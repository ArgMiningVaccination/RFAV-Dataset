Phone Number: (512) 936-4917 Email Address: allison.wilson@twc.texas.gov 1.2 CCDF Policy Decision Authority The Lead Agency has broad authority to administer (i.e., establish rules) and operate (i.e., implement activities) the CCDF program through other governmental, non-governmental, or public or private local agencies as long as the Lead Agency retains overall responsibility for the administration of the program (658D(b) and 98.16 (d)(1)). Administrative and implementation responsibilities undertaken by agencies other than the Lead Agency must be governed by written agreements that specify the mutual roles and responsibilities of the Lead Agency and other agencies in meeting the program requirements. 1.2.1 Which of the following CCDF program rules and policies are administered (i.e., set or established) at the state or territory level or local level? Identify whether CCDF program rules and policies are established by the state or territory (even if operated locally) or whether the CCDF policies or rules are established by local entities, such as Texas Page 3 of 380counties or workforce boards (98.16(i)(3)). Check one. a. All program rules and policies are set or established at the state or territory level. If checked, skip to question 1.2.2. b. Some or all program rules and policies are set or established by local entities or agencies. If checked, indicate which entities establish the following policies. Check all that apply. i. Eligibility rules and policies (e.g., income limits) are set by the: A. State or territory Identify the entity: Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) B. Local entity (e.g., counties, workforce boards, early learning coalitions). If checked, identify the entity and describe the eligibility policies the local entity(ies) can set. TWC Child Care Services rules establish general eligibility requirements for child care services in 40 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 809, Subchapter C and Part D of the Child Care Services Guide . The TWC rules and guidelines describe the policies in place regarding the following for child eligibility: -Age, residency, and family income requirements -Eligibility verification, determination, and redetermination requirements -Priority groups for child care services -Calculation of family income -Child care during interruptions in work, education, or job training -Continuity of care -Waiting periods for reapplication Additionally, 40 TAC \u00a7809.91 establishes the requirements regarding child care providers' eligibility to receive subsidies to ensure that payments are only made to: -regulated child care providers that meet or exceed the Pre-Star designation requirements, (at the point the Pre-Star designation goes into effect, as further described in Section 5.4 of the State Plan, or state licensing minimum standards; -qualified relative child care providers; or -child care providers in a neighboring state, subject to the following requirements: -board's child care contractor reviews the licensing status of the out-of-state provider every month, at a minimum, to confirm the provider is meeting the minimum licensing standards of the state; Texas Page 4 of 380-the provider meets the requirements of the neighboring state to serve CCDF-subsidized children; and -the provider agrees to comply with the requirements, policies, and procedures as set by the Board. TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rules also require the 28 Local Workforce Development Boards (Boards) to establish policies on the following in 40 TAC \u00a7809.13 and Part B-300 of the Child Care Services Guide : -How the Board determines that a parent is making progress toward successful completion of a job training or educational program -Maintenance of a waiting list -Family income limits -Provision of child care services to a child with disabilities until the age of 19 -Minimum activity requirements for parents (if higher than TWC's minimum activity requirements) -Time limits for the provision of child care while a parent is attending an educational program -Provision of services with regard to Board-level and state-defined priority groups -Transfer of a child from one provider to another -Children's eligibility for contracted slots agreements (if the Board opts to enter into such agreements) -Referrals from recognized pre-K or Head Start/Early Head Start partnerships C. Other. Describe: ii. Sliding-fee scale is set by the: A. State or territory Identify the entity: B. Local entity (e.g., counties, workforce boards, early learning coalitions). If checked, identify the entity and describe the sliding fee scale policies the local entity(ies) can set. TWC Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.19(a)(1)(B) and Section B-600 of the Child Care Services Guide require Boards to set the parent share of cost based on the family's size and gross monthly income; Boards may consider the number of children in care. TWC rules also require Board policy to include criteria for Texas Page 5 of 380determining the affordability of the parent share of cost and provisions for a parent's failure to pay the parent share of cost. C. Other. Describe: iii. Payment rates and payment policies are set by the: A. State or territory Identify the entity: Texas Workforce Commission B. Local entity (e.g., counties, workforce boards, early learning coalitions). If checked, identify the entity and describe the payment rates and payment policies the local entity(ies) can set. TWC sets minimum reimbursement thresholds by Board area based on the most recent annual market rate survey. TWC rules and guidelines (40 TAC \u00a7809.20 and Section B-700 of the Child Care Services Guide ) require Boards to establish maximum reimbursement rates at or above these thresholds to ensure that the rates provide access to child care in the local market in a manner consistent with state and federal statutes and regulations governing child care.Additionally, Board payment rates must allow the Board to meet performance targets determined by TWC based on statewide targets established by the Texas legislature for the number of children served. TWC reviews Board performance monthly using measures including the number of children served and the percentage of providers in the state that served subsidized children. As described in TWC Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.20(b) , Boards must establish tiered, enhanced reimbursement rates for providers meeting the Texas Rising Star quality rating program criteria. Texas Government Code \u00a72308.315 requires that the rates for Texas Rising Star providers be greater than those provided to other non-TRS providers by at least: -5 percent for 2-Star programs; -7 percent for 3-Star and Texas Page 6 of 380-9 percent for 4-Star programs. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2019, TWC began benchmarking the Texas Rising Star rates against the most recent Market Rate Survey. The minimum threshold for reimbursement rates for Board Contract Year (BCY) 2022 are as follows: -60th percentile of the most recent Market Rate Survey for infants; -55th percentile of the most recent Market Rate Survey for toddlers; and -50th percentile of the most recent Market Rate Survey for preschool and school age children. The Commission requires Boards to set their Texas Rising Star maximum reimbursement rates at or above the following levels set for BCY'22: -For infants, benchmarking to the 85th percentile as follows: \u00a7809.93(b), Boards must reimburse regulated providers based on a child's monthly enrollment authorization regardless of the child absences, with the exception of periods during which the parent voluntarily suspends care. C. Other. Describe: iv. Licensing standards and processes are set by the: A. State or territory Identify the entity: Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), Child Care Regulation (CCR) Division B. Local entity (e.g., counties, workforce boards, early learning coalitions). If checked, identify the entity and describe the type of licensing standards and processes the local entity(ies) can set. C. Other. Describe: v. Standards and monitoring processes for license-exempt providers are set by the: Texas Page 7 of 380A. State or territory Identify the entity: B. Local entity (e.g., counties, workforce boards, early learning coalitions). If checked, identify the entity and describe the type of standards and monitoring processes for license-exempt providers the local entity(ies) can set. C. Other. Describe: Texas does not monitor license-exempt providers. vi. Quality improvement activities, including QRIS are set by the: A. State or territory Identify the entity: Texas Workforce Commission B. Local entity (e.g., counties, workforce boards, early learning coalitions). If checked, identify the entity and describe the eligibility policies the local entity(ies) can set. Section 2308.3155 of the Texas Government Code requires TWC to adopt rules to administer the Texas Rising Star program (the QRIS for Texas). This section of the statute also requires TWC to make funds available to Boards for the provision of technical assistance to Texas Rising Star programs and providers seeking Texas Rising Star certification. In accordance with \u00a72308.317 of the Texas Government Code, TWC allocates 2 percent of CCDF funding for Boards to spend on local quality initiatives. Child Care Services rules allow Boards to spend those funds on non-direct care quality improvement activities in accordance with 45 CFR \u00a798.53, applicable state laws, and the CCDF State Plan ( TAC \u00a7809.16 ). Additionally, as directed by the Commission and the legislature, TWC expends Texas Page 8 of 380funds at the state level for statewide quality improvement activities as well as for targeted pilot programs. C. Other. Describe: vii. Other. List and describe any other program rules and policies that are set at a level other than the state or territory level: 1.2.2 The Lead Agency has broad authority to operate (i.e., implement activities) through other agencies, as long as it retains overall responsibility. Complete the table below to identify which entity(ies) implements or performs CCDF services. a. Check the box(es) to indicate which entity(ies) implement or perform CCDF services.

List and describe any other state or territory agencies or partners that implement or perform CCDF services and identify their responsibilities. Board child care contractors assist parents in locating child care. Note: \"Child Care Contractor,\" as defined in Section A-100 of the Child Care Services Guide, is the entity or entities under contract with the Board to manage child care services. This includes contractors involved in the determination of eligibility for child care services, the billing and reimbursement process for child care subsidies, and the funding of quality improvement activities. Texas Page 10 of 380 1.2.3 Describe the processes the Lead Agency uses to oversee and monitor CCDF administration and implementation responsibilities performed by other agencies as reported above in 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 (98.16(b)). In the description include: Written agreements. Note: The contents of the written agreement may vary based on the role the agency is asked to assume or type of project but must include at a minimum the elements below (98.11(a)(3)). --Tasks to be performed --Schedule for completing tasks --Budget which itemizes categorical expenditures in accordance with CCDF requirements --Monitoring and auditing procedures --Indicators or measures to assess performance of those agencies Any other processes to oversee and monitor other agencies. The Workforce Board Grants department in TWC's Workforce Development Division is responsible for contract oversight for all Board allocated funds, including child care. Workforce Board Grants works closely with the Child Care and Early Learning Division on: -developing and managing contracts for CCDF funds administered by the 28 Boards; -overseeing contractual compliance and use of allocated funds, including: -the schedule for completing required actions and reports, and -budgeting and correctly categorizing expenditures in accordance with CCDF and TWC requirements, and -meeting required performance levels, which are establshed each year by TWC and included as a Board contracted measure; -TWC adopts Board child care performance standards in an open, posted meeting each year. For Fiscal Year/Board Contract Year 2021, the child care performance agenda item is posted here: https://www.twc.texas.gov/files/twc/commission_meeting_material_100620_item20_ bcy21_cc.pdf -processing any levels; and -issuing corrective actions. TWC's contracts with Boards include performance measures for the use of CCDF funds. Texas Page 11 of 380TWC tracks each Board's monthly performance for the average number of children served using the number of paid billings. Board performance is reviewed by the Child Care and Early Learning Division each month, including: -Average number of children served per day (total and by eligibility category) -Average cost of care per day (total and by eligibility category) -Texas Rising Star provider participation Additionally, TWC's Subrecipient Monitoring (SRM) department within the Regulatory Integrity Division monitors Boards annually to ensure that funds are spent in accordance with applicable federal and state statutes, regulations, and rules. SRM performs monitoring reviews of fiscal and program activities, including customer eligibility, wage verification, provider billing, and disbursement testing. RID also provides training to identify and prevent improper payments and potential problems. 1.2.4 Upon request, and to the extent practicable and appropriate, Lead Agencies must ensure any code or software for child care information systems or information technology for which a Lead Agency or other agency expends CCDF funds to develop must be made available to other public agencies. This includes public agencies in other states, for their use in administering child care or related programs (98.15(a)(11)). Assure by describing how the Lead Agency makes child care information systems systems (e.g., subsidy, registry, and QRIS systems) available to public agencies in other states. Currently, TWC does not have a separate information system for child care. Boards use The Workforce Information System of Texas (TWIST) for eligibility and case management for all workforce programs, including child care. TWIST is a client-server application that was built in 1997; the child care program was phased in to TWIST in 2010. Due to the age and nature of the technology, TWIST does not lend itself to code-sharing. Pending legislative approval, TWC is preparing to release a Request for Offers (RFO) to procure a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) system to replace TWIST and support effective Texas Page 12 of 380management of the child care program at both the state and Board levels. This system will streamline the child care services application and eligibility process across the entire state. The new system will assist with efficient collection of child care data, allow quicker implementation of policy and legislative changes, and provide robust reporting tools to help inform decisions for the future of child care in the state of Texas. In selecting a COTS solution, CCDF funds will be used to configure, customize, implement, and host the system, but will not for software development. As part of the information-gathering process leading up to the RFO, TWC has surveyed CCDF Lead Agencies in other states. TWC met with representatives from several states to share information about data management systems. TWC will continue to share information with other states/territories regarding Texas' selection and implementation of a new system. 1.2.5 Lead Agencies must have in effect policies to govern the use and disclosure of confidential and personally identifiable information about children and families receiving CCDF assistance and child care providers receiving CCDF funds (98.15(b)(13)). Certify by describing the Lead Agency's policies related to the use and disclosure of confidential and personally identifiable information. All TWC staff must adhere to TWC policies regarding protecting personally identifiable information (PII) as outlined in TWC's Privacy Manual. The Privacy Manual sets forth TWC's policies, mandatory procedures, and recommended best practices for safeguarding sensitive personal information (SPI). The policies follow the National Institute of Standards and Technology Publications framework, which includes policies and recommendations for protection of SPI and confidential information by limiting collection, use, access, and retention of information to the minimum necessary to achieve stated business purposes. Additionally, all TWC staff members must complete annual training on policies and procedures for protecting SPI and PPI. TWC's overarching policy is to support our mission while safeguarding the SPI and confidential information entrusted to TWC. Texas Page 13 of 380TWC's Workforce Development Letter 02-18 (WD 02-18), \"Handling and Protection of PII and Other Sensitive Information,\" outlines TWC's policies requiring Boards to ensure the protection of PII and other confidential information for all customers. If a breach occurs, Boards and contractors must follow specific procedures to report the breach to TWC's Risk and Security Management department. WD 02-18 details requirements for the following areas: -Access to, handling of, and protection of PII and other sensitive information -Securing PII on computers and data storage and destruction of PII -Protection against and response to possible breaches of PII -Recommended best practices to ensure security of PII and other sensitive information 1.3 Consultation in the Development of the CCDF Plan The Lead Agency is responsible for developing the CCDF plan, which serves as the application for a 3-year implementation period. As part of the Plan development process, Lead Agencies must consult with the following: (1) Appropriate representatives of units of general purpose local government-(658D(b)(2); 98.10(c); 98.12(b); 98.14(b)). General purpose local governments are defined by the U.S. Census at https://www.census.gov/newsroom/cspan/govts/20120301_cspan_govts_def_3.pdf. (2) The State Advisory Council (SAC) on Early Childhood Education and Care (pursuant to 642B(b)(I)(A)(i) of the Head Start Act) (658E(c)(2)(R); 98.15(b)(1)) or similar coordinating body pursuant to 98.14(a)(1)(vii). (3) Indian tribe(s) or tribal organization(s) within the state. This consultation should be done in a timely manner and at the option of the Indian tribe(s) or tribal organization(s) (658D(b)(1)(E)). Texas Page 14 of 380 Consultation involves meeting with or otherwise obtaining input from an appropriate agency in the development of the state or territory CCDF Plan. Describe the partners engaged to provide services under the CCDF program in question 1.4.1. 1.3.1 Describe the Lead Agency's consultation efforts in the development of the CCDF Plan. Note: Lead Agencies must describe in a. - c. consultation efforts with required partners listed in Rule and Statute. ACF recognizes that there is great value in consulting with other entities and has provided element d. for Lead Agencies to identify consultation efforts with other agencies or organizations. a) Describe how the Lead Agency consulted with appropriate representatives of general purpose local governments. Local Workforce Development Board (Board) members are appointed by chief elected officials (CEOs) in each local workforce development area and certified by TWC. Boards are statutorily created public entities recognized by state statute as local governmental entities, and Board members are considered public officials. TWC staff members serve on Boards as the required public employment service representatives. The CEOs and the Board chair enter into a partnership agreement that defines their operating relationship. The Board executive director (ED) is responsible for administering Board staff operations. TWC's three-member Commission (Commission) and TWC staff consult regularly with Board EDs on all aspects of workforce services, including child care services. TWC staff meets with Board EDs monthly through the Board ED council. Board staff is consulted on a regular basis regarding TWC rules, policies, and procedures that are included in the State Plan. This consultation includes biweekly conference calls with Board EDs, quarterly workforce forums, and quarterly child care network meetings. Additionally, Board child care staff participates in ad hoc workgroups regarding implementation of new initiatives. In development of this State Plan, TWC solicited input from Board EDs and Board staff through a stakeholder survey and a virtual meeting for all Board EDs and Board child care staff. Boards also provided input on policy changes occurring in advance of the Texas Page 15 of 380State Plan through meetings and public input opportunities. b) Describe how the Lead Agency consulted with the State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body. In January 2019, Governor Greg Abbott appointed 20 child care and early learning leaders to the Texas Early Learning Council (TELC) (earlylearningtexas.org). TELC was convened to support the Preschool Development Grant. This group includes representatives from state agencies (including TWC), school districts, colleges, Head Start, child care providers, and nonprofit organizations. TELC includes representatives from the following agencies and organizations: -Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) Child Care Regulation (CCR) -Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) -HHSC Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) -Texas Education Agency (TEA) Early Childhood Education -Texas Head Start Collaboration Office (THSCO) -DFPS Child Protective Services (CPS) -Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS) -Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Maternal Health and Substance Abuse -Greater East Texas Community Action Program -Children's Learning Institute (CLI) of University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston -Texas Association for the Education of Young Children (TAEYC) -Texans Care for Children -PNC Financial Services Group -Texas Public Broadcasting Association TELC conducted a statewide birth-five needs assessment and developed a statewide birth-five strategic plan. The Texas Early Learning Strategic Plan offers a framework for public and private action to achieve the state's vision that all Texas children are ready for school and ready to learn by 2025. TELC continues to meet every other month to provide input on child care and early learning initiatives in the state and to work toward meeting the goals of the strategic plan. In the January 15, 2021, meeting, TWC presented the results of the 2022-2024 CCDF State Plan Stakeholder Survey and solicited input on the State Plan. TWC will share a Texas Page 16 of 380copy of the draft State Plan with TELC members to provide another opportunity for input. c. Describe, if applicable, how the Lead Agency consulted with Indian tribes(s) or tribal organizations(s) within the state. Note: The CCDF regulations recognize the need for states to conduct formal, structured consultation with Tribal governments, including Tribal leadership. Many states and tribes have consultation policies and procedures in place. On January 27, 2021, TWC met with tribal CCDF administrators from the Alabama- Coushatta, Kickapoo, and Ysleta del Sur Pueblo tribes to identify opportunities for coordinating services and consultation on the State Plan. Following the meeting, TWC met with local Boards that have a tribe located in their workforce areas (Borderplex, Deep East, and Middle Rio) to support them in connecting with the tribal CCDF administrators in their areas. Although Boards have established memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with tribes for workforce services, they had not previously established partnerships for child care services. Boards will share opportunities for free training and professional development with tribes. Other services to be coordinated will be based on the tribes' needs and the Boards' available resources. TWC will send a copy of the draft State Plan to each of the tribal CCDF administrators for review and feedback. d) Describe any other entities, agencies, or organizations consulted on the development of the CCDF plan. In addition to holding a public hearing regarding the draft State Plan on April 27, 2021, TWC also conducted a statewide survey and stakeholder focus groups. TWC's 2022- 2024 CCDF State Plan Stakeholder Survey was available via Survey Monkey from December 1, 2020, to January 7, 2021. The survey, available in English and Spanish, was posted to the TWC website and widely distributed to child care providers, parents, Boards, advocacy groups, community organizations, and state agencies. TWC received 3,237 responses from the following: -1,562 child care providers -1,374 parents -83 child care advocacy groups or community organizations -72 Board staff members -13 state agency staff members -50 other early childhood programs -10 industry partners -73 other respondents Texas Page 17 of 380Child care providers that provided input on the State Plan represented 132 counties and all 28 Local Workforce Development Boards. TWC hosted three stakeholder focus groups to discuss State Plan input, as follows: -Child care providers-December 16, 2020 -Child care advocates (including the organizations listed below)-December 17, 2020: -Commit Partnership -Texas Association for the Education of Young Children -Texas Public Broadcasting Association -Child Care Associates -Children at Risk -Dallas Early Education Alliance -Texans Care for Children -Local Boards-January 7, 2021 1.3.2 Describe the statewide or territory-wide public hearing process held to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the provision of child care services under this Plan (658D(b)(1)(C); 98.16(f)). Reminder: Lead Agencies are required to hold at least one public hearing in the state or territory, with sufficient statewide or territory-wide distribution of notice prior to such a hearing to enable the public to comment on the provision of child care services under the CCDF Plan. At a minimum, this description must include: a) Date of the public hearing. 04/27/2021 Reminder: Must be no earlier than January 1, 2021, which is 9 months prior to the October 1, 2021, effective date of the Plan.

In accordance with state law, the public is given notice of rule changes and the opportunity for public input. Additionally, TWC requires Boards to post policy changes for public input at an open meeting. Rule and policy changes are incorporated into any plan amendments. 1.4 Coordination with Partners to Expand Accessibility and Continuity of Care 1.4 Coordination with Partners to Expand Accessibility and Continuity of Care Lead Agencies are required to describe how the state or territory will efficiently, and to the extent practicable, coordinate child care services supported by CCDF with programs operating at the federal, state/territory, and local levels for children in the programs listed below. This includes programs for the benefit of Indian children, infants and toddlers, children with disabilities, children experiencing homelessness, and children in foster care (98.14(a)(1)). 1.4.1 Describe how the Lead Agency coordinates the provision of child care services with the following programs to expand accessibility and continuity of care and to assist children enrolled in early childhood programs in receiving full-day services that meet the Texas Page 21 of 380needs of working families (658E(c)(2)(O); 98.12(a); 98.14(a)). This list includes agencies or programs required by law or rule, along with a list of optional partners that Lead Agencies potentially would coordinate with over the next 3 years to expand accessibility and continuity of care and to assist children enrolled in early childhood programs in receiving full-day services. Include in the descriptions the goals of this coordination, such as: -- extending the day or year of services for families; -- smoothing transitions for children between programs or as they age into school; -- enhancing and aligning the quality of services for infants and toddlers through school- age children; -- linking comprehensive services to children in child care or school age settings; or -- developing the supply of quality care for vulnerable populations (as defined by the Lead Agency) in child care and out-of-school time settings Check the agencies or programs the Lead Agency will coordinate with and describe all that apply. a. The Lead Agency is required to coordinate with the following agencies. Provide a description for how coordination occurred. i. Appropriate representatives of the general purpose local government, which can include counties, municipalities, or townships/towns. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: Each Local Workforce Board (Board) consults with local government representatives to develop a four-year strategic plan for their workforce area that includes a local plan for the administration, coordination, and oversight of child care services and initiatives. ii. State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care or similar coordinating body (pursuant to 642B(b)(I)(A)(i) of the Head Start Act). Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: The Texas Early Learning Council serves as Texas' State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care. Members of the Council are appointed by Governor Greg Abbott. This group includes representatives from state agencies, school districts, colleges, Head Start, child care providers, and nonprofit organizations. The Council meets every other month. TWC regularly presents information to the Council and receives feedback on child care and early learning issues. More information is available Texas Page 22 of 380at https://earlylearningtexas.org/ . TELC continues to meet quarterly. Check here if the Lead Agency has official representation and a decision-making role in the State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body. iii. Indian tribe(s) and/or tribal organization(s), at the option of individual tribes. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results, including which tribe(s) was (were) consulted: On January 27, 2021, TWC met with Tribal CCDF administrators from the Alabama- Coushatta, Kickapoo, and Ysleta del Sur Pueblo tribes to identify opportunities for coordinating services and solicit input on the State Plan. Following the meeting, TWC met with the Boards with tribes located in their workforce areas (Borderplex, Deep East, and Middle Rio) to support them in connecting with their local Tribal CCDF administrators. Although Boards have established memoranda of understanding with tribes for workforce services, they had not previously established partnerships for child care services. Boards will share opportunities for free training and professional development with tribes. Other services to be coordinated will be based on the tribes' needs and the Boards' available resources. N/A-Check here if there are no Indian tribes and/or tribal organizations in the state. iv. State/territory agency(ies) responsible for programs for children with special needs, including early intervention programs authorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Part C for infants and toddlers and Part B, Section 619 for preschool). Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: A TWC Child Care & Early Learning Division representative is a member of the ECI Advisory Committee and works with ECI to give parents and providers information on state resources available for developmental screenings and other services for infants and toddlers with disabilities. ECI and TEA's Preschool Special Education program are also represented on the TELC. Additionally, Boards coordinate with local early childhood programs and ECI service providers to offer ECI services at child care facilities and conduct conferences and trainings for providers and parents about services for infants and toddlers with Texas Page 23 of 380disabilities. v. State/territory office/director for Head Start state collaboration. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: A TWC Child Care & Early Learning Division representative sits on the THSSCO Advisory Board to support the development and activities of the annual needs assessment and strategic plan. THSSCO is also represented on the TELC. To facilitate greater coordination between child care and Head Start/Early Head Start services and ensure full-day care for children enrolled in these programs, in January 2021, TWC added \u00a7809.22 to the TWC Child Care Services rules. This section requires Boards to enroll eligible children in the child care subsidy program who are also enrolled in and referred by a Head Start/Early Head Start program. These children are also exempt from the Board's waiting list. vi. State/territory agency responsible for public health, including the agency responsible for immunizations. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: The Department of State Health Services (DSHS) operating under the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) enterprise. DSHS is represented on the TELC. During the COVID-19 pandemic, TWC provided input to DSHS regarding vaccines for child care workers. And, following the federal prioritization of educators, including child care workers, for vaccine distribution, DSHS immediately notified all vaccine providers to immediately consider child care workers as a 1b COVID vaccine priority. vii. State/territory agency responsible for employment services/workforce development. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: TWC is the state agency responsible for employment services and workforce development. The Child Care & Early Learning Division director meets weekly with directors from other workforce divisions. viii. State/territory agency responsible for public education, including Prekindergarten (PreK). Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: Pre-K partnership activities: TWC has a dedicated position to support the development of partnerships between child care providers and public pre-K programs and to help draft state-level policy to improve their success. Developing partnerships between child care Texas Page 24 of 380providers and public-school pre-K programs is an important strategy to improve school- readiness, support families, and strengthen the ECE workforce through TWC's child care subsidy program. TWC will continue to explore systemic strategies for increasing and expanding pre-K partnerships statewide. To facilitate greater coordination between child care and pre-K services and ensure full- day care for children enrolled in these programs, in January 2021, TWC added \u00a7809.22 to the Child Care Services rules requiring Boards to enroll eligible children in the child care subsidy program who are also enrolled in and referred by a pre-K partnership or local education agency (LEA). These children are also exempt from the Board's waiting list. On June 18, 2021, Governor Abbott signed House Bill 2607 which requires each Board to inform the local school districts and open-enrollment charter schools in the workforce area regarding opportunities to partner with child care providers to expand access to and provide facilities for prekindergarten programs. TWC will support Boards with sharing this information. RECESS grants: TWC leveraged additional CCDF funds in 2019 to support TEA in awarding grants to help develop partnerships in four regions as part of the Regional Early Childhood Education Support Specialists (RECESS) Initiative. The RECESS Initiative grants will help child care providers and school districts in their regions to develop partnerships over a three-year period. Additionally, a school finance bill enacted by the 86th Texas Legislature in 2019 included requirements for pre-K partnerships that were a key part of expanding to full-day pre-K for eligible 4-year-olds. The bill added \u00a729.153(g) to the Texas Education Code, which requires school districts to solicit and consider proposals for pre-K partnerships with high- quality child care providers before they construct, repurpose, or lease classroom facilities. Pre-K Partnership Summit: TWC collaborated with TEA, the nonprofit Children at Risk, and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to host the Pre-K Partnership Summit, which was scheduled for spring 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the groups to reschedule the in-person summit for spring 2021. This summit will provide specialized Texas Page 25 of 380information and training to Boards and regional education service centers-key governmental entities that support partnerships between child care providers and public school pre-K programs. A key part of the summit is building relationships to launch a statewide implementation of partnerships, so individualized technical assistance will be provided for 20 regional teams across the state to develop local plans for partnership expansion. Regional teams consist of the regional education service center, local Board(s), child care programs, and public school partners interested in starting pre-K program partnerships. PEIMS numbers: Texas Labor Code \u00a7302.0043(c-1) requires TWC to coordinate with TEA to assign unique Public Education Information Management System (PEIMS) numbers to children younger than six who are enrolled in the child care subsidy program. This will allow for longitudinal analysis of information on children who receive subsidies by bridging their participation in early childhood programs to their participation in public education. TWC collaborated with TEA to develop an automated interface and began assigning PEIMS numbers to children under age six enrolled in subsidized child care on September 1, 2020. Now that the functionality is in place, TWC and TEA will develop a plan to analyze and share this cross-agency data. ECDataWorks and TXR3: Beginning in 2018, TWC partnered with TEA to participate in ECDataWorks, a multiyear project supported by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and facilitated by the University of Pennsylvania's Consortium for Policy Research in Education in collaboration with leading experts in the field. The ECDataWorks project team works in a collaborative, outcome-driven manner to conceptualize and develop tools to facilitate the organization, delivery, and strategic use of existing early childhood data. The web-based analytic tool-Texas Ready Communities, Ready Schools, and Ready Students (TXR3)-is being developed and will be released in 2021. TXR3 will help decision-makers visualize how well public school pre-K, kindergarten, and Texas Rising Star programs are prepared to educate children. TXR3 provides insight into the professional development needs of communities and schools as equal partners in collaboratively educating and preparing children. Texas Page 26 of 380ix. State/territory agency responsible for child care licensing. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: TWC works closely with the HHSC's Child Care Regulation (CCR) division to ensure that child care providers serving children participating in the child care subsidy program meet the health and safety requirements of the CCDF Final Rule. In addition to meeting with CCR representatives in several interagency groups and monthly Region VI meetings, TWC seeks input from CCR on Texas Rising Star reviews, the effects of natural disasters and COVID-19, and other issues that arise. Additionally, TWC and CCR share data on all regulated child care providers. TWC will continue to work with CCR to support child care providers and parents seeking child care services. x. State/territory agency responsible for the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and other relevant nutrition programs. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: TWC coordinates with the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA)-the agency responsible for CACFP-to participate in efforts to address children's health and nutrition, such as the DSHS Obesity Prevention Program. xi. McKinney-Vento state coordinators for homeless education and other agencies providing services for children experiencing homelessness and, to the extent practicable, local McKinney-Vento liaisons. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: TWC works with the Texas Department of Housing & Community Affairs (TDHCA) to coordinate services for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. Additionally, TEA's State McKinney-Vento Coordinator and a representative of TWC's CC&EL division serve together on the ECI State Advisory Council. Boards coordinate with local homeless shelters and organizations serving homeless families. Boards also work with ISDs to identify and provide outreach to homeless children served by public schools. This coordination is in conjunction with workforce services to homeless families through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). xii. State/territory agency responsible for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: TWC and the Local Boards administer the Choices employment program for TANF recipients. Boards prioritize child care subsidies for parents receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and participating in Choices. Texas Page 27 of 380 xiii. Agency responsible for Medicaid and the state Children\u00e2s Health Insurance Program. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: TWC works extensively with HHSC, the agency responsible for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the Medicaid program. Boards also provide customers with referrals to these programs. xiv. State/territory agency responsible for mental health. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: TWC coordinates with HHSC, DFPS, and DSHS, the agencies responsible for addressing children's mental health issues. Additionally, Boards provide customers with referrals to local mental health programs. xv. Child care resource and referral agencies, child care consumer education organizations, and providers of early childhood education training and professional development. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: Boards and their child care contractors provide many child care resource and referral services. Boards may also contract with local resource and referral organizations and providers of early childhood education training and professional development. xvi. Statewide afterschool network or other coordinating entity for out-of-school time care (if applicable). Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: TWC will provide a copy of the draft State Plan to the Texas Partnership for Out of School Time (TXPOST) and solicit input on the State Plan. xvii. Agency responsible for emergency management and response. Describe the coordination goals, processes, and results: On December 7, 2020, TWC met with representatives from the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM), DSHS, and CCR to review and update the state's Child Care Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Plan. And throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, TWC has worked closely with TDEM to address the needs of the child care industry, including distribution of cleaning and PPE supplies. 1.4.1 Describe how the Lead Agency coordinates the provision of child care services with Texas Page 28 of 380the following programs to expand accessibility and continuity of care and to assist children enrolled in early childhood programs in receiving full-day services that meet the needs of working families (658E(c)(2)(O); 98.12(a); 98.14(a)). b. The following are examples of optional partners a state might coordinate with to provide services. Check which optional partners the Lead Agency coordinates with and describe the coordination goals, processes and results. i. State/territory/local agencies with Early Head Start - Child Care Partnership grants. Describe ii. State/territory institutions for higher education, including community colleges Describe TWC works with CLI at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and Texas A&M AgriLife Extension to coordinate training opportunities. Additionally, TWC meets quarterly with several institutions of higher education (IHEs), including community colleges, during TELC meetings. In the Statewide Strategic Plan, TELC set a target increase of 50 percent by 2025 for the number of IHEs that have developed articulation pathways between the Child Development Associate (CDA) and other degree programs. TWC expects to coordinate with IHEs as needed to help the state meet this goal. Additionally, TWC works with Rice University's Texas Policy Lab to analyze administrative and demographic data related to key policy questions. iii. Other federal, state, local, and/or private agencies providing early childhood and school-age/youth-serving developmental services. Describe TWC is a member of the ECI Advisory Committee. ECI is a statewide program for families with children from birth to three years old who have disabilities and developmental delays. ECI provides support to families to help their children reach their potential through developmental services. iv. State/territory agency responsible for implementing the Maternal and Child Home Visitation programs grant. Describe DFPS's Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) oversees the Teas Home Visiting Texas Page 29 of 380program. PEI is a member of the TELC. In addition, Boards coordinate services with local Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program grantees to identify potential families who may benefit from the program. v. Agency responsible for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment. Describe vi. State/territory agency responsible for child welfare. Describe TWC works with DFPS to fund child care services for children in protective care. Boards also coordinate with local DFPS offices to authorize care for children needing protective services. vii. Provider groups or associations. Describe TWC regularly meets with child care providers who are members of TELC and the Texas Rising Star 4-year review workgroup. Additionally, in June 2020, TWC hosted a listening session with child care providers who gave input on the state's response to COVID-19. In December 2020, TWC conducted a focus group with providers who responded to the 2022-2024 CCDF State Plan Stakeholder Survey. TWC will continue to meet with groups of child care providers periodically. viii. Parent groups or organizations. Describe TWC is in the process of developing a Family Engagement Stakeholder Group with technical assistance from the National Center on Early Childhood Quality Assurance. TWC plans to have regular meetings with a representative group of parents of young children from across the state. ix. Other. Describe TWC regularly meets with organizations that advocate for children, families, and child care providers. Several of these groups, including Texans Care for Children, Texas Texas Page 30 of 380Association for the Education of Young Children, and Children at Risk, are members of TELC and/or the Texas Rising Star four-year review workgroup. Additionally, in December 2020, TWC hosted a focus group with advocacy groups to report the preliminary results of the stakeholder survey and solicit their input on the development of the State Plan. Optional Use of Combined Funds: States and territories have the option to combine CCDF funds with any program identified as required in 1.4.1. These programs include those operating at the federal, state, and local levels for children in preschool programs, tribal early childhood programs, and other early childhood programs, including those serving infants and toddlers with disabilities, children experiencing homelessness, and children in foster care (658E(c)(2)(O)(ii)). Combining funds could include blending multiple funding streams, pooling funds, or layering funds together from multiple funding streams to expand and/or enhance services for infants, toddlers, preschoolers and school-age children and families to allow for the delivery of comprehensive quality care that meets the needs of children and families. For example, state/territory agencies may use multiple funding sources to offer grants or contracts to programs to deliver services; a state/territory may allow a county/local government to use coordinated funding streams; or policies may be in place that allow local programs to layer CCDF funds with additional funding sources to pay for full-day, full-year child care that meets Early Head Start/Head Start Program Performance Standards or state/territory prekindergarten requirements in addition to state/territory child care licensing requirements. As a reminder, CCDF funds may be used in collaborative efforts with Head Start programs to provide comprehensive child care and development services for children who are eligible for both programs. In fact, the coordination and collaboration between Head Start and CCDF is strongly encouraged by sections 640(g)(1)(D) and (E); 640(h); 641(d)(2)(H)(v); and 642(e)(3) of the Head Start Act in the provision of full working day, full calendar year comprehensive services. To implement such collaborative programs, which share, for example, space, equipment, or materials, grantees may layer several funding streams so that seamless services are provided (Policy and Program Guidance for the Early Head Start - Child Care Partnerships: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/occ/acf_im_ohs_15_03.pdf ). Texas Page 31 of 380 1.5.1 Does the Lead Agency choose to combine funding for CCDF services for any required early childhood program (98.14(a)(3))? No (If no, skip to question 1.5.2) Yes. If yes, describe at a minimum: a) How you define \"combine\" Non-CCDF funds are included with CCDF funds in allocations to Boards for the provision of qualifying direct child care services and child care quality improvement activities. b) Which funds you will combine TWC will use TANF funds transferred to Title XX, local donations, and state general revenue funds for child care services. Additionally, Title IV-B, Title IV-E, and Title XX funds are combined with CCDF funds transferred to DFPS as well as with state general revenue funds to provide child care services for children in protective services and children in foster care. c. What is your purpose and expected outcomes for combining funds, such as extending the day or year of services available (i.e., full-day, full-year programming for working families), smoothing transitions for children, enhancing and aligning quality of services, linking comprehensive services to children in child care, or developing the supply of child care for vulnerable populations? Note: Responses should align with the goals, processes and results describe in 1.4.1. Title IV-B, Tile IV-E, Title XX, and state general revenue funds are combined with CCDF funds to enhance and align child care services for children receiving protective services. TANF funds transferred to Title XX funds are combined with CCDF funds to enhance the quality and supply of child care services for children and families that are vulnerable due to extreme poverty. d) How you will be combining multiple sets of funding, such as at the State/Territory level, local level, program level? TWC allocates CCDF funding to Boards in a manner similar to the federal regulation for allocating funds to the states, as follows: -Discretionary Texas Page 32 of 380-Matching (including state general revenue funds) -Mandatory (including state general revenue funds for state Maintenance of Effort (MOE) funds and TANF funds that are transferred to Title XX) e) How are the funds tracked and method of oversight As described in section 1.2.3, Workforce Grants and Initiatives Division, the Workforce Board Grants (WBG) department is responsible for developing and managing contracts for CCDF funds administered by the 28 Boards and for overseeing contractual compliance and use of allocated funds. For control of budgets, expenses, and encumbrances, each funding stream has its own Project Grant Code in the accounting system, which indicates the fund and the federal fiscal year of the award. WBG works closely with the Child Care and Early Learning Division on the oversight of CCDF expenditures, corrective actions, and processing any deobligation and reallocation of funds. TWC's contracts with Boards include performance measures for the use of CCDF funds. TWC tracks each Board's monthly performance for the average number of children served by the number of paid billings. 1.5.2 Which of the following funds does the Lead Agency intend to use to meet the CCDF matching and MOE requirements described in 98.55(e) and 98.55(h)? Note: Lead Agencies that use Prekindergarten funds to meet matching requirements must check Prekindergarten funds and public and/or private funds. Use of PreK for Maintenance of Effort: The CCDF final rule clarifies that public preK funds may also serve as maintenance-of-effort funds as long as the state/territory can describe how it will coordinate preK and child care services to expand the availability of child care while using public preK funds as no more than 20 percent of the state's or territory's maintenance of effort or 30 percent of its matching funds in a single fiscal year (FY) (98.55(h)). If expenditures for preK services are used to meet the maintenance-of-effort requirement, the state/territory must certify that it has not reduced its level of effort in full-day/full-year child care services (98.55(h)(1); 98.15(a)(6)). Use of Private Funds for Match or Maintenance of Effort: Donated funds do not need to be Texas Page 33 of 380under the administrative control of the Lead Agency to qualify as an expenditure for federal match. However, Lead Agencies do need to identify and designate in the state/territory Plan the donated funds given to public or private entities to implement the CCDF child care program (98.55(f)). a. N/A - The territory is not required to meet CCDF matching and MOE requirements b. Public funds are used to meet the CCDF matching fund requirement. Public funds may include any general revenue funds, county or other local public funds, state/territory-specific funds (tobacco tax, lottery), or any other public funds. i. If checked, identify the source of funds: In addition to the state general revenue funds that Texas certifies for match, the 28 Boards receive public match funds from public entities including local governments and public colleges and universities. c. Private donated funds are used to meet the CCDF matching funds requirement. Only private funds received by the designated entities or by the Lead Agency may be counted for match purposes (98.53(f)). i. If checked, are those funds: A. Donated directly to the State? B. Donated to a separate entity(ies) designated to receive private donated funds? ii. If checked, identify the name, address, contact, and type of entities designated to receive private donated funds: Each of the 28 Boards may receive privately donated funds to meet match requirements. A Board directory, which includes addresses and contact information, is available at http://www.twc.state.tx.us/files/partners/workforce-board-directory-twc.pdf . d. State expenditures for PreK programs are used to meet the CCDF matching funds requirement. If checked, provide the estimated percentage of the matching fund requirement that will be met with Prekindergarten expenditures (not to exceed 30 percent): 30% i. If the percentage is more than 10 percent of the matching fund requirement, describe how the State will coordinate its preK and child care services: TWC coordinates with the Texas Education Agency (TEA) Early Childhood Education department, which oversees Texas' public high-quality pre-K program. Additionally, Texas Page 34 of 380Boards coordinate with local Independent School Districts (ISDs) that provide pre-K programs to ensure coordination of pre-K and child care services. TWC and TEA are also coordinating in the development of pre-K partnerships to offer pre-K services in child care settings. ii. Describe the Lead Agency efforts to ensure that Prekindergarten programs meet the needs of working parents: Boards work with local ISDs to provide wraparound child care to serve the needs of working parents with eligible children. Child care and pre-K partnerships were a key part of expanding to full-day pre-K for eligible four-year-olds-a component of House Bill 3, 86th Texas Legislature, Regular Session (2019). TWC and TEA collaborated to provide Pre-K Partnership Planning Grants to help local education agencies develop partnerships with Texas Rising Star 3- or 4-Star-certified private child care providers to expand access and service delivery models for the provision of pre-K services to three- and four-year-old children. TWC and TEA, in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Children at Risk and with the support of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, planned the Pre-K Partnership Summit, which was scheduled for spring 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the groups to reschedule this as a virtual event in the spring of 2021. A key part of the summit is building relationships to launch a statewide implementation of partnerships, which would be difficult to successfully achieve in a virtual meeting. The summit will provide specialized information and training to Boards and education service centers, key regional government entities that support child care providers and public pre-K programs, respectively, to help them develop partnerships. Finally, TWC hired a specialist to provide ongoing technical assistance to Boards and to support state-level policy to improve the development and success of these partnerships. Additionally, effective January 25, 2021, per TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.22, Boards must enroll eligible children who are also enrolled in a pre-K partnership, and Boards may exempt children referred by a pre-K partnership from the Board's waiting list. e. State expenditures for Prekindergarten programs are used to meet the CCDF maintenance-of-effort requirements. If checked, Texas Page 35 of 380i. Assure by describing how the Lead Agency did not reduce its level of effort in full- day/full-year child care services, pursuant to 98.55(h)(1) and 98.15(a)(6). TWC has not reduced-but rather increased-its level of effort in full-day/full-year child care services, as shown by the average number of children served per day. The increase is also reflected in the percentage of those served by high-quality providers that are Texas Rising Star certified. Average Children Served Per Day -2018: 107,139 -2019: 130,224 -2020: 127,604 Percentage of Children Star Provider -2018: 28.8% -2019: 31.6% -2020: 38.2% Between October 2019 and March 2020, TWC served an average of more than 135,500 children per day. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child care providers in 2020 led to a slight reduction in the average children served per day for the year. This count does not include 29,892 children served through the temporary Essential Worker Child Care program for three months in response to COVID-19. ii. Describe the Lead Agency efforts to ensure that Prekindergarten programs meet the needs of working parents: As described in section 1.5.2 (d)(iii), Boards work with local ISDs to provide wraparound child care to serve the needs of working parents with eligible children. Additionally, TWC and TEA collaborated to provide Pre-K Partnership Planning Grants to help local education agencies develop partnerships with Texas Rising Star 3- or 4- Star-certified private child care providers to expand access and service delivery models for the provision of pre-K to three- and four-year-old children. iii. Estimated percentage of the MOE Fund requirement that will be met with Prekindergarten expenditures (not to exceed 20 percent): 20% iv. If the percentage is more than 10 percent of the MOE requirement, describe how the state will coordinate its Prekindergarten and child care services to expand the availability of child care: Texas Page 36 of 380As described in section 1.5.2 (d)(iii), Boards work with local ISDs to provide wraparound child care to serve the needs of working parents with eligible children. Additionally, TWC and TEA collaborated to provide Pre-K Partnership Planning Grants to help local education agencies develop partnerships with Texas Rising Star 3- or 4- Star-certified private child care providers to expand access and service delivery models for the provision of pre-K to three- and four-year-old children. f. The same funds are used to meet at least some of the CCDF MOE and TANF MOE requirements. i. If known, what percent of funds used to meet CCDF MOE also is used to meet TANF MOE requirements? 1.6 Public-Private Partnerships Lead Agencies are required to describe how they encourage public-private partnerships among other public agencies, tribal organizations, private entities, faith-based organizations, businesses or organizations that promote business involvement, and/or community-based organizations to leverage existing service delivery (i.e., cooperative agreement among providers to pool resources to pay for shared fixed costs and operation) (658E(c)(2)(P)). ACF expects these types of partnerships to leverage public and private resources to further the goals of the CCDBG Act. Lead Agencies are required to demonstrate how they encourage public- private partnerships to leverage existing child care and early education service-delivery systems and to increase the supply and quality of child care services for children younger than age 13, for example, by implementing voluntary shared service alliance models (98.14(a)(4)). 1.6.1 Identify and describe any public-private partnerships encouraged by the Lead Agency to leverage public and private resources to further the goals of the CCDBG Act. Include in the response any public-private partnerships that have emerged from the response to the COVID-19 pandemic (98.16(d)(2)) and if applicable, how those partnerships will be continued post-pandemic. Local Workforce Development Boards Local Match: Local Workforce Development Boards (Boards) leverage local public expenditures in their local workforce development areas (workforce areas) as match for federal CCDF matching funds. Boards work with public institutions of higher education (IHEs), independent school districts (ISDs), and local governments to Texas Page 37 of 380certify local public expenditures for direct child care services to low-income families and for child care quality improvement activities. Boards use the federal CCDF matching funds resulting from the public certifications to increase direct child care services to CCDF-eligible families targeted to meet the child care needs in their workforce areas. The funds are also used to expand quality improvement activities in the workforce areas. Quality Set-Aside: Texas Government Code \u00a72308.317(c) requires each Board to use at least 2 percent of its yearly child care allocation for quality initiatives. Boards must ensure that the 2 percent allocation dedicated to quality child care initiatives is used for the following: 1.Quality child care programs, including programs that meet one of the following conditions: -The director receives mentoring -The program is in the process of obtaining Texas Rising Star certification 2.Technical assistance for Texas Rising Star providers and child care providers seeking Texas Rising Star certification, including providing the following: -Child development specialists to serve as Texas Rising Star mentors and assessors -Consumer information for parents regarding the selection of the quality -Parenting education information for parents of children enrolled in the program, including information about parenting classes that are available in the area 3.Professional development for child care providers, directors, and employees 4.Educational materials for children served by child care providers 5.Educational information for parents on the development of children under age five -Boards must ensure that the priority for the 2 percent allocation is given to quality child care initiatives benefiting child care facilities that are working toward Texas Rising Star certification or are Texas Rising Star providers working toward a higher certification level. Texas Rising Star Assessor and Mentor Funding: Texas Government Code \u00a72308.3155(c) requires TWC to provide funding to Boards for Texas Rising Star assessors and mentors. Texas Rising Star assessors are responsible for conducting on-site assessments of providers to determine compliance with Texas Rising Star standards. Texas Rising Star mentors provide technical assistance to providers working to become Texas Rising Star- certified and to Texas Rising Star providers working to attain higher levels of Texas Rising Star certification. Shared Services: This initiative provided $750,000 in 2019 to Boards to purchase back-office solutions for Texas Rising Star-certified child care providers. Funds were spent on software licenses and subscription fees for solutions that support sound business practices and promote management efficiencies, as well as technical assistance and training to support the implementation of back-office solutions. TWC's 2022-2024 CCDF State Plan Stakeholder Texas Page 38 of 380Survey indicated a high level of interest in continuing to support and expand shared services initiatives. TWC will continue to explore meaningful, systemic strategies to support local shared services alliances. Contracted Slots: House Bill 680 was passed in 2019 and amended the Texas Labor Code to add \u00a7302.0461 , which allows Boards to contract with Texas Rising Star 3-Star- or 4- Star-rated providers, including providers that are part of a pre-K partnership or who have a partnership with an Early Head Start or Head Start program, for a number of slots to be reserved for children participating in child care subsidies for specified populations. The rule changes and guidance that were needed to implement contracted slots were finalized in February 2021. TWC is giving Boards the option to pursue a contracted slots model and will provide technical assistance to help interested Boards develop their model. TWC will assess the success of these models to determine whether this is a viable supply-building strategy for the state. Child Care Industry Partnership Program: This program allows Boards to leverage local industry cash donations with CCDF state funds to build public-private partnerships that support early childhood programs and systems and to expand and support activities that improve early learning and child care. Boards partnering with a corporation and/or foundation may submit an application to TWC detailing how they would like to invest these funds in local efforts to expand and improve the quality of child care. The purpose of this oversight is to ensure that the funds are spent on meaningful strategies that have long-term benefits. TWC will provide 100 percent matching funds to support the following quality improvement activities: -Apprenticeship -Family child care -Pre-K partnerships -Business stipends -COVID-19 response and/or recovery -Program capacity expansion -Local child care studies Office of the Governor Texas Early Childhood Learning Summits: In partnership with the Office of the Texas Governor and the Texas Education Agency (TEA), TWC approved funding for two statewide conferences tailored to the needs of early childhood educators. Attendees Texas Page 39 of 380will include certified teachers; school campus and district administrators; and child care staff, administrators, and owners. Goals of the conferences include: -supporting the increased professional development needs of early learning professionals; -equipping child care providers, school districts, and teachers with information, tools, and resources; and -improving the quality of pre-K and early child care experiences.The 2020 and 2021 Summits were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Summit will resume in 2022 Texas Early Learning Council: Governor Greg Abbott reinstated the Texas Early Learning Council (TELC), including representation from TWC. In 2019, TELC leveraged the Preschool Development Grant\u2014Birth to Five Planning Grant to develop the Texas Early Learning Strategic Plan. TELC designed the plan as a framework for public and private action at state and local levels to achieve the group's vision that all Texas children are ready for school and ready to learn. The strategic plan includes goals for system, family, and child outcomes; strategies to meet these goals; and measurable targets to achieve by 2025. TELC continues to meet quarterly to advance implementation of the plan. More information is available at https://earlylearningtexas.org/telc-project-updates.html . Prekindergarten-Child Care Partnership Pre-K partnership activities: TWC has a dedicated staff position to help support the development of pre-K partnerships and provide ongoing technical assistance to Boards and support state-level policy to improve the development and success of these partnerships. As part of this work, pre-K partnership support will be included in Texas Rising Star mentorship activities and the new Continuous Quality Improvement Plan beginning in 2021. Developing partnerships between child care providers and public school pre-K programs is an important strategy to improve school-readiness, better support families, and strengthen the early childhood education workforce through TWC's child care subsidy program. TWC will continue to explore systemic strategies for increasing and expanding pre-K partnerships statewide. RECESS grants: TWC leveraged additional CCDF funds in 2019 to support TEA in awarding grants to help develop partnerships in four regions as part of the Regional Early Childhood Education Support Specialists (RECESS) initiative. The RECESS initiative grantees focusing on pre-K partnerships will help child care providers and ISDs in their regions to develop Texas Page 40 of 380partnerships over a three-year period. Additionally, in 2019, the 86th Texas Legislature enacted a broad school finance bill and included requirements around pre-K partnerships, which was a key part of expanding to full-day pre-K for eligible 4-year-olds. The bill added Texas Education Code \u00a729.153 (g) , which requires school districts to solicit and consider proposals for pre-K partnerships with high-quality child care providers before they construct, repurpose, or lease classroom facilities. Pre-K Partnership Summit: TWC collaborated with TEA and the nonprofit organization, Children at Risk, to host a summit with the support of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, which was scheduled for spring 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the groups to reschedule the in-person summit, which will be held virtually in spring 2021. This summit will provide specialized information and training to Boards and regional education service centers\u2014key regional government entities that support child care providers and public- school pre-K programs, respectively, to develop partnerships. A key part of the summit is relationship building to launch a statewide implementation of partnerships, so the summit will include individualized technical assistance for 20 regional teams across the state to help them develop a localized plan for partnership expansion. Regional teams consist of the regional education service center, local Boards, and child care programs and public school partners interested in starting pre-K partnerships. Quality Initiatives Texas School Ready! Grants: TWC provides CCDF matching funds to TEA for the Texas School Ready! (TSR!) project through the Children's Learning Institute (CLI). TEA certifies state expenditures for the TSR! project. The TSR! project provides training and mentoring to teachers in child care, Head Start, and pre-K settings who serve preschool children and is designed to prepare children for kindergarten. Texas Rising Star Program Support: TWC provides funds to TEA to be used by CLI to develop guides, tools, statewide online and in-person trainings, and consumer education materials to support Texas Rising Star Certification Guidelines content and outreach. Infant, Toddler, and Developmental Screening Training: TWC approved funding to TEA to be used by CLI to improve the quality of infant and toddler care by assisting providers with training on developmental screenings for infants and toddlers. TWC developed a series of web-based training modules that highlight early learning guidelines, social and emotional Texas Page 41 of 380skills, and cognitive development. The modules provide caregivers with lessons that promote child development across all early learning domains. Additionally, the modules will include developmental checklists that will allow caregivers to screen for developmental delays against important milestones in the early learning guidelines. Professional Development Partnerships: TWC provides CCDF funds to TEA for the Professional Development Partnerships for Early Childhood Education (ECE) program, which is designed to determine a pathway for articulation between two- and four-year colleges and universities for preservice early childhood teachers. IHEs identify a faculty member to serve as a mentor and require students agree to complete a minimum number of credit hours over the program period. Each participating IHE is required to adapt its program to include the elements of current effective teacher preparation programs that focus on the skills most important for children's success. Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS): TWC provides funding for TECPDS to support the Texas Workforce Registry (TWR). TWR is a web-based application for early childhood education professionals who work with children from birth to age 8 to house their education and employment history and training hours. TWR is administered by CLI. TWC funds are supporting a statewide roll-out of the TWR to all Texas Rising Star-certified early learning programs or early learning programs applying for and working with a Texas Rising Star mentor to achieve certification. TWC will continue to explore improvements and expansion of the TWR, as well as strategies to use its data to better understand and support the child care industry. Texas Association for the Education of Young Children (TXAEYC): Through a competitive procurement process, TWC awarded funds to TXAEYC for the T.E.A.C.H. program to provide financial assistance to child care providers and early childhood educators to complete a CDA credential or enroll in college-credit courses in early childhood development. In 2020, TWC increased the award and expanded the program to help early childhood educators obtain bachelor's degrees and complete early childhood education apprenticeship programs. Child Care Business Training: Through a competitive procurement process, TWC awarded a two-year grant for $3 million to Collaborative for Children to provide child care business training. This initiative provides online trainings available statewide and live virtual meetings Texas Page 42 of 380for child care owners and directors in targeted regions across Texas. The trainings are designed to teach skills valuable to administrators of small businesses, increase the number of qualified Texas Rising Star providers, and improve the quality of child care services. All training is available in English and Spanish. Infant-Toddler Specialist Network: Through a competitive procurement process, TWC awarded $3 million to CLI at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston to establish a statewide Infant-Toddler Specialist Network (ITSN). This network will provide teachers and administrators of infant and toddler programs with professional development, technical support, and opportunities to participate in professional learning communities (PLCs). This will help to enhance the quality of care provided to infants and toddlers across the state and elevate the skills and competencies of the teachers and administrators who participate. The ITSN website is at https://texasitsn.org/ . Planning for Individualized Instruction: TWC, through a competitive procurement, selected TXAEYC in partnership with Teaching Strategies to implement a statewide early childhood assessment project. At no cost to providers that serve subsidized children, Teaching Strategies provides GOLD\u00ae, an observation-based assessment system that enables early childhood caregivers to assess the development and learning of children from birth to five years of age. Teaching Strategies trains caregivers to use the assessment tools, gather and report data, and use the data to offer care and instruction that is individualized according to each child's strengths and needs. Collaborative Matching Grants Through a competitive procurement process, TWC awarded collaborative matching grants to nonprofits and community-based organizations for projects designed to improve the availability of quality child care services and to meet the needs of local communities and child care providers. Grantees are required to secure matching cash or in-kind leverage contributions to maximize resources for child care needs in the state. These grants are listed below: -Family Child Care Networks: This project, totaling approximately $400,000, funds two local collaborative efforts to develop staffed Family Child Care Networks designed to provide training, specialized services, and technical assistance to address the needs of family home-based caregivers. These efforts will increase the availability and quality of family child care. The United Way of Denton County and AVANCE were awarded 18- month grants on March 1, 2020. Texas Page 43 of 380-Addressing Challenging Behaviors in Child Care: TWC awarded nearly $1 million to Green Space Learning and Development to provide professional development that focuses on identifying, preventing, and addressing challenging behaviors. The professional development activities align with evidence-based models that promote young children's positive emotional and social development and provide teachers with strategies to reduce challenging behaviors. The 18-month grant began September 2020. -Child Care Staff Retention Strategies: In August 2020, TWC awarded approximately $2 million between two grantees, Raising Austin and the Ounce of Prevention (now Start Early), to provide collaborative efforts to implement evidence-based strategies shown to improve retention of child care staff through the development of professional supports such as: -professional development programs that focus on providing adaptive leadership skills training to create supportive work environments and improve staff retention; -initiatives that aid early childhood educators' access to local referral and PLCs to provide ongoing resources for educators; and -initiatives that promote reflective pedagogical supervision, coaching, and other development opportunities.Providing this training will increase director and owner capacity as administrators of small businesses and provide tools and resources. 1.7 Coordination With Local or Regional Child Care Resource and Referral Systems Lead Agencies may use CCDF funds to establish or support a system or network of local or regional child care resource and referral (CCR&R) organizations that is coordinated, to the extent determined by the state/territory, by a statewide public or private non-profit, community- based or regionally based, lead child care resource and referral organization (such as a statewide CCR&R network) (658E(c)(3)(B)(iii); 98.52). If Lead Agencies use CCDF funds for local CCR&R organizations, the local or regional CCR&R organizations supported by those funds must, at the direction of the Lead Agency: - Provide parents in the state with consumer education information concerning the full range of child care options (including faith-based and community-based child care providers), analyzed by provider, including child care provided during non-traditional hours and through emergency child care centers, in their area. - To the extent practicable, work directly with families who receive assistance to offer the Texas Page 44 of 380families support and assistance to make an informed decision about which child care providers they will use to ensure that the families are enrolling their children in the most appropriate child care setting that suits their needs and one that is of high quality (as determined by the Lead Agency). - Collect data and provide information on the coordination of services and supports, including services under Part B, Section 619 and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. - Collect data and provide information on the supply of and demand for child care services in areas of the state and submit the information to the State. - Work to establish partnerships with public agencies and private entities, including faith- based and community-based child care providers, to increase the supply and quality of child care services in the state and, as appropriate, coordinate their activities with the activities of the state Lead Agency and local agencies that administer funds made available through CCDF (98.52(b)). Nothing in the statute or rule prohibits States from using CCR&R agencies to conduct or provide additional services beyond those required by statute or rule. Note: Use 1.7.1 to address if a state/territory funds a CCR&R organization, describe what services are provided and how it is structured. Use subsection 7.5 to address the services provided by the local or regional child care resource and referral agencies and the indicators of progress met by CCR&R organizations if they are funded by quality set-aside funds. 1.7.1 Does the Lead Agency fund a system of local or regional CCR&R organizations? No. The state/territory does not fund a CCR&R organization(s) and has no plans to establish one. Yes. The state/territory funds a CCR&R organization(s) with all the responsibilities outlined above. If yes, describe the following: How are CCR&R services organized? Include how many agencies, if there is a statewide network, and if the system is coordinated: Texas Page 45 of 380 1.8 Disaster Preparedness and Response Plan In past disasters, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision of emergency child care services and rebuilding and restoring of child care infrastructure has emerged as an essential service. Lead Agencies are required to establish a Statewide Child Care Disaster Plan (658E(c)(2)(U)). They must demonstrate how they will address the needs of children - including the need for safe child care before, during, and after a state of emergency declared by the Governor, or a major disaster or emergency (as defined by Section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5122) - through a Statewide Disaster Plan. The effective date for the establishment of this Statewide Disaster Plan was October 1, 2018. 1.8.1 Did you make any updates to the Statewide Disaster Plan since the FY 2019-2021 CCDF Plan was submitted? Please consider any updates that were made as a result of the Lead Agency\u00e2s experiences in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Note: It is a Lead Agency decision on how often a plan should be updated and which entities, if any, should be collaborated with in the updating process.) No Yes If yes, describe the elements of the plan that were updated: Click or tap here to enter text. TWC developed the Statewide Child Care Disaster Plan in collaboration with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) Child Care Regulation (CCR) division Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM), and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). Originally developed in 2018 following Hurricane Harvey, the plan has been improved and updated to reflect lessons learned during COVID-19. Guidelines for continuation of child care subsidies and services, coordination of post- disaster recovery of child care services, requirements for providers were updated and new elements were added in response to COVID-19. Texas Page 46 of 380 1.8.2 To demonstrate continued compliance with the required elements in the Statewide Disaster Plan, certify by checking the required elements included in the current State Disaster Preparedness and Response Plan. a.

A key purpose of the CCDBG Act is to \"promote involvement by parents and family members in the development of their children in child care settings\" (658A(b)). Lead Agencies have the opportunity to consider how information can be provided to parents through the child care assistance system, partner agencies, and child care consumer education websites. The target audience for the consumer education information includes three groups: parents receiving CCDF assistance, the general public, and when appropriate, child care providers. OCC expects that Lead Agencies are using targeted strategies for each group to ensure tailored consumer education information. In this section, Lead Agencies will address how information is made available to families, the general public and child care providers to assist them in accessing high-quality child care and how information is shared on other financial assistance programs or supports for which a family might be eligible. In addition, Lead Agencies will certify that information on developmental screenings is provided and will describe how research and best practices concerning children's development, including their social-emotional development, is shared. This section also covers the parental complaint process and the consumer education website that has been developed by the Lead Agency. Finally, this section addresses the consumer statement that is provided to parents supported with CCDF funds. Note: When asked for citations, responses can include state statute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals, or policy issuances. See the Introduction on page 4 for more detail. Texas Page 48 of 380 2.1 Outreach to Families With Limited English Proficiency and Persons With Disabilities The Lead Agency is required to describe how it provides outreach and services to eligible families with limited English proficiency and persons with disabilities and to facilitate the participation of child care providers with limited English proficiency and child care providers with disabilities in the CCDF program (98.16(dd)). Lead Agencies are required to develop policies and procedures to clearly communicate program information, such as requirements, consumer education information, and eligibility information, to families and child care providers of all backgrounds (81 FR 67456). 2.1.1 Check the strategies the Lead Agency or partners utilize to provide outreach and services to eligible families for whom English is not their first language. Check all that apply. a. Application in other languages (application document, brochures, provider notices) b. Informational materials in non-English languages c. Website in non-English languages d.

Availability and/or access to specialized services (e.g. mental health, behavioral specialists, therapists) to address the needs of all children i. Other. Describe: 2.2 Parental Complaint Process The Lead Agency must certify that the state/territory maintains a record of substantiated parental complaints and makes information regarding such complaints available to the public on request (658E(c)(2)(C); 98.15(b)(3)). Lead Agencies must also provide a detailed description of the hotline or similar reporting process for parents to submit complaints about child care providers; the process for substantiating complaints; the manner in which the Lead Agency maintains a record of substantiated parental complaints; and ways that the Lead Agency makes information on such parental complaints available to the public on request (98.16 (s); 98.32(d)). 2.2.1 Describe the Lead Agency's hotline or similar reporting process through which parents can submit complaints about child care providers, including a link if it is a Web- based process: The Statewide Intake (SWI) division of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) is available for parents to report abuse, neglect, or exploitation of children, as well as violations of minimum standards in child care operations. Individuals may report abuse by using the following methods: Texas Page 50 of 380-Texas Abuse Hotline: 1-800-252-5400 -Non-emergency reports may be submitted at www.txabusehotline.org Both the hotline and website are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, across the United States. The SWI division receives and routes the following types of allegations regarding operations that are subject to regulation by Texas Health and Human Services (HHS) Child Care Regulation (CCR): -All reports that allege abuse, neglect, or exploitation of children in care (routed to the Child Care Investigations (CCI) division of DFPS) -Some, but not all, reports that allege violations of CCR statute, administrative rules, or minimum standards at child day care operations (routed to CCR) Parents can also make reports that allege violations of CCR statute, administrative rules, or minimum standards to their local licensing office. The list of local child care licensing offices is posted on the HHS website by regional areas in Texas. CCR also has an information line, 1-800-862-5252, and a centralized email inbox, CCLQuestions@hhsc.state.tx.us , where parents can contact CCR with questions or concerns. CCR requires child care operations to post the Texas Abuse Hotline and local licensing office telephone numbers in a prominent place in the operation for parents to see. CCR requires that operational policies for licensed facilities and registered homes include instructions on how a parent may contact the local Licensing office, access the Texas Abuse and Neglect Hotline, and access the DFPS website. 2.2.2 For complaints regarding all providers, including CCDF providers and non-CCDF providers, describe the Lead Agency's process and timeline for screening, substantiating, and responding to complaints. Describe whether the process includes monitoring, and highlight any differences in processes for CCDF and non-CCDF providers and licensed and license-exempt providers: DFPS investigates reports of abuse, neglect, or exploitation that allege a child in care of an operation was or may be harmed because of an act or omission by an individual working under the supervision of a child care operation. Such harm must meet the definitions of Texas Page 51 of 380abuse, neglect, or exploitation as described in the Texas Family Code and Texas Administrative Code. (DFPS also investigates reports of exploitation that allege an individual working under the auspices of an operation engaged in illegal or improper use of a child or used a child's resources for monetary or personal benefit, profit, or gain.) The operation where the alleged abuse, neglect, or exploitation occurred may also be violating statutes, administrative rules, or minimum standards. CCR investigates reports, including self-reports made by the operation, that allege statute, administrative rules, or minimum standards have been or are in violation. No allegation of abuse, neglect, or exploitation is involved. Self-reports made by the operation include incidents involving an employee or child at an operation contracting a communicable disease; a disaster or emergency causing an operation to close or rendering part of the operation unsafe or unsanitary; or a minor accident involving a child in care. The timeline for responding to and resolving complaints depends on the priority of the investigation. DFPS must respond to a report of an allegation of abuse or neglect within the first 24 hours of receiving the complaint, and the investigation must be resolved within 30 days unless there is good cause for an extension. At the child care operation, DFPS conducts on-site visits and interviews, gathers information, and observes areas pertaining to the priority 1 or priority 2 allegation of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. The initial investigation of a report that alleges statute, administrative rules, or minimum standards have been or are in violation must occur within five to 15 days and resolved within 30 to 60 days, depending on priority. The timeline for resolution may be extended if there is good cause. All investigations of reports that allege statute, administrative rules, or minimum standards have been or are in violation, assigned a priority of 1, 2, 3, or 4, require CCR staff to conduct an unannounced, on-site inspection of the operation. During the inspection, CCR staff evaluates compliance with the minimum standards related to the allegation and any plain- view observations. CCR does not conduct an on-site inspection for investigations assigned a priority 5, which are self-reports of minor violations of minimum standards or a serious injury. After any investigation (including DFPS abuse, neglect, or exploitation investigation) a written report is given to the operation and staff members discuss deficiencies with the individual in Texas Page 52 of 380charge. This report is required to be posted at the operation and is available for review on the Search Texas Child Care website, a searchable website maintained by CCR. If a provider disagrees with a deficiency, the provider may request an administrative review. Licensing staff follows up on all deficiencies to ensure that they are corrected. If deficiencies are of such a serious nature that the health and safety of the children are threatened, enforcement actions such as administrative penalties, probation, suspension, and permit denial or revocation may be warranted. If DFPS makes the determination of Reason to Believe (RTB) that abuse, neglect, or exploitation occurred to a child in care, then the alleged perpetrator is notified of the finding and his or her due process rights. The alleged perpetrator is registered in the Central Registry of Abuse, Neglect, or Exploitation. The Centralized Background Check Unit will notify the alleged perpetrator of his or her eligibility to remain at the operation depending on the risk evaluation process. 2.2.3 Certify by describing how the Lead Agency maintains a record of substantiated parental complaints. Highlight any differences in processes for CCDF and non-CCDF providers and licensed and license-exempt providers: Records of abuse, neglect, or exploitation investigations are maintained by DFPS in the Information Management Protecting Adults and Children in Texas (IMPACT) system. Records of complaints regarding providers are maintained in the Childcare Licensing Automated Support System (CLASS), the automated system that CCR uses to document all inspections and investigations. CLASS records go back to 2002. 2.2.4 Certify by describing how the Lead Agency makes information about substantiated parental complaints available to the public; this information can include the consumer education website discussed in section 2.3: Information about complaints is available to the public through the Search Texas Child Care website, a searchable website maintained by CCR. The public can review a provider's Five- Texas Page 53 of 380Year Inspection Summary and compliance history, which includes complaints. An individual may also contact DFPS or the local CCR office for complaint information. Public records of complaints are featured prominently on the CCR website. Parents can also easily find public records of complaints and other violations through a simple Google search that involves key terms such as \"Texas child care.\" The first result for this search is the Search Texas Child Care site noted above where they can search the specific child care operation in which they are interested. 2.2.5 Provide the citation to the Lead Agency's policy and process related to parental complaints: Section 6000 of the Child Care Regulation Handbook: https://hhs.texas.gov/laws- regulations/handbooks/ccrh/6000-investigations 2.3 Consumer Education Website States and territories are required to provide information to parents, the general public, and when applicable, child care providers through a state website, which is consumer-friendly and easily accessible (658E(c)(2)(E)(i)(III) and 98.33 (a)). The website must include information to assist families in understanding the Lead Agency\u00e2s policies and procedures, including licensing child care providers. The website information must also include monitoring and inspection reports for each provider, and the quality of each provider (if such information is available for the provider) (658E(c)(2)(D); 98.33(a)). The website should also provide access to a yearly statewide report on the aggregate number of deaths, serious injuries, and the number of cases of substantiated child abuse that have occurred in child care settings. To help families access additional information on finding child care, the website must include contact information for local child care and resource referral organizations. It must also include information on how parents can contact the Lead Agency and other organizations to better understand the information on the website. Texas Page 54 of 380To certify, respond to questions 2.3.1 through 2.3.10 by describing how the Lead Agency meets these requirements and provide the direct URL/website link to the consumer education website in 2.3.11. Please note that any changes made to the web links provided below in this section after the CCDF Plan is approved will require a CCDF Plan amendment. 2.3.1 Describe how the Lead Agency ensures that its website is consumer-friendly and easily accessible. (Note: While there is no Federal CCDF definition for easily accessible, Lead Agencies may consider easily accessible websites to be searchable, simple to navigate, written in plain language, and easy to understand.): The consumer services that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission provides can be found under the Services tab on the Health and Humans Services (HHS) main page at https://hhs.texas.gov/ . The HHS website adheres to all requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Child Care page is under the Safety subtab. Consumer content is organized to allow each audience to easily find information by topic: types of child care, licensing, and technical assistance and training. There is a Frequently Asked Questions section with easy-to-read questions and answers that uses simple terms and avoids industry jargon. Child Care Regulation (CCR) maintains a Search Texas Child Care web page on the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) website with options that allow users to search for child care by a variety of criteria, including provider type, county, ZIP code, age groups served, and services provided. The website presents compliance histories for the past five years and includes the number of minimum standards evaluated, a brief description of each deficiency cited, and the risk level of each minimum standard. Additionally, the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) operates the Texas Child Care Solutions website, which is organized to allow parents and providers to find information on quality child care, financial assistance, and child development. The content on the Texas Child Care Solutions website is tested against the Flesch-Kincaid reading scale to ensure readability for the broadest audience. Texas Page 55 of 380TWC also funded the Texas Child Care Availability Portal - a tool that connects parents to open child care slots by allowing providers to voluntarily indicate their vacant seats and enrollment by age group. This portal provides an easily navigable map powered by Google Maps, with which many users are already familiar. Each child care provider profile also links directly to the provider's state inspection and reports page on CCR's Search Texas Child Care site. The portal has also supported collection of timely and meaningful information about the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on the child care industry. As of March 19, 2021, 3,379 providers were reporting a total of 63,535 vacant slots, and the portal had logged 59,195 searches for child care. To give parents better access to these resources, TWC and agency partners are in the process of creating a new consumer education website that will serve as the primary vehicle for communication about child care and early learning in Texas. Texas' website project was selected to partner with the Inspire Team, an individualized technical assistance service provided through the federal Child Care State Capacity Building Center. The Inspire Team will assist the Texas team with web page design, governance, implementation and communication plans, and a web analytics strategy. Additionally, TWC will seek input from multiple stakeholders, including parents, providers, and partner organizations, in developing this site. TWC's new consumer education website is expected to include all early childhood services, programs, and information provided by the State of Texas. This requires coordination across multiple state agencies that are part of an interagency team formed in 2018 and led by the interagency early childhood deputy director. Currently, Texas parents must search online across multiple websites to find the information they need. The goal of TWC's consumer education website is to give parents of young children one place to get information from at least the following state agencies: -The Texas Workforce Commission -The Texas Education Agency -The Texas Department of State Health Services -The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services -The Texas Health and Human Services Commission The website will include information on eligibility, how to access services, and more for the following resources at minimum: -Child care Texas Page 56 of 380-Public school prekindergarten -Head Start -Home visiting -Early childhood intervention -Child development -Nutrition 2.3.2 Describe how the website ensures the widest possible access to services for families that speak languages other than English (98.33(a)): The child care consumer information on the CCR website is available in both English and Spanish. The inspection results posted on the Search Texas Child Care web page are not being translated at this time because the content is dynamically generated and translation requires additional effort and technical resources. The Texas Child Care Solutions website is available in both Spanish and Vietnamese, the second and third most common languages spoken in Texas, respectively. 2.3.3 Describe how the website ensures the widest possible access to services for persons with disabilities: All CCR web content, except for inspection results, meets accessibility standards. As the inspection results are dynamically generated, ensuring accessibility of that content will require additional technical resources and efforts. HHSC has a dedicated accessibility department that works with new computer systems to ensure the widest possible access to individuals with disabilities. The new systems use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, and specialized accessibility testing occurs during the development life cycle. However, legacy applications with outdated technologies have proven difficult and costly to bring up to standards. There is an opportunity, subject to legislative funding, for this site to be replaced, at which point it would be in compliance. All TWC web content is required to meet industry-accepted accessibility standards that allow Texas Page 57 of 380individuals with disabilities, such as visual impairments, to access information. The Texas Child Care Solutions website was built using WordPress. WordPress templates and design standards adhere to WCAG 2.0 and comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. 2.3.4 Provide the specific website links to the descriptions of the Lead Agency's processes related to child care. A required component of the consumer education website is a description of Lead Agency policies and procedures relating to child care (98.33(a) (1)). This information includes a description of how the state/territory licenses child care, a rationale for exempting providers from licensing requirements, the procedure for conducting monitoring and inspections of providers, and the policies and procedures related to criminal background checks. a.

The consumer education website must include a list of all licensed providers (98.33 (a)(2)). At the discretion of the Lead Agency, all providers eligible to deliver CCDF services, identified as either licensed or license-exempt, can be included. Providers caring for children to whom they are related do not need to be included. The list of providers must be searchable by ZIP Code. a.

Describe -Contact Information -Enrollment Capacity -Years in Operation -Provider Education and Training -Languages Spoken -Quality Information -Monitoring Reports 2.3.6 Lead Agencies must also identify specific quality information on each child care provider for whom they have this information. The type of information provided is determined by the Lead Agency, and it should help families easily understand whether a provider offers services that meet Lead Agency-specific best practices and standards or a nationally recognized, research-based set of criteria. Provider-specific quality information must only be posted on the consumer website if it is available for the individual provider. a. What information does the Lead Agency provide on the website to determine quality ratings or other quality information? i. Quality rating and improvement system ii. National accreditation iii. Enhanced licensing system iv. Meeting Head Start/Early Head Start Program Performance Standards v. Meeting Prekindergarten quality requirements vi. School-age standards, where applicable vii. Other. Texas Page 63 of 380Describe b) For what types of providers are quality ratings or other indicators of quality available? i. Licensed CCDF providers. Describe the quality information: Texas Rising Star is a voluntary, quality-based rating system of child care providers participating in TWC's subsidized child care program. Texas Rising Star certification is available to licensed centers and licensed and registered child care home providers that meet the certification criteria. Texas Rising Star offers three levels of certification (2-Star, 3-Star, and 4-Star) to encourage providers to attain progressively higher levels of quality. This information is not available on the searchable website operated by CCR, however, it is listed in the Texas Child Care Availability Portal. CCR's Search Texas Child Care web page includes provider's self-reported information regarding their national accreditation status. It does not contain information on a provider's certification under the state's QRIS, Texas Rising Star. Parents are able to obtain information on a provider's Texas Rising Star certification status on the Texas Child Care Availability Portal and on Texas Child Care Solutions website. ii. Licensed non-CCDF providers. Describe the quality information: iii. License-exempt center-based CCDF providers. Describe the quality information: Providers operated by the US Department of Defense (DoD) are required to meet high-quality standards established and monitored by DoD. Therefore, DoD-operated facilities automatically receive an initial 4-Star certification without a full on-site assessment. iv. License-exempt FCC CCDF providers. Describe the quality information: Texas Page 64 of 380v. License-exempt non-CCDF providers. Describe the quality information: vi. Relative child care providers. Describe the quality information: vii. Other. Describe 2.3.7 Lead Agencies must post monitoring and inspection reports on the consumer education website for each licensed provider and for each non-relative provider eligible to provide CCDF services. These reports must include the results of required annual monitoring visits, and visits due to major substantiated complaints about a provider's failure to comply with health and safety requirements and child care policies. A full report covers everything in the monitoring visit, including areas of compliance and non- compliance. If the state does not produce any reports that include areas of compliance, the website must include information about all areas covered by a monitoring visit (e.g., by posting a blank checklist used by monitors). The reports must be in plain language or provide a plain language summary, as defined by the state or territory, and be timely to ensure that the results of the reports are available and easily understood by parents when they are deciding on a child care provider. Lead Agencies must post at least 3 years of reports. Certify by responding to the questions below: a. Does the Lead Agency post? (check one): i. Full monitoring reports that include areas of compliance and non-compliance. ii. Monitoring reports that include areas of non-compliance only, with information about all areas covered by a monitoring visit posted separately on the website (e.g., a blank checklist used by monitors). Note: This option is only Texas Page 65 of 380allowable if the state/territory does not produce monitoring reports that include both areas of compliance and non-compliance. If checked, provide a direct URL/website link to the website where a blank checklist is posted. CCR displays the total number of standards evaluated for compliance within the last five years, and the following areas are evaluated at every inspection: -Supervision of children -Child/caregiver ratio -Fire, safety and/or sanitation deficiencies -Conditions of any waiver or variance -Director and caregiver responsibilities -Restrictions and/or conditions of the permit -Background checks Section 4000 of the Child Care Regulation handbook ( https://www.hhs.texas.gov/laws-regulations/handbooks/ccrh/section-4000- inspections ) details the policies and procedures for child care monitoring inspections. b. Check to certify that the monitoring and inspection reports and, if necessary, their plain language summaries include: Date of inspection Health and safety violations, including those violations that resulted in fatalities or serious injuries occurring at the provider. Describe how these health and safety violations are prominently displayed: CCR prominently displays all violations for each provider in a summary broken down by risk level (high, medium-high, medium, medium-low, and low). Violations are displayed in a table that includes a brief description of the minimum standard, the risk level associated with the minimum standard, and a link to the narrative explaining the reason for the violation. Starting in August 2018, two additional fields were added to include the technical assistance provided and the correction narrative for how the operation has come into compliance. Five-year serious injury and fatality summaries are also available, as of April 2020. Corrective action plans taken by the state and/or child care provider. Describe: For each deficiency cited, CCR displays whether the deficiency was corrected at Texas Page 66 of 380the time of the inspection, the deadline for correcting the deficiency, and the date the correction was verified. Additional information about corrections is included in the narrative that explains the violation, the technical assistance provided, and how the operation has come into compliance. There is also an indicator displayed when a provider is subject to a current adverse or corrective action. A minimum of 3 years of results, where available. c. How and where are reports posted in a timely manner? Specifically, provide the Lead Agency's definition of \"timely\" and describe how it ensures that reports and/or summaries are posted within its timeframe. Note: While Lead Agencies may define \"timely,\" we recommend Lead Agencies update results as soon as possible and no later than 90 days after an inspection or corrective action is taken. i. Provide the direct URL/website link to where the reports are posted. http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Child_Care/Search_Texas_Child_Care/ppFacilitySearchDa yCare.asp ii. Describe how the Lead Agency defines timely posting of monitoring reports. CCR posts deficiencies to the public Search Texas Child Care web page after due process has been finalized. CCR notifies providers that if, upon receipt of the inspection report, the provider disagrees with the actions or decisions of CCR staff, the provider has 15 days to request due process via an administrative review. If the provider does not respond within 15 days or gives written notice that it waives the right to an administrative review, the deficiency is posted to the Search Texas Child Care web page the next day. Due process usually takes from 15 to 20 days after CCR cites the deficiency. If the provider requests an administrative review, the process takes approximately 76 days after CCR cites the deficiency. d. Monitoring and inspection reports or the summaries must be in plain language to meet the CCDF regulatory requirements (98.33 (a)(4)). i. Provide the Lead Agency's definition of plain language. HHSC describes plain language as language that allows the audience to find what they need, understand what they find, and use what they find to meet their needs. The contact information for CCR is posted clearly throughout the CCR website, offering Texas Page 67 of 380consumers the opportunity to provide feedback on the readability of the information and reports presented. ii. Describe how the monitoring and inspection reports or the summaries are in plain language. The Search Texas Child Care web page includes a plain-language summary of each inspection, including a list of items that are evaluated at each inspection: supervision; child-to-caregiver ratio; obvious fire, safety, or sanitation deficiencies; conditions of any waiver or variance; director and caregiver responsibilities; and background checks. This information is static across inspection reports and operations. The summary also includes a dynamically created list for each inspection, presented in table format. The table can be viewed in a \"Detail\" view, which includes the date of inspection, the type of inspection, whether the inspection was the result of a self- report, and whether a violation was found. Listed under each inspection is the subchapter of minimum standards that was evaluated, the total number of minimum standards in that subchapter, and the total number of violations found under that subchapter. For subchapters that were not evaluated, the list shows the total number of individual minimum standards evaluated and the total number of violations found. e. Describe the process for correcting inaccuracies in reports (98.33 (a)(4)). CCR does not post deficiencies to the public Search Texas Child Care web page until the provider has either waived the right to due process or requested due process and the finding was upheld. If a provider wants to contest information that is posted on the public website, the contact information for CCR is clearly posted and each request is evaluated. CCR does not regulate or issue deficiencies to any license-exempt provider that is eligible for CCDF. CCDF providers that are regulated by DoD are exempt from CCR, and their inspection reports are not included on the CCR website. DoD child development programs must adhere to the inspection and complaint procedures outlined in DoD Instruction 6060.02. f. Describe the process for providers to appeal the findings in reports. Description of the process should include the time requirements and timeframes for: Texas Page 68 of 380-- filing the appeal -- conducting the investigation -- removal of any violations from the website determined on appeal to be unfounded. CCR notifies providers that if, upon receipt of the inspection report, the provider disagrees with the actions or decisions of CCR staff, the provider has 15 days to request due process via an administrative review. Once CCR receives the request for an administrative review, the provider is contacted within 10 days to schedule the conference. The conference occurs within 30 days of this contact, unless additional time is required to accommodate a provider's Open Records Request to obtain records pertaining to the CCR decision. During the administrative review conference, the provider may present documents to support the appeal of the CCR decision. CCR may interview staff and review inspection or investigation records to obtain additional information. CCR has 21 days after conducting the administrative review conference to overturn or uphold the decision and prepare and send written notification about the outcome of the administrative review to the provider. A decision to uphold the deficiency may include amending the narrative or selecting a more appropriate minimum standard to cite as deficient. Once the decision to uphold is entered in the licensing system (CLASS), the deficiency is posted to the public Search Texas Child Care web page the following day. If CCR overturns the deficiency, the deficiency is not posted to the public web page. Link to Child Care Regulation policy and procedures regarding administrative reviews: https://hhs.texas.gov/laws-regulations/handbooks/cclpph/section-7000-voluntary-actions- enforcement-actions#7710 g. Describe the process for maintaining monitoring and inspection reports on the website. Specifically, provide the minimum number of years reports are posted and the policy for removing reports (98.33(a)(4)(iv)). CCR displays five years of compliance history for licensed operations and registered child care homes. The removal of compliance information after five years from the date of the deficiency is controlled by an IT process. There is no policy for removing reports, however, CCR will evaluate a provider's request to remove or change information posted on the public Search Texas Child Care web page on a case-by-case basis. Texas Page 69 of 380 CCR does not publish reports of closed operations on the Search Texas Child Care web page, but it does include a list of licensed child care operations whose permit has been revoked or involuntarily suspended in the past five years. Registered and listed homes whose permit was revoked or involuntarily suspended after December 13, 2010, are listed permanently. The list includes only revocations or involuntary suspensions that have been finalized, not those that are still under review or appeal. 2.3.8 Aggregate data on serious injuries, deaths, and substantiated cases of child abuse that have occurred in child care settings each year must be posted by Lead Agencies on the consumer education website (98.33(a)(5)). The serious incident aggregate data should include information about any child in the care of a provider eligible to receive CCDF, not just children receiving subsidies. This aggregate information on serious injuries and deaths must be separated by category of care (e.g. centers, family child care homes, and in-home care) and licensing status (i.e. licensed or license-exempt) for all eligible CCDF providers in the state. The information on instances of substantiated child abuse does not have to be organized by category of care or licensing status. Information should also include the total number of children regulated to be cared for by provider type and licensing status (81 FR, p. 67477), so that families can view the serious injuries, deaths, and substantiated cases of abuse data in context. The aggregate report should not include individual provider-specific information or names. a. Certify by providing: i. The designated entity to which child care providers must submit reports of any serious injuries or deaths of children occurring in child care (98.16 (ff)) and describe how the Lead Agency obtains the aggregate data from the entity. CCR requires providers to report serious injuries and deaths of children occurring in regulated child care operations. CCR does not regulate license-exempt providers eligible for CCDF and therefore does not have reporting requirements for those providers. Regulated providers may report serious injuries or deaths of children: -by phone 24 hours a day to the Texas Abuse and Neglect Hotline (1-800-252- 5400); or -24 hours a day via the Texas Abuse and Neglect Hotline online reporting system Texas Page 70 of 380If a report is made to the Texas Abuse and Neglect Hotline (online or by phone), DFPS, which manages the hotline, enters the report into the DFPS automated system (IMPACT). IMPACT routes reports related to child care operations to the licensing system, CLASS. For child deaths or situations in which a child may be at immediate risk of harm, DFPS hotline staff immediately notifies CCR staff by phone. Before September 1, 2017, CCR was a division of DFPS, and the DFPS Management, Reporting, and Statistics division aggregated the data. CCR became a division of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) on that date, and the HHSC Regulatory Services Division Analytics team currently supports CCR's data and reporting needs. ii. The definition of \"substantiated child abuse\" used by the Lead Agency for this requirement. An allegation of abuse, neglect, or exploitation is substantiated if, based on the preponderance of evidence gathered during an investigation, the DFPS investigator concludes that the alleged abuse or neglect occurred. Abuse and neglect are defined in Texas Family Code \u00a7261.001. iii. The definition of \"serious injury\" used by the Lead Agency for this requirement. Serious injury is defined as any physical injury to a child that requires medical treatment and resulted or may result in impairment to the child's overall health or well- being. This does not include: -near fatal injuries; -injuries for which a child is evaluated by a professional as a precaution; -injuries for which first aid is administered at the operation, but no further treatment by a medical professional is warranted; or -medical events due to routine, ongoing medical issues, such as asthma or seizures.Also seeimpairment. Impairment: In most instances, an impairment prevents the injured person from performing one or more of their usual and customary daily activities or makes the task of daily activities more difficult. Link to definition: https://hhs.texas.gov/laws-regulations/handbooks/cclpph/definitions-terms#S Texas Page 71 of 380 b. Certify by checking below that the required elements are included in the Aggregate Data Report on serious incident data that have occurred in child care settings each year. i. the total number of serious injuries of children in care by provider category/licensing status ii. the total number of deaths of children in care by provider category/licensing status iii. the total number of substantiated instances of child abuse in child care settings iv. the total number of children in care by provider category/licensing status c. Provide the website link to the page where the aggregate number of serious injuries, deaths, and substantiated instances of child abuse are posted. CCR posts the following reports on the Child Care Licensing Statistics web page: -Data Book Child Day Care Licensing -Data Book Residential Child Care Licensing -Serious Injuries Report -Child Safety Data for Licensed Day Care Centers DFPS is the state agency responsible for conducting investigations of alleged abuse, neglect, or exploitation of children in child care settings. DFPS posts aggregate data of substantiated instances of child abuse and neglect in child care settings in the DFPS Annual Data Book, available on their public website at www.dfps.state.tx.us . 2.3.9 The consumer education website must include contact information on referrals to local child care resource and referral organizations (98.33 (a)(6)). How does the Lead Agency provide referrals to local CCR&R agencies through the consumer education website? Describe and include a website link to this information: TWC developed Texas Child Care Solutions , the purpose of which is to provide parents and child care providers access to resources and information to assist them in making informed choices to meet their child care and family needs. Texas Child Care Solutions connects parents with up-to-date parenting information, ideas, and on-the-ground resources. As stated in Section 2.3.1, TWC is working on creating a new consumer education website. The goal of the new consumer education website is to give parents of young children one Texas Page 72 of 380place to get information from the following state agencies: -The Texas Workforce Commission -The Texas Education Agency -The Texas Department of State Health Services -The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services -The Texas Health and Human Services Commission The website will include information on eligibility, application, and more for these resources: -Child care -Public school prekindergarten -Head childhood intervention -Child development -Nutrition 2.3.10 The consumer education website must include information on how parents can contact the Lead Agency, or its designee, or other programs that can help the parent understand information included on the website (98.33 (a)(7)). Describe and include a website link to this information: Parents can contact their local Board for assistance with understanding the information provided on the Texas Child Care Solutions website: http://texaschildcaresolutions.org/contact-us/ In addition, the following CCR web pages for parents include a link to a list of local CCR offices: https://hhs.texas.gov/services/safety/child-care/contact-child-care-licensing 2.3.11 Provide the website link to the Lead Agency's consumer education website. Note: An amendment is required if this website changes. Texas Child Care Solutions contains parent resource information, and includes links to the Search Texas Child Care webpage which contains child care licensing information. https://texaschildcaresolutions.org/ Texas Page 73 of 380http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Child_Care/Search_Texas_Child_Care/default.asp 2.4 Additional Consumer and Provider Education Lead Agencies are required to certify that they will collect and disseminate information about the full diversity of child care services to promote parental choice to parents of eligible children, the general public, and where applicable, child care providers. In addition to the consumer education website, the consumer education information can be provided through CCR&R organizations or through direct conversations with eligibility case workers and child care providers. Outreach and counseling can also be effectively provided via information sessions or intake processes for families (658E(c)(2)(E); 98.15(b)(4); 98.33(b)). In questions 2.4.1 through 2.4.5, certify by describing: 2.4.1 How the Lead Agency shares information with eligible parents, the general public, and where applicable, child care providers about the availability of child care services provided through CCDF and other programs for which the family may be eligible, such as state Prekindergarten, as well as the availability of financial assistance to obtain child care services. At a minimum, describe what is provided (e.g., such methods as written materials, the website, and direct communications) and how information is tailored for these audiences. The state uses a variety of methods to inform families of the availability of child care services. TWC posts information regarding child care services on its website, holds community outreach meetings or other in-person meetings, and uses radio and/or television and print media. The information is available to eligible parents and the public through TWC's consumer education website\u2014Texas Child Care Solutions\u2014at http://www.texaschildcaresolutions.org . The website includes links to each program's website and any local information that may be available. TWC is working with a cross-agency early childhood team to develop a single web page where parents can access information about all early childhood services that are publicly available in Texas. Additionally, the state is exploring a parent education and outreach campaign to provide Texas Page 74 of 380parents with information on Texas Rising Star and emphasize the importance of considering quality in the selection of a child care provider. 2.4.2 How does the Lead Agency provide the required information about the following programs and benefits to the parents of eligible children, the general public, and where applicable, providers? Certify by describing for each program listed below, at a minimum, what information is provided, how the information is provided, and how the information is tailored to a variety of audiences.

The description should include: -- what information is provided -- how the information is provided -- how the information is tailored to a variety of audiences, including: - parents - providers - the general public -- any partners in providing this information Description: The Texas Early Learning Council (TELC) developed infant, toddler, and three-year-old Texas Page 76 of 380guidelines called Little Texans-Big Futures ( http://littletexans.org/ ), which address the research and best practices concerning children's development. It includes physical health and development, such as healthy eating, physical activity, information about successful parenting, and family engagement. Little Texans-Big Futures are research-based guidelines and include guidance on what young children should know and be able to do at different points in their development. The guidelines also include critical information to help parents and caregivers notice these milestones and respond appropriately to support each child's development. The Little Texans-Big Futures guidelines are available to parents, providers, and the public at http://littletexans.org/DownloadGuidelines.aspx . TEA has also developed voluntary Texas Prekindergarten Guidelines (Pre-K Guidelines), which are available at http://tea.texas.gov/index2.aspx?id=2147495508 . Little Futures with Pre-K Guidelines.

Parents can subscribe to receive regular text messages or may follow the initiative on social media platforms at https://www.facebook.com/TXReading/ and https://twitter.com/txreading . 2.5 Procedures for Providing Information on Developmental Screenings Lead Agencies are required to provide information on developmental screenings to parents, the general public and, when applicable, child care providers. Information should include: Existing resources and services that the state can use in conducting developmental screenings and providing referrals to services for children who receive child care assistance.Lead Agencies must also include a description of how a family or child care provider can use these resources and services to obtain developmental screenings for children who receive subsidies and who might be at risk of cognitive or other developmental delays, which can include social, emotional, physical, or linguistic delays (658E(c)(2)(E)(ii)).This information about the resources can include the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment program under the Medicaid program carried out under title XIX of the Social Security Act and developmental screening services available under IDEA Part B, Section 619 and Part C, in conducting those developmental screenings and in providing referrals to services for children who receive subsidies. Lead Agencies are required to provide this information to eligible families during CCDF intake and to child care providers through training and education (98.33(c)). Information on developmental screenings, as other consumer education information, should be accessible Texas Page 80 of 380for individuals with limited English proficiency and individuals with disabilities. 2.5.1 Certify by describing: a) How the Lead Agency collects and disseminates information on existing resources and services available for conducting developmental screenings to CCDF parents, the general public, and where applicable, child care providers (98.15(b)(3)). TWC coordinates with the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), and the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to stay abreast of resources available for conducting developmental screenings. Information regarding these services is available to parents, providers, and the public through the Texas Child Care Solutions website. TWC is working with a team of early childhood leaders across five agencies to consolidate all available early childhood state resources into one parent-friendly website in order to make information regarding developmental screenings and related topics more accessible to parents. b) The procedures for providing information on and referring families and child care providers to the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment program under the Medicaid program - carried out under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) - and developmental screening services available under Section 619 and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1419, 1431 et seq.). As required by Texas Workforce Commission Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.15 and described in Section D-1004.a of the Child Care Services Guide , Local Workforce Development Boards (Boards) are required to ensure that parents receive information on developmental screenings as part of the intake process. As described in Section H-106 of TWC's Child Care Services Guide , Boards have the flexibility to choose methods for disseminating developmental screening information to parents, including providing information through Board websites and providing a link to the Texas Child Care Solutions website. Boards are also encouraged to make information and training on developmental screenings available to providers. c) How the Lead Agency gives information on developmental screenings to parents receiving a subsidy as part of the intake process. Include the information provided, ways Texas Page 81 of 380it is provided, and any partners in this work. As required by \u00a7 809.15 and described in Section D-1004.a of the Child Care Services Guide, Boards are required to ensure that parents qualifying for a subsidy receive information on developmental screenings as part of the intake process. TWC provides a sample handout for Boards in Appendix J of the Child Care Services Guide - Parent Information on Developmental Screenings and Other Family Resources. d) How CCDF families or child care providers receiving CCDF can use the available resources and services to obtain developmental screenings for CCDF children at risk for cognitive or other developmental delays. Information on how to access available resources and services to obtain developmental screenings is available at the Texas Child Care Solutions website as well as in the information provided to CCDF families at the time of intake. e) How child care providers receive this information through training and professional development. DSHS offers a national system framework that uses and builds on existing resources to develop and enhance a comprehensive approach to early childhood system-building. Help Me Grow is available in some Texas communities and strengthens the network of community resources, linking families to an organized flow of resources, which allows them to easily access the services and supports that they need. More information about the initiative can be found at https://www.dshs.texas.gov/mch/Child-Health-in-Texas.aspx . There is no funding attached to this initiative. The Texas A&M AgriLife Extension service website offers online child care training courses, and includes a category for Child Growth and Development courses. ECI has also developed an online training course geared specifically toward child care providers to train them on Child Find activities and working with their local ECI provider to jointly serve children. TWC has highlighted this freely available training in our bi-monthly Child Care & Early Learning Newsletter which goes to providers and other stakeholders across the state. At the state level, the interagency team for early childhood is exploring opportunities for partnering and cross-training across programs to increase parent and provider Texas Page 82 of 380awareness of child development, developmental screenings, Child Find activities, inclusion practices, and services available for children with delays and disabilities. Additionally, Texas Rising Star's new Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) framework provides a vehicle for intentional activities to improve individual provider's knowledge and skills around child development, developmental screenings, child progress monitoring, and inclusion practices. f) Provide the citation for this policy and procedure related to providing information on developmental screenings. Section 809.15(b)(6) requires that Boards provide information on existing resources and services available in the local workforce development area for conducting developmental screenings and providing referrals to services. Such resources and services include the following: -Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Program (known as Texas Health Steps Medicaid Resource Center): https://www.txhealthsteps.com/texas- health-steps-medicaid-resource-center -Developmental screening services under Part B and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (HHSC's Early Childhood Intervention program), https://hhs.texas.gov/services/disability/early-childhood-intervention-services -TEA's Assessments for Students with Disabilities: -https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/testing/student-assessment- overview/accommodation-resources/assessments-for-students-with-disabilities 2.6 Consumer Statement for Parents Receiving CCDF Funds Lead Agencies must provide CCDF parents with a consumer statement in hard copy or electronically (such as referral to a consumer education website) that contains specific information about the child care provider they select (98.33 d). Please note that if the consumer statement is provided electronically, Lead Agencies should consider ensuring the statement is accessible to parents, including parents with limited access to the internet, and that parents have a way to contact someone to address their questions. Texas Page 83 of 380 2.6.1 Certify by describing: a. How and when the Lead Agency provides parents receiving CCDF funds with a consumer statement identifying the requirements for providers and the health and safety record of the provider they have selected. As described in Section H-100 of TWC's Child Care Services Guide , Boards may use the TWC-developed forms to notify parents of their eligibility for child care services and provide consumer information. As required in TWC Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.15, Boards must also ensure that consumer education information is provided through a Board's website and contains, at a minimum, the following: -Information about the Texas Information and Referral Network (2-1-1 Texas) -The website and telephone number of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission Child Care Regulation (CCR) so that parents can obtain health and safety requirements, including information on: -the prevention and control of infectious diseases (including immunizations); -building and physical premises safety; -minimum health and safety training appropriate to the provider setting; and -the regulatory compliance history of child care providers. -A description of the full range of eligible child care providers -A description of programs available in the local workforce development area relating to school readiness and quality rating systems, including: -Texas Rising Star provider criteria; -integrated school readiness models, pursuant to Texas Education Code \u00a729.160 ; and -a list of child care providers that meet quality indicators, pursuant to Texas Government Code \u00a72308.3171 . TWC has also recently created Texas Child Care Availability Portal ( https://frontlinechildcare.texas.gov/ ), a searchable website with a map to help parents find child care. Each child care provider profile includes a direct link to its CCR health and safety page, as well as Texas Rising Star information. TWC will be incorporating this into existing requirements and resources. b. Certify by checking below the specific information provided to families either in hard copy or electronically. Note: The consumer statement must include the eight requirements listed in the table below. Health and safety requirements met by the provider Texas Page 84 of 380Licensing or regulatory requirements met by the provider Date the provider was last inspected Any history of violations of these requirements Any voluntary quality standards met by the provider How CCDF subsidies are designed to promote equal access How to submit a complaint through the hotline How to contact a local resource and referral agency or other community-based organization to receive assistance in finding and enrolling in quality child care c.

Provide Stable Child Care Financial Assistance to Families 3. Provide Stable Child Care Financial Assistance to Families In providing child care assistance to families, Lead Agencies are required to implement these policies and procedures: a minimum 12-month eligibility and redetermination period, a process to account for irregular fluctuations in earnings, a policy ensuring that families' work schedules are not disrupted by program requirements, policies to provide for a job search of no fewer than 3 months if the Lead Agency exercises the option to discontinue assistance, and policies for the graduated phase-out of assistance. In addition, the Lead Agency is also required to describe procedures for the enrollment of children experiencing homelessness and, if applicable, children in foster care. Note: Lead Agencies are not prohibited from establishing policies that extend eligibility beyond 12 months to align program requirements. For example, Lead Agencies can allow children enrolled in Head Start, Early Head Start, state or local Prekindergarten, and other collaborative programs to finish the program year or, similarly, parents enrolled in school can have eligibility Texas Page 85 of 380extended to allow parents to finish their school year. This type of policy promotes continuity for families receiving services through multiple benefit programs. In this section, Lead Agencies will identify how they define eligible children and families and how the Lead Agency improves access for vulnerable children and families. This section also addresses the policies that protect working families and determine a family's contribution to the child care payment. Note: When asked for citations, responses can include state statute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals or policy issuances. See the Introduction on page 4 for more detail. 3.1 Eligible Children and Families 3.1 Eligible Children and Families At the time when eligibility is determined or redetermined, children must (1) be younger than age 13; (2) reside with a family whose income does not exceed 85 percent of the State's median income for a family of the same size and whose family assets do not exceed $1,000,000 (as certified by a member of said family); and (3)(a) reside with a parent or parents who are working or attending a job training or educational program or (b) receives, or needs to receive, protective services and resides with a parent or parents not described in (3)(a.)

How does the Lead Agency define \"income\" for the purposes of eligibility at the point of initial determination? For the purposes of determining family income and assessing the parent share of cost, TWC Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.44 directs Boards to ensure that family income is calculated in accordance with Commission guidelines that: -take into account irregular fluctuations in earnings; and -ensure that temporary increases in income, including temporary increases that result in monthly income exceeding 85 percent of the state median income, do not affect eligibility or parent share of cost. A family's monthly income is the gross income before adjustments are made for taxes, which can also be referred to as gross earnings or gross pay. ( Child Care Services Guide, D-106.a ) Unless otherwise required by federal or state law, a family's monthly income for purposes of determining eligibility and the parent share of cost includes all income sources except those listed below. In accordance with Commission income- calculation guidelines, Boards must ensure that the following sources are excluded from family income: (1) Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP benefits, school meals, and housing assistance (2) Monthly monetary allowances provided to or for children of Vietnam veterans born with certain birth defects (3) Needs-based educational scholarships, grants, and loans, including financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants, Federal Work Study Program, PLUS, Stafford Loans, and Perkins loans (4) Individual Development Account (IDA) withdrawals for the purchase of a home, medical expenses, or educational expenses (5) Onetime cash payments, including tax refunds, Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Advanced EITC, onetime insurance payments, gifts, and lump-sum inheritances (6) VISTA and AmeriCorps living allowances and stipends (7) Noncash or in-kind benefits such as employer-paid fringe benefits, food, or housing Texas Page 93 of 380received in lieu of wages (8) Foster care payments and adoption assistance (9) Special military pay or allowances, including subsistence allowances, housing allowances, family separation allowances, or special allowances for duty subject to hostile fire or imminent danger (10) Income from a child in the household between 14 and 19 years of age who is attending school (11) Early withdrawals from qualified retirement accounts specified as hardship withdrawals as classified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (12) Unemployment compensation (13) Child support payments (14) Cash assistance payments, including TANF, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Refugee Cash Assistance, general assistance, emergency assistance, and general relief (15) Onetime income received in lieu of TANF cash assistance (16) Income earned by a veteran while on active military duty and certain other veterans' benefits, such as compensation for service-connected death, vocational rehabilitation, and education assistance (17) Regular payments from Social Security, such as the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (18) Lump-sum payments received as assets in the sale of a house, in which the assets are to be reinvested in the purchase of a new home (consistent with IRS guidance) (19) Payments received as the result of an automobile accident insurance settlement that are being applied to the repair or replacement of an automobile (20) Any income sources specifically excluded by federal law or regulation (TWC rule \u00a7809.44) b.

TWC requires Boards to serve children in the following three priority groups (TWC rule \u00a7809.43 and Section B-400, Child Care Services Guide ): Texas Page 96 of 380 First Priority Group-Mandatory Consistent with CCDF regulations, the first priority group is assured child care services and includes children of parents eligible for the following: -Choices child care -Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Applicant child care -Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Employment and Training (SNAP E&T) child care -At-Risk child care for former Choices child care recipients whose TANF benefits were denied or voluntarily ended within the last 12 months due to employment, timing out of benefits, or an earnings increase Second Priority Group-Subject to Availability of Funds The second priority group is served subject to the availability of funds and includes, in the following order of priority: 1.Children who need to receive protective services child care as referenced in \u00a7809.49 2.Children of a qualified veteran or qualified spouse as defined in \u00a7801.23 3.Children of a foster youth as defined in \u00a7801.23 4.Children experiencing homelessness as defined in \u00a7809.2 and described in \u00a7809.52 5.Children of parents on military deployment as defined in \u00a7809.2 whose parents are unable to enroll in military-funded child care assistance programs 6.Children of teen parents as defined in \u00a7809.2 7.Children with disabilities as defined in \u00a7809.2 Third Priority Group-Board Determined The third priority group includes any other priority adopted by the Board. However, a Board must not establish a priority group based on parent choice of an individual provider or provider type. Boards must ensure that children in the first and second priority groups are enrolled before enrolling children from Board-established priority groups. b. eligibility redetermination. If, at the time of eligibility redetermination, the family is experiencing a temporary status change in work, school, or job training, the Board has the option to extend the eligibility period to the date the parent is expected to return to work, school, or job training. In accordance with local procedures, the redetermination would then be based on the income upon the parent's return to work, school, or job training. This extension is allowed on a case-by-case basis. ( Child Care Services Guide, D-1005 ) Texas Page 97 of 380 3.1.6 Lead Agencies are required to take into consideration children's development and promote continuity of care when authorizing child care services (98.21(f); 98.16(h)(6)). Lead Agencies are reminded that authorized child care services are not required to be strictly based on the work, training, or education schedule of the parent (98.21 (g)). Check the approaches, if applicable, that the Lead Agency uses when considering children's development and promoting continuity of care when authorizing child care services. a.

Following the waiver period, the family must submit required documentation to determine eligibility for child care services to continue. 3.1.9 Which strategies, if any, will the Lead Agency use to ensure the timeliness of eligibility determinations upon receipt of applications? Check all that apply. Time limit for making eligibility determinations Describe length of time: TWC Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.71(6) requires that a parent be notified of his or her eligibility to receive child care services within 20 calendar days from the day that Texas Page 102 of 380the Board's child care contractor receives all necessary documentation required to determine eligibility for child care. Track and monitor the eligibility determination process Other. Describe: N/A None 3.1.10 Informing parents who receive TANF benefits about the exception to the individual penalties associated with the TANF work requirement. 3.1.10 Informing parents who receive TANF benefits about the exception to the individual penalties associated with the TANF work requirement. Lead Agencies are required to inform parents who receive TANF benefits about the exception to the individual penalties associated with the work requirement for any single custodial parent who has a demonstrated inability to obtain needed child care for a child younger than age 6 (98.16(v); 98.33(f)). Lead Agencies must coordinate with TANF programs to ensure that TANF families with young children will be informed of their right not to be sanctioned if they meet the criteria set forth by the state/territory TANF agency in accordance with Section 407(e)(2) of the Social Security Act. In fulfilling this requirement, the following criteria or definitions are applied by the TANF agency to determine whether the parent has a demonstrated inability to obtain needed child care. Note: The TANF agency, not the CCDF Lead Agency, is responsible for establishing the following criteria or definitions. These criteria or definitions are offered in this Plan as a matter of public record. a. Identify the TANF agency that established these criteria or definitions: TWC administers the TANF/Choices program, which is the employment and training component of TANF in Texas. HHSC administers the TANF benefit program and Texas Page 103 of 380determines when a parent has good cause for not meeting work requirements due to lack of child care. TWC and Boards receive good cause determinations through an automated interface between agency systems. b. Provide the following definitions established by the TANF agency: i. \"Appropriate child care\": Child care provided by: -relatives who meet the requirements stipulated in 45 CFR \u00a798.2 and who are eligible under TWC Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.91(e) ; -child care facilities licensed by or registered with Child Care Regulation and those operated and monitored by US military services; or -family homes listed with CCR. ii. \"Reasonable distance\": TWC grants Boards the authority to define \"reasonable distance\" for each local workforce development area (workforce area) based on the workforce area's specific geography and transportation systems. iii. \"Unsuitability of informal child care\": Any informal child care that does not meet the definition of appropriate child care or is deemed inappropriate by the parent is considered unsuitable. iv. \"Affordable child care arrangements\": Child care arrangements that fall within the maximum rates established by each Board. Parents participating in Choices are exempt from co-pays. c. How are parents who receive TANF benefits informed about the exception to the individual penalties associated with the TANF work requirements? i. In writing ii. Verbally iii. Other. Describe: TANF parents are informed about exceptions at the Workforce Orientation for Applicants. Texas Page 104 of 380d. Provide the citation for the TANF policy or procedure: TWC Chapter \u00a7811.4(d)(6) , and \u00a7811.11(a)(2) . 3.2 Family Contribution to Payments 3.2 Family Contribution to Payments Lead Agencies are required to establish and periodically revise a sliding-fee scale for CCDF families that varies based on income and the size of the family to determine each family's contribution (i.e., co-payment) that is not a barrier to families receiving CCDF funds (658E(c)(5)). In addition to income and the size of the family, the Lead Agency may use other factors when determining family contributions/co-payments. Questions 3.2.1 through 3.2.4 address co-payments during the initial/entry-eligibility period. To help families transition off of child care assistance, Lead Agencies may gradually adjust co- pay amounts for families determined to be eligible under a graduated phase-out. Question 3.2.5 addresses co-payments during the graduated phase-out period. 3.2.1 Provide the CCDF co-payments in the chart below according to family size for one child in care. a.

Texas Page 106 of 380Describe: TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.19 describes the parent share of cost requirements. Boards must have a policy that provides for the parent share of cost: -being assessed to all parents (except those described in section 3.2.4); and -being an amount determined on a sliding fee scale based on family size and gross monthly income (number of children in care may also be considered). Boards must ensure that the sliding fee scale is based on family size and gross family income expressed as a percent of the federal poverty guidelines (FPG) or state median income (SMI) for the appropriate fiscal year. In establishing the parent share of cost policy, Boards also may consider the number of children in care by including an additional amount for each additional child in care. Consistent with CCDF regulations \u00a798.45(k), Boards must ensure that the parent share of cost policy does not consider the cost of care or the amount of the provider reimbursement. Teen parents not covered under the exceptions defined in section 3.2.4 must be assessed a parent share of cost that is solely based on the teen parent's income and family size. If the parent share of cost, which is based on income and family size, is calculated to be zero, then the Board or its child care contractor must not charge the parent any minimum share of cost amount. Additionally, families who are initially eligible for child care with a three-month job search period will have their parents' share of cost set at the maximum based on their family size. The Board must waive the parent's share of cost during the initial job search period. If the parent begins to meet participation requirements within or by the end of the three months, the parent's share of cost will be reinstated based on the initially established amount or the actual family income, whichever amount is lower. TWC will explore developing a statewide policy on parent copays, and as part of the review will analyze variances in parents' share of cost with the goal of creating a standard framework that all Boards will follow to determine families' contribution to the cost of child care. vii.

Additionally, as described in \u00a7809.19(i) , a Board or it's contractor may not assess a family co-payment to parents with zero countable income. c. Families meeting other criteria established by the Lead Agency. Describe Describe the policy. 3.2.5 Policies and processes for graduated phase-out of assistance at redetermination. 3.2.5 Policies and processes for graduated phase-out of assistance at redetermination. Lead Agencies that establish initial family income eligibility below 85 percent of state median income (SMI) are required to provide a graduated phase-out of assistance for families whose income has increased above the state's initial income threshold at the time of redetermination but remains below the federal threshold of 85 percent of the state median income (98.21 (b)(1)). Providing a graduated phase-out promotes continuity by allowing for wage growth, allows for a tapered transition out of the child care subsidy program as income increases, and supports long-term self-sufficiency for families. Lead Agencies that provide a graduated phase-out must implement a two-tiered eligibility threshold, with the second tier of eligibility (used at the time of eligibility redetermination) to be set at: Texas Page 110 of 380 At redetermination, a child shall be considered eligible if his or her parents are working or attending a job training or educational program even if their income exceeds the Lead Agency's income limit to initially qualify for assistance as long as their income does not exceed the second tier of eligibility (98.21(a); 98.21(b)(1)). Note that once deemed eligible, the family shall be considered eligible for a full minimum 12-month eligibility period, even if their income exceeds the second tier of eligibility during the eligibility period, as long as it does not exceed 85 percent of SMI. A family eligible for services via the graduated phase-out of assistance is considered eligible under the same conditions as other eligible families with the exception of the co-payment restrictions, which do not apply to a graduated phase-out. To help families transition off of child care assistance, Lead Agencies may gradually adjust copay amounts for families whose children are determined eligible under a graduated phase-out and may require additional reporting on changes in family income. However, Lead Agencies must still ensure that any additional reporting requirements do not constitute an undue burden on families. Lead Agencies that establish initial family income eligibility below 85 percent of state median income (SMI) are required to provide a graduated phase-out of assistance for families whose income has increased above the state's initial income threshold at the time of redetermination but remains below the federal threshold of 85 percent of the state median income (98.21 (b)(1)). Providing a graduated phase-out promotes continuity by allowing for wage growth, allows for a tapered transition out of the child care subsidy program as income increases, and supports long-term self-sufficiency for families. a. Check and describe the option that best identifies the Lead Agency's policies and procedures regarding the graduated phase-out of assistance. N/A. The Lead Agency sets its initial eligibility threshold at 85 percent of SMI and therefore, is not required to provide a graduated phase-out period. (If checked, skip to subsection 3.3) The Lead Agency sets the second tier of eligibility at 85 percent of SMI. A. Describe the policies and procedures. TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.41(e) states that Boards establishing initial family income eligibility at less than 85 percent SMI must ensure that the family remains income-eligible for care after passing the Board's initial income eligibility limit.

Describe: 3.3 Increasing Access for Vulnerable Children and Families 3.3 Increasing Access for Vulnerable Children and Families Lead Agencies are required to give priority for child care assistance to children with special needs, which can include vulnerable populations, in families with very low incomes and to children experiencing homelessness (658E(c)(3)(B); 98.46(a)). The prioritization of CCDF assistance services is not limited to eligibility determination (i.e., the establishment of a waiting list or the ranking of eligible families in priority order to be served). Note: CCDF defines \"child experiencing homelessness\" as a child who is homeless, as defined in Section 725 of Subtitle VII-B of the McKinney-Vento Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a) (98.2). 3.3.1 Describe how the Lead Agency defines: a) \"Children with special needs\": The following groups are considered children with special needs and vulnerable populations ( Child Care Services Guide , Section B-402.e) 1.Children of parents on military deployment whose parents are unable to enroll in military-assistance programs 2.Children of teen parents 3.Children with disabilities Children with special needs are in the second priority group, which also includes children experiencing homelessness ( Child Care Services Guide , Section B-400). b) \"Families with very low incomes\": \"Families with very low incomes\" is defined as families eligible for the following: Texas Page 113 of 380-Choices child care; -TANF Applicant child care; -Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Employment and Training (SNAP E&T) child care; and -At-Risk child care for former Choices child care recipients whose TANF benefits were denied or voluntarily ended within the last 12 months due to employment, timing out of benefits, or an earnings increase. Children in families with very low incomes are in the first priority group and are assured child care services ( Child Care Services Guide , Section B-400). 3.3.2 Identify how the Lead Agency will prioritize or target child care services for the following children and families: Note: If waiving co-payments is checked, Lead Agencies will need to provide further information in question 3.2.4.

(C) State qualified spouse: (i) A spouse who meets the definition of federal qualified spouse; or (ii) A spouse of any member of the armed forces who died while serving on active military, naval, or air service. A parent on military deployment is a parent on temporary duty assignment away from the permanent military installation or place of residence for reserve components of the single military parent or dual military parents. This includes deployed parents in the regular military, military reserves, or National Guard (Texas Workforce Commission Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7 809.2(16) ). An eligible foster youth , as defined in TWC rule \u00a7801.23(1) , is a: (A) Current Foster Youth--A youth, age 14 or older, who is receiving substitute care services under the managing conservatorship of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS). This includes youth residing in private foster homes, group homes, residential treatment centers, juvenile correctional institutions, and relative care; or (B) Former Foster Youth--A youth up to 23 years of age, who formerly was under the managing conservatorship of DFPS, until: (i) the conservatorship was transferred by a court; (ii) the youth was legally emancipated (i.e., the youth's minority status was removed by a court); or (iii) the youth attained 18 years of age. A teen parent is an individual 18 years of age or younger, or 19 years of age and attending high school or the equivalent, who has a child ( \u00a7809.2(24) ). Texas Page 116 of 380 3.3.4 Describe how the Lead Agency prioritizes services for the additional priority groups identified in 3.2.3. TWC requires Boards to serve children in the following three priority groups (TWC rule \u00a7809.43 and Section B-400, Child Care Services Guide ): First Priority Group\u2014Mandatory The first priority group is assured child care services and includes children of parents eligible for the following: -Choices child care -Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Applicant child care -Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Employment and Training (SNAP E&T) child care -At-Risk child care for former Choices child care recipients whose TANF benefits were denied or voluntarily ended within the last 12 months due to employment, timing out of benefits, or an earnings increase Second Priority Group\u2014Subject to Availability of Funds The second priority group is served subject to the availability of funds and includes, in the following order of priority: 1.Children who need to receive protective services child care as referenced in \u00a7809.49 2.Children of a qualified veteran or qualified spouse as defined in \u00a7801.23 3.Children of a foster youth as defined in \u00a7801.23 4.Children experiencing homelessness as defined in \u00a7809.2 and described in \u00a7809.52 5.Children of parents on military deployment as defined in \u00a7809.2 whose parents are unable to enroll in military-funded child care assistance programs 6.Children of teen parents as defined in \u00a7809.2 7.Children with disabilities as defined in \u00a7809.2 Third Priority Group\u2014Board Determined The third priority group includes any other priority adopted by the Board. However, a Board must not establish a priority group based on parent choice of an individual provider or provider type. Boards must ensure that children in the first and second priority groups are enrolled before enrolling children from Board-established priority groups. Texas Page 117 of 380 3.3.5 Lead Agencies are required to expend CCDF funds to (1) permit the enrollment (after an initial eligibility determination) of children experiencing homelessness while required documentation is obtained, (2) provide training and technical assistance to child care providers and the appropriate Lead Agency (or designated entity) staff on identifying and serving homeless children and families (addressed in section 6), and (3) conduct specific outreach to homeless families (658E(c)(3); 98.51). a. Describe the procedures to permit the enrollment of children experiencing homelessness while required documentation is obtained. For children experiencing homelessness, TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rules: -exempt the family from the parent share of cost ( \u00a7809.19(a)(2)(C)) ); and -require that the child is initially enrolled for a period of three months to allow the parent to provide documentation verifying the child's eligibility ( \u00a7809.52). b. Check, where applicable, the procedures used to conduct outreach for children experiencing homelessness (as defined by CCDF Rule) and their families. i. Lead Agency accepts applications at local community-based locations ii. Partnerships with community-based organizations iii. Partnering with homeless service providers, McKinney-Vento liaisons, and others who work with families experiencing homelessness to provide referrals to child care iv. Other Note: The Lead Agency shall pay any amount owed to a child care provider for services provided as a result of the initial eligibility determination, and any CCDF payment made prior to the final eligibility determination shall not be considered an error or improper payment (98.51(a)(1)(ii)). 3.3.6 Lead Agencies must establish a grace period that allows homeless children and children in foster care to receive CCDF assistance while providing their families with a reasonable time to take any necessary actions to comply with immunization and other health and safety requirements (as described in section 5). The length of such a grace period shall be established in consultation with the state, territorial, or tribal health agency (658E(c)(2)(I)(i)(I); 98.41(a)(1)(i)(C)). Texas Page 118 of 380 Note: Any payment for such a child during the grace period shall not be considered an error or improper payment (98.41(a)(1)(i)(C)(2)). a) Describe procedures to provide a grace period to comply with immunization and other health and safety requirements, including how the length of the grace period was established in consultation with the state, territorial, or tribal health agency for: i.

Boards must ensure that consumer education information, including information provided through a Board's website, contains, at a minimum, information on the prevention and control of infectious diseases, including immunizations ( \u00a7809.15(b)(2) and Child Care Services Guide, Section H-101 ). Texas Page 119 of 380 CCR minimum standards require that families with children receiving services during a grace period be referred to an appropriate health-care professional to obtain the required immunizations (26 TAC \u00a7746.613(c)(2)). The DSHS rule at 25 TAC \u00a797.66 , Provisional Enrollment for (Non-Higher Education; Non-Veterinary) Students and Children, establishes the guidelines for provisional enrollment as described here. c) Does the Lead Agency establish grace periods for other children who are not experiencing homelessness or in foster care? No. Yes. Describe: 3.4 Continuity for Working Families 3.4.1 Minimum 12-month eligibility. 3.4.1 Minimum 12-month eligibility. The Lead Agency is required to establish a minimum 12-month eligibility and redetermination period: regardless of changes in income. Lead Agencies may not terminate CCDF assistance during the minimum 12-month period if a family has an increase in income that exceeds the state's income eligibility threshold but not the federal threshold of 85 percent of state median income (SMI).regardless of temporary changes in participation in work, training, or educational activities (658E(c)(2)(N)(i) and (ii)).The Lead Agency may not terminate assistance prior to the end of the minimum 12-month period if a family experiences a temporary job loss or a temporary change in participation in a training or educational activity. Any temporary change cannot have a time limit (e.g. 60 days, 90 days, etc.). A temporary change in eligible activity includes, at a minimum: any time-limited absence from work for an employed parent due to such reasons as the need to care for a family member or an illnessany interruption in work for a seasonal worker who is not workingany student holiday or break for a parent participating in a training or educational programany reduction in work, training, or education hours, as long as the parent is still working or attending a training or educational programany other cessation of work or attendance at a Texas Page 120 of 380training or educational program that does not exceed 3 months or a longer period of time established by the Lead Agencya child turning 13 years old during the minimum 12-month eligibility period (except as described in 3.1.1)any changes in residency within the state, territory, or tribal service area a. Describe the Lead Agency's policies and procedures related to providing a minimum 12-month eligibility period at initial eligibility determination and redetermination and provide a citation for these policies or procedures. TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.42(b) requires Boards to ensure that eligibility for child care services is redetermined no sooner than 12 months following the date of the initial determination or most recent redetermination. Section 809.51(a) states that if the child meets all of the applicable eligibility requirements for child care services on the date of the most recent eligibility determination or redetermination, the child must be considered to be eligible and will receive services during the 12-month eligibility period described in \u00a7809.42, regardless of any: (1) change in family income, if that family income does not exceed 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size; or (2) temporary change in the ongoing status of the child's parent as working or attending a job training or education program.

Texas Page 123 of 380N/A 3.4.2 Continuing assistance for \"job search\" and a Lead Agency's option to discontinue assistance during the minimum 12-month eligibility period. a. Does the Lead Agency consider seeking employment (engaging in a job search) an eligible activity at initial eligibility determination (at application) and at the minimum 12-month eligibility redetermination? (Note: If yes, Lead Agencies must provide a minimum of three months of job search.) 3.4.2 Continuing assistance for \"job search\" and a Lead Agency's option to discontinue assistance during the minimum 12-month eligibility period. Lead Agencies have the option, but are not required, to discontinue assistance during the minimum 12-month eligibility period due to a parent's non-temporary loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job training or educational program, otherwise known as a parent's eligible activity. If the Lead Agency chooses the option to discontinue assistance due to a parent's non- temporary loss or cessation of eligible activity, it must continue assistance at least at the same level for a period of not fewer than 3 months after each such loss or cessation. This time period allows the parent to engage in a job search and to resume work or resume attendance in a job training or educational program. At the end of the minimum 3-month period of continued assistance, if the parent has engaged in a qualifying work, training, or educational program activity with an income below 85 percent of state median income (SMI), assistance cannot be terminated, and the child must continue receiving assistance until the next scheduled redetermination or, at the Lead Agency option, for an additional minimum 12-month eligibility period. No. Yes. If yes, describe the policy or procedure (including any differences in eligibility at initial eligibility determination vs. redetermination of eligibility): On June 15, 2021, TWC authorized a rule waiver to allow 3-month initial job search period for unemployed parents determined eligible from July 1, 2021 through Texas Page 124 of 380September 2022. b. Does the Lead Agency discontinue assistance during the minimum 12-month eligibility period due to a parent's non-temporary loss or cessation of eligible activity and offer a minimum 3-month period to allow parents to engage in a job search and to resume participation in an eligible activity? No, the state/territory does not discontinue assistance during the 12-month eligibility period due to a parent's non-temporary loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job training or educational program. Yes, the Lead Agency discontinues assistance during the 12-month eligibility period due to a parent's non-temporary loss of work or cessation of eligible activity and provides a minimum 3-month period of job search. If yes: i. Provide a summary describing the Lead Agency's policies and procedures for discontinuing assistance due to a parent's non-temporary change: During the period of time between eligibility redeterminations, a Board shall discontinue child care services due to a parent's loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job training or educational program that does not constitute a temporary change as described in Section 3.4.1. However, Boards must ensure that care continues at the same level for a period of not less than three months after such loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job training or educational program ( \u00a7809.51(b) ). Boards must provide parents written notification at least 15 calendar days before any termination of child care services ( \u00a7809.71(9) ). ii. Describe what specific actions/changes trigger the job-search period after each such loss or cessation: The job search period is triggered based on parent self-report of permanent cessations of activity or identification of those who have filed an unemployment insurance (UI) claim using the UI Early Warning Report. The UI Early Warning Report seeks to identify and assess customers who filed a UI claim and who may no longer be working and therefore may have experienced a nontemporary change in work status. A customer identified in the report has not necessarily experienced a nontemporary change in work. Potential child care issues are resolved by verifying the customer's employment and/or training status using current local procedures. The parent is required to report only a permanent cessation of activity ( \u00a7809.73(b)(2) ). The three-month activity interruption for job search begins the day Texas Page 125 of 380after the activity ends and is tracked in Texas Workforce Information System of Texas (TWIST). If the parent does not report a permanent cessation that has already exceeded three months and the Board contractor discovers and verifies with the parent that one has occurred, care must be terminated after proper notice is provided to the parent. Before making a determination to end care, verification that the parent has not resumed participation in any activity at any level must occur. iii. How long is the job-search period (must be at least 3 months)? Boards must ensure that care continues at the same level for a period of not less than three months after such loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job training or educational program. iv. Provide the citation for this policy or procedure. TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.51(b) c. The Lead Agency may discontinue assistance prior to the next minimum 12-month redetermination in the following limited circumstances. Check and describe any circumstances in which the Lead Agency chooses to discontinue assistance prior to the next minimum 12-month redetermination. Check all that apply. i. Not applicable. ii. Excessive unexplained absences despite multiple attempts by the Lead Agency or designated entity to contact the family and provider, including the prior notification of a possible discontinuation of assistance. A. Define the number of unexplained absences identified as excessive: If a child has exceeded 40 total unexplained absences during the most recent eligibility period, then the child shall be terminated from care because of excessive unexplained absences. Exceptions are provided for court-ordered visitation, documented chronic illness, or disability. Additionally, when the child reaches 15 and 30 cumulative absences, notice regarding the potential termination must be provided to the parent and provider before terminating care, allowing the parent to explain the absences or determine whether a voluntary suspension may be appropriate. Texas Page 126 of 380B. Provide the citation for this policy or procedure: \u00a7809.78 iii. A change in residency outside of the state, territory, or tribal service area. Provide the citation for this policy or procedure: Section D-901.a of the TWC Child Care Services Guide requires that Boards terminate child care services when a family experiences a change in residency outside of the state. iv. Substantiated fraud or intentional program violations that invalidate prior determinations of eligibility. Describe the violations that lead to discontinued assistance and provide the citation for this policy or procedure. As described in Section G of the TWC Child Care Services Guide , and in \u00a7809.111- \u00a7809.112, the following parental actions may be grounds for suspected fraud and cause for Boards to conduct fraud fact-finding: - Not reporting or falsely reporting at initial eligibility or at eligibility redetermination: 1.household composition or income sources or amounts that would have resulted in ineligibility or a higher parent share of cost; and/or 2.work, training, or education hours that would have resulted in ineligibility. - Not reporting during the 12-month eligibility period: 1.changes in income or household composition that would cause the family income to exceed 85 percent SMI (taking temporary fluctuations of income into consideration); 2.a permanent loss of job or cessation of training or education that exceeds three months; and/or 3.improper or inaccurate attendance reporting. These violations may result in the following actions: -Recouping funds from the parent -Prohibiting future child care eligibility until a recoupment is repaid in full, provided the prohibition does not result in a Choices or SNAP E&T participant becoming ineligible -Requiring parents to selecta regulated child care provider -Terminating care during the 12-month eligibility period if eligibility was determined using fraudulent information provided by the parent -Any other action consistent with the intent of the governing statutes or regulations to investigate, prevent, or stop suspected fraud Texas Page 127 of 380As described in \u00a7 809.19(d), failure to pay the parent share of cost may constitute an intentional program violation and result in termination of care. Before terminating care, Boards must follow locally established policies regarding the evaluation of each family's financial situation and a possible temporary reduction in the parent share of cost based on extenuating circumstances. Parents must also receive written notice of possible termination resulting from failure to pay the parent share of cost prior to services being terminated. 3.4.3 Change reporting during the minimum 12-month eligibility period. 3.4.3 Change reporting during the minimum 12-month eligibility period. The Lead Agency must describe the requirements for parents to report changes in circumstances during the 12-month eligibility period and describe efforts to ensure that such requirements do not place an undue burden on eligible families, which could impact the continuity of care for children and stability for families receiving CCDF services (98.21 (e)). Note: Responses should exclude reporting requirements for a graduated phase-out, which were described in question 3.2.5 b. Families are required to report a change to the Lead Agency at any time during the 12-month eligibility period if the family's income exceeds 85 percent of the state median income, taking into account irregular fluctuations in income (98.21(e)(1)). If the Lead Agency chooses the option to terminate assistance, as described in section 3.4.2 of the Plan, they may require families to report a non-temporary change in work, training or educational activities (otherwise known as a parent's eligible activity). a. Does the Lead Agency require families to report a non-temporary change in a parent's eligible activity? No Yes b. Any additional reporting requirements during the 12-month eligibility period must be limited to items that impact a family's eligibility (e.g., income changes over 85 percent of Texas Page 128 of 380state median income (SMI)) or that impact the Lead Agency's ability to contact the family or pay the child care providers (e.g., a family's change of address, a change in the parent's choice of child care provider). Check and describe any additional reporting requirements required by the Lead Agency during the 12-month eligibility period. Check all that apply. i. Additional changes that may impact a family's eligibility during the 12-month period. Describe: As described in TWC Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.73, families are required to report the following to the child care contractor within 14 calendar days of occurrence: -Changes in family income or family size that would cause the family to exceed 85 percent SMI for a family of the same size -Changes in work or attendance at a job training or an education program that are not considered to be temporary changes ii. Changes that impact the Lead Agency's ability to contact the family. Describe: Families are required to report any changes in family residence, primary phone number, or email address (if applicable) to the child care contractor within 14 calendar days of occurrence ( \u00a7809.73). iii. Changes that impact the Lead Agency's ability to pay child care providers. Describe: Child Care Rule \u00a7809.92 details provider responsibilities in order to receive subsidy payments for child care. Providers are responsible for the following: (1) collecting the parent share of cost as assessed under \u00a7809.19 before child care services are delivered; (2) collecting other child care funds received by the parent as described in \u00a7809.21(a)(2); (3) reporting to the Board or the Board's child care contractor instances in which the parent fails to pay the parent share of cost; and (4) following attendance reporting and tracking procedures required by the Commission under \u00a7809.95, the Board, or, if applicable, the Board's child care contractor. Texas Page 129 of 380 Additionally, Providers shall not charge the difference between the provider's published rate and the amount of the Board's reimbursement rate as determined under \u00a7809.21 to parents (1) who are exempt from the parent share of cost assessment under \u00a7809.19(a)(2); or (2) whose parent share of cost is calculated to be zero pursuant to \u00a7809.19(f). A Board may develop a policy that prohibits providers from charging the difference between the provider's published rate and the amount of the Board's reimbursement rate (including the assessed parent share of cost) to all parents eligible for child care services Providers shall not deny a child care referral based on the parent's income status, receipt of public assistance, or the child's protective service status. Providers shall not charge fees to a parent receiving child care subsidies that are not charged to a parent who is not receiving subsidies. c. Any additional reporting requirements that the Lead Agency chooses to require from parents during the minimum 12-month eligibility period, shall not require an additional office visit. In addition, the Lead Agency must offer a range of notification options to accommodate families. How does the Lead Agency allow families to report changes to ensure that reporting requirements are not burdensome and to avoid an impact on continued eligibility between redeterminations? Check all that apply. i. Phone ii. Email iii. Online forms iv. Extended submission hours v. Postal Mail vi. FAX vii. In-person submission viii. Other. Describe: d) Families must have the option to voluntarily report changes on an ongoing basis Texas Page 130 of 380during the minimum 12-month eligibility period. Lead Agencies are required to act on information reported by the family if it will reduce the family's co-payment or increase the family's subsidy. Lead Agencies are prohibited from acting on information reported by the family that would reduce the family's subsidy unless the information reported indicates that the family's income exceeds 85 percent of SMI after considering irregular fluctuations in income or, at the option of the Lead Agency, the family has experienced a non-temporary change in eligible activity. i. Describe any other changes that the Lead Agency allows families to report. Parents may report changes in: (1) income and family size, which might result in a reduction in the parent share of cost; and (2) work, job training, or education program participation that might result in an increase in the level of child care services. ii. Provide the citation for this policy or procedure. TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.73(d) 3.4.4 Prevent the disruption of employment, education, or job training activities 3.4.4 Prevent the disruption of employment, education, or job training activities. Lead Agencies are required to have procedures and policies in place to ensure that parents (especially parents receiving assistance under the TANF program) are not required to unduly disrupt their employment, education, or job training activities to comply with the Lead Agency's or designated local entity's requirements for the redetermination of eligibility for assistance (658E(c)(2)(N)(ii); 98.21(d)). Examples include developing strategies to inform families and their providers of an upcoming redetermination and the information that will be required of the family, pre-populating subsidy renewal forms, having parents confirm that the information is accurate, and/or asking only for the information necessary to make an eligibility redetermination. In addition, states and territories can offer a variety of family-friendly methods for submitting documentation for eligibility redetermination that considers the range of needs for families in accessing support (e.g., use of languages other than English, access to transportation, accommodation of parents working non-traditional hours). Texas Page 131 of 380 a) Identify, where applicable, the Lead Agency's procedures and policies to ensure that parents (especially parents receiving TANF program funds) do not have their employment, education, or job training unduly disrupted to comply with the state/territory's or designated local entity's requirements for the redetermination of eligibility. Check all that apply. i. Advance notice to parents of pending redetermination ii. Advance notice to providers of pending redetermination iii. Pre-populated subsidy renewal form iv. Online documentation submission v. Cross-program redeterminations vi. Extended office hours (evenings and/or weekends) vii. Consultation available via phone viii. Other. Describe: Section 801.25 contains requirements for all workforce services, including that Boards must have written procedures that define the steps taken to minimize customer wait times, and if a Workforce Solutions Office does not provide all on- site services and programs, electronic access to such services is provided, for example, by making access available through computer applications or telephone conferencing. Boards do not require working parents to visit Workforce Solutions Offices to submit eligibility documentation. Boards accept documentation by fax, mail, or email. Additionally, some Workforce Solutions Offices are open after standard work hours, and some locations have a drop box in which parents may submit documentation outside of business hours. 4 Ensure Equal Access to Child Care for Low-Income Children A core purpose of CCDF is to promote parental choice and to empower working parents to make their own decisions regarding the child care services that best suit their family's needs. Parents have the option to choose from center-based care, family child care, or care provided in the child's own home. In supporting parental choice, the Lead Agencies must ensure that families receiving CCDF funding have the opportunity to choose from the full range of eligible Texas Page 132 of 380child care settings and must provide families with equal access to child care that is comparable to that of non-CCDF families. Lead Agencies must employ strategies to increase the supply and to improve the quality of child care services, especially in underserved areas. In addition to generally building the supply of child care for all families, this effort also supports equal access for CCDF eligible children to the priced child care market. This section addresses strategies that the Lead Agency uses to promote parental choice, ensure equal access, and increase the supply of child care. Note: In responding to questions in this section, the Office of Child Care (OCC) recognizes that each state/territory identifies and defines its own categories and types of care. The OCC does not expect states/territories to change their definitions to fit the CCDF-defined categories and types of care. For these questions, provide responses that closely match the CCDF categories of care. Note: When asked for citations, responses can include state statute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals or policy issuances. See the Introduction on page 4 for more detail. 4.1 Maximize Parental Choice and Implement Supply Building Mechanisms The parent(s) of each eligible child who receive(s) or is offered financial assistance for child care services has the option of either receiving a child care certificate or, if available, enrolling their child with a provider that has a grant or contract for providing child care services (658E(c)(2)(A); 98.30(a)). Even if a parent chooses to enroll their child with a provider who has a grant or contract, the parent will select the provider, to the extent practicable. If a parent chooses to use a certificate, the Lead Agency shall provide information to the parent on the range of provider options, including care by sectarian providers and relatives. Lead Agencies must require providers chosen by families to meet health and safety standards and has the option to require higher standards of quality. Lead Agencies are reminded that any policies and procedures should not restrict parental access to any type of care or provider (e.g. center care, home care, in-home care, for-profit provider, non-profit provider, or faith-based provider, etc.) (98.15 (a)(5)). 4.1.1 Describe the child care certificate, including when it is issued to parents (before or after the parent has selected a provider) and what information is included on the certificate (98.16 (q)). Upon eligibility determination, parents receive a child care certificate. The parent may have already selected a provider but is not required to do so before receiving the certificate Texas Page 133 of 380(Notification of Eligibility for Child Care Services). As described in Section D-1004 of TWC's Child Care Services Guide , Boards must ensure that eligibility notification packets contain the following elements, at a minimum: -A written eligibility notification, which must contain the following: -A congratulatory opening statement -The requirement that the parent select a provider within 14 days or contact the Child Care Services program if the parent requires assistance finding a provider -Specific eligibility reasons or elements -A calculated monthly income including all income sources used to determine eligibility -Household composition (family size) -The parent share of cost amount -85 percent of state median income (SMI) information -Requirements regarding changes to report -Parents' rights information, which must contain: -the basic rights listed in the TWC Sample Parent Rights form (Child Care Service Guide, Appendix J ); and -a statement of acknowledgment by the parent that, by selecting a provider and entering into care, the parent has read and understood the information about parent rights. -An agreement to report attendance, which must contain: -information on the state attendance standards that the parent agrees to follow and the state-defined consequences for not meeting those standards; and -information on attendance reporting and responsibilities. -Parent information for choosing a provider, which must contain: -information on parent choice, including types of providers available; -information on choosing a quality provider, including information about Texas Rising Star providers; and -information on how to access Texas Child Care Regulation (CCR) provider compliance and inspection information. -Additional consumer information, including information on developmental screenings and a link to the Parent Portal 4.1.2 Identify how the parent is informed that the child care certificate allows the option to choose from a variety of child care categories, such as private, not-for-profit, faith- based 658P(2); 658Q). Check all that apply. a. Certificate provides information about the choice of providers b. Certificate provides information about the quality of providers Texas Page 134 of 380c. Certificate is not linked to a specific provider, so parents can choose any provider d. Consumer education materials on choosing child care e. Referrals provided to child care resource and referral agencies f. Co-located resource and referral staff in eligibility offices g. Verbal communication at the time of the application h. Community outreach, workshops, or other in-person activities i. Other. Describe: TWC and Boards use consumer education materials (flyers, forms, brochures), verbal communication at the time of application, and Board websites. There are multiple points of communication throughout the eligibility and renewal process. TWC Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.15 requires Boards to inform parents of child care options by providing a description of the full range of eligible child care providers, including: -licensed child care centers; -licensed child care homes; -registered child care homes; and -the option to choose an eligible relative. Additionally, TWC rules require Boards to provide parents with: -a description of programs available in the local workforce development area (workforce area) relating to Texas Rising Star provider certification, providers participating in the Texas School Ready project, and other quality rating systems, including national accreditations; -the CCR website and telephone number, so parents can be aware of health and safety requirements for regulated child care providers; and -information about 2-1-1 Texas. TWC distributes a brochure to Boards with information for parents to consider when choosing child care, including quality considerations. Texas Government Code \u00a72308.3171 requires that Boards post a list of child care providers that have met a quality indicator in a prominent place on the Board's website. The statute also requires any child care provider that cares for subsidized children to post its quality indicator at the entrance of the provider's facility. Texas Page 135 of 380 4.1.3 A core principle of CCDF is that families receiving CCDF-funded child care should have equal access to child care that is comparable to that of non-CCDF families (658E(c)(4)(A) and 98.45(a)). a. Describe how parents have access to the full range of providers eligible to receive CCDF: TWC policies and procedures ensure that parents who are eligible for the child care subsidy program have access to the full range of eligible providers. Boards recruit licensed child care centers, licensed and registered child care homes, and military child care providers to ensure that parents have a choice of eligible providers available. Program data, available at https://www.twc.texas.gov/childcarenumbers/Texas_Statewide_System_annual.html , shows that more than 97% of children in the Texas subsidy system are served in licensed child care centers. As of May 2021, over 60% of licensed centers were serving subsidized children. Boards provide a list of eligible providers in their workforce area and encourage parents to select high-quality child care options, such as Texas Rising Star- certified providers. To encourage providers to participate in the Texas Rising Star program, Boards set enhanced reimbursement rates for 4-Star Texas Rising Star programs at or above the 75th percentile of the most recent MRS, with 3-Star programs receiving at least 90 percent of the 4-Star amount and 2-Star programs receiving at least 90 percent of the 3- Star amount. Boards set their maximum reimbursement rates for providers that are not quality-rated at or above the minimum threshold described in Section 4.3.1(f) (ranging from the 50th to the 60th percentile of their workforce area's market rate, according to the most recent marker rate survey (MRS)). TWC's tiered reimbursement rate system has proven to be an effective way to increase the supply of high-quality child care available to children in Texas. TWC's Child Care by the Numbers data ( Average Number of Children in Texas Rising Star Care by Star Level ) shows an annual increase in children served by Texas Rising Star providers since 2018 (from 30,820 in 2018 to 48,675 in 2020), particularly for children in top-quality 4-star providers. Texas Page 136 of 380 Of children served by Texas Rising Star providers in 2018: -21.0% were in 2-star providers -28.2% were in 3-star providers -50.8% were in 4-star providers Of children served by Texas Rising Star providers in 2019: -14.1% were in 2-star providers -25.3% were in 3-star providers -60.6% were in 4-star providers Of children served by Texas Rising Star providers in 2020: -12.6% were in 2-star providers -23.6% were in 3-star providers -63.8% were in 4-star providers On June 18, 2021, the Governor Abbott signed House Bill 2607 which requires all subsidy providers to participate in Texas Rising Star. TWC plans to continue to incentivize child care programs to provide high-quality care by offering a tiered reimbursement with 4-star providers reimbursed at least at the 75th percentile of the market rate based on the most recent MRS, with care at 4-star providers set at or above the 85th percentile for infants and the 80th percentile for toddlers. b. Describe state data on the extent to which eligible child care providers participate in the CCDF system: In Board Contract Year* 2020 (BCY'20), Texas had 12,564 regulated child care operations. Of those, 7,803 (62.1 percent) had agreements with Boards to accept children participating in the child care subsidy system. Of the 7,228 providers that actively served children with subsidies in BCY'20: -6,099 (84.4 percent) were licensed child care centers; -615 (8.5 percent) were licensed child care homes; -492 (6.8 percent) were registered child care homes; and -22 (0.3 percent) were military child care centers. All data listed is available at https://twc.texas.gov/programs/child-care-numbers . This data is available annually and monthly by Board workforce area. *The Board Contract Year aligns with the Federal Fiscal Year and begins October 1 of the previous year through September 30 of the year listed. Texas Page 137 of 380c. Identify any barriers to provider participation, including barriers related to payment rates and practices - including for family child care and in-home providers - based on provider feedback and reports to the Lead Agency: Beginning with the 2019 study, TWC's MRS included two new questions to gain insight into the dynamics of which facilities accept subsidized children and how that affects their pricing for such children. The first question, addressed to providers that serve subsidized children, asks whether they charge more to families of subsidized children if their established rates are greater than the reimbursement they would receive (which includes the subsidy and co-payment). In the 2020 MRS, a little more than 5 percent of centers and approximately 8 percent of homes charge families a surcharge. These figures are quite similar to the rates observed in the 2019 MRS. The second question added to the MRS, addressed to facilities that do not report serving subsidized children, asked whether they had a reason for not accepting subsidized children. The most common reason reported by homes is that families have not requested or needed subsidized care. In the 2020 MRS, 5 to 6 percent of facilities not serving subsidized children indicated that they did not do so because reimbursement rates were too low. Additionally, less than 1 percent of facilities reported that they did not accept subsidized children due to issues with not receiving payments or receiving payments late. These patterns are similar to those reported in the 2019 study. TWC also asked providers that responded to the 2022-2024 CCDF State Plan Stakeholder Survey , \"What challenges, if any, have you experienced with the child care subsidy program?\" Of 1,392 providers that reported accepting subsidies, 769 responded to this question. Some providers described losing money because reimbursement rates, even at 75th percentile for 4-Star Texas Rising Star providers, are less than their rates for private-pay parents. Others said they charge parents in their community less than the Board's maximum rates, particularly for Texas Rising Star providers, and do not receive the full enhanced Texas Rising Star rate. Aside from payment rates, providers described barriers to provider participation, such as paperwork, billing complications, and loss of funds when parents do not pay the co- payment and transfer to another provider or do not return to care. Providers also Texas Page 138 of 380requested notice from Boards before terminating payments for care when providers are transferred or care is terminated. Based on feedback from the survey and other provider feedback opportunities, TWC recently instituted a new policy requiring Boards to implement a two-week waiting period for transfers in order to better align with industry standards. ( 40 TAC \u00a7809.13(10) ) TWC will explore additional opportunities to improve policies and procedures to reduce the barriers to provider participation in child care subsidies. 4.1.4 Certify by describing the Lead Agency's procedures for ensuring that parents have unlimited access to their children whenever their children are in the care of a provider who receives CCDF funds (658E(c)(2)(B); 98.16(t)). Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) CCR Minimum Standards require that during the hours of operation licensed facilities make all areas of the facility accessible to parents of children who are receiving care at the facility. ( 26 TAC \u00a7746.501(b) ) During the eligibility process, the child care contractor informs parents of their rights and responsibilities, including the right to: -visit child care facilities; -make telephone inquiries before enrolling; and -observe providers at any time after the child is enrolled. Child care contractors discuss parental concerns with the facility's director or owner to ensure that parental rights are respected. 4.1.5 The Lead Agency must allow for in-home care (i.e., care provided in the child's own home) but may limit its use (98.16(i)(2)). Will the Lead Agency limit the use of in-home care in any way? No. Yes. If checked, what limits will the Lead Agency set on the use of in-home care? Check all that apply. Texas Page 139 of 380a.

Restricted to in-home providers that meet additional health and safety requirements beyond those required by CCDF. Describe: Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.91(e)(1) requires in-home providers to list with CCR as a family home, undergo a criminal background check, and undergo a check against the sex offender registry and the central child abuse and neglect registry. g. Other. Describe: Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.91(e)(2) requires Boards to allow relative child care Texas Page 140 of 380providers to provide in-home child care only for the following: -A child with disabilities and his or her siblings -A child under 18 months of age and his or her siblings -A child of a teen parent -When the parent's work schedule requires evening, overnight, or weekend child care and taking the child outside of the child's home would be disruptive to the child A Board may allow relative in-home child care for circumstances in which the Board's child care contractor determines and documents that other child care provider arrangements are not available in the community. (40 TAC \u00a7809.91(e) ) 4.1.6 Child care services available through grants or contracts. a) In addition to offering certificates, does the Lead Agency provide child care services through grants or contracts for child care slots (658A(b)(1))? Note: Do not check 'yes' if every provider is simply required to sign an agreement to be paid in the certificate program. No. If no, skip to 4.1.7. Yes, in some jurisdictions but not statewide. If yes, describe how many jurisdictions use grants or contracts for child care slots. Texas Labor Code \u00a7302.0461 allows Boards to contract with child care providers for a specified number of slots to be reserved for children participating in child care subsidies. To qualify for a contract for reserved slots, providers must: -maintain a 3- or 4-Star Texas Rising Star provider rating; and -meet one of the following criteria: -be located in an area where the number of children younger than six years of age who have working parents is at least three times greater than the capacity of licensed child care providers in the area (a child care \"desert\") or another area determined to be underserved; -have a partnership; places reserved for high-quality infant/toddler care; or -satisfy a requirement for the Board's strategic plan. TWC issued the necessary policy changes and guidance on the processes and procedures for implementing contracted slots at the Board level in spring 2021. Texas Page 141 of 380Currently, all Boards have the option to contract with providers for slots if they meet the criteria listed above. While several Boards have expressed interest in and are in the initial stages of developing their programs, none have been fully implemented. TWC works with Boards to understand the effectiveness of contracted slot strategies as they are implemented and uses that information to inform future plans related to contracted slots. Boards will contract directly with eligible (3- or 4-Star) Texas Rising Star providers. Providers will receive the same reimbursement rates for contracted slots as they would for any other referral. Parents will continue to have the option to select any provider that participates in the subsidy program. In areas where providers have available contracted slots, parents may be offered the opportunity to enroll with a contracted provider but will not be required to do so. When a contracted slot becomes open, the Board will first contact families on the waiting list that requested care in that ZIP code in order of priority group, as described in Section 3.3. As Boards fill vacant reserved slots, they will follow the same rules for priority groups as they normally do, but the pool of eligible families will be restricted to those seeking services for the appropriate age group within the ZIP code where the contracted slot is available. On June 29, 2021 , TWC's three-member Commission authorized dedicating CRRSA/ARPA funding to support pilot programs for Boards who wish to implement contracted slots within Texas Rising Star 3- and 4-Star providers, as authorized in the Texas Labor Code \u00a7302.0461 . TWC will administer an application process on a first come first served basis for Boards to request funding to implement Texas Rising Star Contracted Slots. This pilot will provide Boards with the opportunity to create a new service delivery design, outside of the Board's regular annual allocation of child care funds. Yes, statewide.

Also describe the method of tracking progress to support equal access and parental choice (98.16(x). a. In child care centers. To determine shortages in the supply of high-quality providers, each Board uses information from The Workforce Information System of Texas (TWIST), CCR, and the Children's Learning Institute (CLI) along with local data on the number of high-quality child care centers and parents seeking care. Several Boards leverage geographic information systems to map the locations of providers and identify child care deserts. TWC and Boards also use data collected through the Texas Child CareAvailability Portal to analyze supply and demand. b. In child care homes. To determine shortages in the supply of high-quality providers, each Board uses information from TWIST, CCR, and CLI along with local data on the number of high- quality child care centers and parents seeking care.

Describe: 4.1.9 Lead Agencies must prioritize investments for increasing access to high-quality child care and development services for children of families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and do not currently have sufficient numbers of such programs (658 E(c)(2)(M); 98.16 (x);98.46(b)). a) How does the Lead Agency define areas with significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment? TWC analyzes the percentages of the population below 100 percent of federal poverty guidelines (FPG) and of children under 13 in families below 150 percent of FPG across each of the 28 workforce areas. TWC uses unemployment data collected by the agency's Unemployment Insurance Division to compare child poverty rates with unemployment rates and has found a correlation between child poverty and unemployment. b) Describe how the Lead Agency prioritizes increasing access to high-quality child care and development services for children of families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and that do not have high-quality programs TWC includes the percentage of the population below 100 percent of FPG and the percentage of children under 13 in families below 150 percent FPG as factors in determining funding allocations to each workforce area. Additionally, TWC provides funding to Boards to improve child care quality and increase access to Texas Rising Star-certified providers for low-income families. Boards prioritize these quality funds Texas Page 159 of 380based on the needs of the workforce area, including increasing the number of Texas Rising Star-certified providers in areas that have high concentrations of poverty and unemployment. Magnifying these efforts, Texas Government Code \u00a72308.317 requires Boards to prioritize quality child care funding initiatives that benefit child care facilities working toward Texas Rising Star certification or Texas Rising Star-certified providers working toward higher certification levels. 4.2 Assess Market Rates and Analyze the Cost of Child Care 4.2 Assess Market Rates and Analyze the Cost of Child Care Key principles of the CCDF are to: (1) provide equal access to childcare for children receiving childcare assistance; and (2) ensure parental choice by offering a full range of childcare services. Payment rates that are too low to support equal access undermine these principles. To establish subsidy payment rates that ensure equal access, Lead Agencies collect and analyze data through a number of tools. Lead Agencies have the option to conduct a statistically valid and reliable (1) market rate survey (MRS) reflecting variations in the price to parents of childcare services by geographic area, type of provider, and age of child or (2) an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, such as a cost estimation model (CEM) (658E(c)(4)(B)). A cost estimation model estimates the cost of care by incorporating both data and assumptions to judge what expected costs would be incurred by childcare providers and parents under different scenarios. Another approach would be a cost study that collects cost data at the facility or program level to measure the costs (or inputs used) to deliver childcare services (CCDF-ACF-PI-2018-01). Regardless of whether Lead Agencies conduct a MRS or an alternative methodology, they are required to analyze the cost of providing child services, known as the narrow cost analysis, that meet basic health/safety/quality and staffing requirements (base level care) (98.45(b)(3), (f)(1)(ii)(A), and (f)(2)(ii)), and higher-quality care at each level of quality, as defined by the Lead Agency (98.45(b)(4), (f)(1)(ii)(B), and (f)(2)(iii)). The analysis must identify the gaps between the cost of care and subsidy levels adopted by the state and then be considered as part of the rate setting process. Note: Any Lead Agency considering using an alternative methodology, instead of a MRS rate survey, is required to submit a description of its proposed approach to its ACF Regional Child Care Program Office for pre-approval in advance of the Plan submittal (see Texas Page 160 of 380https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/resource/ccdf-acf-pi-2016-08 ). Advance approval is not required if the Lead Agency plans to implement both a MRS and an alternative methodology. A MRS or an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology must be developed and conducted no earlier than 2 years before the date of submission of the Plan (658E(c)(4)(B)(i) (98.45 (c)). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Lead Agencies may request a waiver for up to one additional year (until July 1, 2022) to complete the required MRS or an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology. Lead Agencies may also request the required Narrow Cost Analysis be waived for one year (until July 1, 2022). These waiver requests must include a justification linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. 4.2.1 Completion of the MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology. Did the state/territory conduct a statistically valid and reliable MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology? Yes. If yes, please identify the methodology(ies) used below to assess child care prices and/or costs. a. MRS. When was your data gathered (provide a date range, for instance, September - December, 2019)?

Texas Page 161 of 380ii. ACF pre-approved alternative methodology. If checked, describe the status of the Lead Agency's implementation of the ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, including if applicable, the date of the ACF approval and a description of the methodology: b. If a waiver is requested, Lead Agencies will need to respond to questions 4.2.2- 4.5.2 based on data collected for the FY 2019-2021 CCDF Plan or any data collected since then. Identify the date of the Lead Agencies' most recent and complete Market Rate Survey or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology that will provide data to inform responses to questions 4.2.2 - 4.5.2. 4.2.2 Prior to developing and conducting the MRS, or conducting the ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, the Lead Agency is required to consult with (1) the State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body, local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral agencies, and other appropriate entities, and (2) organizations representing caregivers, teachers, and directors (98.45 (e)). Local child care program administrators may also be good informants to Lead Agencies on narrow cost analyses. Describe how the Lead Agency consulted with the: a) State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body: TWC previously solicited comments in 2016, when the MRS instrument was significantly modified, on the draft MRS implementation plan and survey questionnaires from Boards, CCR, the Texas Education Agency, the Children's Learning Institute, and multiple child care policy and advocacy groups. b) Local child care program administrators: TWC solicited comments on the draft MRS implementation plan and survey questionnaires from providers that serve subsidized children. c) Local child care resource and referral agencies: TWC solicited comments on the draft MRS implementation plan and survey questionnaires from Boards and contractors that provide child care resource and referral services. Texas Page 162 of 380 d) Organizations representing caregivers, teachers, and directors: TWC solicited comments on the draft MRS implementation plan and survey questionnaires from the Texas Licensed Child Care Association. e) Other. Describe: TWC previously solicited comments in 2016, when the MRS instrument was significantly modified, on the draft MRS implementation plan and survey questionnaires from Boards, CCR, the Texas Education Agency, the Children's Learning Institute, and multiple child care policy and advocacy groups. After the vendor submitted its MRS implementation plan, which included the MRS statistical methodology and process, TWC provided a copy of the plan process and the draft MRS survey questionnaire to the stakeholders listed above. Stakeholders had 30 days to review and comment. TWC reviewed the comments with the vendor and incorporated changes as appropriate. 4.2.3 ACF has established a set of benchmarks, largely based on research, to identify the components of a valid and reliable market rate survey (81 FR, p. 67509). To be considered valid and reliable a Market Rate Survey or preapproved alternative methodology meets the following: -represents the child care market -provides complete and current data -uses rigorous data collection procedures -reflects geographic variations -analyzes data in a manner that captures other relevant differences An MRS can use administrative data, such as child care resource and referral data, if it is representative of the market. a. Describe how each of the benchmarks are met in either the MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology. i. Represent the child care market: Click or tap here to enter text. Of the 3,926 eligible child care providers surveyed in 2020, 2,131 (54.3 percent) completed the survey. This overall response rate reflects the same pattern seen in Texas Page 163 of 380previous years in which homes have lower response rates than centers. The overall response rate for homes was 41.6 percent, and the overall response rate for centers was 64.8 percent, providing a large and statistically reliable sample size. ii. Provide complete and current data: Data Source and Sample Population TWC contracts with the Texas Institute for Child & Family Wellbeing (TXICFW) in partnership with the Ray Marshall Center for the Study of Human Resources (RMC) to conduct the Texas Child Care MRS. A month before the surveys begin, RMC obtains a list of all licensed centers and licensed and registered homes from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission's CCR to determine a target number of facilities to sample for statistically valid and stable rate estimates statewide and for each of the 28 local workforce development areas (workforce areas). The facility sample for the 2020 MRS was determined from a list of 14,529 facilities obtained from HHSC in September 2019. First, a statewide representative sample of 1,000 facilities was randomly selected from the list to provide greater statistical power for estimating statewide rates and trends and to increase the precision of rate estimates for the largest Boards, which provide the bulk of care in the state. In addition to the statewide sample, another sample of randomly selected facilities was used to estimate rates at the workforce area level. This sample includes the target number of each type of facility from each workforce area projected to yield 50 independent rate observations in full-time rate categories. Projections based on detailed response rates to the last three annual surveys indicated that, on average, 116 licensed child care centers (LCCCs), 23 licensed child care homes (LCCHs), and 92 registered child care homes (RCCHs) per workforce area were needed to reach this goal. These target numbers were then increased by between 5 percent and 21 percent for workforce area and facility type combinations that showed low response rates in recent surveys. The target number of facilities was then randomly selected from each workforce area, or, if fewer providers were available in any given combination of workforce area and facility type, the entire population was selected (a complete census). Texas Page 164 of 380 Implementation of this sampling scheme resulted in all facilities of any type being selected from 11 workforce areas. In addition to these 11, a complete census of LCCCs was necessary in four more workforce areas, a complete census of LCCHs was necessary in one more workforce area, and a complete census of RCCHs was necessary in 12 more workforce areas. Before the survey sample was finalized, a match was performed between the list of sampled facilities and a database indicating which facilities, whose published rates were already available through administrative records, were serving subsidized children. These partially subsidized facilities were randomly split into two groups, with one half being retained in the sample and the other half set aside to be excluded from further study. This sampling plan can be described as an under-sample of subsidized facilities, whose rate data is largely redundant with existing data sources, and a corresponding over-sample of nonsubsidized facilities, whose rates constitute the bulk of the paid market and are not otherwise available without surveying. Before final rates were estimated, data from the statewide sample was added to that from the local samples in their respective areas, as well as the published rate data, and weighting schemes were applied as appropriate. The number of rate observations collected by this design was more than adequate to provide stable rate estimates for all workforce areas, without needing to rely on rates from adjacent areas or any other kinds of estimates or approximations. Head Start facilities were excluded before the sample was drawn because they do not charge parents directly. During the interview, research staff members screened out facilities that did not represent the true price market for child care in Texas. These facilities include those that only offered drop-in care, part-day care with no after-school care, summer camps, care provided to specific populations only (such as children with special needs, children of teen moms, children of staff at a company), and free or family-discounted child care services. School and kindergarten programs that did not offer regular after- school care and Head Start programs were also excluded. Finally, facilities that had closed or no longer had children enrolled were determined to be ineligible. Texas Page 165 of 380 iii. Use rigorous data collection procedures: Survey and Rate Estimation Methodology Detailed training and supervision were provided to research staff members on survey methodology, interviewing protocols, data entry and collection, and tracking procedures by advanced graduate students and the project manager. Before interviews, the research team mailed introductory letters and/or sent emails to all facilities in the sample explaining the survey purpose, goals and objectives, confidentiality policies, and the voluntary nature of participation. Information was presented in both English and Spanish unless providers' surnames suggested they were of Vietnamese origin, in which case information was presented in both English and Vietnamese. A website was also constructed to present more information about the survey to providers. The research team added an incentive drawing, new to the 2020 study, for providers participating in the survey to increase overall response rates. Child care providers were notified in the initial email or letter that when they completed the survey, their facility would be entered into a weekly drawing for a $200 gift card. At the end of the month, winners would be selected and notified. Due to the disruption caused by COVID-19, it is difficult to determine to what extent this worked to enhance response rates. In order to prevent a delay in data collection, bilingual research staff members (seven English/Spanish and one English/Vietnamese) were hired to conduct interviews with centers and homes. Three additional research staff members were hired to conduct interviews with all multisite facilities (facilities with more than one location). Data collection began in October 2019 and was extended to July 2020 due to delays related to COVID-19. A seven-station call center at TXICFW operated Monday through Friday between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Research staff members maintained a tracking database containing basic provider information (facility name, workforce area, phone number, facility identification number) and call history (number of attempts, date and time of attempt, preferred calling Texas Page 166 of 380times, appointments, call results, final status). A minimum of two morning and two afternoon/evening calls were made to contact each provider. The research staff called at least one week apart unless an appointment or preferred calling time was established. In these cases, the staff made up to three additional attempts to complete the survey. A toll-free number was also available for providers to return missed calls, return messages, or ask questions about the survey. If research staff members were unable to complete the survey after all attempts had been made to reach a provider, the facility was marked as \"' and no more attempts to contact that facility were made. In cases where the phone number provided was disconnected or no longer in service, the research staff attempted to contact the facility three times at least one week apart. If the number was still not working and no additional information was available online, the staff determined the facility to be ineligible. In addition to the percentage of children enrolled who were receiving TWC- subsidized child care, the survey instrument asked providers for the following: Enrollment numbers and the daily rates charged for full-day (six hours or more) and part day (fewer than six hours) care for: and above) Information about: -hours of operation; -availability of care for children -additional charges (registration/activity fees) and transportation example, sectarian/nonsectarian, community-based, for-profit/nonprofit); and -national accreditation or Texas Rising Star (TRS) provider status Among survey data gathered, daily market rates for licensed centers were captured for all categories of care offered, regardless of whether any children were being served in such categories. The categories consisted of all possible combinations of age groups (gathered for actual age categories in which each center offered rates but aggregated to the four standard categories for reporting) by full-time status (part day or full day). Thus, one center could contribute as many as eight independent rate Texas Page 167 of 380observations, each representing any number of children (including zero). These rate observations were then weighted by the number of child care slots they represent when calculating market rate percentiles. In contrast, market rates for surveyed home-based facilities, including RCCH and LCCH, were gathered at the level of the individual child currently being served. Each child's age, detailed weekly schedule, and rates charged were gathered for purposes of calculating daily market rates. In this case, the individual children were treated as independent rate observations, and each facility could contribute as many as nine observations (or fewer depending on the facility type and number of children enrolled). Because of this, there was no need to differentially weight the rate observations when calculating the local market rate percentiles for surveyed home-based facilities: each child (or rate) started with a weight equal to one (but see weighting discussion below). When incorporating published rates from administrative records, it was necessary to calculate and adjust weights so that any estimation of rates, whether local or statewide, would reflect the typical balance of care provided by subsidized and non- subsidized facilities. Generally speaking, since so much more data on published rates are now available, weights for these rates need to be smaller to prevent their contribution to the rate market from being overstated. For the analysis of surveyed center rates, the number of child care slots for each rate category was determined in one of two ways. First, for categories of care in which children were currently being served, the number of children in each category served as a proxy for the number of slots. Second, rate categories in which no children were currently being served were also included in the analysis, since they were also theoretically part of the market. This was done by estimating the number of slots for each of these rate categories with a formula that multiplies the number of children served at each facility by the average proportion of children, across all licensed centers, served in each rate category. Thus, for example, a facility that served 100 children and had an existing part-day infant rate schedule, but did not currently serve any part-day infants, would have its number of slots for this category of care estimated at two (100 child capacity X 2 percent of children served in the part-day infant category across all licensed centers). If the same facility served no part-day preschoolers, its number of slots would be estimated at seven (100 child capacity X 7 Texas Page 168 of 380percent served in this category across all licensed centers). This method allows fuller use of the rate information gathered from surveyed centers, especially for rare forms of care in which rate observations are otherwise scarce. iv. Reflect geographic variations: Before final rates were estimated, data from the statewide sample was added to that from the local samples in their respective areas, as well as the published rate data, and weighting schemes were applied as appropriate. The number of rate observations collected by this design was more than adequate to provide stable rate estimates for all workforce areas, without needing to rely on rates from adjacent areas or any other kinds of estimates or approximations. v. Analyze data in a manner that captures other relevant differences: New supplemental Cost of Quality Analysis TWC has contracted with the Ray Marshall Center (RMC), LBJ School of Public Affairs, and the University of Texas at Austin to conduct a study of the cost of providing quality child care in the State of Texas. The purpose of the study is to provide estimates of the cost of providing higher-quality care under our Texas Rising Star program, relative to child care providers who are not Texas Rising Star-certified. The study is being conducted in conjunction with the Texas Institute for Child and Family Wellbeing (TICFW), who assisted with the design of the surveys to capture important quality factors and pricing information, and were responsible for fielding the surveys to carefully selected samples of home- and center-based child care facilities. This supplemental study was fielded together with the 2020 Market Rate Survey but results will be included in a separate final study report to be released in summer of 2021. b. Given the impact of COVID-19 on the child care market, do you think that the data you gathered (as indicated in 4.2.1) on the prices or costs of child care adequately reflect the child care market as you submit this plan? No Yes. If yes, why do you think the data represents the child care market? Yes, a large portion of the survey was completed prior to the onset of the COVID- Texas Page 169 of 38019 pandemic and survey timeframe was extended through July 2020 due to delays. 4.2.4 Describe how the market rate survey or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology reflects variations in the price or cost of child care services by: a) Geographic area (e.g., statewide or local markets). Describe: The MRS includes results by LWDA. The MRS providers are selected from a statewide list provided by CCR. In addition to a statewide sample, another sample of facilities is randomly selected to estimate rates at the LWDA level. This sample includes a target number of each type of facility from each LWDA projected to yield 35 independent rate observations in full-time rate categories. b) Type of provider. Describe: The MRS includes results by each of the three types of child care provider regulated by CCR and eligible to care for subsidized children: -Licensed child care centers -Licensed child care homes -Registered child care homes The applicable facilities for the MRS are developed from a CCR-provided statewide list of all licensed centers and licensed and registered homes in the state. However, some providers are excluded from the sample for a variety of reasons. Head Start facilities are excluded before the sample is drawn because they do not charge parents directly. Facilities whose only service is drop-in care are excluded at the time of the interview because they charge very high hourly rates and are not usually used by employed parents for regular care. Other types of facilities that are not included in the survey are listed homes, relative providers, kindergartens, summer camps, and nursery schools. c) Age of child. Describe: The MRS includes results by the following age groups: -Infants (0-17 months) -Toddlers (18-35 months) -Preschool-age children (36-71 months) -School-age children (72 months and above) Texas Page 170 of 380The MRS instrument asked providers for enrollment numbers and the daily rates charged for full-day (six hours or more) and part-day (fewer than six hours) care for each age group. d. Describe any other key variations examined by the market rate survey or ACF pre- approved alternative methodology, such as quality level. The survey asks providers if they have a Texas Rising Star quality designation or another national accreditation. However, the report does not disaggregate the results by Texas Rising Star or other quality designator. 4.2.5 Has the Narrow Cost Analysis been completed for the FY 2022 - 2024 CCDF Plan? No, a waiver is being requested in Appendix A. If no, describe the status of the Lead Agency's upcoming narrow cost analysis. Yes, the narrow cost analysis information is included in the report as described in 4.2.6. If yes, describe how the State/Territory analyzed the cost of child care through a narrow cost analysis for the FY 2022 - 2024 CCDF Plan, including: a. The methodology the Lead Agency used to conduct, obtain, and analyze data on the estimated cost of care (narrow cost analysis), including any relevant variation by geographic location, category of provider, or age of child (98.45 (f)(ii)). TWC has contracted with the Ray Marshall Center (RMC), LBJ School of Public Affairs, and the University of Texas at Austin to conduct a study of the cost of providing quality child care in the State of Texas. b. How the methodology addresses the cost of child care providers' implementation of health, safety, quality and staffing requirements (i.e. applicable licensing and regulatory requirements, health and safety standards, training and professional development standards, and appropriate child to staff ratio, groups size limits, and caregiver qualification requirements (98.45 (f)(ii)(A)). c. How the methodology addresses the cost of higher-quality care, as defined by the Lead Agency using a quality rating and improvement system or other system of quality indicators, at each level of quality (98.45 (f)(ii)(B)). Texas Page 171 of 380d. The gap between costs incurred by child care providers and the Lead Agency's payment rates based on findings from the narrow cost analysis. 4.2.6 After conducting the market rate survey or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, the Lead Agency must prepare a detailed report containing the results of the MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology. The detailed report must also include the Narrow Cost Analysis, as described in 4.2.5, which estimates the cost of care (including any relevant variation by geographic location, category of provider, or age of child) necessary to support (1) child care providers\u00e2 implementation of the health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements, and (2) higher quality care, as defined by the Lead Agency using a quality rating and improvement system or other system of quality indicators, at each level of quality. For states without a QRIS or for a state with a QRIS system that is currently limited to only certain providers, those states may use other quality indicators (e.g. provider status related to accreditation, PreK standards, Head Start performance standards, school-age quality standards, or state defined quality measures.) The Lead Agency must make the report with these results widely available no later than 30 days after completion of the report, including posting the results on the Lead Agency website. The Lead Agency must describe in the detailed report how the Lead Agency took into consideration the views and comments of the public or stakeholders. Describe how the Lead Agency made the results of the market rate survey or ACF pre- approved alternative methodology report widely available to the public (98.45(f)(1)) by responding to the questions below. a. Date the report containing results was made widely available - no later than 30 days after the completion of the report. September 25, 2020 b. Describe how the Lead Agency made the detailed report containing results widely available and provide the link where the report is posted. TWC provides links to all current and previous market rate surveys on its Child Care & Early Learning services webpage at: https://twc.texas.gov/programs/texas-child-care- market-rate-survey . Texas Page 172 of 380The direct link to the 2020 Market Rate Survey and Supplemental Report is https://txicfw.socialwork.utexas.edu/2020-texas-child-care-market-rate-survey/. c. Describe how the Lead Agency considered stakeholder views and comments in the detailed report. As TWC begins developing the narrow cost analysis, TWC will solicit feedback for that and the MRS in the form of focus groups, emails to stakeholders, and public webinars. 4.3 Establish Adequate Payment Rates The Lead Agency must set CCDF subsidy payment rates, in accordance with the results of the current MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, as identified in 4.2.1, at a level to ensure equal access for eligible families to child care services that are comparable with those provided to families not receiving CCDF assistance. Lead Agencies must also consider the costs of base and higher quality care at each level as part of its rate setting. The Lead Agency must re-evaluate its payment rates at least every 3 years. 4.3.1 Provide the base payment rates and percentiles (based on the most recent MRS as identified in 4.2.1) for the following categories below. 4.3.1 Provide the base payment rates and percentiles (based on the most recent MRS as identified in 4.2.1) for the following categories below. Lead Agencies are required to provide a summary of data and facts in their Plan to demonstrate how its payment rates ensure equal access. The preamble to the final rule (81 FR, p. 67512), indicates that a benchmark for adequate payment rates is the 75th percentile of the most recent MRS. The 75th percentile is the number separating the lowest 75 percent of rates from the highest 25 percent. Setting rates at the 75th percentile, while not a requirement, would ensure that eligible children have access to three out of four child care slots. The 75th percentile benchmark applies to the base rates. Base rates are the lowest, foundational rates before any differentials are added (e.g., for higher quality or other purposes). Further, base rates must be sufficient to ensure that minimum health and safety and staffing requirements are covered. Texas Page 173 of 380 Percentiles are not required if the Lead Agency conducted an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, but must be reported if the Lead Agency conducted a MRS. For states that conduct an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, report the base payment rates based on a full-time weekly rate. The ages and types of care listed below are meant to provide a snapshot of the categories on which rates can be based and are not intended to be comprehensive of all categories that might exist or to reflect the terms used by the Lead Agency for particular ages. If rates are not statewide, please use the most populous geographic region (defined as the area serving highest number of CCDF children) to report base payment rates below. a. Provide the base payment rates and percentiles based on either the statewide rates or the most populous area of the state (area serving highest number of children accessing CCDF). To facilitate compiling state by state payment rates, provide the full-time weekly base payment rates in the table below. If weekly payment rates are not published, then the Lead Agency will need to calculate its equivalent. i. Age of child in what type of licensed child care setting (All rates are full-time) - Infant (6 months) Center care: Base payment rate: $42.60 daily Full-time weekly base payment rate: $213.00 If the Lead Agency conducted an MRS, what is the percentile of the base payment rate? 60th If the Lead Agency used an alternative methodology what percent of the estimated cost of care is the base rate?

N/A b. If the Lead Agency does not publish weekly rates then how were these rates calculated (e.g., were daily rates multiplied by 5 or monthly rates divided by 4.3)? Weekly rates were calculated by multiplying daily rates by 5. Texas Page 176 of 380 c. Describe how the Lead Agency defines and calculates part-time and full-time care. Full-time care is from six to 12 hours of care and part-time is less than six hours of care. d. Provide the date these current payment rates became effective (i.e., date of last update based on most recent MRS as reported in 4.2.1). October 1, 2021 e. If applicable, identify the most populous area of the state (area serving highest number of children accessing CCDF) used to complete the responses above. Gulf Coast Workforce Development Area f. Provide the citation, or link, if available, to the payment rates https://www.twc.texas.gov/files/twc/commission_meeting_material_08.31.21_item11a_dp -bcy22_cc_%20minimum_%20rates.pdf g. If the payment rates are not set by the Lead Agency for the entire state/territory, describe how many jurisdictions set their own payment rates (98.16(i)(3)). As described in TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.20, based on local factors, including a market rate survey (MRS) provided by TWC, each of the 28 Local Workforce Development Boards (Boards) establishes maximum reimbursement rates for child care subsidies at or above a level established by TWC to ensure that the rates provide equal access to child care in the local market in a manner consistent with state and federal statutes and regulations governing child care.TWC requires Boards to set maximum reimbursement rates at no lower than the 50th-60th percentile (dependent on age group) of the Boards' workforce area) market rate according to the most recent MRS. 4.3.2 Describe how and on what factors the Lead Agency differentiates payment rates. Check all that apply. a. Geographic area. Describe: Each of the 28 Boards establishes reimbursement rates in their workforce areas ( \u00a7809.20(a)) based on the most recent MRS. Texas Page 177 of 380 b. Type of provider. Describe: Boards establish rates for the following: -Licensed Child Care Centers (LCCCs) -Licensed Child Care Homes (LCCHs) -Registered Child Care Homes (RCCHs) -Eligible relatives c. Age of child. Describe: Boards establish rates for the following: -Infants: Age 0 through 17 months; at 60th percentile of the most recent MRS -Toddlers: Age 18 through 35 months; at 55th percentile of the most recent MRS -Preschool-age children: Age 36 through 71 months; at 50th percentile of the most recent MRS -School-age children: Age: 72 months and older; at 50th percentile of the most recent MRS On May 18, 2021, Governor Abbott signed Senate Bill 1555 which requires TWC to align maximum reimbursement rates with the age groups reflected by HHSC CCR. The rates must provide the highest rates to providers caring for children in the age group with the lowest child-to-caregiver ratio. TWC will establish the new graduated reimbursement rates by December 1, 2023. d. Quality level. Describe: Boards establish enhanced reimbursement rates for Texas Rising Star providers for each provider type (except relatives) and age group. The minimum enhanced rate must be set at or above the following: -For infants, benchmarking to the 4-Star providers, the 75th percentile of the most recent Market Rate Survey -For 3-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 4-Star rate -For 2-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 3-Star rate Boards also have enhanced rates of at least 5 percent above the Board's regular rate for preschool-age children served at a Texas School Ready provider. Texas Page 178 of 380e. Other. Describe: Boards are required to ensure that providers that are reimbursed for additional staff members or equipment needed to assist in the care of a child with disabilities are paid a rate up to 190 percent of the provider's reimbursement rate for a child of the same age. The higher rate must take into consideration the estimated cost of the additional staff members or equipment needed by a child with disabilities. The Board must ensure that a professional, who is familiar with assessing the needs of children with disabilities, certifies the need for the higher reimbursement rate described in this subsection. 4.3.3 Lead Agencies can choose to establish tiered rates, differential rates, or add-ons on top of their base rates as a way to increase payment rates for targeted needs (i.e., a higher rate for special needs children as both an incentive for providers to serve children with special needs and as a way to cover the higher costs to the provider to provide care for special needs children). Lead Agencies may pay providers more than their private pay rates as an incentive or to cover costs for higher quality care (81 FR, p. 67514). Has the Lead Agency chosen to implement tiered reimbursement or differential rates? No. Yes. If yes, identify below any tiered or differential rates, and at a minimum, indicate the process and basis used for determining the tiered rates, including if the rates were based on the MRS or an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology. Check and describe all that apply. a. This option should not be selected if the answer above is \"Yes\" -- Tiered or differential rates are not implemented. Describe: b. Differential rate for non-traditional hours. Describe: Boards may define differential rates for nontraditional hours, based on the MRS and factors specific to the workforce area. TWC will conduct an analysis on the availability of Texas Page 179 of 380care across the state during nontraditional hours and will support Boards in increasing this type of care, if needed. c. Differential rate for children with special needs, as defined by the state/territory. Describe: TWC Child Care Services rules provide for an inclusion rate of up to 190 percent of the reimbursement rate. d. Differential rate for infants and toddlers. Note: Do not check if the Lead Agency has a different base rate for infants/toddlers with no separate bonus or add- on. Describe: TWC addresses the higher costs of infant and toddler care by establishing a higher minimum threshold for these groups, as follows: -60th percentile of the most recent MRS for infants; -55th percentile of the most recent MRS for toddlers; and -50th percentile of the most recent MRS for preschool and school-age children. Reimbursement rates for Texas Rising Star providers are also tiered by age group, as follows: -For infants, benchmarking to the 4-Star providers, the 75th percentile of the most recent Market Rate Survey -For 3-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 4-Star rate -For 2-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 3-Star rate e. Differential rate for school-age programs. Note: Do not check if the Lead Agency has a different base rate for school-age children with no separate bonus or add-on. Describe: f. Differential rate for higher quality, as defined by the state/territory. Describe: Texas Government Code \u00a72308.315 (as described in Section B-703 of the Child Care Services Guide ) requires that Boards reimburse Texas Rising Star-certified providers an increased rate above the rate reimbursed to non-Texas Rising Star providers. The percentage of the increase must be at least: -5 percent for a 2-Star provider; -7 percent for a 3-Star provider; and Texas Page 180 of 380-9 percent for a 4-Star provider. However, Boards reimburse at much higher rates than those minimums that are set forth in state statute. TWC requires that the minimum enhanced rate be set at or above the following: -For infants, benchmarking to the 4-Star providers, the 75th percentile of the most recent Market Rate Survey -For 3-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 4-Star rate -For 2-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 3-Star rate Additionally, TWC rules require that Boards reimburse providers participating in the Texas School Ready project at an increased rate for preschool-age children. The increased rate must be at least 5 percent greater than the Board's regular base rate. g. Other differential rates or tiered rates. Describe: 4.3.4 Establishment of adequate payment rates. a. Describe how base payment rates are adequate and enable providers to meet health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements under CCDF, and how they were established based on the most recent MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology and the Narrow Cost Analysis, as reported in 4.2.1 and 4.2.5.. In determining compliance with the Act for the equal access provisions in the FY2019-2021 CCDF Plan, the OCC reviewed all the states with payment rates below the 75th percentile benchmark. Of those states, the half with the lowest payment rates were considered non-compliant and placed on a corrective action plan (CAP). These states all had rates below the 25th percentile for either some or all categories of care. The 25th percentile is not to be viewed as a benchmark or a long-term solution to gauge equal access. It is also not to be viewed as sufficient for compliance in future plan cycles. OCC expects to continue to take action against states with the lowest rates in future plan cycles in an effort to keep payment rates moving upward toward ensuring equal access. Note: Per the preamble (81 FR p. 67512), in instances where an MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology indicates that prices or costs have increased, Lead Agencies must raise their rates as a result. Texas Page 181 of 380TWC annually sets minimum standards for provider rates according to the most recent market rate survey. The BCY'22 minimum thresholds for reimbursement rates are preschool and school-age children. -Reimbursement rates for Texas Rising Star providers are also set based on the most recent market rate survey: -For infants, benchmarking to the 4-Star providers, the 75th percentile of the most recent Market Rate Survey -For 3-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 4-Star rate -For 2-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 3-Star rate Boards have the ability to set a higher rate but have to follow the above minimum standards when setting maximum reimbursement rates. b) Describe how payment rates are adequate and have been established based on the most recent MRS or alternative methodology . Note: Per the preamble (81 FR 67512), in instances where a MRS or alternative methodology indicates that prices or costs have increased, Lead Agencies must raise their rates as a result. TWC uses the most recent MRS to set rates. During COVID-19, additional enhanced reimbursement rates (ERR) were paid to child care providers that continued to provide child care to subsidized referrals. An additional 25 percent was paid on the total monthly reimbursement for child care subsidies starting in April 2020 until March 2021. The ERR began to slowly decrease by 5 percent increments starting in April 2021 through July 2021. In August 2021, the ERR program was discontinued. 4.3.5 Describe how the Lead Agency took the cost of higher quality, as determined in 4.2.5, into account, including how payment rates for higher-quality care, as defined by the Lead Agency using a QRIS or other system of quality indicators, relate to the estimated cost of care at each level of quality. Note: For states without a QRIS, the states may use other quality indicators (e.g. provider status related to accreditation, PreK standards, Head Start performance standards, or state-defined quality measures). As described above, Texas Government Code \u00a72308.315 requires that Texas Rising Star-certified providers be reimbursed at the following percentages above the Board's non-Texas Rising Star rate for the same type of care: Texas Page 182 of 380-5 percent for a 2-Star provider -7 percent for a 3-Star provider -9 percent for a 4-Star provider However, TWC requires that the minimum enhanced rate must be set at or above the following: -For infants, benchmarking to the 4-Star providers, the 75th percentile of the most recent Market Rate Survey -For 3-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 4-Star rate -For 2-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 3-Star rate 4.3.6 Identify and describe any additional facts that the Lead Agency considered in determining its payment rates ensure equal access. If applicable, provide a description of how any additional health and safety costs, because of the COVID-19 pandemic are included in rate setting. In May 2020, the Commission authorized the use of CCDF CARES Act funding to support a temporary increase of 25 percent in child care provider reimbursement rates. That temporary measure was approved through December 2020. In January 2021, the Commission authorized the extension of that ERR of 25 percent through March 2021, which phased out by the end of July 2021, with reductions to 20 percent in April, 15 percent in May, 10 percent in June, and 5 percent in July. 4.4 Implement Generally Accepted Payment Practices and Ensure Timeliness of Payments 4.4 Implement Generally Accepted Payment Practices and Ensure Timeliness of Payments Lead Agencies are required to demonstrate that they have established payment practices applicable to all CCDF child care providers that include ensuring the timeliness of payments by either (1) paying prospectively prior to the delivery of services or (2) paying within no more than 21 calendar days of the receipt of a complete invoice for services. To the extent practicable, the Lead Agency must also support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by (1) paying based on a child's Texas Page 183 of 380enrollment rather than attendance, (2) providing full payment if a child attends at least 85 percent of the authorized time, (3) providing full payment if a child is absent for 5 or fewer days in a month, or (4) using an alternative approach for which the Lead Agency provides a justification in its Plan (658E(c)(2)(S)(ii); 98.45(l)(2)). Lead Agencies are required to use CCDF payment practices that reflect generally accepted payment practices of child care providers who serve children who do not receive CCDF-funded assistance. Unless a Lead Agency is able to demonstrate that the following policies are not generally accepted in its particular state, territory, or service area or among particular categories or types of providers, Lead Agencies must (1) pay providers based on established part-time or full-time rates rather than paying for hours of service or smaller increments of time and (2) pay for reasonable, mandatory registration fees that the provider charges to private- paying parents (658E(c)(2)(S); 98.45(l)(3)). Responses may also identify any additional health and safety fees providers are charging as a result of COVID-19. In addition, there are certain other generally accepted payment practices that are required. Lead Agencies are required to ensure that child care providers receive payment for any services in accordance with a payment agreement or an authorization for services, ensure that child care providers receive prompt notice of changes to a family's eligibility status that could impact payment, and establish timely appeal and resolution processes for any payment inaccuracies and disputes (98.45(l)(4) through (6); 658E(c)(2)(S)(ii); 98.45(l)(4); 98.45(l)(5); 98.45(l)(6)). 4.4.1 Certify by identifying and describing the payment practices below that the Lead Agency has implemented for all CCDF child care providers. a. Ensure the timeliness of payments by either (Lead Agency to implement at least one of the following): i. Paying prospectively prior to the delivery of services. Describe the policy or procedure. N/A ii. Paying within no more than 21 calendar days of the receipt of a complete invoice for services. Describe the policy or procedure. Local Workforce Development Boards (Boards) or Board child care contractors Texas Page 184 of 380reimburse all providers in their local workforce development area (workforce area) on a standard weekly, biweekly, or monthly schedule as determined by the Board. Payment to child care providers is based on the child care authorization that is in place for the child. b. To the extent practicable, support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by: (Note: The Lead Agency is to choose at least one of the following): i. Paying based on a child's enrollment rather than attendance. Describe the policy or procedure. TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.93 requires that a Board or its child care contractor reimburse a regulated provider based on a child's monthly enrollment authorization. Providers are reimbursed for the full authorization regardless of the child's attendance. ii. Providing full payment if a child attends at least 85 percent of the authorized time. Describe the policy or procedure. N/A iii. Providing full payment if a child is absent for five or fewer days in a month. Describe the policy or procedure. N/A iv. Use an alternative approach for which the Lead Agency provides a justification in its Plan. If chosen, please describe the policy or procedure and the Lead Agency's justification for this approach. N/A c. The Lead Agency's payment practices reflect generally accepted payment practices of child care providers who serve children who do not receive CCDF subsidies. These payment practices must include the following two practices unless the Lead Agency Texas Page 185 of 380provides evidence that such practices are not generally accepted in its state (658E(c)(2)(S); 98.45(l)(3)). i. Paying on a part-time or full-time basis (rather than paying for hours of service or smaller increments of time). Describe the policy or procedure and include a definition of the time increments (e.g., part time, full-time). TWC rules require payments be based on a child's enrollment authorization, which is categorized as full or part time (or blended for school-age children). Payments are based on that categorization and are not based on smaller increments. Full-time care is from six to 12 hours of care and part-time is fewer than six hours of care. ii. Paying for reasonable mandatory registration fees that the provider charges to private-paying parents. Describe the policy or procedure. TWC rules require that Boards ensure that a provider's published rate, used to calculate the maximum provider reimbursement, includes the provider enrollment, supply, and activity fees. TWC's Child Care Services Guide Section B-707.b describes the procedures that Boards must use to calculate providers' published rates: -The published daily rate is the sum of calculated daily rates and calculated daily fees. -Boards must ensure that child care contractors use the methodology outlined in B- 707.b to calculate providers' published rates and applicable fees upon renewal of provider agreements. -Daily fees include the following: -Enrollment and registration fees -Supply fees -Activity fees Additionally, Texas' annual Market Rate Survey (MRS) uses the same methodology to calculate market rates for child care services. As described in Section B-701 of TWC's Child Care Services Guide , Boards must establish maximum reimbursement rates based on local factors, including the MRS, to ensure that rates provide equal access to child care in the local market. The BCY'22 minimum thresholds for reimbursement rates are for infants; -55th 186 of 380-50th percentile for preschool and school-age children. Reimbursement rates for Texas Rising Star providers are also set based on the most recent market rate survey: -For infants, benchmarking to the 4-Star providers, the 75th percentile of the most recent Market Rate Survey -For 3-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 4-Star rate -For 2-Star providers, at 90 percent of the 3-Star rate d. The Lead Agency ensures that providers are paid in accordance with a written payment agreement or an authorization for services that includes, at a minimum, information regarding provider payment policies, including rates, schedules, any fees charged to providers, including fees related to COVID 19, and the dispute-resolution process. Describe: Boards establish contractual agreements with each provider receiving CCDF subsidies. These agreements detail payment policies, including rates, schedules, fees, and the dispute resolution process. e. The Lead Agency provides prompt notice to providers regarding any changes to the family's eligibility status that could impact payments, and such a notice is sent no later than the day that the Lead Agency becomes aware that such a change will occur. Describe: Details of each child's authorization, including the days of the week authorized and the beginning and end dates, are sent to the provider based on local Board procedures. Updates to the authorization, including any changes in the days authorized and end dates, are immediately conveyed to the provider as outlined in local Board procedures (for example, by phone or email). Additionally, beginning in 2021, TWC rule \u00a7809.13(c)(10) requires that Board policies regarding the transfer of a child from one provider to another include a waiting period of two weeks before the effective date of the transfer. This new rule, which allows for limited exceptions such as when a provider has been placed on corrective action with CCR, ensures that providers have notice prior to a subsidy child being unenrolled. f. The Lead Agency has a timely appeal and resolution process for payment inaccuracies and disputes. Describe: As mentioned previously, Boards or Board child care contractors reimburse providers on Texas Page 187 of 380a weekly, biweekly, or monthly schedule. Upon receipt of the payment, providers may contact Boards or Board contractors regarding any payment inaccuracy at any time, and Boards are able to resolve any discrepancy through direct payment adjustments to the provider. g. Other. Describe: N/A 4.4.2 Do payment practices vary across regions, counties, and/or geographic areas? No, the practices do not vary across areas. Yes, the practices vary across areas. Describe: Each Board has an agreement for each provider that provides subsidized child care. All Boards follow the practices of verifying services were received, paying based on enrollment authorization, and paying after services are received. Procedural differences exist across Boards, including the frequency with which Boards reimburse providers, and this varies by Board workforce area. 4.4.3 Describe how Lead Agencies' payment practices described in subsection 4.4 support equal access to a full range of providers. TWC Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.91 outlines the requirements to be a child care provider and \u00a7809.93 outlines provider reimbursement. Additionally, parents have parental choice and the ability to choose any provider that has entered into an agreement to provide subsidized child care. Texas Page 188 of 380 4.5 Establish Affordable Co-Payments Family co-payments are addressed in Section 3 related to minimum 12-month eligibility and the graduated phase-out provision and also in this subsection, because they are an important element for determining equal access. If a Lead Agency allows providers to charge amounts more than the required family co-payments, the Lead Agency must provide a rationale for this practice, including how charging such additional amounts will not negatively impact a family's ability to receive care they might otherwise receive, taking into consideration a family's co- payment and the provider's payment rate. 4.5.1 How will the Lead Agency ensure that the family contribution/co-payment, based on a sliding-fee scale, is affordable and is not a barrier to families receiving CCDF services (98.16 (k))? Check all that apply a. Limit the maximum co-payment per family. Describe: . N/A b. Limit the combined amount of co-payment for all children to a percentage of family income. List the percentage of the co-payment limit and N/A c. Minimize the abrupt termination of assistance before a family can afford the full cost of care ('the cliff effect') as part of the graduated phase-out of assistance discussed in 3.2.5. TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.41(e) states that Boards establishing initial family income eligibility at less than 85 percent state median income must ensure that the family remains income-eligible for care after passing the Board's initial income eligibility limit. d. Other. Describe: Parent share of cost amounts are set by each Board and are based on local factors. Texas Page 189 of 380 TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.19 outlines that the parent share of cost is determined by a sliding scale based on family size and gross monthly income. It also requires Boards to examine the sliding scale if there are frequent terminations for lack of payment of the parent share of cost. Additionally, \u00a7809.19(d) states that prior to termination of child care for nonpayment of parent share of cost, an evaluation is required of each family's financial situation for extenuating circumstances that may affect the affordability of the parent share of cost, and a temporary reduction may apply. TWC is analyzing parent share of cost and will consider the development of a statewide policy that all Boards will follow to set their local parent share of cost amount. TWC intends to establish a statewide policy to support a more consistent approach to the amounts that families are required to pay. 4.5.2. Does the Lead Agency choose the option to allow providers to charge families additional amounts above the required co-payment in instances where the provider's price exceeds the subsidy payment (98.45(b)(5))? No Yes. If yes: i. Provide the rationale for the Lead Agency's policy to allow providers to charge families additional amounts above the required co-payment, including a demonstration of how the policy promotes affordability and access for families. TWC Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.13(c)(11) states that Boards must develop a policy relating to providers charging the difference between their published rate and the Board's reimbursement rate. This policy is decided upon at the local level and is based on the needs of the local workforce development area in regard to child care provider capacity. Allowing Boards to make this decision locally allows more parental choice and access for families regarding child care options. Texas Page 190 of 380ii. Provide data (including data on the size and frequency of such amounts) on the extent to which CCDF providers charge additional amounts to families. Out of the 28 Boards, 7 Boards have opted to allow providers to charge the difference between their published rate and the reimbursement rate to families. TWC will work with these Boards to understand the size and frequency of those amounts: - Texoma - Brazos Valley - Deep East - Heart of Texas - Central Texas - Alamo - Permian Basin iii. Describe the Lead Agency's analysis of the interaction between the additional amounts charged to families with the required family co-payment, and the ability of current subsidy payment rates to provide access to care without additional fees. TWC is analyzing the parent share of costs across Boards as a percentage of family income. As part of this analysis, TWC will pay particular attention to the 7 Boards that allow providers to charge the difference. TWC will use the findings to inform any actions in order to better support parental choice and equal access. 5 Establish Standards and Monitoring Processes to Ensure the Health and Safety of Child Care Settings Lead Agencies are required to certify that there are in effect licensing requirements applicable to all child care services in the state/territory, which supports the health and safety of all children in child care. States and territories may allow licensing exemptions. Lead Agencies must describe how such licensing exemptions do not endanger the health, safety, and development of CCDF children in license-exempt care (98.16 (u)). Lead Agencies also must certify that there are in effect health and safety standards and training Texas Page 191 of 380requirements applicable to providers serving CCDF children whether they are licensed or license-exempt. These health and safety requirements must be appropriate to the provider setting and age of the children served, must include specific topics and training on those topics, and are subject to monitoring and enforcement procedures. The organization of this section begins with a description of the licensing system for all child care providers in a state or territory and then moves to focus specifically on CCDF providers who may be licensed, or those exempt from licensing. The next section addresses child-staff ratios, group size limits, and required qualifications for caregivers, teachers, and directors (98.16(m)) serving CCDF children. The section then covers the health and safety requirements; standards, training, and monitoring and enforcement procedures to ensure that CCDF child care providers comply with licensing and health and safety requirements (98.16(n)). Finally, Lead Agencies are asked to describe any exemptions for relative providers (98.16(l)). In some cases, CCDF health and safety requirements may be integrated within the licensing system for licensed providers and may be separate for CCDF providers who are license-exempt. In either case, Lead Agencies are expected to identify and describe health and safety requirements for all providers receiving CCDF. Note: When responding to questions in this section, the OCC recognizes that each state/territory identifies and defines its own categories of care. The OCC does not expect states/territories to change their definitions to fit the CCDF-defined categories of care. For these questions, provide responses that closely match the CCDF categories of care. Criminal background check requirements are included in this section (98.16(o)). It is important to note that these requirements apply to all child care staff members who are licensed, regulated, or registered under state/territory law and all other providers eligible to deliver CCDF services. Note: When asked for citations, responses can include state statute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals or policy issuances. See the Introduction on page 4 for more detail. 5.1 Licensing Requirements Each state/territory must certify it has in effect licensing requirements applicable to all child care services provided within the state/territory (not restricted to providers receiving CCDF funds) and provide a detailed description of these requirements and how the requirements are Texas Page 192 of 380effectively enforced (658E(c)(2)(F)). If any types of providers are exempt from licensing requirements, the state/territory must describe those exemptions and describe how these exemptions do not endanger the health, safety, or development of children. The descriptions must also include any exemptions based on provider category, type, or setting; length of day; and providers not subject to licensing because the number of children served falls below a Lead Agency-defined threshold and any other exemption to licensing requirements (658E(c)(2)(F); 98.16(u); 98.40(a)(2)(iv)). 5.1.1 To certify, describe the licensing requirements applicable to child care services provided within the state/territory by identifying the providers in your state/territory that are subject to licensing using the CCDF categories listed below? Check, identify, and describe all that apply, and provide a citation to the licensing rule. a. Center-based child care. i.

Describe and provide the citation: i. Identify the providers subject to licensing: Licensed Child Care Homes and Registered Child Care Homes ii. Describe the licensing requirements: Licensed Child Care Home is a licensed operation that provides care in the caregiver's own residence for children from birth through age 13 for less than 24 hours per day, but at least two hours per day, three or more days a week. The total number of children in care varies with the ages of the children in care at any given time, including the children related to the caregiver, and must not exceed 12. Registered Child Care Home is a registered operation in which the primary caregiver provides regular care in the caregiver's own residence for not more than six children from birth through age 13 and may provide care after school hours for not more than six additional elementary school children. The total number of children in care at any given time, including the children related to the caregiver, must not exceed 12. Regular care is defined as care that is provided for at least four hours per day, three or more days a week, for three or more consecutive weeks, or four hours a day for 40 or more days in a 12-month period. Listed Family Home is a listing of a caregiver who is at least age 18 and who provides care in his or her own home for compensation, for three or fewer children unrelated to the caregiver, from birth through age 13, for at least four hours a day, three or more days a week, for three or more consecutive weeks, or four hours a day for 40 or more days in a 12-month period. The total number of children in care, including the children related to the caregiver, may not exceed 12. The caregiver must be listed as a relative-only listed home (care is provided only for children related to the provider in the provider's own home) to be eligible for CCDF. iii.

Describe the exemptions based on length of day, threshold on the number of children in care, ages of children in care, or any other factors applicable to the exemption: Texas Page 195 of 380Programs exempt from regulation by Licensing fall into four categories: 1.Certain programs and facilities regulated by other government entities; 2.Programs of limited duration 3.Educational facilities and programs; and 4.Miscellaneous programs Child care programs operating on federal installations, including military bases and Indian reservations, are exempt. Youth camps that are licensed by the Department of State Health Services are not regulated by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). Municipal programs run by the municipality are exempt if the governing body annually adopts standards of care by ordinance that includes requirements for child-caregiver ratios; minimum employee qualifications; minimum building, health, and safety standards; and mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing the adopted standards. A municipal program must also provide the standards to parents, inform parents that the program is not licensed by the state, and ensure that the program does not advertise itself as a child care program. Programs of limited duration include those with parents on the premises and operate in association with shopping centers, businesses, and places offering other activities such as retreats or classes for religious instruction. A child may be in care for up to only four-and-one-half hours per day and up to 12 hours per week, or for up to 15 hours per week if care is provided so that a parent may attend a class provided by a nonprofit entity. Short-term programs operate for less than three consecutive weeks and less than 40 days in a 12-month period and are not subject to regulation. These include religious programs lasting two weeks or less and foreign exchange or sponsorship programs offering a living arrangement in a caretaker's home. Educational facilities that serve children in grades pre-K and above, including educational facilities accredited by the Texas Education Agency (TEA), the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), or the Texas Private School Accreditation Commission (TEPSAC); educational facilities that are members of an organization requiring compliance with standards and that do not provide care for more than one hour before and one hour after the customary school day in the Texas Page 196 of 380community; and private educational facilities that do not provide more than two total hours of care before or after the customary school day in the community are all exempt. Before- and/or after-school care centers that are operated by an accredited educational facility and that offer care for children in grades pre-K and above are exempt. Before- and/or after-school care centers that are operated by a contracted entity and offer care for children in grades pre-K and above are exempt if an accredited educational facility contracts with the entity and the accredited educational facility approves the curriculum content of the program. Miscellaneous programs include skills programs that offer direct instruction, food distribution programs, and programs offering emergency shelter for minors. Neighborhood nonprofit programs that provide activities designed for recreational purposes for children ages 5-13 if the program does not accept compensation; has a governing body that adopts standards of care, including ratios, training, background checks, health and safety checks, and mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing standards and receiving and resolving complaints from parents of the enrolled children; and other requirements as required by rule are exempt. ii.

N/A Texas Page 198 of 380 5.2 Standards for Ratios, Group Size and Qualifications for CCDF Providers Lead Agencies are required to have child care standards for providers receiving CCDF funds, appropriate to the type of child care setting involved, that address appropriate ratios between the number of children and number of providers in terms of the age of the children, group size limits for specific age populations, and the required qualifications for providers (658E(c)(2)(H); 98.41(d); 98.16(m)). For ease of responding, this section is organized by CCDF categories of care, licensing status, and age categories. Respondents should map their Lead Agency categories of care to the CCDF categories. Exemptions for relative providers will be addressed in subsection 5.6. 5.2.1 Describe how the state/territory defines the following age classifications. For instance, Infant: 0-18 months. a. Infant. Describe: Birth-17 months b. Toddler. Describe: 18-35 months c. Preschool. Describe: A child who is three or four years of age before the beginning of the current school year. d. School-Age. Describe: A child who is five years of age and older and is enrolled in or has completed kindergarten. School-age and before- or after-school programs follow the same ratio and group sizes as licensed centers; however, they only care for children who attend prekindergarten through grade six. Texas Page 199 of 380 5.2.2 To demonstrate continued compliance, provide the ratio and group size for settings and age groups below. a) Licensed CCDF center-based care i. Infant A. Ratio: 1:4 10 for 0-11 months; 13 for 12-17 months ii. A. Ratio: 1:9 for 18-23 months; 1:11 for 24-35 months size: 18 for 18-23 months; 22 for 24-35 months iii. Preschool A. Ratio: 1:15 for 3 years; 1:18 for 4 years B. Group size: 30 for 3 years; 35 for 4 years iv. School-age A. Ratio: 1:22 for 5 years; 1:26 for 6-13 years Texas Page 200 of 380B. Group size: 35 for 5-13 years v. Mixed-Age Groups (if applicable) A. Ratio: The child/caregiver ratio is the maximum number of children one caregiver can be responsible for. Each child must have a caregiver who is responsible for the child and who is aware of details of the child's habits, interests, and any special problems. Ratios for mixed-age groups are determined by the specified age of the children in the caregiver's group or the age of the youngest child in the group, depending on the activity and the number of children at the child care center. The specified age is determined as follows: 1) List each child by age from youngest to oldest; 2) Determine the core number by dividing the total number of children by 2 and round up any non-whole number; 3) Starting from the first or youngest child on the list, count down until reaching the core number; 4) The age of the child on the list that corresponds with the core number is the specified age of the group. This age dictates the applicable ratio as described above. This age dictates the applicable ratio as described above. B. Group size: This specified age of the children in the group determines the maximum group size and the number of children two or more caregivers may supervise. vi. If any of the responses above are different for exempt child care centers, describe the ratio and group size requirements for license-exempt providers. N/A 5.2.2 To demonstrate continued compliance, provide the ratio and group size for settings and age groups below. Texas Page 201 of 380 b. Licensed CCDF family child care home providers: i. Mixed Groups A. Ratio: The child/caregiver ratio is the maximum number of children one caregiver may be responsible for. (1) The total number of children a caregiver may supervise is determined by the ages of the children in the child care home. (2) When determining the child-caregiver ratio, the provider may use the developmental or emotional age, rather than the chronological age, of a child with special care needs, if this is recommended by a health care professional or a qualified professional and is documented in the child's record. (3) All children present, including children related to the provider, assistant, and substitute caregiver's children, and drop-in and part-time children must be counted in the child/caregiver ratio, by age of the child, regardless of the length of time they are present. (4) The provider must also count neighborhood children visiting the child care home, if the provider is responsible for their care and supervision in the absence of the parent. (5) In a registered child care home, a child who is at least four years of age and attending a prekindergarten program during the customary school day is counted in the same way children five years old and older who are in after-school care are counted. The prekindergarten program must be operated by or in collaboration with the local school district. Listed family homes may only care for up to three unrelated children, with no restrictions on ratio/group size. B. Group size: The group size varies depending on the total number of children, the ages of the children, and the number of caregivers in the home. ii. Infant A.

Lead Agencies are required to have minimum pre-service or orientation training requirements (to be completed within 3 months), as appropriate to the provider setting and the age of children served. This training must address the required health and safety topics (658E(c)(2)(l)(i) and the content area of child development. Lead Agencies have flexibility in determining the number of training hours to require, and they may consult with Caring for our Children Basics for best practices and the recommended time needed to address these training requirements. Lead Agencies must also have ongoing training requirements for caregivers, teachers, and directors who are caring for children receiving CCDF funds (658E(c)(2)(I)(i); 98.44(b)(1)(iii)). Lead Agencies are to report the total number of ongoing training hours that are required each year, but they do not have to report these hours out by topic (658E(c)(2)(G)(iii). Ongoing training requirements will be addressed in 5.3.13. Both preservice/orientation and ongoing trainings should be a part of a broader systematic Texas Page 213 of 380approach and progression of professional development (as described in section 6) within a state/territory. States and territories must have health and safety standards for programs (e.g., child care centers, family child care homes, etc.) serving children receiving CCDF assistance relating to the required health and safety topics as appropriate to the provider setting and age of the children served (98.41(a)). This requirement is applicable to all child care programs receiving CCDF funds regardless of licensing status (i.e., licensed or license-exempt). The only exception to this requirement is for relative providers, as defined in 98.2. Lead Agencies have the option of exempting relatives from some or all CCDF health and safety requirements (98.42(c)). Exemptions for relative providers' standards and training requirements will be addressed in question 5.6.3. To certify, describe the following health and safety requirements for programs serving children receiving CCDF assistance on the following topics (98.16(l)) identified in questions 5.3.1 - 5.3.12.

Vaccine-preventable diseases for employees must also be addressed in policy, unless the operation is in the home of the permit holder, the director, or a caregiver. Providers must adhere to the local health authority's requirements regarding tuberculosis testing for children and employees. Employees and children must wash hands throughout the day at specific times, including after diapering and toileting. Multiple standards require sanitation of the class environment to prevent and control Texas Page 214 of 380infectious disease. Pre-service and annual training hours for licensed and registered child care centers and school-age, before and after school programs must include instruction on immunizations and preventing and controlling the spread of communicable diseases. For home providers, orientation and annual training hours must include such training, and the primary caregiver must complete such training as part of the requirements of a primary caregiver. ii. Describe any variations in the standard(s) by category of care (i.e. Center, FCC, In- home), licensing status (i.e. licensed, license-exempt), and the age of the children in care. Standards for licensed and registered child care centers and school-age, before and after school programs require health and safety protocols and training on immunizations and preventing and controlling the spread of communicable diseases. Standards for listed family homes were adopted in March 2021. The standards establish basic health and safety guidelines for these providers.

The Lead Agency must have policies and practices that require licensing inspectors (or qualified monitors designated by the Lead Agency) to perform an annual monitoring visit of each license- exempt CCDF provider for compliance with health, safety, and fire standards (658E(c)(2)(K)(i)(IV); 98.42(b)(2)(ii)). Inspections for relative providers will be addressed in question 5.6.4. At a minimum, the health and safety requirements to be inspected must address the standards listed in subsection 5.3 (98.41(a)). To certify, describe the policies and practices for the annual monitoring of: a.

Lead Agencies have the option to develop alternate monitoring requirements for care provided Texas Page 258 of 380in the child's home that are appropriate to the setting. A child's home may not meet the same standards as other child care facilities and this provision gives Lead Agencies flexibility in conducting more streamlined and targeted on-site inspections. For example, Lead Agencies may choose to monitor in-home providers on basic health and safety requirements such as training and background checks. Lead Agencies could choose to focus on health and safety risks that pose imminent danger to children in care. This flexibility cannot be used to bypass the monitoring requirement altogether. States should develop procedures for notifying parents of monitoring protocols and consider whether it would be appropriate to obtain parental permission prior to entering the home for inspection (98.42(b)(2)(iv)(B)). a. To certify, describe the policies and practices for the annual monitoring of license- exempt in-home care, including if monitoring is announced or unannounced, occurs more frequently than once per year, and if differential monitoring procedures are used.

To certify, describe how inspectors and monitors have received training on health and safety requirements that are appropriate to the age of the children in care and the type of provider setting (98.42(b)(1-2)). The training program involves classroom, individual, and experiential learning activities designed to ensure that inspectors learn how to regulate for the health and safety requirements outlined in state law, rules, and agency policy. c. Provide the citation(s) for this policy or procedure. Child Care Regulation Professional Development Division Handbook. 4000 Required CCR Classes 5.4.6 The states and territories shall have policies and practices that require the ratio of licensing inspectors to child care providers and facilities in the state/territory to be maintained at a level sufficient to enable the state/territory to conduct effective inspections of child care providers and facilities on a timely basis in accordance with federal, state, and local laws (658E(c)(2)(K)(i)(III); 98.42(b)(3)). a. To certify, describe the state/territory policies and practices regarding the ratio of licensing inspectors to child care providers (i.e. number of inspectors per number of child care providers) and facilities in the state/territory and include how the ratio is sufficient to conduct effective inspections on a timely basis. CCR has created a weighted points system (WPS) to assist with caseload management. Caseloads are based on the WPS that has been designed to take into consideration the following factors: -Numbers and type of child care operations -Investigations (forecasted) -Applications (forecasted) -All other inspections CCR derives forecasting formulas by using a weighted moving average model that is based on 10 years of historical data. CCR then uses the state's average time at inspections to determine the \"weight\" assigned to each factor to calculate the points correlated to a specific child care operation. CCR assigns each county points and Texas Page 260 of 380workloads with a targeted set of points per inspector. CCR reassess the data at least every other year to determine whether positions need to be relocated to other areas in the state to address statewide fluctuation in child care operations. b. Provide the policy citation and state/territory ratio of licensing inspectors. CCR provides monthly updates to the Texas Legislative Budget Board to identify current caseloads for the CCR inspector workforce. The legislature uses this information to assess whether CCR inspectors are meeting current performance measures with the allocated positions. 5.5 Comprehensive Background Checks The CCDBG Act requires states and territories to have in effect requirements, policies and procedures to conduct comprehensive background checks for all child care staff members (including prospective staff members) of all child care programs that are 1) licensed, regulated, or registered under state/territory law; or, 2) all other providers eligible to deliver CCDF services (e.g., license-exempt CCDF eligible providers) (98.43(a)(1)(i)). Background check requirements apply to any staff member who is employed by a child care provider for compensation, including contract employees and self-employed individuals; whose activities involve the care or supervision of children; or who has unsupervised access to children (98.43(2)). For family child care homes, this requirement includes the caregiver and any other adults residing in the family child care home who are age 18 or older (98.43(2)(ii)(C)). This requirement does not apply to individuals who are related to all children for whom child care services are provided (98.43(2)(B)(ii)). Exemptions for relative providers will be addressed in 5.6.5. A comprehensive background check must include eight (8) separate and specific components (98.43(2)(b)), which encompass three (3) in-state checks, two (2) national checks, and three (3) interstate checks (if the individual resided in another state in the preceding 5 years). 5.5.1 Background Check Requirements. In the table below, certify by checking that the state has policies, and is conducting checks for the required background check components, ensuring that these requirements are in place for all licensed, regulated, or registered child care providers and for all other providers eligible to deliver CCDF services (e.g., license-exempt CCDF eligible providers), in accordance with 98.43(a)(1)(i), Texas Page 261 of 38098.43(a)(2) and 98.16(o). a.

Child care providers are required to submit requests for background checks for each of their staff members to the appropriate state or territorial agency, which is to be defined clearly on the state or territory Web site. Family child care home providers must also submit background check requests for all household members over the age of 18. The requests must be submitted prior to when the individual becomes a staff member and must be completed at least once every five years per \u00c2\u00a7 98.43(d)(1) and (2). The state or territory must ensure that its policies and procedures under this section, including the process by which a child care provider or other state or territory may submit a background check request, are published on the web site of the state or territory as described in \u00c2\u00a7 98.43(g) and the web site of local lead agencies. a. Describe the state/territory procedure(s) for a provider to request the required background checks. If the process is different based on provider type, please include that in this description. If the process is different based on each background check component, please include that in this description. All background check types are submitted the same way, and there is not a separate process for providers or the state agency to submit background check requests. Most regulated providers are required to use the online CCR account to submit and manage background checks. Once the provider has submitted the background check request through the online account, the background check data is transferred to the background check processing application, where CCR's Centralized Background Check Unit (CBCU) processes the background check. The system is designed to determine which background check types are required based on the following: -Operation type -Role of background check subject -Supervised or unsupervised with children -If the subject has lived in another US state or territory in the past five years There are three provider types that are not required to use the online CCR account to submit background checks: listed family homes, employer-based child care operations, Texas Page 266 of 380and shelter care operations. These providers may submit a paper or electronic background check request to CBCU staff for manually entering the request. If other provider types have difficulty with their online accounts, the provider can also submit a paper or electronic form for CBCU to submit the background check while the provider is working on gaining access to the provider's account. b. The state/territory must ensure that fees charged for completing the background checks do not exceed the actual cost of processing and administration, regardless of whether they are conducted by the state/territory or a third-party vendor or contractor. What are the fees and how do you ensure that these fees do not exceed the actual cost of processing and administering the background checks? Lead Agencies can report that no fees are charged if applicable (98.43(f)). Child care providers and child care staff members are required to pay a $2 per person fee to HHSC when submitting a request for a background check. This fee is used to offset the cost of the name-based background check requirements but does not fully cover the actual HHSC labor costs of processing and administering the background check program. This fee goes to the Texas General Revenue Fund. c. Describe the state/territory policy(ies) related to prospective staff members working on a provisional basis. Pending completion of all background check components in 98.43(b), the prospective staff member must be supervised at all times by an individual who received a qualifying result on a background check described in 98.43(b) within the past 5 years (98.43(c)(4)) and the prospective staff member must have completed and received satisfactory results on either the FBI fingerprint check or a fingerprint check of the state/territory criminal registry or repository in the state where the prospective staff member resides. Describe and include a citation for the Lead Agency\u00e2s policy: Citation: 26 TAC Chapter 745 \u00a7\u00a7745.631, 745.637, and 745.647. The Texas Central Registry Check and either the Texas Name-Based Criminal History Check or Fingerprint- Based National Criminal History Check must be completed prior to the background check subject is allowed to be in a provisional status. The conditions on the background check subject's presence when in a provisional status are listed below: (1) The individual must never be left in charge of the operation. (2) The individual must never be left alone with a child or group of children in the care of or enrolled in the operation, including during transportation. (3) The individual may only be supervised by a person with no conditions regarding his or Texas Page 267 of 380her presence at the operation. (4) The individual must never be allowed to transport children in the care of or enrolled in the operation during hours of operation. (5) The individual must never be responsible for financial transactions at the operation. (6) The individual must never be allowed to administer medication to children in the care of the operation, except for in a medical emergency to prevent the death or serious bodily injury of a child. (7) The individual must never be allowed to supervise caregivers, volunteers, or employees who have access to children. A background check subject will remain in provisional status until all background check types have an eligibility status. The circumstances in which a background check subject will be in a provisional status are listed below: (1) While the subject's out-of-state criminal history check or out-of-state child abuse or neglect registry check is pending, if applicable, and CBCU has not received information that renders the subject ineligible to be present at an operation (2) Pending the outcome of a risk evaluation for an eligible criminal conviction, child abuse and neglect finding, or crime for which the subject has been arrested or charged (3) For an approved risk evaluation (4) For a minimum standard violation that is relevant to a condition or restriction already placed on a subject's presence at an operation d. Describe the procedure for providers to request background checks for staff members that resided in another state within the previous 5 years. All background check types are submitted the same way, and there is not a separate process for providers or the state agency to submit background check requests. Most regulated providers are required to use the online CCR account to submit and manage background checks. The system is designed to determine which background check types are required based on the following: -Operation type -Role of background check subject -Supervised or unsupervised with children -If the subject has lived in another US state or territory in the past five years If the background check data that is submitted indicates that the background check subject has lived in another state or territory in the past five years, the system will require Texas Page 268 of 380those out-of-state background checks. Different processes are required to obtain results for the background checks from other states and territories. Every state and territory has a different process to request and receive its background check results and the background check subject, the provider, or CBCU will initiate the request, depending on the requirements of the state or territory. e. Describe the procedure to ensure each staff member completes all components of the background check process at least once during each 5-year period. If your state enrolls child care staff members in the FBI Rap Back Program or a state-based rap back program, please include that in this description. Note: An FBI Rap Back program only covers the FBI Fingerprint component of the background check. If child care staff members are enrolled in a state-based rap back, please indicate which background check components are covered by this service. The online account system notifies a provider when a background check is due for the five-year (or two-year) renewal by: 1) sending an email notification, and 2) displaying a message on the message board in the online account, explaining that the background check subject is due for a renewal check within the next 30 days. Any individual who has fingerprints processed for his or her criminal history check is enrolled in the national Rap Back service, which will provide new arrest history in Texas and other states and territories, as long as the arresting agency reports that history to the FBI and the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) (depending on the state of arrest). All fingerprints processed on or after June 1, 2015, are enrolled in the national Rap Back service. Any background check subject whose last set of fingerprints was submitted before June 1, 2015, cannot be enrolled in the national Rap Back service and will be required to submit new fingerprints at the time of the subject's next background check renewal in order to be enrolled in the national Rap Back service. For individuals whose fingerprints cannot be read, and a name-based search is completed, they are not enrolled in the national Rap Back service and will require new fingerprints every five years. f. Describe the procedure to ensure providers who are separated from employment for more than 180 consecutive days receive a full background check. If a background check subject is separated from employment for more than 180 Texas Page 269 of 380consecutive days, the national Rap Back enrollment is eliminated. As long as the enrollment can be renewed, the individual will not need to submit new fingerprints. All other background check types will be processed as normal to complete a full background check. g. Provide the website link that contains instructions on how child care providers should initiate background check requests for a prospective employee (98.43(g)). https://hhs.texas.gov/doing-business-hhs/provider-portals/protective-services- providers/child-care-licensing/child-care-licensing-account-registration-login 5.5.3 Procedures for a Lead Agency to Respond to and Complete a Background Check. Once a request has been initiated, the state shall carry out the request of a child care provider for a criminal background check as expeditiously as possible, but not to exceed 45 days after the date on which such request was submitted. The Lead Agency shall make the determination whether the prospective staff member is eligible for employment in a child care program (98.43(e)(1)). Lead Agencies must ensure the privacy of background checks by providing the results of the criminal background check to the requestor or identified recipient in a statement that indicates whether a child care staff member (including a prospective child care staff member or a family child care household member over the age of 18) is eligible or ineligible for employment, without revealing any documentation of criminal history or disqualifying crimes or other related information regarding the individual. In the following questions, describe the Lead Agency's procedures for conducting background checks. These responses should include: -- The name of the agency that conducts the investigation; include multiple names if multiple agencies are involved in different background check components -- How the Lead Agency is informed of the results of each background check component -- Who makes the determinations regarding the staff member's eligibility? Note: Disqualification decisions should align to the response provided in 5.5.7. -- How the Lead Agency ensures that a background check request is carried out as quickly as possible and not more than 45 days after a request is submitted. Texas Page 270 of 380a. Describe the procedures for conducting In-State Background Check requests and making a determination of eligibility. HHSC/CCR's CBCU reviews and analyzes background check results, which are provided by the following agencies: the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) (for Texas abuse and/or neglect history) and DPS (for Texas name-based and fingerprint-based Texas and national criminal history). Texas Central Registry Check: The Background Check (BGC) system communicates with the Texas abuse and/or neglect system to determine if the BGC subject has any possible match to abuse and/or neglect history within Texas. If there is a possible match, those results are provided to CBCU and are manually reviewed to determine whether the history pertains to the subject. Texas Name-Based Check: The BGC system communicates with the DPS system to determine whether the BGC subject has any possible match to Texas criminal history. If there is a possible match, the results are provided to CBCU for manual review to determine whether the history pertains to the subject. Fingerprint-based criminal history check: The BGC subject submits fingerprints through DPS's fingerprint contractor. If the individual has criminal history confirmed by a fingerprint record, those results are provided to CBCU for manual review. Texas sex offender: This result will be included within the Texas name-based check or the fingerprint-based check. Out-of-State Abuse/Neglect and Out-of-State Criminal History Check: Each state and territory has a different process to request and receive results. Depending on a state's process, the results are provided to CBCU for manual review. Out-of-State Sex Offender Check: CBCU checks the individual state or territory sex offender search website to determine whether the background check subject is a registered sex offender within that state or territory. The results of the search are manually entered into the BGC system. National Sex Offender Registry: The BGC system communicates with the NCIC Texas Page 271 of 380database to determine whether the BGC subject has any possible match to a registered sex offender. If there is a possible match, the results are provided to CBCU for manual review to determine whether the history pertains to the subject. CBCU uses specifications in the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) and Licensing Policy and Procedures Handbook to determine if a person's abuse and/or neglect and criminal history results require further action. CBCU staff members will review the individual's history and compare to TAC minimum standards to determine whether the results are considered violations. b. If the procedure is different for National Background checks, including the name-based NCIC NSOR check and FBI fingerprint check, please describe here. The process to review these background check types is the same as above. c. Describe the procedures for conducting Interstate Background Check requests and making a determination of eligibility. (Note this response should detail how a state conducts an interstate check for a provider who currently lives in their state or territory but has lived in another state(s) within the previous five years). DPS is the state criminal history repository. d. Describe the procedure the Lead Agency has in place to make an eligibility determination in the event not all the components of the background check are completed within the required 45-day timeframe. HHSC makes an eligibility determination of ineligible when the fingerprint-based criminal history results obtained through the Texas Department of Public Safety and/or the Texas Central Registry (child abuse/neglect) check could not be completed within 45 days. HHSC makes an eligibility determination of provisionally eligible with conditions when: the fingerprint-based criminal history results and the Texas Central Registry results are received within 45 days and do not bar the subject from being eligible ; and additional components, such as out-of-state abuse or neglect or out-of-state criminal history cannot be completed within 45 days. e. Describe procedures for conducting a check when the state of residence is different than the state in which the staff member works. If the subject of a background check works at a child care operation in Texas but lives in Texas Page 272 of 380another state, 26 Texas Administrative Code \u00a7\u00a7 745.613(a)(2)(b) , 745.611, and 745.623 require the subject to complete a fingerprint-based out-of-state criminal history check in addition to the fingerprint-based criminal history check submitted through the Texas Department of Public Safety's approved fingerprint vendor. The subject must also complete all other types of checks that are applicable to individuals who have lived out- of-state anytime in the last five years. If an individual's background check indicates a required background check from other states or territories is necessary, that information is provided up front: https://hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/doing-business-with-hhs/provider- portal/protective-services/ccl/out-of-state-background-check-resource-guide.pdf \"Compact State\" and participation in the National Fingerprint File program. a. \"Compact States\" are states that have ratified the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Act of 1998 in order to facilitate electronic information sharing for noncriminal justice purposes (such as employment) among the Federal Government and states. More information can be found here: https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/compact- council. The Compact allows signatory states to disseminate its criminal history record information to other states for noncriminal justice purposes in accordance with the laws of the receiving state. For the most up-to-date Compact States and Territories map visit: https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/compact-council/maps. Is your state or territory a Compact State? No Yes b. The National Fingerprint File (NFF) is a database of fingerprints, or other unique personal identification information relating to an arrested or charged individual, which is maintained by the FBI to provide positive fingerprint identification of record subjects. Only a state or territory that has ratified the Compact (a Compact State) may join the NFF program. An FBI fingerprint check satisfies the requirement to perform an interstate Texas Page 273 of 380check of another state's criminal history record repository if the responding state (where the child care staff member has resided within the past 5 years) participates in the NFF program. It is unnecessary to conduct both the FBI fingerprint check and the search of an NFF state's criminal history record repository (refer to CCDF-ACF-PIQ-2017-01). For the most up-to-date NFF Participation map visit: https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/compact- council/maps. Is your state or territory an NFF State? No Yes 5.5.5 Procedures for a Lead Agency to Respond to Interstate Background Checks: a. Interstate Criminal History Registry Check Procedures Provide a description of how the state or territory responds to interstate criminal history check requests from another state and whether there are any laws or policies that prevent the state from releasing certain criminal history information to an out-of-state entity for civil purpose (i.e., for purposes of determining employment eligibility). DPS is the state criminal history repository. b. Interstate Sex Offender Registry Check Procedures Provide a description of how the state or territory responds to interstate sex offender history check requests from another state and whether there are any laws or policies that prevent the state from releasing certain sex offender information to an out-of-state entity for civil purpose (i.e., for purposes of determining employment eligibility). DPS is the state's repository for sex offender history information. c. Interstate Child Abuse and Neglect Registry Check Procedures Provide a description of how the state or territory responds to interstate child abuse and neglect history check requests from another state and whether there are any laws or policies that prevent the state from releasing certain child abuse and neglect information to an out-of-state entity for civil purpose (i.e., for purposes of determining employment eligibility). DFPS is the state's repository for child abuse and/or neglect history information. Texas Page 274 of 380 5.5.6 Consumer Education Website Links to Interstate Background Check Processes Lead Agencies must have requirements, policies, and procedures in place to respond as expeditiously as possible to other States', Territories' and Tribes' requests for background checks in order to meet the 45-day timeframe (98.43(a)(1)(iii)). In addition, Lead Agencies are required to include on their consumer education website the process by which another Lead Agency may submit a background check request, along with all of the other background check policies and procedures (98.43 (g)). State and Territory Lead Agencies are required to designate one page of their existing Consumer Education Website as a landing page for all interstate background check related processes and procedures pertaining to their own state. The purpose of having a dedicated interstate background check web page on the Lead Agency Consumer Education Website is to help state and territories implement the interstate background check requirements of the CCDBG Act (CCDF Consumer Education Website and Reports of Serious Injuries and Death (OMB #0970-0473)). Check to certify that the required elements are included on the Lead Agency's consumer education website for each interstate background check component, and provide the direct URL/website link.

Enter direct URL/website link: https://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Background_Checks/FAQ/faq_abuse_registry.asp 5.5.7 Child care staff members cannot be employed by a child care provider receiving CCDF subsidy funds if they refuse a background check, make materially false statements in connection with the background check, or are registered or required to be registered on the state or National Sex Offender Registry (98.43 (c)(1)(i-iii)). Potential staff members also cannot be employed by a provider receiving CCDF funds if they have been convicted of: a felony consisting of murder, child abuse or neglect, crimes against children, spousal abuse, crimes involving rape or sexual assault, kidnapping, arson, physical assault or battery, or - subject to an individual review (at the state/territory's option) - a drug-related offense committed during the preceding 5 years; a violent misdemeanor committed as an adult against a child, including the following crimes - child abuse, child endangerment, or sexual assault; or a misdemeanor involving child pornography (98.43(c)(1)(iv-v)). a. Does the state/territory disqualify child care staff members based on their conviction for any other crimes not specifically listed in 98.43(c)(i)? No Yes. If yes, describe other disqualifying crimes and provide the citation: 26 TAC \u00a7745.661: Smuggling of Persons; Trafficking of Persons; Invasive Visual Recording; Deadly Conduct; Terroristic Threat; Aiding Suicide; Tampering with a Consumer Product; Harassment by Persons in Certain Correctional Facilities; Texas Page 278 of 380Harassment of a Public Servant; Violation of Protective Order; of Prostitution; Failure to Report -Licensed or Certified Child Care Operations: Criminal History Requirements (PDF) -Registered Child Care Homes and Listed Family Homes: Criminal History Requirements (PDF) b. Describe how the Lead Agency notifies the applicant about their eligibility to work in a child care program. This description should detail how the Lead Agency ensures the privacy of background checks. Note: The Lead Agency may not publicly release the results of individual background checks. (98.43(e)(2)(iii)). HHSC notifies the applicant of eligibility or ineligibility by encrypted email or, if preferred by applicant, by First Class U.S. Mail. Letters indicating eligibility status of applicants do not contain personally identifiable information (PII). Child Care Regulation only provides background check results directly to the individual to further ensure the confidentiality of the information. c. Describe whether the state/territory has a review process for individuals disqualified due to a felony drug offense to determine if that individual is still eligible for employment (98.43 (e)(2-4). Texas has a process to appeal the accuracy or completeness of the national and/or Texas criminal background check results. Individuals are asked to provide copies of court documents for any criminal history that does not have complete disposition information in the criminal history database report. Additionally, if the individual intends to challenge the accuracy of the results, the individual is advised to provide copies of history searches completed at the local court clerk and is also advised of the process to resolve criminal history errors through the Texas Department of Public Safety and the FBI. Texas has a review process called a risk evaluation for individuals with disqualifying results that do not reflect a history of severe violent behavior, such as a drug offense within the last 10 years. As part of the risk evaluation, child care staff members are asked to provide a personal statement explaining the context of their disqualifying history, explaining what has changed since the history occurred to prevent similar offenses or Texas Page 279 of 380abuse/neglect investigations from occurring again in the future. 5.5.8 Appeals Processes for Background Checks States and territories shall provide for a process by which a child care program staff member (including a prospective child care staff member) may appeal the results of a background check to challenge the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in a staff member's background report. The state or territory shall ensure that: -- The child care staff member is provided with information related to each disqualifying crime in a report, along with information/notice on the opportunity to appeal -- A child care staff member will receive clear instructions about how to complete the appeals process for each background check component if the child care staff member wishes to challenge the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in such member's background report -- If the staff member files an appeal, the state or territory will attempt to verify the accuracy of the information challenged by the child care staff member, including making an effort to locate any missing disposition information related to the disqualifying crime -- The appeals process is completed in a timely manner for any appealing child care staff member -- Each child care staff member shall receive written notice of the decision. In the case of a negative determination, the decision should indicate 1) the state's efforts to verify the accuracy of information challenged by the child care staff member, 2) any additional appeals rights available to the child care staff member, and 3) information on how the individual can correct the federal or state records at issue in the case. (98.43(e)(3)) -- The Lead Agency must work with other agencies that are in charge of background check information and results (such as the Child Welfare office and the State Identification Bureau), to ensure the appeals process is conducted in accordance with the Act. a. What is the procedure for each applicant to appeal or challenge the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in the background check report? If there are different appeal process procedures for each component of the check, please provide Texas Page 280 of 380that in this description, including information on which state agency is responsible for handling each type of appeal. Note: The FBI Fingerprint Check, State Criminal Fingerprint, and NCIC NSOR checks are usually conducted by a state's Identification Bureau and may have different appeal processes than agencies that conduct the state CAN and state SOR checks. Texas has a process to appeal the accuracy or completeness of the national and/or Texas criminal background check, as well as NCIC NSOR results. Individuals are asked to provide copies of court documents for any criminal history that does not have complete disposition information in the criminal history database report. Additionally, if the individual intends to challenge the accuracy of the results, the individual is advised to provide copies of history searches completed at the local court clerk and is also advised of the process to resolve criminal history errors through TDPS and the FBI. Individuals are also offered an opportunity to contest unsustained Texas abuse/neglect findings through the Texas State Office of Administrating Hearings when such a finding is found in the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services' abuse/neglect registry. b. If the appeals process is different for interstate checks, what is the procedure for each applicant to appeal or challenge the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in the background report for interstate checks? Texas has a process to appeal the accuracy or completeness of interstate check results. Individuals are asked to provide copies of court documents for any criminal history that does not have complete disposition information in the criminal history database report. Additionally, if the individual intends to challenge the accuracy of the results, the individual is advised to provide copies of history searches completed at the local court clerk. c. Interstate Child Abuse and Neglect (CAN) Registry Check: Texas has a process to appeal the accuracy or completeness of interstate CAN registry check results. Individuals are asked to provide copies of official documents for any CAN history that does not have complete disposition information in the CAN Registry Check results received from another state. Additionally, if the individual intends to challenge the accuracy of the results, the individual is advised to provide copies of any records from the agency which maintains the out-of-state CAN registry which would dispute the accuracy of records relied upon by Texas in the determination of ineligibility of the applicant. Texas Page 281 of 380 5.6 Exemptions for Relative Providers States and territories have the option to exempt relatives (defined in CCDF regulations as grandparents, great-grandparents, siblings if living in a separate residence, aunts, and uncles (98.42(c)) from certain health and safety requirements. Note: This exception applies if the individual cares only for relative children. Check and describe where applicable the policies that the Lead Agency has regarding exemptions for eligible relative providers for the following health and safety requirements. The description should include the health and safety requirements relatives are exempt from, if applicable, as well as which of the federally defined relatives the exemption applies to. 5.6.1 Licensing Requirements (as described in Section 5.1) a. Relative providers are exempt from all licensing requirements. b. Relative providers are exempt from a portion of licensing requirements. Describe: Relative-only listed family homes must complete and meet the listed family home requirements for a listing, including submitting and clearing background checks. They are exempt from obtaining liability insurance and complying with minimum standards. c. Relative providers must fully comply with all licensing requirements. 5.6.2 Health and Safety Standards (as described in Section 5.2 and 5.3) a. Relative providers are exempt from all health and safety standard requirements b. Relative providers are exempt from a portion of health and safety standard requirements. Texas Page 282 of 380Describe: c. Relative providers must fully comply with all health and safety standard requirements. 5.6.3 Health and Safety Training (as described in Section 5.3) a. Relative providers are exempt from all health and safety training requirements. b. Relative providers are exempt from a portion of all health and safety training requirements. Describe: Relative-only listed family homes are required to complete safe-sleep training as part of their application. c. Relative providers must fully comply with all health and safety training requirements. 5.6.4 Monitoring and Enforcement (as described in Section 5.4) a. Relative providers are exempt from all monitoring and enforcement requirements. b. Relative providers are exempt from a portion of monitoring and enforcement requirements. Describe: Child Care Regulation (CCR) is developing new standards for listed family home providers in Fiscal Year 2021 (FY'21). However, relative-only listed family homes will be exempt from those standards. Beginning in the spring of 2021, relative-only listed family home providers will not be required to comply with the new minimum standards promulgated for listed family homes. As such, relative-only providers will not be investigated for violation of these minimum standards. Relative-only listed family home providers will continue to be investigated by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) for allegations related to abuse, neglect, or exploitation of children in care. Texas Page 283 of 380c. Relative providers must fully comply with all monitoring and enforcement requirements. 5.6.5 Background Checks (as described in Section 5.5) a. Relative providers are exempt from all background check requirements. b. Relative providers are exempt from a portion of background check requirements. If checked, identify the background check components that relatives must complete: i. Criminal registry or repository using fingerprints in the current state of residency ii.

National Crime Information Center (NCIC) National Sex Offender Registry (NSOR) name based search. vi. Criminal registry or repository in any other state where the individual has resided in the past five years. vii. Sex offender registry or repository in any other state where the individual has resided in the past five years. viii. Child abuse and neglect registry or data base in any other state where the individual has resided in the past five years. c. Relative providers must fully comply with all background check requirements. This section covers the state or territory framework for training, professional development, and post-secondary education (98.44(a)); provides a description of strategies used to strengthen the business practices of child care providers (98.16(z)); and addresses early learning and developmental guidelines. Lead Agencies are required to reserve and use a portion of their Child Care and Development Fund program expenditures for activities designed to improve the quality of child care services and to increase parental options for and access to high-quality child care (98.53). This section addresses the quality improvement activities implemented by the Lead Agency related to the Texas Page 284 of 380support of the child care workforce and the development and implementation of early learning and developmental guidelines. It asks Lead Agencies to describe the measurable indicators of progress used to evaluate state/territory progress in improving the quality of child care services. (98.53 (f)) in either of these two areas. States and territories are required to describe their framework for training, professional development, and post-secondary education for caregivers, teachers, and directors, including those working in school-age care (98.44(a)). This framework is part of a broader systematic approach building on health and safety training (as described in section 5) within a state/territory. States and territories must incorporate their knowledge and application of health and safety standards, early learning guidelines, responses to challenging behavior, and the engagement of families. States and territories are required to establish a progression of professional development opportunities to improve the knowledge and skills of CCDF providers (658E(c)(2)(G)). To the extent practicable, professional development should be appropriate to work with a population of children of different ages, English-language learners, children with disabilities, and Native Americans (98.44(b)(2)(iv)). Training and professional development is one of the options that states and territories have for investing their CCDF quality funds (658G(b)(1)). 6.1 Professional Development Framework 6.1.1 Each state or territory must describe their professional development framework for training, professional development, and post-secondary education for caregivers, teachers and directors in programs that serve children of all ages. This framework should be developed in consultation with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care or similar coordinating body. The framework should include these components: (1) professional standards and competencies, (2) career pathways, (3) advisory structures, (4) articulation, (5) workforce information, and (6) financing (98.44(a)(3)). Flexibility is provided on the strategies, breadth, and depth with which states and territories will develop and implement their framework. a) Describe how the state/territory's framework for training and professional development addresses the following required elements: i. State/territory professional standards and competencies. Describe: The Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS) provides a framework for training and professional development in the state. The four components Texas Page 285 of 380of TECPDS are as follows: -Core Competencies -Texas Trainer Registry (TTR) -Texas Workforce Registry (TWR) -Early Childhood Career Lattice The Texas Core Competencies for Early Childhood Practitioners and Administrators define observable skills that, when achieved, demonstrate competency in the concepts, practices, and knowledge that early childhood practitioners and administrators must have in order to effectively facilitate children's growth and development. Core competencies for practitioners are the following: -Child growth and development -Responsive interactions and guidance -Learning environments, planning framework, curriculum, and standards -Supporting skills development -Observation and assessment -Diversity and dual-language learners -Families and community relationships -Health, safety, and nutrition professionalism and ethics Levels of practice: -Beginning practitioners support early learning and development through adherence to program and regulatory policies. -Intermediate practitioners support early learning and development with increasing independence and effectiveness. -Advanced practitioners support early learning and development through leadership in the development of program policy and practice and through their ability to enhance the knowledge and skills of others in the profession. Core competencies for administrators are the following: -Establishing and maintaining an effective organization -Business and operations management -Human resources leadership and development -Maintaining a healthy and safe environment -Implementing developmentally appropriate curriculum and environment -Instituting family and community-centered programming Levels of practice: -Beginning administrators lead and support the program by adhering to laws governed by the state and program policies. -Intermediate administrators lead and support the program with increasing independence and effectiveness. -Advanced administrators lead and support the program by providing strong leadership and high-quality program components that promote the well-being of Texas Page 286 of 380children and families. -Texas Core Competencies for Practitioners and Administrators Training is available at https://cliengage.org/public/tools/online-learning/core-competencies-training/ . These online training modules were designed for use by early childhood professionals to improve the quality of care and education that young children receive. The content and structure of the competencies are a framework for assessing knowledge and skills, guiding training and professional development opportunities, and monitoring progress. ii. Career pathways. Describe: The Early Childhood Career Lattice is a tool within the Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS) that allows early childhood professionals to relate training hours, education, work experience, and other factors to a position on the career lattice. Based on the level of education, annual training, and experience that practitioners and administrators have achieved, they are designated as beginner, intermediate, or advanced. On June 29, 2021 , TWC's three-member Commission authorized up to $3 million in awards through competitive procurement to support the expansion of early childhood education registered apprenticeship programs. TWC recognizes registered apprenticeship programs as a strategy to foster sustainable career pathways that increase the availability of qualified care and education professionals. This program is one step toward TWC's goal to increase early childhood educators' effectiveness, increase their marketable value, increase the number of educators' in the field particularly in rural areas, improve child outcomes, and build the early childhood education workforce. iii. Advisory structure. Describe: In addition to the Texas Early Learning Council (TELC), Texas also has a TECPDS Advisory Council. Members include representatives from CLI, TWC, TEA, THSSCO, CCR, and TAEYC. The purpose of the TECPDS Advisory Council is to support early childhood professionals by providing them with resources and tools to help meet their professional development needs. TECPDS defines professional development as any opportunity that enhances the knowledge and skills of those working with young children, including training, education, and employment. Texas Page 287 of 380The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) is exploring opportunities to continue to improve TECPDS services and solicit feedback from stakeholders. iv. Articulation. Describe: In 2015, the Texas Early Learning Council (TELC) worked with MCCM Associates to develop and publish the Higher Education Articulation Agreements Toolkit, which was updated in 2017. The project met the following objectives: -Collect and review data on articulation agreements -Analyze data and develop recommendations on articulation agreements -Create a higher education articulation agreement toolkit for communities The tool kit is available at https://www.childrenslearninginstitute.org/media/154229/texas- ece-degree-articulation-toolkit-updated-october-2017.pdf . In addition to the statewide initiatives described above, many Boards have formed partnerships with local community colleges to implement articulation agreements to move training participants from the CDA credential into associate's and bachelor's degree programs. v. Workforce information. Describe: Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS): TWR is a web-based application that early childhood professionals may use to store and access their education and employment history, as well as the professional development hours that they have completed. Professionals with an account on TWR may also access the new Find My Career Lattice tool on TECPDS. As of January 2021, 40,254 practitioners had registered in TWR. Beginning in 2021, all Texas Rising Star programs will be required to join TWR. TTR is a statewide system that approves early childhood trainers and their trainings. Trainers listed on TTR have undergone an approval process defined by qualifications that include early childhood expertise and experience, as well as knowledge of adult learning theories and principles. The training approval process is linked to core competencies, principles of adult learning, and other standards, such as early learning guidelines. As of January 2021, 767 trainers had registered in TTR. Additionally, in 2020 TWC began to require new statewide grantees providing CCDF- funded professional development activities to utilize TECPDS. This data collection will Texas Page 288 of 380help TWC, Boards, and the grantees to better understand the reach and impact of these activities. vi. Financing. Describe: TECPDS is currently jointly financed with funds from TWC, TEA, THSSCO, and additional smaller partners such as the Texas Association for the Education of Young Children's (TAEYC). In 2019-2020, TWC also directed $800,0000 to CLI for statewide training and implementation activities to bring all Board areas and all Texas Rising Star programs on to TWR. Additionally, TWC uses CCDF quality funds for a variety of professional development activities that align with statewide system goals. For example, TWC provides funds to support the Texas Association for the Education of Young Children's (TAEYC) Teacher Education and Compensation Helps (T.E.A.C.H.) program, which offers financial assistance to help child care providers and caregivers earn a CDA Credential or enroll in college credit courses to obtain an associate's or bachelor's degree. It also includes the Early Childhood Educator Apprenticeship (ECEA) scholarship. This model will support ECEAs with on-the-job training, tuition, or course fees. The program assists educators in achieving progressive educational and career advancement by helping them attain stackable credentials in early childhood development and education. Additionally, the program assists early learning programs in retaining well-qualified staff and meeting Texas Rising Star staff qualifications. Each year local Boards must use at least 2 percent of their annual CCDF allocation for quality activities, and many fund professional development professional development opportunities that leverage the state's framework through grants, contracts, and direct services. Additionally, TWC partners with the Texas Education Agency (TEA) and other stakeholders in leveraging statewide resources to achieve professional development system goals. Boards have the option to partner with local independent school districts, regional education service centers, community colleges, and universities to jointly design professional development programs for practitioners. On June __, 2021, Governor Abbott signed House Bill 619 which requires TWC to create Texas Page 289 of 380a strategic plan to improve the quality of the workforce for child care. The plan will be updated every three years and must include recommendations for: -Local Workforce Development Boards (Boards) to improve and support the child care workforce -compensation increases and staff retention -eliminating pay disparity -opportunities for paid professional development and education, including apprenticeships -increasing the use of the Texas Early Care Professional Development System (TECPDS) -higher education institutes to increase articulation agreements with school districts and charter schools and assist child care workers with training and education and -best practices from Boards and other programs designed to support the child care workforce -improving the infant and toddler child care workforce -a timeline with benchmarks for implementation by TWC and the Boards TWC will convene a workgroup to assist in the development of the strategic plan. This workgroup will include child care providers, community stakeholders, and child care workers. Additionally, TWC to consider the following information from a representative sample of child care providers when creating the plan: -the race, ethnicity, gender and education level of child care workers as well as the ages of the children they work with -data regarding compensation for child care workers, broken down by race, ethnicity, gender, and education level b) The following are optional elements, or elements that should be implemented to the extent practicable, in the training and professional development framework. i. Continuing education unit trainings and credit-bearing professional development to the extent practicable Describe: Approximately 20 Boards offer scholarships to providers and caregivers to assist them in receiving CDA Credentials or completing early education courses. Boards also deliver CDA training modules directly to caregivers and directors. ii. Engagement of training and professional development providers, including higher education, in aligning training and educational opportunities with the state/territory's framework Texas Page 290 of 380Describe: Boards are encouraged to work with local education and training providers to align professional development opportunities with Texas' framework. Additionally, TTR requires that trainers demonstrate how their offerings align to the core competencies for practitioners and/or administrators. iii. Other Describe: 6.1.2 Describe how the state/territory developed its professional development framework in consultation with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care (if applicable) or similar coordinating body if there is no SAC that addresses the professional development, training, and education of child care providers and staff. The Texas Core Competencies for Early Childhood Practitioners and Administrators were developed in 2011 and revised in 2013 through a collaboration between the Texas Early Learning Council (TELC) and the Texas Head Start State Collaboration Office, both housed at CLI at the University of Texas Health Science Center. TWC and Child Care Regulation participated in the development of the Core Competencies through TELC. The Core Competencies are available through the TECPDS web site at https://tecpds.org/wp/resources/texas-core-competencies/ . 6.1.3 Describe how the framework improves the quality, diversity, stability, and retention of caregivers, teachers, and directors (98.44(a)(7)). Financial Assistance to Attain Credentials and Post-Secondary Degrees: The Professional Development Scholarship Program for Early Childhood Educators, currently provided by the T.E.A.C.H. scholarship program, is designed to improve the quality Texas Page 291 of 380of child care programs in Texas. Early childhood educators receive valuable education and training in early childhood development and education. The program helps educators achieve progressive educational and career advancement by attaining stackable credentials. Additionally, the program helps early learning programs retain well-qualified staff and meet Texas Rising Star staff qualifications. Many Boards also provide scholarships to providers and caregivers to assist them in earning CDA Credentials or completing early education courses. Boards also deliver CDA training modules directly to caregivers and directors. Financial Incentives Linked to Educational Attainment and Retention: Participants in the Professional Development Scholarship Program for Early Childhood Educators receive a onetime bonus or a wage increase if they remain employed with their program for a minimum number of months that is tied to the educational level they attained. Some Boards also provide bonuses and stipends to providers and caregivers who attain CDAs or complete early education courses. Additionally, Workforce Solutions of Capital Area operates a WAGE$ program - the Jeanette Watson Wage Supplement Project with funding from the City of Austin, Travis County, and the Capital Area Workforce Board. 6.2 Training and Professional Development Requirements The Lead Agency must describe how its established health and safety requirements for pre- service or orientation training and ongoing professional development requirements--as described in Section 5 for caregivers, teachers, and directors in CCDF programs--align, to the extent practicable, with the state/territory professional development framework. These requirements must be designed to enable child care providers to promote the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of children and to improve the knowledge and skills of the child care workforce. Such requirements shall be applicable to child care providers caring for children receiving CCDF funds across the entire age span, from birth through age 12 (658E(c)(2)(G)). Ongoing training and professional development should be accessible and appropriate to the setting and age of the children served (98.44(b)(2)). Texas Page 292 of 380 6.2.1 Describe how the state/territory incorporates into training and professional development opportunities: -- the knowledge and application of its early learning and developmental guidelines (where applicable); -- its health and safety standards (as described in section 5); -- and social-emotional/behavioral and mental health intervention models for young children, which can include positive behavior intervention and support models that reduce the likelihood of suspension and expulsion of children (as described in Section 2 of the Pre-Print) (98.44(b)). The Health and Safety Core Competency (Health, Safety, and Nutrition\u2014Area 8 of the Texas Core Competencies ) addresses core knowledge and skills necessary to ensure children's safety, promote sound health practices, recognize and respond to child abuse and neglect, and provide nutritious meals and snacks. This area includes knowledge on a broad array of prevention, preparedness, and implementation of health and safety practices. The Social/Emotional Development Core Competency (Responsive Interactions and Guidance\u2014Area 2 of the Texas Core Competencies ) addresses core knowledge and skills necessary to promote positive interactions and use developmentally appropriate guidance techniques in accordance with children's ages and developmental levels. Registered trainers are required to submit trainings to the Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS) for review and approval to ensure that core competencies are being addressed. TWC also released a policy statement demonstrating its commitment to providing support and resources to child care and early education settings to ultimately reduce suspensions and expulsions. TWC also participated in a workgroup of early childhood stakeholders and created the Texas Early Childhood Suspension and Expulsion Matrix (TECSEM), a crosswalk and overview of federal and state agency policies and efforts related to suspension and expulsion. TWC partnered with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) and the Texas A&M Extension program, AgriLife, to create free and/or low-cost online training for Texas Page 293 of 380child care providers to support children with challenging behaviors. Additionally, TWC awarded a grant to Greenspace Learning in 2020 to develop and delivery professional development related to Addressing Challenging Behaviors in early care and education settings. Given the current and anticipated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, TWC is exploring opportunities to address mental health for early childhood educators and children in care. 6.2.2 Describe how the state/territory's training and professional development are accessible to providers supported through Indian tribes or tribal organizations receiving CCDF funds (as applicable) (98.44(b)(2)(vi)). The Early Learning Guidelines, Professional Development Core Competencies, and the TECPDS Trainer and Workforce Registries, as well as the Texas Education Agency (TEA) training on the prekindergarten guidelines, are available online to tribes and tribal organizations. TWC includes tribes in all professional development outreach activities through the GovDelivery email delivery system. The three Board areas with tribal organizations coordinate directly to communicate about relevant and appropriate activities including professional development activities. 6.2.3 States/territories are required to facilitate participation of child care providers with limited English proficiency and disabilities in the subsidy system (98.16 (dd)). Describe how the state/territory will recruit and facilitate the participation of providers in the subsidy system: a) with limited English proficiency Outreach (conferences, trainings, and professional development) is available as necessary to providers for whom English is not their first language. TWC requires Boards to provide translation and interpretation services to workforce customers. TWC and the Boards also provide informational materials to providers in Spanish and Vietnamese. Critical documents Texas Page 294 of 380that are not available in Spanish include a Babel notice to inform customers how to access translation services. Boards with high concentrations of Spanish speakers also regularly provide Spanish-language options for providers who primarily speak Spanish. b) who have disabilities TWC's Technical Assistance Bulletin 287, issued January 17, 2018, and titled \"Training, Assistive Technology, and Accessibility,\" provides Boards with guidance on serving individuals with disabilities. The guidance includes information about assistive technologies, people-first language, and technical assistance resources. All resources that TWC provides online undergo an extensive review to ensure that they are accessible for individuals who are visually impaired. 6.2.4 Describe how the state/territory's training and professional development requirements are appropriate, to the extent practicable, for child care providers who care for children receiving child care subsidies, including children of different age groups (such as specialized credentials for providers who care for infants and/or school-age children); English-language learners; children with developmental delays and disabilities; and Native Americans, including Indians as defined in Section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (including Alaska Natives) and Native Hawaiians (98.44(b)(2)(iv)). The infant/toddler and prekindergarten guidelines address special needs, English language learners, and cultural diversity. The infant/toddler guidelines define and discuss inclusive practices, including why it is important and ways to learn and assist with inclusive practices. The guidelines also offer resources for teachers and early learning programs. The infant/toddler guidelines address culturally appropriate practices. These include communicating with families to understand home life and traditions, recognizing children's home language, and honoring diversity and awareness as a concept and core value of society. The pre-K guidelines address English language learners' diverse needs, including recommendations for instruction and strategies for success. The guidelines also address issues regarding children with disabilities, how those children can be fully integrated into Texas Page 295 of 380school and life, and what opportunities those children need to be successful. The guidelines discuss preparation and examples of strategies to implement in a classroom. The Texas Core Competencies reference diversity, dual-language learners, and family and community relationships. Core Competency Area 6, Diversity and Dual Language Learners, addresses the following core concepts: -Children's cultural identity is developed within the family and community setting. -Programs should work to maintain a child's cognitive, linguistic, and emotional connection to the home culture and language. -Children have the ability to learn more than one language at the same time. -Children's language and literacy skills in their home language will transfer and support learning of a second language. Core competency Area 7, Family and Community Relationships, addresses the following core concepts: -Families are the primary influence on a child's development. -Family context and situations vary greatly in terms of living arrangements, goals and values, ethnicity, and culture. -Programs and practitioners are better able to support children's development when they provide experiences and set expectations that are aligned with those of the family. -Practitioners communicate frequently and positively with parents to ensure that parents are informed about their children's needs and interests while in care, collaborate and problem-solve when children are met with challenges, follow up on parent requests and joint decisions, and provide resources and referrals to appropriate aids and services. -Early childhood programs and practitioners must be responsive to the unique contexts and situations created by interdependencies between family systems, social institutions, and communities. -Forming collaborative partnerships with community organizations, childhood advocates, businesses, and families increases the capacity of the program. Child Care Regulation (CCR) minimum standards for caregivers provide the option of obtaining remaining training hours in cultural diversity for children and families and care of children with special needs. For caregivers providing care for children under 24 months of age, one hour of caregivers' annual training must cover the following topics: -Recognizing and preventing shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma -Understanding and using safe sleep practices and preventing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) Texas Page 296 of 380-Understanding early childhood brain development TWC is funding an Infant/Toddler Specialist Network through CLI, as discussed in Section 7.4. 6.2.5 The Lead Agency must provide training and technical assistance (TA) to providers and appropriate Lead Agency (or designated entity) staff on identifying and serving children and families experiencing homelessness (658E(c)(3)(B)(i)). a. Describe the state/territory's training and TA efforts for providers in identifying and serving homeless children and their families (relates to question 3.2.2). TWC developed guidance in 2018 that helps Boards identify and serve families and individuals experiencing homelessness. Boards use the information to inform assistance and training offered to providers. b. Describe the state/territory's training and TA efforts for Lead Agency (or designated entity) staff in identifying and serving children and their families experiencing homelessness (connects to question 3.3.6). TWC developed guidance in 2018 that helps Boards identify and serve families and individuals experiencing homelessness. TWC continues to offer guidance as needed. 6.2.6 Lead Agencies must develop and implement strategies to strengthen the business practices of child care providers to expand the supply and to improve the quality of child care services (98.16 (z)). Describe the state/territory's strategies to strengthen provider's business practices, which can include training and/or TA efforts. a. Describe the strategies that the state/territory is developing and implementing for strengthening child care providers\u00e2 business practices. In 2019, TWC awarded Collaborative for Children $3 million to develop and administer child care business training. The trainings focus on business practices tailored to the needs of child care administrators. Objectives address business management, financial Texas Page 297 of 380stability, personnel management, increased recruitment and retention of staff, communication, and family and community engagement. Trainings also incorporate information on Texas Rising Star and opportunities to become a recognized quality provider. All trainings are available in English and Spanish. Online trainings are available statewide, and additional child care business forums are available regionally. In 2020, TWC joined the Early Childhood Education Business Collaboratory project, led by First Children's Finance, and developed a statewide workgroup with representation from the child care industry, a child care business training vendor, and CCR. This group will release recommendations in 2021 for additional child care business supports that may be needed. TWC has also been sharing business supports to child care programs during the COVID- 19 pandemic to help them access federal financial resources, such as the Paycheck Protection Program. TWC continues to explore opportunities to support child care businesses, particularly those related to the pandemic's ongoing impacts on such businesses. b.

Texas Page 305 of 380Each month, TWC tracks the number and percent age of the following for each level of Texas Rising Star: -Subsidized providers participating in Texas Rising Star; -Subsidized children in Texas Rising Star-certified provider care; -Texas Rising Star providers as a share of regulated providers; and -Texas Rising Star providers by provider type (for example, center-based, registered home, and licensed home) This and other data can be found at the Child Care by the Numbers web page, launched in 2021, at https://www.twc.texas.gov/childcarenumbers/Texas_Statewide_System_monthly.html . Additionally, each quarter, TWC monitors Boards' CCDF quality expenditures and the progress made toward improving the quality of child care programs, including monitoring the following measures: -Providers receiving financial supports (one-time or ongoing grants or stipends) -Provider staff receiving scholarships, bonuses, or wage supplements -Providers receiving financial or mentoring support to achieve national accreditation Measure: Subsidized providers participating in Texas Rising Star In Fiscal Year 2018 (FY'18): 1,558 In FY'19: 1,884 In FY'20: 1,949 Measure: Subsidized children who receive care at Texas Rising Star-certified providers In FY'17: 30,074 In 41,178 In FY'20: 48,724 Measure: Total child care capacity Rising FY'18: 166,162 In FY'19: 201,593 In FY'20: 227,075 TWC has awarded funds through a competitive procurement process to provide professional development scholarships at the postsecondary level, with the Texas Association for the Education of Young Children (TXAEYC) Teacher Education And Compensation Helps (T.E.A.C.H.) program consistently being selected. The T.E.A.C.H. program provides Texas Page 306 of 380scholarships to child care professionals who want to obtain a Child Development Associate (CDA) certificate or a Certified Childcare Professional credential. TXAEYC also uses the funds to provide scholarships to child care professionals to pursue courses that lead to an associate's degree in early childhood education. In 2020, TWC expanded the effort to include funding for bachelor's degrees and apprenticeships. Professional development scholarships help educators achieve progressive educational and career advancement by attaining stackable credentials. Additionally, the scholarship program helps eligible early learning programs retain well-qualified staff and meet Texas Rising Star staff qualifications. From Board Contract Year 2016 (BCY'16) through BCY'20, TXAEYC was instrumental in advancing child care professional development, awarding 755 CDA assessment fee scholarships and 316 associate's degree scholarships. Additionally, the wages of recipients who attained a CDA or associate's degree increased by an average of 6-9 percent in FY'20. Additionally, TWC will consider collecting data related to the following: -The number of child care professionals who participate in T.E.A.C.H. -The number of child care professionals who participate in a Board's scholarship program -The number of child care professionals who earn their CDA or degree through T.E.A.C.H. or a Board's scholarship program -The number of child care professionals who defer or drop out of T.E.A.C.H. and Boards' scholarship programs -The type and number of professional development trainings funded by Boards and TWC -The number of trainings that may count toward a CDA certificate or early childhood degree In addition to the measures described above, TWC monitors financial aid provided to providers: Measure: The number of provider staff members receiving scholarships, bonuses, or wage supplements In FY'18: 3,574 In FY'19: 3,577 In FY'20: 4,500 The number of provider facilities receiving financial support Onetime grants, awards, bonuses FY'18: 1,021 Texas Page 307 of 380FY'19: 1,573 FY'20: 2,168 or periodic quality stipends FY'18: 137 FY'19: 204 FY'20: 325 Each Board determines the appropriate mix of provider financial aid and other quality activities that will best meet the needs of the local workforce development area each year. The provision of financial aid to provider staff and provider facilities in FY'20 compared to that of FY'18 represents an average increase of 92 percent in overall support. Scholarships, wage supplements, bonuses, and other types of support increased by 26 percent over the same period, and support for provider facilities increased by an average of 124 percent. 6.4 Early Learning and Developmental Guidelines 6.4.1 States and territories are required to develop, maintain, or implement early learning and developmental guidelines that are appropriate for children in a forward progression from birth to kindergarten entry (i.e., birth-to-three, three-to-five, birth-to-five), describing what children should know and be able to do and covering the essential domains of early childhood development. These early learning and developmental guidelines are to be used statewide and territory-wide by child care providers and in the development and implementation of training and professional development (658E(c)(2)(T)). The required essential domains for these guidelines are cognition, including language arts and mathematics; social, emotional, and physical development; and approaches toward learning (98.15(a)(9)). At the option of the state/territory, early learning and developmental guidelines for out-of-school time may be developed. Note: States and territories may use the quality set-aside, discussed in section 7, to improve on the development or implementation of early learning and developmental guidelines. a. Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines address the following requirements: Texas Page 308 of 380i. Are research-based. In collaboration with the Texas Early Learning Council (TELC), stakeholders from the state developed the Texas Infant, Toddler, and Three-Year-Old Early Learning Guidelines ( Little Texans, Big Futures ), which outline expectations about what children should know and be able to do across learning domains during specific age ranges. The guidelines also outline steps that caregivers may take to support healthy development. Training that correlates to the guidelines is available through Engage, the Children's Learning Institute's (CLI) web-based platform. Additionally, the Texas Education Agency (TEA), the state lead education agency, established a 13-member review committee consisting of classroom teachers and administrators from early childhood programs in public schools, higher education faculty, and early learning experts from across the state to participate in the revision of the Texas Prekindergarten Guidelines (pre-K guidelines). The revised pre-K guidelines are aligned with the Kindergarten Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)-sequenced to follow child development-and provide teaching strategies for each of the guidelines. The pre-K guidelines offer educators the information and support necessary to prepare all children for success in kindergarten. ii. Developmentally appropriate. As described above, the revised pre-K guidelines are aligned with the TEKS- sequenced to follow child development-and provide teaching strategies for each of the guidelines. The new guidelines offer educators the information and support necessary to prepare all children for success in kindergarten. iii. Culturally and linguistically appropriate. The pre-K guidelines must be used to support learning for children who are English language learners (ELLs), including children receiving instruction in their home language. Under Texas Education Code \u00a728.005, the state's policy is to ensure the mastery of English by all students, specifically in situations in which bilingual instruction is necessary to ensure students' reasonable proficiency in the English language and ability to achieve academic success. The 19 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 89 , Adaptions for Special Populations, further emphasizes the goal of bilingual education programs to enable ELLs to become competent in understanding, Texas Page 309 of 380speaking, reading, and writing the English language by developing literacy and academic skills in the primary language and in English. iv. Aligned with kindergarten entry. As described above, the revised pre-K guidelines are aligned with the TEKS- sequenced to follow child development-and provide teaching strategies for each of the guidelines. The guidelines offer educators the information and support necessary to prepare all children for success in kindergarten. v. Appropriate for all children from birth to kindergarten entry. Little Texans, Big Futures guidelines were created for children ages birth through three years, and the pre-K guidelines were created for children ages four to five. vi. Implemented in consultation with the educational agency and the State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body. TEA is responsible for Texas' pre-K guidelines. TEA worked with the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) and a variety of advisory groups and agencies, including the Texas Early Learning Council, to develop and maintain the guidelines. b. Describe how the required domains are included in the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines. Responses for \"other\" are optional. i. Cognition, including language arts and mathematics. The pre-K guidelines include: -Language and Communication domain: Listening Comprehension skills, Speaking (conversation) skills, Speech Production skills, Vocabulary skills, Sentences and Structure skills -Emergent Literacy: Reading domain: Motivation to Read skills, Phonological Awareness skills, Alphabet Knowledge skills, Comprehension of Text Read-Aloud skills, Print Concepts -Emergent Literacy Writing domain: Motivation to Write skills, Writing as a Process, Conventions in Writing -Mathematics domain: Counting skills, Adding To/Taking Away skills, Geometry and Spatial Senses skills, Measurement skills, Classification and Patterns skills -Science domain: Physical Science skills, Life Sciences skills, Earth and Space Science skills -Social Studies domain: People, Past and Present skills; Economics skills; Geography skills; Citizenship skills Texas Page 310 of 380 ii. Social development. The pre-K guidelines include: -Social-emotional development domain: Self-Concept skills, Self-Regulation skills, Relationships with Others, Social Awareness skills iii. Emotional development. The pre-K guidelines include: -Social-emotional development domain: Self-Concept skills, Self-Regulation skills, Relationships with Others, Social Awareness skills iv. Physical development. The pre-K guidelines include: -Physical Development domain: Gross Motor Development skills, Fine Motor Development skills, Personal Safety and Health skills v. Approaches toward learning. The pre-K guidelines include: -The Learning Environment: Physical Arrangements, Activities, and Social Relationships vi. Describe how other optional domains are included, if any: The pre-K guidelines also include: -Fine Arts domain: Art skills, Music skills, Dramatic Expression skills -Technology Applications domain: Technology and Devices skills c. Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines are updated and include the date first issued and/or the frequency of updates. Little Texans, Big Futures guidelines were published in 2013CLI reviews the infant and toddler guidelines on an ongoing basis through research and projects that support quality infant and toddler care. Additionally, the state interagency team for early education and child care has the opportunity to make recommendations to TWC and CLI regarding revisions. The pre-K guidelines were first released in 2008, and a major revision was published in 2015. TEA monitors the relevance of these guidelines and works with stakeholders to make revisions as appropriate. Texas Page 311 of 380 Participants in the 2022-2024 CCDF State Plan Stakeholder Survey, including providers (34 percent), parents (38 percent), advocates (25 percent), and Boards (25 percent), listed updating the Infant and Toddler Early Toddler Early Learning Guidelines to reflect the latest research and resources as one of their top three priorities. TWC is exploring opportunities to update these guidelines to reflect current evidence and best practices. d. If applicable, discuss the state process for the adoption, implementation, and continued improvement of state out-of-school time standards. The Texas Partnership for Out of School Texas Rising Star includes quality measures specific to school-age/out-of-school time programs. Additionally, the Texas Partnership for Out of School Time (TXPOST) maintains the Texas Standards of High Quality Afterschool, Summer and Expanded Learning Programs. e. Provide the Web link to the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines and if available, the school-age guidelines. Infant, Toddler, and Three-Year-Old Early Learning Guidelines (Little Texans, Big Futures) http://www.littletexans.org/ Texas Pre-Kindergarten Guidelines https://tea.texas.gov/sites/default/files/PKG_Final_2015_navigation.pdf 6.4.2 CCDF funds cannot be used to develop or implement an assessment for children that: -- Will be the primary or sole basis to determine a child care provider ineligible to participate in the CCDF, -- Will be used as the primary or sole basis to provide a reward or sanction for an individual provider, -- Will be used as the primary or sole method for assessing program effectiveness, Texas Page 312 of 380 -- Will be used to deny children eligibility to participate in the CCDF (658E(c)(2)(T)(ii)(I); 98.15(a)(2)). Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines are used. The Core Competencies for early childhood practitioners were designed in alignment with the state early learning guidelines (Little Texans, Big Futures and Texas Prekindergarten Guidelines) to ensure a strong connection between goals for practitioners and what children need to know, understand, and be able to do. CLI hosts online trainings that support developing and implementing curriculum and learning activities based on the early learning guidelines and the related core competencies for practitioners. Providers are made aware of the online training through outreach activities conducted by CLI, including conferences such as the annual Texas Early Childhood Learning Summit and the Texas School Ready! Summer Institute. Local Workforce Development Boards (Boards) also promote the online training through technical assistance and mentoring services to providers, including providers working to become Texas Rising Star certified. Additionally, Texas Rising Star curriculum guidelines and caregiver interaction measures are linked to the early learning guidelines. Board mentors provide technical assistance and guidance to providers on Texas Rising Star measures related to the early learning guidelines. TWC has also competitively procured TAEYC in partnership with Teaching Strategies to provide training to early childhood caregivers on assessment tools related to the development and learning of children from ages birth to five years, data collection and reporting, and leveraging assessment data to inform classroom teaching. The goal is to help caregivers use data to develop instruction based on a child's individual needs. 6.4.3 If quality funds are used to develop, maintain, or implement early learning and development guidelines, describe the measurable indicators that will be used to evaluate the state/territory's progress in improving the quality of child care programs and Texas Page 313 of 380services and the data on the extent to which the state/territory has met these measures (98.53(f)(3)). The Texas Rising Star program requires all early learning program directors to obtain training in the guidelines that are applicable to the ages of the children they serve. 7 Support Continuous Quality Improvement Lead Agencies are required to use a portion of their CCDF program expenditures for activities designed to improve the quality of child care services and to increase parental options for and access to high-quality child care (98.53). The quality activities should be aligned with a statewide or territory-wide assessment of the state's or territory's need to carry out such services and care. States and territories are required to report on these quality improvement investments through CCDF in three ways: 1. In the CCDF Plan, the ACF 118, states and territories will describe the types of activities supported by quality investments over the 3-year period (658G(b); 98.16(j)). 2. In the annual expenditure report, the ACF-696, ACF will collect data on how much CCDF funding is spent on quality activities. This report will be used to determine compliance with the required quality and infant and toddler spending requirements (658G(d)(1); 98.53(f)). 3. For each year of the Plan period, states and territories will submit a Quality Progress Report, the ACF 218, that will include a description of activities funded by quality expenditures and the measures used by the state/territory to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory (658G(d); 98.53(f)). States and territories must fund efforts in at least one of the following 10 activities: - Supporting the training and professional development of the child care workforce (Addressed in Section 6) - Improving on the development or implementation of early learning and developmental guidelines (Addressed in Section 6) - Developing, implementing, or enhancing a tiered quality rating and improvement system or Texas Page 314 of 380other systems of quality improvement for child care providers and services - Improving the supply and quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers - Establishing or expanding a statewide system of child care resource and referral services - Supporting compliance with state/territory requirements for licensing, inspection, monitoring, training, and health and safety (as described in section 5) - Evaluating the quality of child care programs in the state/territory, including evaluating how programs positively impact children - Supporting providers in the voluntary pursuit of accreditation - Supporting the development or adoption of high-quality program standards related to health, mental health, nutrition, physical activity, and physical development - Performing other activities to improve the quality of child care services, as long as outcome measures relating to improved provider preparedness, child safety, child well-being, or kindergarten entry are possible. Throughout this Plan, states and territories will describe the types of quality improvement activities where CCDF investments are being made, including but not limited to, quality set- aside funds, and will describe the measurable indicators of progress used to evaluate state/territory progress in improving the quality of child care services for each expenditure (98.53(f)). These activities can benefit infants and toddlers through school-age populations, and all categories of care. It is important that while Lead Agencies have the flexibility to define \"high quality\" and develop strategies and standards to support their definition, Lead Agencies should consider how that definition and those strategies for different provider types reflect and acknowledge their unique differences and how quality varies in different settings, including family child care and small care settings as well as child care centers. This section covers the quality activities needs assessment, quality improvement activities, and indicators of progress for each of the activities undertaken in the state or territory. Texas Page 315 of 380 7.1 Quality Activities Needs Assessment for Child Care Services 7.1.1 Lead Agencies must invest in quality activities based on an assessment of the state/territory's needs to carry out those activities. Lead Agencies have the flexibility to design an assessment of their quality activities that best meet their needs, including how often they do the assessment. Describe your state/territory assessment process, including the frequency of assessment (658G(a)(1); 98.53(a)). State statute (Government Code, \u00a72308.3155 ) requires TWC rules include a regular review of the Texas Rising Star program standards and TWC child care rule \u00a7809.130(e) requires that the regular review occur every four years. In 2020 TWC completed its first four-year review of the Texas Rising Star program. TWC has the following goals for high-quality, subsidized child care in Texas: -Improve child care services by assisting child care providers in achieving quality standards such as Texas Rising Star certification and national accreditation -Increase access to quality child care for families by increasing the number of Texas Rising Star-certified and nationally-accredited facilities -Improve the quality of teacher-child interactions and learning environments by increasing professional development opportunities for child care and prekindergarten teachers who work in early childhood education Each month, TWC tracks the number and percent of the following for each level of Texas Rising Star: -Subsidized providers participating in Texas Rising Star -Subsidized children in Texas Rising Star-certified provider care -Texas Rising Star providers as a share of regulated providers -Texas Rising Star providers by provider type (center-based, registered home, and licensed home) This and other data can be found at the Child Care by the Numbers web page, which launched in 2021. TWC regularly assesses the quality activities that are currently available and seeks feedback from child care programs to understand their needs related to quality activities. TWC works Texas Page 316 of 380with Workforce Development Boards (Boards) to understand the needs they seek to address through quality activities. The Texas Early Learning Council (TELC), described in Section 1.3.1, conducted a statewide birth-five needs assessment in 2019 and developed a statewide birth-five strategic plan based on the results. The needs assessment identified many areas for quality improvement that align with CCDF-funded quality improvement areas, including developing and implementing strategies to: -increase the number of subsidy providers participating in Texas Rising Star; -increase outreach and awareness of professional development and educational supports for early childhood professionals; and -supporting relationship-building and partnership development across early learning programs. As discussed in Section 1.3.1, TWC conducted a statewide survey and stakeholder focus groups. TWC's 2022-2024 CCDF State Plan Stakeholder Survey was available via Survey Monkey from December 1, 2020, to January 7, 2021. The survey, available in English and Spanish, was posted to the TWC website and widely distributed to child care providers, parents, Boards, advocacy groups, community organizations, and state agencies. TWC received 3,237 responses from the following: -1,562 child care providers -1,374 parents -83 child care advocacy groups or community organizations -72 Board staff members -13 state agency staff members -50 other early childhood programs -10 industry partners -73 other respondents 7.1.2 Describe the findings of the assessment and if any overarching goals for quality improvement were identified. If applicable, include a direct URL/website link for any available evaluation or research related to the findings. TWC provides quality improvement activities in accordance with CCDF regulations, which give states broad flexibility to design and deliver quality improvement activities that best meet identified needs and help providers meet the revised guidelines. Texas Page 317 of 380 TWC recently completed a four-year review of the Texas Rising Star program, which resulted in numerous revisions. Beginning in May 2019, TWC convened a workgroup to review the Texas Rising Star guidelines and recommend revisions. The workgroup included: -early learning program directors from around the -the Texas Health and Human Services Commission Child Care Regulation (CCR) department; and -the Children's Learning Institute. Over an eight-month period, the workgroup met regularly to review the Texas Rising Star guidelines in detail and to engage in a collaborative effort to improve the guidelines' standards. TWC commissioned Strengthening Texas Rising Star Implementation Study , which provided valuable data and research during the review process. On January 21, 2020, TWC's three-member Commission (Commission) approved the publication of the workgroup's recommendations for public comment. During February 2020, TWC partnered with Boards to host seven public stakeholder meetings across the state. Throughout the review process, TWC also provided the public with a website to view materials related to the review and a dedicated email address to offer input. The revisions consider the recommendations of the workgroup as well as stakeholder input received during public meetings or provided to TWC in writing. On January 5, 2021 the Commission approved the following revisions and rule changes : -Adding a requirement for programs applying for Texas Rising Star certification to agree to participate in the Texas Workforce Registry (TWR) and to encourage their staff to participate as well. For all programs, adopting and maintaining use of TWR will be included in ongoing technical assistance and Continuous Quality Improvement Plans (CQIPs). -Creating a \"Pre-Star\" provider definition and a requirement that all regulated subsidy providers be designated as Pre-Star. Providers with Pre-Star designations are outside of the statutorily defined Texas Rising Star quality-based rating system and will not receive an enhanced reimbursement rate. Pre-Star designations are based upon a child care program's demonstration that they do not have significant licensing findings, as defined in the Screening Criteria for Subsidized Child Care in Section 5.4.1 of this plan. -Developing a framework for CQIPs and requiring certified programs to engage in a Texas Page 318 of 380formal CQIP process. Early childhood programs and their mentors will use CQIPs to identify areas for program and staff improvement. The Texas Rising Star CQIP framework will provide targeted technical assistance and customized coaching to set specific improvement goals and monitor progress. -Requiring assessors to take the Texas Rising Star Assessment Training course, to obtain certification, and to pass quarterly reliability checks. -Adopting more robust training requirements for mentors by requiring the Texas Rising Star Assessment Training course and participation in competency-based professional development designed to improve coaching practices. Increasing the number of programs that attain and retain higher levels of quality will require strong mentoring support, and successful implementation of a CQIP framework will depend on skillful coaching from Texas Rising Star mentors. -Reorganizing Texas Rising Star measures under the following four categories: (1) Director and Staff Qualifications and Training, (2) Teacher-Child Interactions, (3) Program Administration, and (4) Indoor/Outdoor Environments. -Adjusting the relative weight of each category in recognition of the categories that are most closely correlated with child outcomes. The teacher-child interactions category will be assigned a weight of 40 percent, with the remaining three categories weighted at 20 percent each. -Revising the structure for considering licensing deficiencies for both new Texas Rising Star applicants and existing certified programs. The revised structure will continue to provide a high level of accountability for the most critical licensing issues but will allow opportunities for providers to correct issues that are less correlated with the quality of care that children receive. Strengthening Texas Rising Star Implementation Study (Executive Summary): https://www.twc.texas.gov/files/partners/executive-summary-cli-twc.pdf Approved Chapter 809 Rules, Effective January 25, 2021: https://www.twc.texas.gov/files/partners/fr-ch809-hb680-trs-transfers-adopted-1-5-21-twc.pdf Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) Tool In addition to Texas Rising Star, there are other nationally available tools which also measure teacher-child interactions. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services uses the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) observational tool within their Head Start programs. CLASS includes three domains or categories of teacher-child interactions that support children's learning and development: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support. As of FY 2020, eight Boards reported using CLASS or plans to begin CLASS for Texas Page 319 of 380assessments in prekindergarten partnerships and quality improvement initiatives. On June 8, 2021, TWC authorized Boards to recognize CLASS-scored teacher-child interactions towards the Texas Rising Star Category 2 scoring as follows: CLASS Scoring Texas Rising Star Score for Category 2 LOW - score of 1-2 LOW - score of 0-1 MID - score of 3-5 MID - score of 2 HIGH - score of 6-7 HIGH - score of 3 Statewide Consolidation of Texas Rising Star Assessors On June __, 2021, Governor Abbott signed House Bill 1792 which requires TWC to competitively procure a single entity to oversee a statewide roster of qualified assessor staff to evaluate child-care providers participating in the Texas Rising Star Program during the initial certification process and at any time during the provider's participation in the program. Transferring the responsibility of assessing from the 28 Boards to a single entity will provide consistent hiring practices, inter-rater reliability and fidelity in program certification ratings of the Texas Rising Star Certification Guidelines and equitable caseload distribution. TWC will initiate the procurement process in the summer of 2021, with a new statewide entity expected to take over Texas Rising Star assessment functions beginning in the fall of 2022. The Texas Early Learning Strategic Plan offers a framework for public and private action to achieve the state's vision that all Texas children are ready for school and ready to learn by 2025. TWC will work with TELC to make progress towards these goals, described below.

Check all that apply i CCDF funds ii. State general funds Other funds. Describe: 7.3 Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) or Another System of Quality Improvement Lead Agencies may respond in this section based on other systems of quality improvement, even if not called a QRIS, as long as the other quality improvement system contains the elements of a QRIS. QRIS refers to a systematic framework for evaluating, improving and communicating the level of quality in early childhood programs and contains five key elements: 1. Program standards 2. Supports to programs to improve quality 3. Financial incentives and supports 4. Quality assurance and monitoring 5. Outreach and consumer education 7.3.1 Does your state/territory have a quality rating and improvement system or other system of quality improvement? a. No, the state/territory has no plans for QRIS development. If no, skip to 7.4.1. b. No, but the state/territory is in the QRIS development phase. If no, skip to 7.4.1. c. Yes, the state/territory has a QRIS operating statewide or territory-wide. Describe how the QRIS is administered (e.g., statewide or locally or through CCR&R entities) and any partners, and provide a link, if available. Texas Page 325 of 380The Texas Rising Star program is Texas' Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). Texas Rising Star is a voluntary, quality-based rating system of providers participating in TWC's subsidized child care program. Texas Rising Star certification is available to licensed centers and licensed and registered home child care providers that meet the certification criteria. The Texas Rising Star certification system offers three levels of certification, 2-Star, 3-Star, and 4-Star, to encourage providers to attain progressively higher certification requirements leading to the 4-Star level. TWC establishes the rules and guidelines for the Texas Rising Star program and provides funding to Boards to hire Texas Rising Star mentors and assessors and administer the program. Texas Rising Star mentors provide technical assistance and mentoring services to child care providers that want to become Texas Rising Star certified or achieve higher Texas Rising Star certification levels. Texas Government Code \u00a72308.315 requires the minimum reimbursement rate for a Texas Rising Star-certified program to be greater than the maximum rate established for a program that is not Texas Rising Star certified for the same category of care. Specifically, 2-Star rates must be at least 5 percent higher, 3-Star rates must be at least 7 percent higher, and 4-Star rates must be at least 9 percent higher. In accordance with TWCChapter 809 Child Care Services rule \u00a7809.20(a) , TWC's three-member Commission (Commission) may require Boards to establish maximum reimbursement rates at or above a level established by the Commission. TWC has published each of the Board's maximum reimbursement rates as of October 1, 2021 . The Commission requires Boards to set their Texas Rising Star maximum reimbursement rates at or above the following levels: -For infants, benchmarking to the 85th percentile d. Yes, the state/territory has a QRIS initiative operating as a pilot-test in a few localities or only a few levels but does not have a fully operating initiative on a statewide or territory-wide basis. Provide a link, if available. N/A Texas Page 326 of 380e. Yes, the state/territory has another system of quality improvement. Describe the other system of quality improvement and provide a link, if available. N/A 7.3.2 Indicate how providers participate in the state or territory QRIS or another system of quality improvement. a. Are providers required to participate in the QRIS or another system of quality improvement? Check all that apply if response differs for different categories of care. Participation is voluntary Participation is partially mandatory. For example, participation is mandatory for providers serving children receiving a subsidy, participation is mandatory for all licensed providers or participation is mandatory for programs serving children birth to age 5 receiving a subsidy. If checked, describe the relationship between QRIS participation and subsidy (e.g., minimum rating required, reimbursed at higher rates for achieving higher ratings, participation at any level). On June 18, 2021, the Governor Abbott signed House Bill 2607, effective September 1, 2021, which requires all subsidy providers to participate in Texas Rising Star. TWC will amend Texas Rising Star rules to include an entry level rating for child care providers who meet the minimum screening and eligibility requirements for Texas Rising Star and a maximum length of time a provider may participate at the entry level rating. Providers designated at this entry level rating are not eligible for increased reimbursement rates. TWC will develop a process to allow a child care provider to request a waiver to extend the maximum length of time a provider may participate at the entry level rating, not to exceed 36 months. Participation is required for all providers. b. Which types of settings or distinctive approaches to early childhood education and care participate in the state/territory QRIS or another system of quality improvement? Check all that apply. Texas Page 327 of 380i. Licensed child care centers ii. Licensed family child care homes iii. License-exempt providers iv. Early Head Start programs v. Head Start programs vi. State Prekindergarten or preschool programs vii. Local district-supported Prekindergarten programs viii. Programs serving infants and toddlers ix. Programs serving school-age children x. Faith-based settings xi. Tribally operated programs xii. Other Describe: Department of Defense-operated child care facilities and licensed Early Head Start or Head Start programs that offer wraparound child care services c. Describe how the Lead Agency's QRIS, or other system for improving quality, considers how quality may look different in the different types of provider settings which participate in the QRIS or other system of quality improvement. For instance, does the system of quality improvement consider what quality looks like in a family child care home with mixed-age groups vs. child care centers with separate age groups? Or are standards related to quality environments flexible enough to define quality in home-based environments, as well as child care center environments? Texas Rising Star includes measures that are specifically designed to consider the infrastructure, staff compilation, and environments of a center-based program, registered or licensed home, and a program that only provides after-school care. The Facility Assessment Record Form identifies these three types of programs and outlines what measures and scoring criteria is reviewed to determine the level of quality being provided. Texas Page 328 of 380 7.3.3 Identify how the state or territory supports and assesses the quality of child care providers. The Lead Agency may invest in the development, implementation, or enhancement of a tiered quality rating and improvement system for child care providers and services or another system of quality improvement. Note: If a Lead Agency decides to invest CCDF quality dollars in a QRIS, that agency can use the funding to assist in meeting consumer education requirements (98.33). Do the state/territory's quality improvement standards align with or have reciprocity with any of the following standards? No Yes. If yes, check the type of alignment, if any, between the state/territory's quality standards and other standards. Check all that apply. a. Programs that meet state/territory PreK standards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standards is the same, there is a reciprocal agreement between PreK programs and the quality improvement system) . b. Programs that meet federal Head Start Program Performance Standards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standards is the same, there is a reciprocal agreement between Head Start programs and the quality improvement system). c. Programs that meet national accreditation standards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standards is the same, an alternative pathway exists to meeting the standards). d. Programs that meet all or part of state/territory school-age quality standards. e. Other. Describe: N/A Texas Page 329 of 380 7.3.4 Do the state/territory's quality standards build on its licensing requirements and other regulatory requirements? No Yes. If yes, check any links between the state/territory's quality standards and licensing requirements a. Requires that a provider meet basic licensing requirements to qualify for the base level of the QRIS. b. Embeds licensing into the QRIS c. State/territory license is a \"rated\" license d.Other. Describe: Texas Rising Star certification is built upon minimum licensing standards. To be eligible for Texas Rising Star certification, a provider must not be on corrective or adverse action with CCR. Additionally, a provider is not eligible to apply for Texas Rising Star certification if, during the most recent 12-month licensing history, the provider: -was cited for any specified CCR minimum standard in Section 3 of the initial screening form; -has 15 or more total CCR high or medium-high weighted licensing deficiencies; or -was cited for specified CCR minimum standards regarding weapons and ammunition. On January 5, 2021, the Commission approved amendments to TWC's Child Care Services rules to add a Pre-Star designation ( \u00a7809.2 (18)) and a requirement that all subsidy providers meet the Pre-Star requirements ( \u00a7809.91 (a)(1)). Additionally, TWC has identified several licensing standards that, if violated, will result in an immediate star level drop or the loss of Texas Rising Star Certification 7.3.5 Does the state/territory provide financial incentives and other supports designed to expand the full diversity of child care options and help child care providers improve the quality of services that are provided through the QRIS or another system of quality Texas Page 330 of 380improvement. No Yes. If yes, check all that apply a. If yes, indicate in the table below which categories of care receive this support. i.

Other: Some of the items above are offered by Boards at their discretion. Additionally, Boards may provide locally designed financial incentives and support to expand the diversity of child care options and improve the quality of child care services available in their workforce area. On June 29, 2021 , TWC's three-member Commission authorized distributing CRRSA funds to Boards, to provide targeted support to incent increased and ongoing participating in Texas Rising Star, as follows: -Targeted recruitment and outreach activities to expand the number of providers participating in Texas Rising Star , with specified goals for the number of new Texas Rising Star-certified programs to be certified. Funds may be used to assist providers in addressing the requirements to become Texas Rising Star certified. Boards are encouraged to outreach all subsidy providers who do not currently participate in Texas Rising Star and conducting a facilitated self- assessment to determine if they can be certified. -Incentives for newly certified providers and current providers who reach and sustain higher levels of quality . Consideration of enhanced incentives for providers in rural areas, for home-based providers, or for providers offering care during nontraditional hours. Consideration of enhanced incentives for providers who have lower teacher/child ratios. Incentives may include offering providers curriculum, professional development, classroom materials, outdoor environment improvements, or one-time bonus payments, which providers may choose how to use on the aforementioned items or other program support, as well as for staff bonuses to incent and support staff retention. -Targeted coaching and resources to assist providers in strengthening their Texas Page 333 of 380business practices. This may include strategies for providers regarding improvements to their enrollment efficiency, which can reduce their operational costs. Boards are encouraged to consider how to assist providers who may be facing challenges in obtaining or retaining their Texas Rising Star certification by addressing the issues and underlying concerns that cause the provider to obtain a licensing deficiency. Boards are encouraged to employ targeted strategies for providers pursing TRS certification, and support strategies, based on a provider's initial self-assessment or pre-assessment, which allow those providers to address their individualized needs. -Targeted strategies to assist Texas Rising Star Providers to succeed in meeting the goals of their individualized Continuous Quality Improvement Plans (CQIP), which could include training and resources on inclusive care, providing child care during nontraditional hours, improving program design to address the needs of English language learners, measuring and improving teacher/child interactions or child progress monitoring. Boards may implement other strategies with approval from TWC's Child Care and Early Learning (CC&EL) Division. 7.3.6 Describe the measurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 7.3 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. As described in Section 7.1.1, TWC tracks the number and percent age of: -subsidized providers participating in Texas Rising Star; -subsidized children in Texas Rising Star-certified provider care; -Texas Rising Star providers as a share of regulated providers; and -Texas Rising Star providers by provider type (center-based, registered home, and licensed home).Child Care by the Numbers: https://www.twc.texas.gov/childcarenumbers/Texas_Statewide_System_monthly.html Additionally, TWC tracks the number of: -providers receiving financial supports (onetime or ongoing grants/stipends); -provider staff receiving scholarships, bonuses, or wage supplements; and -providers receiving financial or mentoring support to achieve national accreditation. Data for these measures as of September 2020: Measure: Number of providers receiving financial support (onetime grants/stipends) 1,021 support periodic grants/stipends) In FY 2018: 137 2020: 325 Measure: Number of provider staff members receiving scholarships, bonuses, or wage supplements In FY 2018: of providers receiving financial or mentoring support to achieve national accreditation In FY 2018: 118 In FY 2019: 135 In FY 2020: 74 Beginning in 2021, Texas Rising Star also requires providers to participate in a Continuous Quality Improvement Plan (CQIP) that is jointly developed and managed by a provider and their mentor. To support the CQI framework, TWC has directed funding for CLI to add features to the Engage system to collect data on each provider's quality improvement goals, strategies, and progress.

It can be coordinated, to the extent determined appropriate by the Lead Agency, by a statewide public or private non-profit, community-based, or regionally based lead child care resource and referral organization (658E(c)(3)(B)(iii)). This effort may include activities done by local or regional child care and resource referral agencies, as discussed in section 1.7. 7.5.1 What are the services provided by the local or regional child care and resource and referral agencies? The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) does not fund Child Care Resource & Referral (CCR&R) entities. However, TWC's 28 Local Workforce Development Boards and their Texas Page 344 of 380child care contractors provide some of the same services that CCR&Rs provide. All Boards provide consumer education and enrollment assistance for child care services. All Boards also work to expand the supply of and quality of child care, through their oversight of the Texas Rising Star certification program. Some Boards, but not all, analyze supply and demand data for child care services. Three Local Workforce Development Boards (Borderplex, Dallas, and Gulf Coast) child care contractors are a part of the Texas Association of CCR&R. http://www.taccrra.net/ TWC will explore opportunities for improving the provision of resource and referral information through our existing infrastructure, working in partnership with our 28 Local Boards. 7.5.2 Describe the measurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 7.5 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. TWC does not provide funding directly to CCR&R entities; therefore, TWC does not have measures for this activity. 7.6 Facilitating Compliance With State Standards 7.6.1 What activities does your state/territory fund with CCDF quality funds to facilitate child care providers' compliance with state/territory health and safety requirements? These requirements may be related to inspections, monitoring, training, compliance with health and safety standards, and with state/territory licensing standards as outlined in Section 5. Describe: Texas Page 345 of 380 7.6.1 What activities does your state/territory fund with CCDF quality funds to facilitate child care providers' compliance with state/territory health and safety requirements? These requirements may be related to inspections, monitoring, training, compliance with health and safety standards, and with state/territory licensing standards as outlined in Section 5. Describe: The Texas legislature annually appropriates and directs TWC to transfer approximately $28 million in CCDF funds to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to supplement Child Care Regulation's (CCR) duties of licensing and monitoring child care facilities, and to support health and safety training for child care facilities. Many Boards also spend a portion of their quality funds on health and safety trainings, such as CPR training, defibrillator training, security systems training, and others. 7.6.2 Does the state/territory provide financial assistance to support child care providers in complying with minimum health and safety requirements? No Yes. If yes, which types of providers can access this financial assistance?

No Yes. If yes, describe any tools used to measure child, family, teacher, classroom, or provider improvements, and how the state/territory evaluates how those tools positively impact children. TWC Chapter 809 Child Care Services rules require staff to review and update the Texas Rising Star guidelines every four years at a minimum. As part of this review, TWC analyzes data from Texas Rising Star facilities and classroom assessments and monitoring. TWC uses this information to evaluate the Texas Rising Star measures and to assess: -Texas Rising Star assessor inter-rater reliability; -measures with a high or low compliance rate; and -when feasible, other data points that may indicate a correlation between Texas Rising Star measures and other outcomes, such as caregiver turnover, child continuity of care, and parent employment outcomes. TWC contracted for the Strengthening Texas Rising Star Implementation study in order to evaluate and identify opportunities to strengthen the Texas Rising Star program. The Texas Rising Star four-year review was completed in 2019. Based on Texas Page 348 of 380the findings of the study and the recommendations of the stakeholder workgroup, TWC revised the measures and categories within the assessment tools and added further requirements, including participation in a Continuous Quality Improvement Plan (CQIP). Implementation is expected to begin in April 2021. Contents and progress of programs' CQIPs will be evaluated to understand provider needs, strengths, and trends. Additionally, TWC partnered with the Children's Learning Institute (CLI) to provide training sessions designed specifically for Texas Rising Star staff assessors and mentors, including a certification program for Texas Rising Star staff assessors and mentors and a micro-credential program for Texas Rising Star mentors. Effectiveness of the Child Care Program Texas Labor Code \u00a7302.0043 requires TWC to evaluate the child care program's effectiveness in helping parents who receive subsidized child care maintain employment. TWC is required to submit a report to the Texas legislature every odd- numbered year providing the following information. Parent Employment and Wage Outcomes Section 302.0043(a) directs TWC to compile and report the following five-year trends- statewide and by local workforce development area (workforce area)-regarding the wage and employment status of each parent receiving TWC-funded child care: -If the parent receives both Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and subsidized child care, whether the parent: -finds employment; and -maintains the employment after one year. -If the parent receives only subsidized child care, whether the parent: -maintains the employment; and -experiences a change in earnings after one year of employment. -If the parent leaves the child care program: -the parent's reason for leaving the program; and -whether the parent returns to TANF or becomes a TANF recipient for the first time. Improving Quality: Professional Development and Program Coordination Section 302.0043 also requires TWC to measure the effectiveness of its child care program in: -improving the training of child care professionals; -facilitating collaboration with Early Head Start (EHS) or Head Start (HS), the Texas Education Agency (TEA), the Texas Department of Family Protective Services (DFPS), and the Texas Health and Human Services Commission Texas Page 349 of 380(HHSC); -coordinating with TEA to assign Public Education Information Management System (PEIMS) numbers to children younger than age six who are enrolled in the program; -coordinating with TEA, school districts, and open-enrollment charter schools on any prekindergarten (pre-K) quality improvement efforts; -increasing coordination between providers participating in the program, school districts, and open-enrollment charter schools; -facilitating child care provider enrollment in the Texas Rising Star program and helping providers obtain the highest rating level; and -developing and implementing rates and payments, as determined by Local Workforce Development Boards (Boards), to: -allow providers to deliver high-quality child care; and -ensure that TWC meets performance measures established by the legislature for the average number of children served per day by the program. Texas Rising Star Program Section 302.0043 also requires TWC to report on the following data regarding the Texas Rising Star program: -The total number of child care providers that are participating in the Texas Rising Star program in each workforce area and the number of 2-Star-, 3-Star-, and 4- Star-rated child care providers in the workforce area -The number of child care providers participating in the Texas Rising Star program in each workforce area as a percentage of the total number of both subsidized child care providers and all child care providers in the workforce area -The number of 2-Star-, 3-Star-, and 4-Star-rated child care providers in the workforce area as a percentage of the total number of both subsidized child care providers and all child care providers in the workforce area -The total number of children participating in subsidized child care with Texas Rising Star providers in each workforce area and the number of children participating in subsidized child care with 2-Star-, 3-Star-, and 4-Star-rated child care providers in the workforce area -The number of children participating in subsidized child care with Texas Rising Star providers in each workforce area as a percentage of the total number of children participating in subsidized child care in the workforce area -The number of children participating in subsidized child care with 2-Star-, 3-Star-, and 4-Star-rated child care providers in the workforce area as a percentage of the total number of children participating in subsidized child care in the workforce area Stakeholder Input Section 302.00435 requires TWC to summarize input obtained from TEA, school districts, open-enrollment charter schools, subsidized child care providers, relevant businesses, and the public on the child care program and any recommendations for Texas Page 350 of 380legislation or regulation, including regulatory recommendations for governmental bodies other than TWC. The most recent report is available at https://www.twc.texas.gov/students/child-care- program-evaluation-effectiveness . Other Data Analysis Systems Texas Ready Communities, Ready Schools, and Ready Students Texas Ready Communities, Ready Schools, and Ready Students (TXR3) is an analytic tool that uses data from TEA's Early Childhood Data System (ECDS), the Texas Rising Star program, and professional development data from the TEA- and TWC-supported Engage platform at the Children's Learning Institute (CLI) at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Based on user selections, TXR3 generates custom reports and graphics to visualize the combined data to provide insight regarding communities, schools, and students. Public Education Information Management System In 2020, TWC worked with TEA to begin assigning all children in the child care subsidy program a PEIMS unique identifier number that the child will carry into the public school system. TEA and TWC will develop a plan for analyzing and sharing information that will become available through this new longitudinal data. Classroom Assessments of Quality TWC funds Texas School Ready, which is a free teacher coaching and assessment tool provided by CLI. It is available to all child care providers in the subsidy program and to other early learning programs. Boards also have the option of using their quality funds to provide classroom coaching and assessment services. For example, the following six Boards fund the CLASS training and assessment tool: Tarrant County, Dallas County, North Central Texas, Southeast Texas, North Texas, and Lower Rio Grande Valley. Contracted Slots Section 302.0461 allows Boards to contract with child care providers for a specified number of slots to be reserved for children participating in child care subsidies. To Texas Page 351 of 380qualify for a contract with Boards for reserved slots, providers must meet the following criteria: -Be a Texas Rising Star 3- or 4-Star provider -Meet one of the following: -Be located in a child care \"desert\" or area determined to be underserved -Have a pre-K partnership -Have an EHS or HS partnership -Increase the number of places reserved for high-quality infant and toddler care -Satisfy a requirement for the Board's strategic plan The statute also requires Boards that opt to use contracted slots to submit reports every twelve months evaluating the contract's effect on: -the financial stability of the child care provider participating in the contract; -the availability of high-quality child care options for participants in TWC's subsidized child care program in the workforce area; -the number of high-quality child care providers in any part of the workforce area with a high concentration of families that need child care; and -the percentage of children participating in TWC's subsidized child care program at each Texas Rising Star program provider in the workforce area. To measure providers' financial stability, Boards must report the following for each age group at each contracted provider upon initiating the contract and every twelve months thereafter: -Number of classrooms -Strategy or priority area supported (child care desert, underserved area, pre-K partnerships, EHS or HS partnership, infant and toddler slots, or Board priority) -Number of slots contracted -Total number of children enrolled -Vacancy rate -Cost per child -Percentage of tuition collected To measure the effect of contracted slots on the availability of high-quality child care options in the workforce area, Boards must report the following for each strategy or priority area used upon initiating the contract and every twelve months thereafter: -Number of 3- or 4-Star providers supporting the strategy -Percentage of 3- or 4-Star providers supporting the strategy -Number of slots at 3- or 4-Star providers supporting the strategy To measure Texas Rising Star providers in any part of the workforce area with a high concentration of families that need child care, Boards must report the following for each identified region upon initiating the contract and every twelve months thereafter: -Number of 3- or 4-Star providers in the region -Percentage of 3- or 4-Star providers in the region Texas Page 352 of 380-Number of slots at 3- or 4-Star providers in the region 7.7.2 Describe the measurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 7.7 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services in child care centers and family child care homes within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures.

TWC began this comprehensive review in May 2019 and recently completed it, with revised guidelines effective January 25, 2021. Stakeholders are a critical component of this review. TWC convened a workgroup to review the Texas Rising Star guidelines and recommend revisions. Over an eight-month period, the workgroup met regularly to review the Texas Rising Star guidelines in detail and to engage in a collaborative effort to improve the guidelines' standards. The TWC-commissioned Strengthening Texas Rising Star Implementation Study conducted by the Children's Learning Institute (CLI) at the University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, provided valuable data and research during the review process. CLI's findings and the workgroup's proposed revisions are available on the Texas Rising Star Workgroup web page at https://twc.texas.gov/partners/texas-rising-star-workgroup . TWC will continue to hold focus groups and stakeholder engagement meetings to understand child care providers' needs related to quality activities. TWC will also work with Boards to understand the needs they are addressing through their quality- improvement activities. 7.9.2 Describe the measurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 7.9 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. Child Care by the Numbers TWC released Child Care by the Numbers , an overview of subsidized child care data since October 2014. The 86th Texas Legislature directed TWC to publish annual information on providers participating in Texas Rising Star as well as the number of Texas Page 357 of 380children enrolled in Texas Rising Star programs. Child Care by the Numbers not only provides annual data but will also include quarterly updates for the most recent year and provide information at the state level and for each of the 28 Boards. Continuous Quality-Improvement Plans TWC is implementing continuous quality-improvement plans in 2021 and will internally evaluate that data to understand child care programs' strengths, needs, and trends related to Texas Rising Star standards. This will inform Texas Rising Star standards as well as TWC's investments and guidance related to quality-improvement supports, including funding and training. 7.10 Other Quality Improvement Activities 7.10.1 List and describe any other activities that the state/territory provides to improve the quality of child care services for infants and toddlers, preschool-aged, and school- aged children, which may include consumer and provider education activities; and also describe the measurable indicators of progress for each activity relevant to this use of funds that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving provider preparedness, child safety, child well-being, or kindergarten entry, and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures.

Lead Agencies are required to have processes in place to identify fraud and other program violations to ensure program integrity. Program violations can include both intentional and unintentional client and/or provider violations, as defined by the Lead Agency. These violations and errors, identified through the error-rate review process, may result in payment or nonpayment (administrative) errors and may or may not be the result of fraud, based on the Lead Agency definition. Check and describe any activities that the Lead Agency conducts to ensure program integrity. a. Check and describe all activities that the Lead Agency conducts, including the results of these activities, to identify and prevent fraud or intentional program violations. Include in the description how each activity assists in the identification and prevention of fraud and intentional program violations. i. Share/match data from other programs (e.g., TANF program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), Medicaid) or other databases (e.g., State Directory of New Hires, Social Security Administration, Public Assistance Reporting Information System (PARIS)). Describe the activities and the results of these activities: As described below, TWC matches child care program data with data from the state's Unemployment Insurance program and state wage records. Results: Reports are sent to each of the 28 Board areas who then research each case and reach out to the client to inquire about the report and work to resolve the issue. These activities have increased accountability and integrity by ensuring CCDF is only expended on eligible families. ii. Run system reports that flag errors (include types). Describe the activities and the results of these activities: TWC's TA Bulletin 276, issued December 22, 2016, and titled \"Child Care Fraud Detection Report Tools- Update,\" provides Boards with information on child care fraud detection reports. TWC provides these reports through SRM and The Workforce Information System of Texas (TWIST) to help Boards detect potential Texas Page 365 of 380fraud. Results: These reports have helped Texas identify and investigate potential fraud and fraud detection activities have also led to the substantiation of fraud. From October 1, 2019, to the end of State Fiscal Year 2020 (August 31, 2020), Texas' 28 Boards opened 377 cases for fact-finding and closed 251. Of the 251 cases closed, $226,580 in overpayments were established. Child Care and Unemployment Insurance Early Warning Report Purpose and Discussion: The Child Care and Unemployment Insurance Early Warning Report is a tool to assist Boards in the oversight of CCDF funds. SRM sends this report to Boards twice a month, normally on the first and third Wednesdays of each month. The report seeks to identify and assess customers who may have experienced a non-temporary change in work activities because they filed an unemployment insurance (UI) claim advising TWC that they are not working. The objective is to prevent child care overpayments by identifying customers before their three-month job search period expires. Customers identified in the report are not necessarily ineligible for services. Potential child care eligibility issues are resolved by verifying customers' employment or training status using current local procedures. This also provides an opportunity for child care contractors to verify that customers have reported their UI benefits income for child care eligibility. Results: Boards connect unemployed parents with other Workforce services. These activities help parents re-engage in work or education so they can continue their eligibility for subsidized child care beyond the three months of continued care. Identifying and assisting parents who become unemployed helps to ensure that limited funds are used to serve only eligible families and to promote their self- sufficiency. Methodology: The Child Care and Unemployment Insurance Early Warning Report identifies active child care customers whose eligibility is based on their employment but who have recently filed for UI benefits and reported to TWC that they are unemployed or have had a reduction in work hours. Texas Page 366 of 380 Child Care Income Report Purpose and Discussion: The Child Care Income Report is a tool to assist Boards in the oversight of CCDF funds. SRM sends this report to Boards quarterly. The report seeks to identify and assess customers who are potentially ineligible due to parental/custodial changes or underreporting of income. A customer identified in the report is not necessarily ineligible for services; the issue of eligibility can be established only after a thorough review of the customer's case file and can involve contacting the customer for further information. Results: Boards review the report and contact clients to review their reported income to identify if family income exceeds85% SMI. If family income has increased over 85% of SMI while allowing for temporary and irregular fluctuations, the client's child care is ended. These activities ensure that child care subsidies are only paid for eligible children. Methodology: The Child Care Income Report excludes from consideration customers funded through Child Protective Services, foster care, or the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act (WIOA) dislocated worker program-funding sources that are not subject to federal income eligibility limits. The methodology for generating the report is to compare all currently available income sources for the parent/custodian of a child care recipient to the 85 percent of state median income (SMI) level, using the known family size identified in TWIST. Currently available income sources for generating the report include UI wage records, UI benefit payments, and TANF payments. TWIST Web Reports Child Care Cases/Clients with the Same Social Security Number (SSN) Report The Child Care Cases with the Same SSN Report lists parent/guardian duplicated SSNs that have a payment in more than one workforce area in the same service month. The Child Care Clients with the Same SSN Report lists children's duplicated SSNs that have a payment in more than one workforce area in the same service month. Note: An SSN is not required but may be voluntarily provided by the parent. Results: Boards review the reports and contact clients to determine if the social Texas Page 367 of 380security number provided is correct. Boards will take action to resolve and correct data entry errors and may initiate fact-finding for potential fraud if appropriate. These activities help ensure child care subsidies are only paid for eligible children and also increases integrity of program data. iii. Review enrollment documents and attendance or billing records Describe the activities and the results of these activities: Boards ensure that attendance is reviewed with each billing cycle. Additionally, Boards ensure that staff members conduct quality assurance reviews of enrollment documents and billing records. Records are also reviewed by Boards' independent audit providers and SRM staff. Results: If local or independent monitoring activities discover any issues, Boards investigate and resolve the issues by reaching out to the client or completing additional reviews based on identified issues. This may involve a fraud investigation. Additionally, when SRM staff complete monitoring activities, findings are relayed to the Board for further training and any identified improper payments are recovered by TWC. These activities help ensure child care subsidies are only paid for eligible children and that payments are accurate, and also increases integrity of program data. iv. Conduct supervisory staff reviews or quality assurance reviews. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: Boards ensure that Board or contractor staff conducts quality assurance reviews before eligibility determination, in response to risks identified through reports or other means and as random spot checks. Results: If issues are discovered, Board's review with staff and resolve issues through internal processes or by contacting the client for additional information before eligibility can be determined. These activities help ensure child care subsidies are only paid for eligible children and that payments are accurate. v. Audit provider records.

These waivers will be considered \u00e2extraordinary circumstance waivers\u00e2 to provide relief from the timeline for completing the MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology and the narrow cost analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. These waivers are limited to a one-year period. Approval of these waiver requests is subject to and contingent on OCC review and approval of responses in Section 4, questions 4.2.1 and 4.2.5. To submit a Market Rate Survey (MRS) or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology or a Narrow Cost Analysis waiver, complete the form below. Check and describe each provision for which the Lead Agency is requesting a time-limited waiver extension. Appendix A.2: The Narrow Cost Analysis (See related question 4.2.5.) 1. Describe the provision (Narrow Cost Analysis) from which the state/territory seeks relief. Include the reason why in these extraordinary circumstances, the Lead Agency is seeking relief from this provision. TWC completes the MRS annually and contracts with the Texas Institute for Child & Family Wellbeing in partnership with the Ray Marshall Center for the Study of Human Resources to conduct this survey. The current survey format does not include information as outlined in \u00a798.45(f)(ii) on the estimate cost of care (narrow cost analysis). TWC funded a statewide cost study over 2020-2021. This study has collected and Texas Page 380 of 380analyzed the data required for a narrow cost analysis. However, the study also took place during the midst of COVID-19. TWC is in the process of completing thenarrow cost analysis and plans to publish in Fiscal Year 2022. TWC seeks a waiver of the narrow cost analysis to provide more time to analyze the results of the study and seek stakeholder input. 2. Describe how a waiver of the provision will, by itself, improve the delivery of child care services for children. A waiver of this provision will provide time for TWC to conduct and review additional study data and to analyze of the child care market in Texas, to improve rate-setting methodology and enable improvements to the delivery of child care services. 3. Certify and describe how the health, safety, and well-being of children served through assistance received through CCDF will not be compromised as a result of the waiver. The MRS provides TWC with data on child care provider rates in Texas annually, which allows TWC to raise provider reimbursement rates timely to align with market increases. This waiver will have no effect on the health, safety, and well-being of children served. Texas Page 381 of 380 "}
