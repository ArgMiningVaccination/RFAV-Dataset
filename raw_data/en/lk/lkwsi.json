The Federal Trade Commission has issued an enforcement policy statement that requires over-the-counter (OTC) homeopathic drugs and products makers to [disclose in their advertisement and labeling that there is no evidence that Homeopathic products are effective](http://www.vox.com/2016/11/18/13676834/ftc-homeopathy-crackdown-regulation) and also mention that modern medical experts don't recognize any claims of effectiveness only based on homeopathic theories. From a report on Vox: This FTC ruling is definitely a step in the right direction of raising awareness about the lack of evidence behind homeopathy. \"This is a real victory for reason, science, and the health of the American people,\" said Michael De Dora, public policy director for the Center for Inquiry, a science-based advocacy and education group that's been pushing for more homeopathy oversight. \"The FTC has made the right decision to hold manufacturers accountable for the absolutely baseless assertions they make about homeopathic products.\" But it doesn't mean these \"medicines\" will disappear from store shelves. The FTC only has the right to crack down on misleading marketing claims, and if the makers of homeopathic remedies clearly state that their products are based on no science, they can still sell them.
