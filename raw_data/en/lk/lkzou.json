Summary A process development scientist might be responsible for developing a cell culture process for the manufacture of viruses or proteins that are used in the production of vaccines. Once a new product has been developed and approved for manufacture, a process development scientist finds out how to produce the product on a large scale with standardized protocols. In setting up and supervising initial and ongoing production, a process development scientist always is looking for ways to make improvements in methods and technology by reviewing and interpreting analytical test results and data. Process development scientists often use sophisticated technology to monitor production and identify faults. They work closely with research scientists, with process engineers and with quality control technicians. Combining extensive knowledge of biotechnology and biomanufacturing, process development scientists also use computer-aided design models to develop manufacturing processes. As a process development scientist, you must have an investigative and analytical mind and a methodical approach to testing new processes. You will need to be creative and have strong problem-solving skills as well. Good teamwork and motivation skills are essential, as is the ability to write and communicate effectively. Process development scientists will find jobs available across the manufacturing industry, on products ranging from biopharmaceuticals to foods, fuels and cosmetics. Educational Requirements Process development scientists will need at least a four-year Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree. Advanced degrees such as a Master's or a doctorate may be required for some positions. Degrees in chemistry or biology will provide solid foundations; while more targeted degrees might include biochemistry, biotechnology, genetics, microbiology, molecular biology and pharmaceutical science. Median Salary 2019 According to payscale.com, the median salary of a Process Development Scientist in 2019 was $70,596. Want to know more?
