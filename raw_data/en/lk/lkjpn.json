Clinical Overview Use Spirulina is available in the United States as a health food or supplement. Claims of immunostimulatory, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, effects exist; however, evidence supporting these claims is limited, and spirulina cannot be recommended for any specific use. Dosing Clinical data are insufficient to guide therapeutic dosing of spirulina. Dosages in clinical studies have ranged from 1 to 10 g/day, usually in divided doses, given for up to 12 months. Contraindications Phenylketonuria has occurred; however, an association with spirulina has not been substantiated. Pregnancy/Lactation Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Because of the possible presence of mercury and other heavy metal contaminants in spirulina, use should be avoided during pregnancy. Interactions None well documented. Adverse Reactions Few reports of adverse reactions are available. Cases of anaphylaxis and spirulina-associated hepatotoxicity have been reported, and reactions from heavy metal contamination are possible. Toxicology Spirulina is considered nontoxic to humans at usual levels of consumption and has \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) status according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, information is limited. Scientific Family - Phormidiaceae Biology Spirulina, a blue-green algae (cyanophytes/cyanobacteria), grows as microscopic, corkscrew-shaped multicellular filaments and is now classified as a distinct genus, Arthrospira (also known as and formerly classified as Spirulina). A. platensis is found in Africa and Asia, and A. maxima is found in Central America. [Ciferri 1983](#6420655), [Kulshreshtha 2008](#18855693) Spirulina is free growing and exists only in high-salt alkaline water in subtropical and tropical areas, sometimes imparting a dark-green color to bodies of water. [Ciferri 1985](#3933408) Spirulina is noted for its characteristic behavior in carbonated water and its energetic growth in laboratory cultures. [Dillon 1995](#7732699) It is commercially grown in the United States and has been proposed as a primary foodstuff to be cultivated during long-term space missions because it withstands extreme conditions. [G\u00f2dia 2002](#12385718), [Robb-Nicholson 2006](#17228442) Due to its unique growth requirements, contamination of open pond cultures of spirulina by other microorganisms is usually slight, with the alga growing as a relatively pure culture. For information on red, blue, or green algae, see the Seaweed monograph. History Spirulina has been described in the literature since the 16th century. Spanish explorers observed the Aztecs harvesting a blue mud that probably consisted of spirulina. The mud, which was dried to form chips or flavored bread, was obtained from Lake Texcoco near Mexico City. Spirulina was also harvested in the Sahara Desert from small lakes near Lake Chad, where it was called \"dihe\" and consumed by the local population. [Ciferri 1983](#6420655) Spirulina is currently marketed by numerous companies as a nutritional supplement. [Khan 2005](#16248810) Chemistry Spirulina is composed of approximately 65% crude protein, high levels of B-complex amino acids, [Ciferri 1983](#6420655), [Maranesi 1984](#6442827) and the total protein is nutritionally superior to legume protein but inferior to meat protein. [Ciferri 1983](#6420655) The proteins C-phycocyanin and allophycocyanin in spirulina have the focus of much research. [Patil 2008](#18295479), [Yoshikawa 2008](#18567296) High levels of gamma are 2007](#17487827) Spirulina preparations contain 300 to 400 ppm of iron (dry weight) and, unlike many forms of plant iron, have high bioavailability when ingested by humans. A dosage of 10 g/day can contain 1.5 to 2 mg of absorbable iron, similar to that of standard ferrous sulfate. [Kapoor 1993](#8464842), [Kapoor 1993](#8332584) Trace elements present at high levels include manganese, selenium, and zinc. Calcium, potassium, and magnesium are also concentrated in the organism. [Johnson 1986](#Johnson.1986) Calcium spirulan, a sulfated polysaccharide from been characterized. [Hayashi 1996](#8984158) Uses and Pharmacology Clinical trials have investigated spirulina's potential clinical applications but have been too small to support its purported effects. [Karkos 2011](#18955364) Allergic rhinitis and asthma In vitro data In vitro data have suggested that C-phycocyanin exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, selectively inhibiting release of histamine from rat mast cells and preventing increases in immunoglobulin E. [Remirez 2002](#12061428) Clinical data A small study in patients with mild to moderate asthma (N=34) suggested that spirulina supplementation (1 g/day) produced improvement in lung function parameters. [Labhe 2001](#Labhe.2001) A study evaluating spirulina in patients with allergic rhinitis (N=36) suggested a positive effect on laboratory values, but no clinical outcomes were reported. [Mao 2005](#15857205) In a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled allergic rhinitis (N=150), spirulina 2 g/day was superior to placebo with regard to diary-based symptom scores of nasal discharge. [Cingi 2008](#18343939) Antibacterial/Antifungal activity Animal and in vitro data In vitro, spirulina demonstrated some activity against common human bacterial pathogens but less than that of the standard comparator. [Ozdemir 2004](#15478198) Immune stimulation by phycocyanin and polysaccharides of spirulina antifungal and antibacterial effects in mice. [El-Sheekh 2010](#20336506) Antioxidant effects Animal and in vitro data In vitro, the antioxidant activity of selenium-containing phycocyanin was evaluated using 4 different free-radical scavenging assays; results indicated that phycocyanin. [Chen cellular assays of activity, 4 commercial spirulina preparations were active. [Dartsch 2008](#18398928) Another in vitro study determined that both the phycocyanin and nonphycocyanin bioactive compounds in a novel A. platensis-based aqueous cyanophyta extract contributed to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects without a negative impact on blood clotting. In the presence of phycocyanin, nonphycocyanin, and aqueous cyanophyta extract, time for clot formation and lysis was not affected; however, clots were significantly more robust, with the effect statistically significant (P<0.05) at doses between 125 and 500 mcg/mL. Lipoxygenase inhibition was associated specifically with the nonphycocyanin components. [Jensen 2015](#25764268) In one study, spirulina supplementation in rats did not increase plasma or liver alpha-tocopherol levels [Garc\u00eda-Mart\u00ednez 2007](#18271281); however, another study in rats reported effective antioxidant activity using combinations of whey protein and spirulina. [Gad 2011](#20708378) In another study, C-phycocyanin spirulina in hamsters fed an atherogenic diet. [Riss 2007](#17696484) Similarly, in rabbits fed a 4-week high-cholesterol diet to induce hypercholesterolemia, an additional 8 weeks of spirulina 1% or 5% added to feed protected against oxidative stress. [Kim 2010](#20210608) In mice with zymosan-induced arthritis, phycocyanin exerted a scavenging action against reactive oxygen species, and also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in various in vitro and in vivo models. [Remirez 2002](#12061427) Pretreatment with spirulina 180 mg/kg orally in a rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model reduced neurologic deficits and histological changes. [Thaakur 2010](#20700612) A systematic review of preclinical in vivo and in vitro studies evaluating effects of spirulina (Arthrospira) and its extracts against specific toxicity induced by environmental and occupational pollutants showed strong antioxidant effects of spirulina, particularly of the C-phycocyanin protein, which has been shown to exhibit up to 20 times more antioxidant activity than ascorbic acid. [Martinez-Galero 2016](#26439611) Clinical data Limited clinical studies suggest antioxidant effects of spirulina, but clinical importance has not been demonstrated. [Deng 2010](#20633020), [McCarty 2007](#18158824), [Szulinska 2017](#28617537) In one small clinical no effect on plasma antioxidant status. [Shyam activity small, double-blind, trial assessed the impact of aqueous cyanophyta extract from spirulina (2.3 g/day, equivalent to approximately 1 g/day of phycocyanin) on coagulation and platelet activation in adults with chronic pain. After 2 weeks, no significant difference was observed in platelet aggregation, platelet P-selectin expression, serum levels of soluble partial thromboplastin time, thrombin clotting time, or fibrinogen activity between the aqueous cyanophyta extract and placebo groups. Significant improvement in primary pain scores at rest and when active was noted in the aqueous cyanophyta extract group (P<0.01) and between groups (P<0.05). The liver enzyme AST was also significantly reduced in the aqueous cyanophyta extract group (P<0.001). Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 and activation of Nrf2 by phycocyanin have been identified as likely mechanisms of action. [Jensen 2016](#27362442) Antiviral activity It has been suggested that cultures in which large amounts of algae are consumed have lower levels of HIV infection. [Teas 2004](#15050097) Spirulina and its extracts have been evaluated for antiviral activity. In vitro data One in vitro study found that the sulfated polysaccharide calcium spirulan interfered with the replication of several enveloped viruses, including herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, mumps, measles, influenza A, and HIV-1. [Hayashi 1996](#8984158) Another study described a slightly different range of viruses susceptible to the extract. [Hern\u00e1ndez-Corona 2002](#12406511) HIV-1 adsorption and penetration were inhibited by an aqueous extract of spirulina, and a crude hot water extract reduced HIV-1 replication. [Teas 2004](#15050097) This type of in vitro activity is common to acidic polysaccharides from a variety of sources. Enterovirus is also susceptible to spirulina, with allophycocyanin being the active constituent. [Shih 2003](#12629652) Clinical data An evidence-based review (14 studies including 1,725 adults and 271 children) evaluated the effects of nutritional supplements, including spirulina, in HIV-infected individuals. The reviewers stated that firm conclusions could not be drawn because of the small sample sizes and heterogeneity among studies. Risk of mortality was not significantly altered with nutritional supplementary food or supplemental spirulina compared with control (placebo or no supplement) in malnourished, antiretroviral therapy-naive adults in the 2 studies evaluating this outcome. In an 8-week pediatric study evaluating effects of spirulina 10 g/day (in addition to traditional meals) on anthropometric measures, no benefit was observed compared with control (traditional meal only group). In general, the available evidence did not support the use of specific macronutrients, whey protein, or spirulina to improve anthropometric, immunologic, or clinical outcomes in HIV-infected and children. [Grobler 2013](#23450554) In a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, comparative pilot trial conducted in 66 interferon-naive adults with unresponsive chronic hepatitis C, no difference in virological response was observed between spirulina (1,500 mg/day) and silymarin (420 mg/day) groups. However, supplementation with spirulina resulted in statistically significant improvements in serum ALT values (P=0.006), sexual function total scores (P=0.001), and overall quality-of-life scores (P=0.003). Mild, transient adverse events of nausea, bloating, giddiness, and headache were reported in fewer than 6 patients in both groups. [Yakoot 2012](#22497849) Arthritis Animal and in vitro data In mice with zymosan-induced arthritis, phycocyanin exerted a scavenging action against reactive oxygen species, and also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in various in vitro and in vivo models. [Remirez 2002](#12061427) In similar experiments of mice with complete Freund adjuvant-induced arthritis, spirulina 800 mg/kg orally for 8 days was effective in reducing inflammation. [Rasool 2006](#17142986) In rats, collagen-induced arthritis was inhibited by spirulina 400 mg/kg given for 45 days. [Kumar 2009](#19390977) Cancer Animal and in vitro data C-phycocyanin showed a dose-dependent inhibition of HeLa and human chronic myeloid leukemia cell and proliferation in vitro. [Li 2006](#16316316), [Subhashini 2004](#15242812) Induction of apoptosis was considered to one of the mechanisms involved. [Li 2005](#16271846) A polysaccharide extract of spirulina was mouse corneal model. [Yang 2009](#19784394) Doxorubicin-resistant HepG2 liver cancer cells were an apoptotic mechanism, [Roy 2007](#17274761) while water-soluble polysaccharides were implicated as the active agent against stomach cancer cells. [Oh 2011](#20405153) Survival rates increased in mice with liver cancer treated with C-phycocyanin, and tumor regression has been reported in animals with oral cancer. [Schwartz 1987](#3108474), [Schwartz 1988](#3129701), [Shklar spirulina enhanced antitumor efficacy in a B16 mouse melanoma model, and the effect was abolished in MyD88 null/null mice, indicating that NK cell activation was a key pathway. [Akao 2009](#19432881) In a hamster cheek pouch model of of spirulina extract reduced dysplastic changes [Grawish 2008](#18262461); these results were further confirmed by an immunohistochemical study. [Grawish 2010](#19156551) In rats, nitrosamine-induced carcinogenesis. [Ismail 2009](#19521547) Clinical data In a study conducted in India, spirulina induced lesion regression in tobacco chewers with oral leukoplakia. [Mathew 1995](#8584455) Chelating effects Animal and in vitro data A protein extract and purified phycocyanin protected neuroblastoma cells from iron-induced toxicity. liver in rats. [Torres-Dur\u00e1n 1998](#9584992) Cadmium toxicity in rats was reduced by spirulina, measured by liver histopathology. [Karadeniz 2009](#18395256) Mercuric chloride-induced stress in mice was spirulina 800 mg/kg orally for 40 days. [Sharma 2007](#17706852) Lead acetate damage to rats was minimized by spirulina via normalizing plasma and liver lipid levels, as well as via antioxidant effects. [Ponce-Canchihuam\u00e1n 2010](#20353607) S. platensis hepatitis. [Lu 2010](#20102673) Liver and kidney enzyme markers of toxicity were reduced with spirulina administration following 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide insult to rats. [Viswanadha 2011](#20352348) Spirulina decreased cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats, to its antioxidant action. [Mohan 2006](#16552571) Gentamicin-induced kidney damage in rats was reversed by intraperitoneal administration of spirulina 1 g/kg daily. [Karadeniz 2008](#18690652) In a study of pregnant mice, intragastric administration of spirulina 125 to 500 mg/kg for 17 days of gestation reduced teratogenicity due to cadmium. [Paniagua-Castro 2011](#21254891) In mice injected mutagenicity of cyclophosphamide. [Chamorro-Cevallos 2008](#17928122) A systematic review of preclinical in vivo and in vitro studies of the antitoxic properties of Spirulina spp. to environmental pollutants supports the strong antioxidant effects of spirulina and notes very few reports of adverse events. [Martinez-Galero 2016](#26439611) Clinical data In a small, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, spirulina plus zinc increased urinary excretion of arsenic and decreased arsenic hair content in individuals with long-term exposure to arsenic. [Misbahuddin 2006](#16615668) Diabetes/Metabolic syndrome Animal data In a study of rats with alloxan-induced diabetes, spirulina 10 mg/kg orally for 30 days lowered glucose levels while slightly elevating insulin. [Muthuraman 2009](#19912059) Clinical data Two small clinical studies (N=15 and N=25) investigated the effects of spirulina supplementation in type 2 diabetes; improvement was noted in fasting blood sugar and lipid profiles. Suggested mechanisms of action include hypoglycemia caused by fiber content or possible insulin-stimulating action of peptides and polypeptides of spirulina proteins. The actions on lipids have been attributed to gamma linolenic acid content. [Mani 2000](#Mani.2000), [Parikh 2001](#12639401) More recent systematic reviews of interventional trials exploring the effects of spirulina on metabolic syndrome have been conducted. In a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial (N=50), insulin sensitivity and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were reported to be significantly improved with administration of spirulina supplementation compared with placebo in obese patients with stable, treated hypertension (P<0.001). [Szulinska 2017](#28617537) Based on limited and/or equivocal data, spirulina is likely to improve glucose metabolism, lipid parameters, and possibly blood pressure for some patient populations with metabolic syndrome. [van den Driessche 2018](#29557436), [Yousefi 2019](#30670232) Dietary supplement Spirulina, historically considered a food item in many countries, is now popularly thought of as a dietary supplement. [Robb-Nicholson 2006](#17228442) Spirulina has been purported to aid in weight loss because of its high phenylalanine content, but an FDA review found no evidence to support this claim. [Saper 2004](#15554492) Suggestions that spirulina is a valuable source of vitamin B12 have been similarly disputed. [Robb-Nicholson 2006](#17228442) Animal data Skeletal muscle protein (myosin) was increased in young rats fed spirulina as the sole dietary protein source compared with those fed casein. [Voltarelli 2008](#18807105) Clinical data In a study of malnourished children in the West African nation of Burkina Faso, spirulina supplementation for 8 weeks demonstrated clinical improvement in weight gain and increased hemoglobin levels. [Simpore 2006](#16430775) Similar nutritional rehabilitation results have been demonstrated among HIV-positive children receiving spirulina. [Simpore 2005](#16219988) Both motor and mental development scores were significantly improved in preschool children aged 6 to 18 months in Zambia 1.5 years after the completion of 16 months of spirulina supplementation compared to no supplementation. Data collected from 370 of the original 540 children enrolled in the initial open-label trial revealed significantly higher gross and fine motor skills (P<0.001) as well as language and personal-social skills (P<0.05). Greater improvements were observed in children with baseline values that were moderately to severely stunted and/or whose dietary diversity was below median. [Masuda 2019](#30934863) In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of elderly Koreans, a variety of positive effects (cholesterol, antioxidant status, interleukin 2 [IL-2] and IL-6 levels) were observed with administration of spirulina 8 g/day for 16 weeks. [Park 2008](#18714150) In another double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving 50 obese adults with medication-controlled hypertension and no concomitant conditions, supplementation with 2 g/day of S. maxima for 3 months did not result in beneficial changes in plasma mineral levels (ie, calcium, magnesium, zinc) but did lead to significantly lower iron levels compared with placebo (P=0.008). [Suliburska 2016](#26779620) Fatigue Clinical data Although spirulina supplementation (3 g/day) was ineffective against idiopathic chronic fatigue in one small study, it showed improvements in some physical and mental fatigue parameters in healthy, active men in another small study. [Baicus 2007](#17335116), [Johnson 2016](#26888417) In a small study of moderately trained males, spirulina increased time to fatigue, decreased carbohydrate oxidation rate, and increased fat oxidation rate, leading to an increase in exercise performance. [Kalafati 2010](#20010119) Hepatoprotective effects Clinical data In a case series of 3 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, spirulina 4.5 g/day for 3 months improved ALT values and lipid profiles. [Ferreira-Hermosillo 2010](#20370930) Hypertension Clinical data In a small pilot study of patients with systemic arterial hypertension (N=16; 3 men, 13 women) treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, adjunctive oral supplementation with S. maxima 4.5 g/day for 12 weeks significantly improved mean systolic blood pressure compared with placebo (126 vs 140 mm Hg; P<0.05), as well as some but not all markers of endothelial damage and antioxidant status. Reported adverse events were similar between groups. [Mart\u00ednez-S\u00e1mano 2018](#30544795) However, in a small, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 24 adults with chronic pain, no difference in systolic or diastolic blood pressure was observed between placebo patients and those receiving aqueous cyanophyta extract (2.3 g/day, equivalent to approximately 1 g/day of phycocyanin). [Jensen 2016](#27362442) Immune system effects Animal and experimental data Most in vitro and animal experiments have suggested immunostimulatory effects; however, one in vitro study found a spirulina extract to be immunosuppressive. as well as augmentation of interleukin and interferon production, have been demonstrated. [Mao 2000](#19281334) In a study of aged mice, treatment with spirulina increased intestinal epithelial lymphocytes compared with the control aged group. [Hayashi 2009](#19857060) An ex vivo study of NK cells from spirulina-treated healthy patients showed increased NK activity, an effect confirmed by a second study in which NK cell and T-cell markers were increased with spirulina. [Nielsen 2010](#20560112) Clinical data In a study in healthy men, oral administration of spirulina for 3 months resulted in enhanced interferon production and NK cell capacity. [Teas 2004](#15050097) A trial in elderly patients showed positive effects on anemia and immunosenescence after 6 and 12 weeks of spirulina supplementation. [Selmi 2011](#21278762) Immunostimulatory effects 19 trained male athletes, supplementation with spirulina 1,500 mg/day for 6 weeks appeared to mitigate exercise-induced reductions in some immune parameters, suggesting a potential preventative effect against strenuous exercise-induced immune deficits. [Juszkiewicz 2018](#29467598) Lipid effects Animal data Experiments in rats suggest that C-phycocyanin exhibits hypocholesterolemic action. [Nagaoka 2005](#16177207) In rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet, the addition of spirulina (1% or 5%) lowered serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL at 8 weeks. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) was markedly increased. [Cheong 2010](#20354344) Clinical data Two small clinical studies examined the role of spirulina in hyperlipidemia secondary to nephrotic syndrome. Both populations showed an improved lipid profile with spirulina supplementation; however, the control group in one experiment also showed improvement. The gamma linolenic acid content of spirulina may have played a role in the mechanism of action. [Khanam 2001](#Khanam.2001), [Samuels 2002](#12487756) A study in type 2 diabetes patients reported a reduction in triglycerides with use of spirulina 8 g/day for 12 weeks. [Lee 2008](#20016733) In studies of healthy volunteers, spirulina 4.5 g/day for 6 weeks lowered blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL, and increased HDL. [Ju\u00e1rez-Oropeza 2009](#19298191), [Torres-Duran 2007](#18039384) In a 15-day study of healthy runners, spirulina 5 g/day produced a significant reduction (20%) in postprandial triglyceride levels compared with baseline (P=0.04). Subgroup analysis found that triglyceride reduction was greatest in 10- to 12-year-old study participants. [Torres-Dur\u00e1n 2012](#22738038) In a case series of 3 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, spirulina 4.5 g/day for 3 months improved ALT values and lipid profiles. [Ferreira-Hermosillo 2010](#20370930) A systematic review and meta-analysis identified 7 randomized controlled trials (N=522) evaluating spirulina's effects on lipid parameters. Diagnoses of participants included type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease, overweight, nephrotic syndrome, and HIV, with one trial enrolling volunteers. Pooled results supported efficacy of spirulina in improving total cholesterol (weighed mean difference [WMD], 46.76 +6.06 mg/dL; P=0.001); effects were independent of dose. No adverse events were reported for any dosages used (1 to 10 g/day for durations of 2 to 12 months). [Serban 2016](#26433766) Recent systematic reviews of interventional trials exploring the effects of spirulina on metabolic syndrome suggest spirulina is likely to improve glucose metabolism and lipid parameters in some patient populations with metabolic syndrome, based on limited and/or equivocal data. [van den Driessche 2018](#29557436), [Yousefi 2019](#30670232) Neuroinflammation Animal data A rat study showed that spirulina potentially protects neural stem cells and promotes their growth. [Bachstetter 2010](#20463965) Clinical data An amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) support network did not find evidence sufficiently compelling to support use of spirulina in ALS and states that better efficacy and safety studies are needed. [ALSUntangled 2011](#21323493) Obesity Clinical data Recent systematic reviews of interventional trials exploring the effects of spirulina on metabolic syndrome report a potential beneficial effect on weight reduction in populations with metabolic syndrome based on limited and/or equivocal data. [van obese or overweight sedentary Mexican men, spirulina alone and in combination with a physical exercise program reduced body weight compared with the placebo phase. Obese men experienced more benefit than their overweight counterparts. Cardiorespiratory fitness was similarly improved with spirulina with and without exercise, with more benefit evident in the obese group. [Hern\u00e1ndez-Lepe 2018](#30275428) Osteoporosis Animal data In a study of rosiglitazone-treated rats, oral treatment with spirulina 500 mg/kg/day reduced the risk of osteoporosis. [Gupta 2010](#19896232) Radioprotective effects In vitro data Spirulina has been reported to protect mouse and human bone marrow cells against gamma guide therapeutic dosing of spirulina. Spirulina has typically been studied in daily dosages of 1 to 10 g, usually in divided doses, for durations of 15 days to regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Spirulina may contain more than 180 mcg of mercury per 20 g [Johnson 1986](#Johnson.1986) and should be avoided during pregnancy. A case of neonatal hypercalcemia, considered a likely result of maternal exposure to excessive S. platensis, was reported in a 1-day-old newborn. Subsequent to 5 months of daily maternal spirulina consumption, spirulina-related toxicity was suspected to have caused hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to calcitriol, resulting in fetal hypercalcemia. [Moulis 2012](#21842336) Interactions None well documented. An antiplatelet effect has been demonstrated in vitro but was not clinically evaluated. [Hsiao 2005](#16190625) A likely lab specimen interference was suspected in an otherwise healthy, asymptomatic 55-year-old female who presented for her annual physical with very high carbohydrate antigen levels; the patient had been taking spirulina health products for approximately 6 months. Interference was noted in 2 different assay methods (ARCHITEXT i2000 and cobas E601). [Li 2015](#25153597) Adverse Reactions Few reports of adverse reactions are available. Case reports of immunoblistering [Kraigher 2008](#18173606) and rhabdomyolysis been published. Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) may contain the amino acid phenylalanine; therefore, individuals with phenylketonuria should avoid spirulina. [Robb-Nicholson 2006](#17228442) are produced by number of cyanobacteria and been reported as spirulina contaminants. [Jiang 2008](#18569007), [Rawn 2007](#17388076) Other contaminants include the heavy metals mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and lead, as well as microbes cultivated on fermented animal waste. [Johnson 1986](#Johnson.1986), [Wu 1981](#6794684) There may be a potential for adverse reactions in individuals with autoimmune disorders who consume immunostimulatory herbal preparations. [Lee 2004](#15210464) Two cases of anaphylaxis in young, atopic teenage boys have been reported, each occurring within 10 minutes to 6 hours of consuming spirulina tablets. In both cases, the reaction was confirmed as a positive allergic reaction to S. platensis via skin prick tests. In one case, the offending allergen was positively identified as C-phycocyanin protein. [Le 2014](#25445756), [Petrus 2010](#19889119) A case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome in a patient with Cushing disease was suspected to have developed 1 week after taking a spirulina product.
