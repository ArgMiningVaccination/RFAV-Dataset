We have created more than 8 million new jobs in the last 4 years and now have the lowest unemployment rate in over 5 years. Our housing market is rebounding. Our manufacturing sector is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. We now produce more oil at home than we buy from the rest of the world. We have cut our deficits by more than half since I took office. And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world's number one place to invest; America is. We have made great progress, but we must do more to rebuild our economy on a new foundation for growth and prosperity. I believe that what unites the people of this Nation, regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor, is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all\u2014the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead. That belief has suffered some serious blows. Over more than three decades, even before the Great Recession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated good, middle class jobs and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on. Today, after 4 years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better. But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility remains stalled. Even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by\u2014let alone get ahead. And too many still are not working at all. Our job is to reverse these trends. We need to return to an America where our success depends not on accident of birth, but on the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams. That is what drew our forebears here. Opportunity is who we are. And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise. It will not happen right away. But we must continue to strive toward that goal. What I offer in this Budget is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class\u2014all while continuing to improve the Nation's long-run fiscal position. Earlier this year, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, the Congress produced an agreement that undid some of last year's severe cuts to priorities like education and research, infrastructure, and national security. Recognizing the importance of that bipartisan compromise, the Budget adheres to the spending levels agreed to by the Congress for fiscal year 2015. But there is clearly much more we can and should do to invest in areas like infrastructure, innovation, and education that will create jobs, economic growth, and opportunity. So I am including in my Budget a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative that provides the Congress a roadmap 2 THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT for how and where additional investments should be made in both domestic priorities and national security this year. We know where to start: the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job. With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year. And over half of big manufacturers say they are thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad. We need to make that decision easier for more companies. Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that make it harder to invest here and encourage companies to keep profits abroad. Last summer, I offered a proposal to couple business tax reform with critical investments in infrastructure. This Budget includes that proposal, using the transition revenue that will result from a shift to a simpler, more efficient tax code to create jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges and unclogging our commutes and transporting goods made in America\u2014because in today's global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure. At the same time, this Budget lays out how my Administration will continue to act on our own to cut red tape and streamline the permitting process for key infrastructure projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible. We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs. My Administration has already launched four hubs for high-tech manufacturing, where we have connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies. The Budget expands on these efforts by providing funding for five additional institutes, and, through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports the goal I announced last summer of creating a national network of 45 of these manufacturing innovation institutes over the next 10 years. We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow. This is an edge America cannot surrender. That is why the Budget includes investments in cutting-edge research and development, driving scientific and technological breakthroughs that will create jobs, improve lives, and open new opportunities for the American people. The Budget's Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative will allow us to push our limits even further, supporting additional biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health that will help us fight Alzheimer's, cancer, and other diseases, climate research to develop climate change-resilient infrastructure, and agricultural research that will help increase agricultural productivity and improve health. We also know that one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy. The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we have been in decades. The Budget advances this strategy by ensuring the safe and responsible production of natural gas and cleaner electricity generation from fossil fuels. It creates new incentives to cut the amount of energy we waste in our cars, trucks, homes, and factories. It promotes clean energy with investments in technologies like solar and by expanding and making permanent the tax credit for the production of renewable energy. And it continues to strengthen protection of our air, water, land, and communities, and addresses the threat of climate change. Climate change is a fact, and we have to act with more urgency to address it because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought and coastal cities dealing with floods. That is why I directed my Administration to work with States, utilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 3 plants are allowed to dump into the air, and why this Budget advances new approaches to address the growing cost and damage from wildfires. All of these efforts can speed up growth and create more jobs. But in this rapidly changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs. The Budget therefore invests in new efforts to drive greater performance and innovation in workforce training, including on-the-job training, apprenticeships, and other steps to equip workers with skills that match the needs of employers. Of course, it is not enough to train today's workforce. We also have to prepare tomorrow's workforce by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. That is why the Budget builds on the progress we have made with new investments and initiatives to improve all levels of education, from early childhood through college. Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child's life is high-quality early education. This year, we will invest in new partnerships with States and communities across the country to expand access to high-quality early education, and I am again calling on the Congress to make high-quality preschool available to every four-year-old child. The Budget also includes funding to provide access to high-quality infant and toddler care for more than 100,000 children, and supports the extension and expansion of voluntary home visiting programs. Last year, I called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next 4 years. This year, the FCC is making a down payment on this goal by connecting more than 15,000 schools and 20 million students over the next 2 years, without adding a dime to the deficit. To ensure students receive the full benefit of this connectivity, the Budget invests in training for teachers in hundreds of school districts across the country. The Budget also supports redesigning our high schools, helping them partner with colleges and employers that offer the college-level coursework and real-world skills to prepare students for college and careers. And it launches a new Race to the Top competition aimed at closing the achievement gap, so that all children get the high-quality education they need to succeed. And we are shaking up our system of higher education to encourage innovation, give parents more information, and reward colleges for improving quality and reducing costs, so that no middle class student is priced out of a college education. Last summer, I directed the Department of Education to develop and publish a new college rating system that will identify colleges that provide the best value to students and encourage all colleges to improve. The Budget supports the development of that rating system and provides bonuses to reward colleges that improve educational outcomes for Pell Grant recipients. And to help more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt, the Budget expands income-driven repayment options, allowing millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments at 10 percent of their income. We also must do more to ensure our economy honors the dignity of work, and that hard work pays off for all of our citizens. Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. I have already acted by Executive Order to require Federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. The Congress needs to go further and raise the minimum wage for all workers to that same amount. This raise will help families, and it will help the economy by giving businesses customers with more money 4 THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT to spend and by boosting productivity and reducing turnover. The Budget also invests in enforcement efforts to make sure workers receive the wages and overtime they have earned. There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet. Few policies are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC for families with children lifts millions out of poverty each year and helps about half of all parents at some point in their lives. But as a number of prominent policymakers, both progressive and conservative, have noted, the EITC does not do enough for single workers who do not have kids. The Budget doubles the value of the EITC for workers without children and non-custodial parents, and also makes it available to younger adult workers, so that it can encourage work in the crucial years at the beginning of a young person's career. We also need to do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, most workers do not have a pension. A Social Security check often is not enough on its own. And while the stock market has doubled over the last 5 years, that does not improve retirement security for people who do not have retirement savings. That is why the Budget builds on my proposal to create a new way for working Americans to start saving for retirement: the MyRA savings bond. To encourage new savers, MyRA requires a low initial contribution and guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in. Separately, the Budget also proposes to establish automatic enrollment Individual Retirement Accounts, offering every American access to an automatic savings vehicle on the job. For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system. With the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, we are in the process of fixing that. Already, because of the health reform law, more than 3 million Americans under the age of 26 have gained coverage under their parents' plans. More than 9 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage. Because of this law, no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma, back pain, or cancer. No woman can ever be charged more just because she is a woman. And we did all this while adding years to Medicare's finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors. To continue this progress, the Budget fully funds the ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We must always remember that economic growth and opportunity can only be achieved if America is safe and secure. At home, the Budget supports efforts to make our communities safer by reducing gun violence and reforming our criminal justice system. Looking beyond our borders, the Budget responsibly transitions from the completion of our military mission in Afghanistan in 2014 to political and security support for a unified Afghan government as it takes full responsibility for its own future. When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, all our troops are out of Iraq and more than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan. With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America's longest war will finally be over. In addition to responsibly winding down our operations in Afghanistan, the Budget ensures we maintain ready, modern, and capable defense forces to address any threats we might face, including threats from terrorism and cyber attacks. It funds humanitarian and diplomatic efforts in Syria, supports transition and reform throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and advances our strategic rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific region. It enhances stability and creates new markets THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 5 for U.S. businesses with investments in Power Africa and promotes peace and security by supporting global health care and addressing climate change. And it strengthens oversight of intelligence activities and enhances the protection of U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel overseas. The Budget also ensures that we continue to meet our obligations to our troops and veterans who have given so much to our country. To deliver on this commitment, it provides significant resources to support veterans' medical care, help military families, assist soldiers transitioning to civilian life, reduce veterans' homelessness, and reduce the disability claims backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they have earned. It also introduces necessary reforms to our military compensation system, which our uniform military leadership called for, to ensure servicemembers and their families receive the benefits that they have earned while making sure that our military can invest in the training, equipment, and support that it needs. In addition to making these critical investments, the Budget outlines the steps my Administration is taking to create a 21 st Century Government that is more efficient, effective, and supportive of economic growth. Our citizens and businesses expect their Government to provide the same level of service experienced in the private sector and we intend to deliver. The Budget includes initiatives that will lead to better, faster, and smarter services, both online and in-person. It calls on Federal agencies to share services and leverage the buying power of the Government to bring greater value and efficiency for taxpayer dollars. It continues to open Government data and research for public and private sector use to spur innovation and job creation. And it invests in the Government's most important resource, its workers, ensuring that we can attract and retain the best talent in the Federal workforce and foster a culture of excellence. The Budget does all of these things while further strengthening the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook. Over the last 5 years, we have cut the deficit in half as a share of the economy, experiencing the fastest period of deficit reduction since the demobilization following World War II. The Budget continues this progress, bringing deficits down as a share of the economy to below 2 percent by 2023 and putting debt as a share of the economy on a declining path. Although we have seen a notable and significant decline in health care spending growth over the last few years, in part due to the Affordable Care Act, we know that over the long run, the growth of health care costs continues to be our Nation's most pressing fiscal challenge. That is why the Budget builds on the savings and reforms in the health reform law with additional measures to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid and encourage high-quality and efficient health care. We also know that revenue has to be part of the solution to our Nation's long-term fiscal challenges. Given the aging of our population and the declining ratio of workers to retirees, we will need additional revenue to maintain our commitments to seniors while also making the investments that are needed to grow our economy and expand opportunity. The Budget secures that revenue through tax reform that reduces inefficient and unfair tax breaks and ensures that everyone, from Main Street to Wall Street, is paying their fair share. Finally, if we are serious about long-term, sustainable economic growth and deficit reduction, it is also time to heed the calls of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement\u2014and fix our broken immigration system. Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades. And for good reason: when people come here to fulfill their dreams\u2014to study, invent, and contribute to our culture\u2014they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and help create jobs for everyone. 6 THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT The Senate has acted to pass a bipartisan immigration reform bill that is worthy of support. It is time for the House of Representatives to finish the job. We have made progress over the last 5 years. But our work is not done. This Budget provides a roadmap to ensuring middle class families and those working to be a part of the middle class can feel secure in their jobs, homes, and budgets. To build real, lasting economic security, we also need to expand opportunity for all so every American can get ahead and have a shot at creating a better life for their kids. None of it is easy. America has never come easy. But if we work together, if we summon what is best in us, I know it is within our reach. BaraCk oBama The WhiTe hoUse, m arCh 4, 2014.7Thanks to the hard work and resilience of the American people, the economy and our Nation are moving forward. More than eight million pri- vate sector jobs have been created over the last four years, the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in over five years, and health care costs are growing at the lowest rate on record. For the first time since the 1990s, the manufacturing sector is creating jobs and we produce more of our own oil at home than we buy from the rest of the world. And for the first time since the turn of the centu - ry, CEOs around the world have declared that the United States is the number one place to invest. Our economy is moving forward and business - es are creating jobs, but our top priority must be accelerating that growth while expanding opportunity for all Americans. For the last sev - eral years, manufactured crises in Washington have hindered, rather than helped, economic growth and opportunity. But earlier this year, Democrats and Republicans came together to produce a 2014 budget that invests in key areas of innovation, education, and infrastructure\u2014investments that will help grow our economy, create jobs, and strengthen the middle class. The President's 2015 Budget shows how we can build on that progress. By rewarding hard work with fair wages, equipping all children with a high-quality education to prepare them for a good job in the future, making sure a secure retirement is within reach, and ensuring health care is affordable and reliable, we can expand op-portunity for all Americans. By fixing our broken immigration system, investing in our infrastruc - ture, simplifying the tax code for businesses, and reforming our skills and job training programs, we can create jobs and achieve stronger and more inclusive economic growth. By cutting waste - ful tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans and making common sense reforms to Government programs, we can manage our Government more efficiently and effectively, and continue to cut the deficit in a balanced way. BUILDING ON ECONOMIC PROGRESS The economy is moving forward as we continue to recover from losses sustained during the Great Recession. The economy has added private sector jobs for 47 consecutive months, for a total of 8.5 million jobs. In 2013 alone, private sector employ - ment increased by 2.4 million jobs. Despite vari - ances in month-to-month figures, the year-over-year changes indicate that the recovery has been durable even in the face of headwinds that have emerged in recent years from the Eurozone crisis and from self-inflicted wounds at home, such as last year's sequestration, Government shutdown, and uncertainty surrounding the debt limit. There are encouraging signs emerging across industries. Domestic oil production is exceeding imports for the first time since 1995 and is at its highest level since 1989. Increases in domes - tic oil and petroleum production have helped to cut U.S. net imports of crude oil and petroleum products in half relative to the 2005 peak, re - duce trade imbalances, and boost manufactur - ing. Manufacturing production has grown since the end of the recession at its fastest pace in over a decade, adding 622,000 jobs over the past 47 months. Since Chrysler and General Motors emerged from bankruptcy in mid-2009, the auto OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL8 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL industry has added 423,900 jobs, the industry's strongest growth since the 1990s. The housing sector is coming back, with housing prices, new home sales, and building permits up in 2013. PROGRESS ON OUR FISCAL HEALTH Under the President's leadership, the deficit has been cut in half as a share of the economy, rep - resenting the largest four-year deficit reduction since the demobilization from World War II. This progress is largely the result of increased econom - ic growth, cuts to discretionary spending in the Budget Control Act (BCA), and the restoration of tax rates on the highest earners to 1990s levels in the American Taxpayer Relief Act. The policies in the Budget will strengthen the recovery by making investments for the long Jan 2008Jan 2009Jan 2010Jan 2011Jan 2012Jan 2013Jan 2014-800,000-600,000-400,000-200,0000200,000400,000Seasonally-Adjusted Private Sector Monthly Job Gain/Loss 8.5 Million Jobs Added Over the Past 47 Months 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 20240%2%4%6%8%10%Historical 2015 as a GDP 9.8% 4.1% 1.6%Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 9 term, while continuing to bring our deficits down and putting debt on a declining path as a share of the economy. Under the Budget, deficits will continue to fall, declining to below two percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2023, with the debt stabilized by 2015 and declining after that. Over the long run, the largest single factor driv- ing projected deficits remains rising health care costs. In the last few years, health care spending growth has fallen to the lowest levels since the Government started tracking these data in the 1960s. Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that, from 2010 to 2012, health care spending grew at an annual rate of just 1.1 percent in real inflation-adjusted per capita terms, a small fraction of the 4.0 percent average annual rate over the first part of the last decade. While some portion of the slowdown is attrib - utable to the business cycle, evidence suggests that a substantial fraction is probably structural, meaning that it reflects factors more likely to per -sist once the economy fully recovers. 1 One notable structural factor contributing to the slowdown is the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is lowering costs and improving quality by reducing exces- sive Medicare payments to private insurers and providers, deploying new payment models that encourage more efficient, higher-quality care, and creating strong incentives for hospitals to reduce readmission rates. This slowdown is already yielding substan - tial fiscal dividends. Compared with the 2011 Mid-Session Review, aggregate projected Federal health care spending between 2014 and 2020 has decreased by more than $1 trillion based on cur - rent budget estimates. If sustained, the slow - down in health care costs will also help boost employment and bolster wage growth as the job market strengthens, and will translate into high - er wages and living standards over the long run. If even one-third of the recent slowdown con- 1 This is the conclusion reached by multiple groups of outside researchers.

The ACA will have a growing impact on reduc - ing health care costs and improving quality in fu-ture years. The Budget builds on the savings and reforms in ACA with additional measures that will help ensure health care cost growth remains low and improve the quality of care. HELPING, NOT HURTING, OUR ECONOMY Over the past few years, Washington has lurched from one manufactured crisis to another, including sequestration, a Government shutdown last fall, and repeated threats to put the Nation in default by failing to raise the debt limit. These actions have created uncertainty for families and businesses around the Nation, put at risk our commitments to seniors, our military men and women, and the most vulnerable among us, un - dermined the Government's ability to serve the public, weakened economic growth, and wasted billions of dollars. These self-inflicted economic wounds must stop. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the 2013 sequestration reduced real GDP growth by about 0.6 percentage points in calendar year 2013 and cost 750,000 jobs. Private sector economists have estimated that the Government shutdown reduced the annualized growth rate of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2013 by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points, and, during the shutdown, the Gallup Daily Economic Confidence Index fell to its lowest level since December 2011. A report by the Office of Management and Budget also high - lighted other costs of the Government shutdown, including billions of dollars in lost productivity, reduced revenue for the Federal Government, and major disruption to Government services that the American people and the private sector economy rely on. 2 2 See: http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/reports/impacts-and-costs-of- october-2013-federal-government-shutdown-report.pdf. ENACTING BIPARTISAN BUDGET AND APPROPRIATIONS ACTS: IMPORTANT STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION In the immediate aftermath of the shutdown, the President called on both parties to return to regular order in Washington. The enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 (CAA) represents compromise between Democrats and Republicans and a positive step toward return - ing Washington to regular order and ensuring that fiscal policy is helping our economy, not hurting it. While neither side got everything they want - ed, the BBA took an important first step toward replacing the damaging sequestration cuts with sensible long-term reforms, including a num -ber of reforms proposed in the President's 2014 Budget. The CAA built on the BBA to provide funding for investments in key areas of innova - tion, education, and infrastructure\u2014investments that will help grow our economy, create jobs, and strengthen the middle class. It also supported our national security by providing the Department of Defense (DOD) with needed relief from the unten - able sequestration cuts that were undermining military readiness. This bipartisan legislation provided appropriations for every agency in the Federal Government, enabling them to more effi - ciently and effectively serve the American people and bringing greater certainty to businesses and communities across the Nation.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 11 THE PRESIDENT'S 2015 BUDGET The BBA and the CAA were important first steps toward ending manufactured crises and re- placing the damaging cuts caused by sequestra - tion with long-term reforms. But they did not go far enough. In particular, while the BBA replaced half the discretionary sequestration cuts for 2014, it replaced just one-fifth of the scheduled cuts in discretionary funding for 2015. As a result, tak - ing into account projected growth in programs such as veterans' medical care and other factors, the BBA non-defense discretionary funding lev-els for 2015 are several billion below the levels the Congress provided in 2014. They are also below 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation, even though the need for pro-growth investments in infrastructure, education, and innovation has only increased due to the Great Recession and its aftermath. Recognizing the importance of this bipartisan compromise, the President's Budget adheres to the spending levels agreed to in the BBA in 2015, and proposes difficult but necessary cuts and re-forms to make room for investments in priority areas such as research, clean energy, early learn - ing, and ending homelessness. But even with those tough cuts and reforms, the discretionary levels set by the BBA simply are not sufficient to ensure that the Nation is achieving its full po - tential in creating jobs, growing the economy, and promoting opportunity for all.For that reason, the Budget also includes a separate, fully paid for $56 billion Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, which is split evenly between defense and non-defense funding, shows how additional discretionary investments can spur economic progress and strengthen our national security. It will help restore our global edge in basic research, provide funding to sup- port preschool across the United States, and train teachers to take advantage of broadband technol - ogy in the classroom. It will invest in our commu - nities through emergency response activities, ju - venile justice programs, and expansion of Promise Zones, and will fund a national network of manu- facturing institutes that will spur economic devel - opment. It will put people back to work, restoring our national parks, renovating veterans' hospitals, and building resilient infrastructure that will help our communities prepare for the effects of climate change. It will support partnerships between community colleges and employers to train work - ers for jobs that are in demand, including a bold new expansion of apprenticeship programs. It will also help us put a stop to short-sighted cuts to Government operations that compromise effi- ciency and effectiveness and cost money over the long run, such as growing deferred maintenance backlogs, sharp cuts to Federal employee training, and erosions in customer service at agencies like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). OPPORTUNITY, GROWTH, AND SECURITY INITIATIVE: SECURING OUR NATION'S FUTURE The Budget's fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative provides a roadmap for additional investments that will help secure our Nation's future. NON-DEFENSE The non-defense portion of the Initiative makes investments in six key areas. Below are examples of specific investments in each of these categories. Education Enhancing Early Childhood Education \u2014providing additional Preschool Development Grants to reach two-thirds of all States by 2015, laying a stronger foundation for Preschool for All; 12 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL providing access to high-quality early learning opportunities to a total of more than 100,000 children through Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships; and supporting Head Start grantees in expanding their programs and investing in teacher quality, without reducing the number of children served. Accelerating Improvements to K-12 Education \u2014providing 100,000 teachers in 500 districts with access to professional development to take greater advantage of the universal broadband provided through the ConnectED initiative; increasing investment in high school redesign to create additional innovative, career-focused high schools; and providing additional incentives, through Race to the Top, for States to bring the most successful K-12 reforms to the most disadvantaged schools to help close the achievement gap. Making Other Invesments\u2014to ensure that all students have access to a high-quality educa - tion, from preschool to college.

Advancing Clean Energy Research and Development (R&D)\u2014 investing in applied research at the Department of Energy to accelerate the development and deployment of new energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies\u2014such as higher-performing electric drive motors, batteries, and ultra-light materials and composites to enable electric vehicles to be as affordable and con - venient as the gasoline powered vehicles we drive today; and technological advances to make renewable electricity as inexpensive and accessible as fossil-fuel based electricity. Launching a Race to the Top for Energy Efficiency and Grid Modernization\u2014 incentivizing States to make progress toward the goal of doubling American energy productivity in 20 years and toward modernizing their electricity grids, resulting in more cost-effective demand response, distributed generation, and improved grid reliability and resilience. Making Other Investments \u2014to maintain U.S. global leadership in basic research and help transition our economy to a clean energy future. Infrastructure and Jobs Expanding Advanced Manufacturing and Investing in Regional Economic Growth\u2014 in- vesting in a national competition to establish 45 manufacturing institutes, positioning the United States as a global leader in advanced manufacturing technology; launching a new public-private \"Scale-Up\" fund to help firms with innovative advanced manufac - turing technologies take them to scale; and investing in regional economic growth and competitiveness through grants to communities. THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 13 Developing Climate Resilience\u2014 investing in research and unlocking data and information to better understand the projected impacts of climate change and how to better prepare our communities and infrastructure; helping communities plan and prepare for the impacts of cli - mate change and encouraging local measures to reduce future risk; and funding breakthrough technologies and resilient infrastructure that will make us more resilient in the face of a chang-ing climate. Launching the National Parks Centennial Initiative\u2014helping launch a Works Progress Administration (WPA)-like effort to put thousands of veterans, youth, and others to work upgrading the National Park System for its 100 th anniversary in 2016, along with similar improvements to national forests, refuges, and other public lands. Modernizing the National Airspace System\u2014 supporting the Federal Aviation Administra - tion's NextGen initiative, a multi-year effort to improve the efficiency, safety, capacity, and environmental performance of the aviation system. Supporting High Priority Medical Construction and Renovation Projects\u2014 investing in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) construction and capital projects to improve veterans' services and meet increased demand at VA, as well as new Indian Health Service health care facilities to improve the health of American Indians and Alaskan Natives. Promoting Financial Stability and Protection\u2014protecting investors, consumers, and taxpay-ers by providing additional funding for investigating and prosecuting the full spectrum of financial fraud and for implementing financial reform. Making Other Investments\u2014to help rebuild our Nation's infrastructure, support small businesses in creating jobs, and spur economic development in communities around the United States. Opportunity and Mobility Expanding Opportunity in Distressed Neighborhoods\u2014 through a combination of base and Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative funding, supporting 40 additional Prom - ise Neighborhoods and 10-14 Choice Neighborhoods to improve educational outcomes and revitalize distressed neighborhoods. Supporting Apprenticeships and Job-Driven Training at Community Colleges\u2014 awarding grants to partnerships of community colleges, employers, and others to launch training for in-demand jobs, and doubling the number of apprenticeships in America over the next five years. Improving Training and Employment Services\u2014 increasing State and local capacity, including through greater innovation and performance incentives; targeting additional resources to populations that face significant barriers to employment; and reaching a total of 50,000 households in public housing with Jobs-Plus job training and financial incentives, an 1-based approach that has been shown to boost annual incomes by $1,300 on average. In addition, the defense portion of the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, discussed below, would provide funding for additional teens to participate in National Guard Youth ChalleNGe, an evidence-based residential training and mentoring program that has been shown to increase employment, education, and earnings for at-risk youth. Encouraging States to Offer Paid Leave\u2014providing additional funding to help more States launch paid leave programs like those in California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island that have helped more than a million workers care for a new child or cope with a family member's illness.14 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL Making Other Investments \u2014to increase economic opportunity and assist vulnerable popula - tions, including incentivizing schools funded through the Bureau of Indian Education to in - troduce reforms that improve student outcomes; and additional funding for the Legal Services Corporation, which assists millions of low-income Americans each year with essential civil legal services in areas such as housing and consumer protection. Public Health, Safety, and Security Supporting Homeland Security and Law Enforcement\u2014 investing in a reformed, risk-based approach to increase preparedness, mitigation, and emergency response to disasters and other threats in communities across America. Making Targeted Investments in State and Local Justice Assistance Grants and Strengthening Public Safety\u2014funding a new youth investment initiative that will incentivize State efforts to increase the availability of alternatives to incarceration, reenroll youth back into school after confinement, and reduce ethnic and racial disparities in the juvenile justice system; and providing resources for bringing newly completed or acquired Federal prisons on-line. Providing for the Public Health\u2014accelerating development of a universal flu vaccine. Investing in Global Security\u2014 funding foreign assistance programs that have a proven track record of fostering economic growth, reducing poverty, and improving health. Leveraging Funds for Global Health\u2014making additional matching funding available for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria to encourage other donors to increase their pledges. Making Other Investments \u2014in programs that are important to maintaining public health and safety at the local, State, Federal, and global levels. More Efficient and Effective Government Advancing Cross-Government Customer Service Initiatives \u2014combined with base discretion - ary funding, supporting IRS customer service improvements that will increase toll-free tele - phone service response rates from about 60 percent to about 80 percent; and funding SSA improvements to reduce wait times and enhance services for the public. Helping Businesses Cut Through Red Tape \u2014supporting the National Inventory of Historic Properties to help expedite Federal permitting and get infrastructure projects off the ground; and making improvements to Business.gov and Exports.gov. Investing in Federal Employee Training\u2014restoring cuts to Federal employee training to help train, retain, and recruit a skilled and effective Federal workforce, targeting investments in employee training to common, but high-impact areas such as customer service or information technology. Making Other Investments \u2014to ensure that the Federal Government can meet its core responsibilities to the American public, now and in the future.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 15 DEFENSE The defense portion of the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative makes investments in four key areas. Key Weapons Systems Modernization Consistent with the reductions in discretionary spending required by the BCA and the BBA, DOD has reduced or slowed down planned purchases of a variety of weapons systems and equip - ment over the last three years. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would allow DOD to accelerate the schedules for developing and buying new or upgraded systems in order to ensure that the United States maintains technological superiority over potential adversaries. For example, the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative provides enhanced resources for procurement of manned and unmanned aircraft, helicopters, ground vehicles, and communication systems. It also expands the R&D efforts that underpin all defense modernization programs. Readiness Restoration In 2013, significant reductions in funding degraded readiness throughout the Joint Force by requiring sharp cuts to training, maintenance, and support. For example, the Air Force had to ground 33 squadrons and reduce an additional seven squadrons to basic \"takeoff and land\" train - ing for several months. Although the base budget provides the resources needed to continue gradually restoring readiness and balance, the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative pro - vides the resources to expedite progress by supporting increased activity at depot maintenance facilities around the Nation, greater training support, and increases in funding for fuel, spare parts, and transportation costs. Nuclear R&D and Infrastructure The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative provides additional funding to support the infrastructure and human capital that underpin long-term, effective sustainment of the nucle - ar weapons stockpile and supporting enterprise. For example, the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative allows the National Nuclear Security Administration to begin important facili - ties construction and deferred maintenance projects and to undertake several R&D projects to keep nuclear weapons safe, reliable, and effective. DOD Facilities Improvement Sequestration required significant funding cuts for DOD facilities, forcing the Department to defer some sustainment, restoration, and modernization (SRM) costs, as well as some military construction projects. The base budget provides the funds necessary to keep DOD bases, housing, and other facilities safe, secure, and operational, but not enough to avoid long-term deteriora - tion. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative provides additional resources for SRM and construction at hundreds of DOD installations that will generate jobs and reduce future costs to replace buildings, roads, runways, and other facilities.16 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL Importantly, the Budget also shows that this ini - tiative is fully paid for, and easily affordable if the Congress is willing to enact a few common-sense spending and tax changes. Building on the model established in the BBA, the Budget outlines a spe - cific set of mandatory spending reforms and tax loophole closers that would fully offset the cost of the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: $28 billion in savings from common- sense spending reforms, including: \u2014Reforming Federal crop insurance by re - ducing subsidies for overly generous cover - age ($14 billion). While the newly enacted Farm Bill made progress on curbing direct subsidy payments, it failed to adopt bipar - tisan reforms to the increasingly expen - sive Federal crop insurance program. The Budget proposes to reduce Federal sub - sidies for disproportionately subsidized plans that benefit wealthy corporate farm- ers and to reduce overpayments to private crop insurance companies. \u2014Reallocating spectrum to promote eco - nomic growth ($5 billion). The Budget proposes to introduce new mechanisms to promote more efficient allocation of spec - trum to high priority uses. \u2014Reforming the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) passenger fees to reflect the cost of aviation security ($5 bil- lion). While the Congress took steps to - ward better matching TSA fees with costs in the BBA, the Budget proposes to fur - ther reform these user fees to more closely reflect the costs of passenger screening and other aviation security services. \u2014Preventing Unemployment Insurance and Disability Insurance overlap ($3 billion). The Budget proposes to prevent individu- als from collecting Unemployment and Disability Insurance benefits for the same period of time. $28 billion in savings from reducing tax benefits for multi-million dollar retire-ment accounts. Tax-preferred savings ac- counts were intended to help middle class families save for retirement. However, un - der current rules, some wealthy individuals are able to accumulate millions of dollars in these accounts, substantially more than is needed to ensure a secure retirement. The Congress could pay for the remaining half of the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Ini - tiative by enacting the President's proposal to prevent additional tax-preferred saving by individuals who have already accumu - lated tax-preferred retirement savings suf - ficient to finance an annual income of over $200,000 per year in retirement\u2014more than $3 million per person. When considering both base funding and Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative re-sources, the Budget provides a comprehensive and detailed plan for making investments that will drive the Nation forward. Without taking ac - tion, funding levels for 2016 and beyond will con- tinue to preclude the investments needed to pro - tect our Nation or enable our economy to achieve its full potential, since the BBA did not provide even partial sequestration relief after 2015. The Budget proposes to restore discretionary spend - ing to a path that would continue to support eco - nomic growth, opportunity, and safety and secu - rity; these investments will also be paid for with a combination of reforms to mandatory spending programs and targeted tax loophole closers in- cluded in the Budget. Even so, under the Budget proposals, discretionary spending will fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy in more than 50 years.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 17 MANAGING GOVERNMENT TO DRIVE FURTHER GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY At the same time, the Budget takes key steps to enhance the Administration's efforts to deliv- er a Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth. The Budget includes initiatives to deliver better, faster, and smarter services to citizens and businesses. The Budget advances the Administration's effort to modernize the infrastructure permitting process, cutting through red tape, allowing more construc - tion workers on the job faster, and achieving better outcomes for our communities and environment. The Budget also expands the use of shared services between Federal agencies and strategic sourcing to leverage the buying power of the Government, bringing greater value and efficiency for taxpayer dollars. Further, the Budget continues to open Government data and research for public and pri - vate sector use to spur innovation and job creation. These and other key management initiatives are detailed in Chapter 2 of the Budget. INVESTING IN JOBS, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY Creating jobs that pay good wages is the best way to grow our economy and the middle class. To compete in the 21st Century economy and make America a magnet for job creation and op-portunity, we need to invest in American innova - tion, strengthening our manufacturing base, and keeping the Nation at the forefront of technologi - cal advancement. To ensure our energy security and address global climate change, we must con - tinue to focus on domestic energy production, the development of clean energy alternatives, and the promotion of energy efficiency. The Budget therefore includes investments in advanced man - ufacturing, R&D, and clean energy and energy ef-ficiency technologies. Making America a Magnet for Jobs. The President is committed to making America a magnet for jobs and manufacturing so that we can create new opportunities for American workers. Transforming Communities Into World- Leading Centers of Advanced Manufacturing. To support investment and accelerate inno - vation in U.S. manufacturing, the President has called for the creation of a national net - work of manufacturing innovation institutes across the Nation. Leveraging the strengths of a particular region, each institute will bring together companies, universities, community colleges, and Government to co-invest in the development of world-leading manufacturing technologies and capabilities that U.S.-based manufacturers can apply in production. Through a combination of base discretionary funds and the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, and build-ing on the four institutes already launched and the five additional institutes expected to be launched in 2014, the Budget supports the President's goal announced last summer of creating 45 new manufacturing innovation institutes over 10 years, tripling the number originally proposed in the President's 2012 and 2013 State of the Union addresses. Expanding SelectUSA to Attract Investment to Our Shores . In 2011, the President launched SelectUSA at the Department of Commerce, creating the first Federal effort to actively attract business investment in the United States. Building on the resources provided in the CAA, the Budget supports the President's proposal to significantly expand and enhance SelectUSA. Investing in R&D. Scientific discovery, tech- nological breakthroughs, and innovation are the primary engines for expanding the frontiers of human knowledge and are vital for responding to the challenges and opportunities of the 21 st Century. We look to scientific innovation to pro - mote sustainable economic growth and job cre- ation, improve the health of all Americans, move us toward a clean energy future, address global climate change, manage competing demands on environmental resources, and ensure the security 18 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL of the Nation. Science and engineering research is a valuable source of new knowledge that has driven important developments in fields ranging from telecommunications to medicine, yielding high economic and social rates of return and cre-ating entirely new industries with highly-skilled, high-wage jobs. Continuing our commitment to world-class sci - ence and research, the Budget provides $135 bil - lion for R&D overall, while targeting resources to those areas most likely to directly contribute to the creation of transformational technologies that can create the businesses and jobs of the fu - ture. The base Budget increases R&D relative to the 2014 enacted levels, with over $5 billion in additional funding in the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative to drive progress in key R&D priorities. Advanced Manufacturing and Clean Energy Technologies. The Budget will sup- port the development and scaling of new ad-vanced manufacturing technologies, such as increasing research in the National Institute of Standards and Technology's labs and ac - celerating the transfer of new technologies from Federal labs to industry. The Budget will also increase funding for clean energy technology investment at the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014Energy, building on the Administration's success in reducing our de - pendence on fossil fuels, promoting energy efficiency, and doubling U.S. renewable elec - tricity generation. Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, the Budget will support a new Energy Efficiency and Grid Modernization Race to the Top, which will incentivize States to modernize their electricity grids and to make progress to- ward the goal of doubling American energy productivity in 20 years. Health Care R&D. The Budget, includ- ing the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, will support biomedical research at NIH, providing about 9,500 new NIH grants that will help us better understand the fundamental causes and mechanisms of disease. The Budget will help us in the fight against Alzheimer's disease, cancer and oth - er diseases that affect millions of Americans. The Budget will support the BRAIN initia - tive, which will help revolutionize our un-derstanding of how the human brain pro - cesses, stores and retrieves information. The Budget will also allow for the development of a new health research program modeled after the DARPA program designed to fund innovative projects and accelerate the dis - covery of life-saving treatments and cures. Agriculture R&D. The Budget includes funding for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative competitive research program, supporting research in areas im - portant to American agriculture: bioener - gy, food security, water, obesity prevention, and food safety. The Budget also includes funding to support three multidisciplinary institutes dedicated to crop science and pol - linator health, advanced biobased manu - facturing and anti-microbial research. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes additional funding to support com - petitive research and the construction of a new biosafety research laboratory in Athens, Georgia. Supporting Applied R&D by Reforming and Making Permanent the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. The Research and Experimentation (R&E) Tax Credit is an important Federal incentive for research. But the R&E Tax Credit is less effective than it could be in spurring additional research because it is complicated and temporary. Currently, businesses must choose between using a complex, outdated formula that pro - vides a 20 percent credit rate and a much simpler one that provides a 14 percent credit rate. The Budget would increase the rate of the simpler credit to 17 percent, which would make it more attractive and simplify tax filing for businesses. In addition, the Budget makes the basic and the simplified THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 19 R&E credit permanent to provide certainty and increase effectiveness. Investing in Homegrown Clean Energy. In order to secure America's energy future and cut carbon pollution, the Budget invests in clean energy, improving energy security, and enhancing preparedness and resilience to climate change. These investments are critical components of the President's Climate Action Plan, bringing about a clean energy economy with new businesses, jobs, and opportunities for American workers. Promoting Safe and Responsible Production and Use of Natural Gas and Cleaner Energy from Fossil Fuels. Our do-mestic natural gas resources are reduc - ing energy costs across the economy\u2014from manufacturers investing in new facilities to lower heating costs for families throughout the United States. The Budget invests in re - search to ensure safe and responsible natu - ral gas production. The Budget invests in innovative approaches to cleaner fossil fuels, including advanced high-efficiency combus - tion engines and carbon capture and stor - age technologies from both natural gas and coal. The Budget also supports technical as-sistance to States and local communities to help ensure shale gas is developed in a safe, responsible way that helps build diverse and resilient regional economies that can with- stand boom-and-bust cycles and can be lead - ers in building and deploying clean energy technologies. In addition, it helps States and localities improve the integration and utili - zation of natural gas in manufacturing and transportation. Making Energy Go Further Across the Economy. Cutting the amount of energy we waste in our cars and trucks, in our homes and buildings, and in our factories will make a stronger, more resilient, and more competi - tive economy. That is why the President set a goal of cutting in half the energy wasted by America's homes and businesses with action aimed at doubling the economic output per unit of energy consumed in the United States by 2030, relative to 2010 levels. The Budget takes a number of steps to help reach this goal, including: supporting the development of additional efficiency standards for appli - ances and buildings, expanding the Better Buildings Challenge to encourage greater energy efficiency in industrial and commer - cial buildings, improving energy efficiency in Federal buildings, improving energy data ac - cess for consumers and for Federal facilities through the \"Green Button\" initiative\u2014un-der which utilities are establishing a stan-dardized system allowing electricity custom - ers to securely download their energy usage information\u2014and supporting and encourag- ing the adoption of State and local policies to cut energy waste. Investing in Energy Security . Over the President's first term, the United States cut oil imports by more than 3.6 million bar - rels per day, more than under any other President. In 2012, America's net oil imports fell to the lowest level in 20 years. To ensure that we continue on a path toward greater energy security, the Budget establishes an Energy Security Trust to help fund efforts to shift our cars and trucks off oil. This $2 billion investment over 10 years will sup - port R&D in a range of cost-effective tech - nologies\u2014like advanced vehicles that run on electricity, homegrown biofuels, renewable hydrogen, and domestically produced natu-ral gas\u2014and will be drawn from revenues generated from Federal oil and gas develop - ment. The Budget proposes an extension of tax credits to support cellulosic biofuels and new tax incentives for medium- and heavy-duty trucks that run on alternative fuels like natural gas, and for the fuel infrastruc-ture needed to deploy them. The Budget also includes reforms to promote respon - sible oil and gas development on Federal lands, including increasing funding at the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management to support better permitting processes for oil and gas, renewable energy, and infrastructure, including the transition 20 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL to an electronic, streamlined system for oil and gas permits. Meeting the Challenge of Climate Change . The President's Climate Action Plan, which was released last year, builds upon the Administration's commitment to help ad-dress climate change by cutting carbon pol - lution in the United States in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. The Budget continues the Administration's sig-nificant progress toward reaching that goal by increasing available renewable energy, seeking achievable reductions in emissions through carbon pollution standards, and im - proving the energy efficiency of vehicles and major appliances. The Budget also supports efforts by Federal agencies to assist in local preparedness for climate change impacts, manage Federal lands to improve resilience, fund activities to create climate-resilient infrastructure, and develop better informa - tion, data, and tools to be used by decision-makers. The Budget strengthens U.S. global leadership on climate issues, encouraging international efforts to reduce carbon pollu - tion and build global climate resiliency. Making permanent and expanding the Production Tax Credit. In order to provide a strong, consistent incentive to encourage investments in renewable energy technolo- gies like wind and solar, the Budget would, as part of business tax reform, make perma - nent the tax credit for the production of re-newable electricity and reform it by making it refundable. Addressing Growing Costs and Damage From Wildfires. The Budget proposes a signif-icant reform to address wildfire suppression costs that have cannibalized forest health and rehabilitation programs and other pri - orities at the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service and the Department of the Interior. By creating a dedicated source of funding outside of the discretionary bud - get caps for wildland fire suppression, the Budget provides funding certainty in future years for firefighting costs, frees up resourc - es to invest in areas that will promote long-term forest health and preservation, and maintains fiscal responsibility by addressing wildfire disaster needs through agreed-upon funding mechanisms. BUILDING A 21ST CENTURY INFRASTRUCTURE Building a durable and reliable infrastructure will create good American jobs that cannot be outsourced and will provide businesses with the transportation and communication networks our economy needs. The Budget includes significant investments to repair our existing infrastructure and build the infrastructure of tomorrow. Eliminating Loopholes in Our Busi - ness Tax Code and Rebuilding Our Infrastructure. Last summer, in an effort to spur congressional action that would help our economy, the President offered a proposal to pay for investments in infrastructure by closing loop - holes and reforming our business tax code. The Budget includes this proposal, which would use one-time transition revenue resulting from busi - ness tax reform to fill the Highway Trust Fund funding shortfall and make critical new infra -structure investments as part of a four-year trans - portation reauthorization proposal. Meanwhile, reforming the tax code for businesses will also promote long-run growth, job creation, and com - petitiveness by cutting tax rates, simplifying the tax code, and eliminating inefficient provisions that distort companies' investment decisions. Transportation Reauthorization. To spur economic growth and allow States and locali - ties to initiate sound multi-year investments, the Budget includes a four-year, $302 billion surface transportation reauthorization pro - posal. By reinvesting the transition rev - enue from pro-growth business tax reform, the President's plan will ensure the health of the Highway Trust Fund for another four years and invest in a range of activities to spur and sustain long-term growth. The THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 21 President's plan to rebuild America will in - crease \"fix-it-first\" investment to repair and modernize our highways and bridges, while also modernizing our infrastructure by mak- ing new investments in transit, intercity pas-senger rail, and competitive programs. The President's plan will also provide Americans with affordable transportation options by in - creasing investment to expand new transit projects and maintain existing systems, link regional economies by funding the develop - ment of high-performance rail and strength - ening Metropolitan Planning Organizations, and support American exports by improv - ing movement within the Nation's freight networks. To help spur innovation and eco - nomic mobility, the reauthorization proposal will permanently authorize the competitive TIGER grant program to support projects that bring job opportunities to communities across the United States. The proposal will also advance the President's Climate Action Plan by building more resilient infrastruc-ture and reducing transportation emissions by responding to the greater demand and travel growth in public transit. Reforming Our Business Tax Code . The President believes that reforming our busi - ness tax code can help create jobs and spur investment, while ensuring a fairer and more equitable tax system that eliminates the loopholes that reward companies for moving profits overseas and allow them to avoid paying their fair share. In February 2012, the President provided a framework for how business tax reform could achieve these goals. The Budget builds on that framework with specific proposals to simpli - fy and strengthen tax incentives for research and clean energy, to begin closing loopholes and eliminating special interest subsidies, and to begin reforming the international tax system. The Budget proposals would both prevent U.S. companies from shifting profits overseas and prevent foreign companies op - erating in the United States from avoiding the taxes they owe. The President favors adopting these mea - sures as part of long run revenue neutral business tax reform that would also cut the corporate tax rate to 28 percent\u2014with a rate of no more than 25 percent for manufactur - ing\u2014cut taxes for small businesses, and com-prehensively reform tax subsidies and the international tax system. For this reason, the Budget does not count the net savings from the business tax proposals described above toward its deficit reduction targets, instead reserving them to help pay for busi - ness reform. However, the transition to a reformed business tax system will generate one-time, temporary revenue, for example from addressing the $1-2 trillion of untaxed foreign earnings that U.S. companies have accumulated overseas. The Budget proposes to use the one-time savings generated from transitioning to the new business tax system to fill the Highway Trust Fund shortfall and pay for the four-year transportation reau - thorization proposal included in the Budget. Boosting Private Investment Through a Rebuild America Partnership. To help fur - ther drive infrastructure investment, the Budget includes proposals aimed at enhancing the role of private capital in U.S. infrastructure invest - ment as a vital additive to the traditional roles of Federal, State, and local governments. Creating a National Infrastructure Bank . The President continues to call for the cre - ation of an independent, wholly-owned Government entity to support increased in - vestment in our Nation's infrastructure. A National Infrastructure Bank or similar fi - nancing entity with bipartisan support in the Congress will have the ability to lever - age private and public capital to support in-frastructure projects of national and region - al significance. In addition, such an entity will be able to invest through loans and loan guarantees in a broad range of infrastruc - ture, including transportation, energy, and water projects. 22 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL Enacting America Fast Forward Bonds and Other Tax Incentives for Infrastructure Investment. The Budget again calls for the creation of an America Fast Forward (AFF) Bonds program based on the successful ex - ample of the Build America Bonds program. AFF Bonds will attract new sources of capi - tal for infrastructure investment\u2014including from public pension funds and foreign inves- tors that do not receive a tax benefit from traditional tax exempt debt. In addition, the Budget proposes changes to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of invest - ment in U.S. infrastructure and real estate to a broader universe of private investors. Cutting Red Tape in the Infrastructure Permitting Process. In order to accelerate eco - nomic growth and improve the competitiveness of the American economy, the Administration is tak- ing action to modernize and improve the efficiency of the Federal permitting process for major infra-structure projects. In August 2011, the President issued a Memorandum to add more transparency, accountability, and certainty into the permitting and review process. Since then, agencies have worked to expedite the permitting and review of 50 major projects, and have completed the re - view of 30 projects including bridges, railways, ports and waterways, roads, and renewable en- ergy projects. In support of this effort, and as part of the President's Management Agenda, the Budget includes funding for a new Interagency Infrastructure Permitting Improvement Center housed at the Department of Transportation, which will lead the Administration's reform ef - forts across nearly 20 Federal agencies and bu - reaus. The Budget also supports an expanded, publicly available Permitting Dashboard that tracks project schedules and metrics for major infrastructure projects, further improving the transparency and accountability of the permit- ting process. Launching National Parks Centennial Initiative. To mark the 100 th year anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service in 2016, the Budget will fund a targeted effort to put youth, returning veterans, and other Americans to work restoring some of our greatest historical, cultural, and natural treasures. The Centennial Initiative, building on the President's America's Great Outdoors Initiative, would be one of the largest parks improvement efforts in the his - tory of the National Parks System, helping to upgrade roadways, water mains, bridges, paths, and visitor services across the entire system, in - cluding some of the Nation's most famous sites, from Yosemite National Park to the Blue Ridge Parkway to Katmai National Park. Conserving Lands for Current and Future Generations. The Budget builds on receipts col - lected under the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act by proposing $900 million an - nually to invest in conserving lands for future generations, supporting livable communities and creating jobs through a growing outdoor recre-ation industry. Since the passage of the LWCF Act almost 50 years ago, the need for this funding has increased due to population growth and land lost to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential development. Making Permanent the Enhanced Tax Deduction for Conservation Easements. Combined with targeted reforms, making perma- nent the enhanced tax deductions for conserva - tion easements will create certainty for America's landowners who willingly seek to ensure land and water conservation gains for future genera - tions. It will also help stimulate the economy by ensuring working lands stay working, and guar - antee recreational as well as hunting and fishing opportunities. The enhanced deduction will also help achieve a key goal of the President's Climate Action Plan by locking in a strong tool to help conserve land and water resources.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 23 EQUIPPING EVERY AMERICAN WITH A HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION AND THE SKILLS TO SUCCEED Americans must be prepared with the skills and knowledge necessary to compete in the 21st Century economy. Expanding educational oppor - tunities is critical to equipping all children with these skills and positioning them to succeed as adults. The Budget includes investments and ini - tiatives to improve all levels of education, from early childhood through college, as well as signifi - cant new efforts to ensure our workforce has the skills needed by American businesses. Enhancing Access to High-Quality Early Childhood Education. The Budget includes the Preschool for All initiative proposed by the President last year. This proposal calls for part - nering with States to provide every low- and moderate-income four-year-old child access to high-quality preschool, while incentivizing States to expand those programs to reach additional children from middle class families and estab - lish full-day kindergarten policies. These invest - ments are fully financed by raising Federal tobac - co taxes, which will also help to discourage youth smoking and save lives. In addition, building on funding provided in the CAA, the Budget invests discretionary funding in Preschool Development Grants, which, together with additional resourc - es in the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, would reach two-thirds of States by 2015, laying a stronger foundation for Preschool for All. Additional funding in the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would also pro - vide early learning opportunities to a total of more than 100,000 children through Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships and support Head Start grantees in expanding program duration and investing in teacher quality. In addition, the Budget invests $15 billion in mandatory funds over the next 10 years to extend and expand evidence-based, voluntary home visiting pro-grams, which enable nurses, social workers, and other professionals to connect families to services and educational supports that improve a child's health, development, and ability to learn. Redesigning High Schools. The President has called for a comprehensive effort to rethink the high school experience, challenging schools to scale up innovative models that personalize teaching and learning for students, so that they receive the rigorous and relevant education need- ed to graduate and transition into postsecondary learning and adulthood. The Budget provides $150 million for a new program to redesign high schools to focus on providing students challeng - ing, relevant learning experiences, and rewarding high schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers to help develop the skills students need for jobs now and in the future. This will build on $100 million provided through the Youth CareerConnect grant competition at the Department of Labor (DOL) to expand these models. Connecting Schools and Training Teachers for the Digital Age. The President has called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to take steps to connect 99 percent of American students to the digital age through next-generation broadband and wireless in their schools and libraries. The FCC is making a major down-payment on this goal\u2014connecting more than 20 million students in 15,000 schools over the next two years\u2014without adding a dime to the deficit. The Budget proposes $200 million for the ConnectEDucators program to ensure that students receive the full benefit of this con - nectivity by providing professional development and high-quality digital instructional resources to teachers to help them make effective use of these new resources. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would add an additional $300 million to this initiative to provide a total of 100,000 teachers in 500 school districts across the Nation access to professional development. Preparing Students for STEM Careers. Our Nation's competitiveness depends on our ability to improve and expand science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning in the United States. The Budget proposes a fresh Government-wide reorganization of STEM educa - tion programs designed to enable more strategic investment in STEM education and more critical 24 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL evaluation of outcomes, leveraging Government resources more effectively to meet national goals. This proposal reduces fragmentation of STEM education programs across Government, and fo - cuses efforts around the five key areas identified by the Federal STEM Education 5-Year Strategic Plan: P-12 instruction; undergraduate education; graduate education; broadening participation in STEM to women and minorities traditionally underrepresented in these fields; and education activities that typically take place outside of the classroom. Making College More Affordable. The President has placed a high priority on making college affordable and helping Americans obtain a meaningful college degree. Beginning in 2009, the Administration has increased the maximum Pell Grant for working and middle class families by $1,000, to $5,730 in school year 2014-15, and created the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which helps more than 10 million students and families each year pay for college. Last sum - mer, the President directed the Department of Education to develop and publish a new college ratings system that will identify colleges that provide the best value to students and encour - age all colleges to improve. The Budget supports the development and refinement of the ratings system by investing in data initiatives or other necessary projects. The Budget also provides new College Opportunity and Graduation Bonuses to reward colleges for improving educational out-comes for low- and moderate-income students. The Budget includes an expansion of \"Pay As You Earn\" (PAYE) repayment options to all student borrowers, and reforms the PAYE terms to ensure that the program is well-targeted and provides a safeguard against raising tuition at high-cost institutions. Improving Training and Employment Services. Helping workers acquire the skills they need to pursue in-demand jobs and careers is critical to growing our economy, ensuring that everyone who works hard is rewarded, and building a stronger middle class. The Budget's approach to skills and training is guided by the principle that all Federal investments should be designed to equip the Nation's workers and job seekers with skills matching the needs of em - ployers looking to hire them into good jobs. The Budget proposes significant new investments at DOL to drive greater performance and innova-tion, through the Workforce Innovation Fund and Incentive Grants that reward States that succeed in serving workers with the greatest barriers to employment. Additional resources to support this effort, as well as to increase State and local capacity and provide targeted assistance to high-need populations, are made available through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative. Investing in Job-Driven Training at Community Colleges and Apprenticeships. Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, the Budget invests in a Community College Job-Driven Training Fund at DOL. This Fund will offer competitive grants to partnerships of community colleges, employers, and others to launch new training programs that will prepare Americans for in-demand jobs and careers. The Fund will also support expanding apprenticeship opportunities. On-the-job apprenticeship train- ing programs provide a robust path to middle-in - come jobs in many countries. The funds provided through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative will support doubling the number of ap - prenticeships in America over the next five years. Helping Build the Skills of the Long- Term Unemployed. Although the unemploy - ment rate has come down from its peak during the Great Recession, too many of our unemployed have been without a job for an extended period of time, which can lead to a deterioration in skills and strain families and communities. Finding jobs for the long-term unemployed is an impor - tant national priority, because we are stronger when America fields a full team. The Budget pro - vides resources for new public-private partner - ships to help the long-term unemployed transi-tion back into good jobs that can support their families. To help more recently displaced work - ers, the Budget proposes a New Career Pathways program that will reach as many as one million workers a year with a set of core services, combin - ing the best elements of two existing programs\u2014THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 25 Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers and Workforce Investment Act Dislocated Workers. Investing in Health Professions Education to Improve Access to Health Care Providers and Services. The Budget invests in the health care workforce to improve access to health care services, including support for 15,000 providers in the National Health Service Corps that will serve areas across the United States experiencing a shortage of medical providers. In addition, the Budget creates new graduate medical education residency slots in primary care and other high-need specialties. Most of these new residents will be trained in community based settings, includ - ing rural and underserved areas. EXPANDING OPPORTUNITY FOR MIDDLE CLASS SECURITY Our economy is moving forward and business- es are creating jobs. But to build real, lasting eco-nomic security we need to create more opportuni - ties for all working and middle class Americans to get ahead. The Budget includes a series of pro - posals to help ensure that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can find a good job, feel se - cure about your community, and support a family. Raising the Minimum Wage to $10.10. Over the past 30 years, modest minimum wage increases have not kept pace with the higher costs of basic necessities for working families. No one who works full time should have to raise his or her family in poverty. The Administration supports raising the minimum wage so that hard-working Americans can earn wages that allow them to support their families and make ends meet. The President knows this is impor - tant for workers, and good for the economy. That is why the President is calling on the Congress to raise the Federal minimum wage in stages to $10.10 per hour and index it to inflation there - after, while also raising the minimum wage for tipped workers for the first time in over 20 years. The President is leading by example by signing an Executive Order to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 for individuals working under new and replacement Federal service, construction, and concession contracts. Extending Unemployment Insurance for 1.7 Million Americans Looking for Work. As a starting point in achieving economic op-portunity and mobility, the Congress should act to extend unemployment insurance for the 1.7 million Americans who have lost this vital eco- nomic lifeline. At more than 35 percent, the per -centage of unemployed workers who are long-term unemployed is much higher than the last time emergency unemployment benefits expired. Economists have estimated that extending un - employment insurance would provide significant returns, leading to 240,000 more jobs. Partnering with Communities to Expand Opportunity. The Budget supports the Administration's Promise Zone initiative, which supports partnerships between the Federal Government, local communities, and businesses to create jobs, increase economic security, expand educational opportunities, increase access to quality, affordable housing, and improve public safety. Communities are chosen through a com - petitive process and put forward a plan on how they will partner with local business and com - munity leaders to make investments that reward hard work and expand opportunity. In exchange, the Federal Government partners with these communities to help them secure the resources and flexibility they need to achieve their goals. The President announced the first five Promise Zone communities earlier this year and will cre - ate an additional 15 Promise Zones in the year ahead. The Budget includes Promise Zone tax incentives to stimulate growth and investments in targeted communities, such as tax credits for hiring workers and incentives for capital invest- ment within the Zone. Through a combination of the base budget and the additional resources pro - vided in the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, the Budget will support the President's vision for Promise Zones by funding 40 new Promise Neighborhoods and 10-14 new Choice Neighborhoods. 26 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL Ensuring Workers Receive the Pay and Overtime They Earned. The Budget increases support for DOL's Wage and Hour Division to in - crease enforcement of the laws that ensure work - ers receive appropriate wages and overtime pay, as well as the right to take job-protected leave for family and medical purposes. The Wage and Hour Division will be able to hire 300 new inves - tigators across the United States to help in this effort, and will use risk-based approaches to tar - get the industries and employers most likely to break the law. Ending Homelessness. The President has set ambitious goals to end homelessness across the Nation, and we have made significant prog-ress, including reducing the total number of homeless veterans by almost 18,000 since 2009. By investing in homeless assistance and support-ive services programs at both the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and VA, the Budget keeps us on a path to end vet - erans' homelessness in 2015 and end chronic homelessness in 2016. In addition, the Budget makes investments in rental assistance, which plays an important role in helping extremely low- income families avoid homelessness by providing stable and affordable housing. The Budget funds renewed assistance for 4.5 million low-income families through HUD's core rental assistance program, including providing 40,000 new hous- ing vouchers for low-income families, including 10,000 for homeless veterans. Expanding the EITC for Childless Workers. Few things help families with children pull themselves up through hard work like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). However, the maximum EITC available to childless workers (including non-custodial parents) is only $500, and the credit is unavailable to workers under age 25, which means that it cannot shape work decisions during the crucial years at the begin - ning of a young person's career. The Budget will double the maximum credit (to $1,000), make the credit available to workers at slightly higher income levels (e.g., a full-time minimum wage worker at the current minimum wage), and lower the age limit from 25 to 21, as a way to support and reward work. The proposal will also update the childless worker EITC upper age limit for in - creases in the Social Security Normal Retirement Age (raising it from 64 to 66). These changes will be paid for by closing tax loopholes that let some high-income professionals avoid income and pay-roll taxes. Helping Workers with Disabilities Re - main in the Workforce. In addition to the Administration's continued commitment to Vocational Rehabilitation programs, the Budget provides new authority and $400 million in new resources for the Social Security Administration (SSA), in partnership with other Federal agen-cies, to test innovative strategies to help people with disabilities remain in the workforce. Early-intervention measures, such as supportive em - ployment services for individuals with mental impairments, targeted incentives for employers to help workers with disabilities remain on the job, and incentives and opportunities for States to better coordinate services, have the potential to achieve long-term gains in the employment and the quality of life of people with disabilities, and the proposed demonstration authority will help build the evidence base for future program improvements. The cost of the demonstrations could be offset by a proposal to automate coordi- nation of disability benefit payments between the Office of Personnel Management and SSA, reduc - ing overpayments, and other program integrity measures. The proposed childless worker EITC expansion will also benefit over one million work - ers with disabilities, encouraging and supporting them in maintaining employment. Improving Retirement Security. Workers must have a place to invest their hard-earned savings that provides an appropriate balance of risk and return, and many private sector provid- ers do not offer retirement savings options tai-lored to smaller balance savers. The retirement system should help these potential savers and en - courage them to begin building their retirement security. The Budget builds on the President's announcement in the State of the Union to create a new simple, safe, and affordable \"starter\" retire - ment savings account\u2014the MyRA\u2014that will be THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 27 available through employers and help millions of Americans save for retirement. The Budget also continues to propose automatic enrollment in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)\u2014or \"auto-IRAs\"\u2014for employees without access to a workplace savings plan. ENSURING OUR NATION'S SAFETY AND SECURITY Economic growth and opportunity can only be achieved if America is safe, secure, and resilient, both at home and abroad. At home, the Budget supports efforts to help make communities safer by reducing gun violence and supporting emer - gency preparedness, and makes reforms to our criminal justice system to reduce recidivism and achieve better outcomes. Beyond our borders, the Budget provides resources to sustain ready, modern, and capable defense forces and support the effective operation and protection of our dip - lomats, both of which are critical to providing for the Nation's security and sustaining our global leadership role. These resources advance our strategic rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific re - gion, support key investments in Power Africa, and provide other resources critical to improving Global Health Security and combating global cli-mate change. The Budget strengthens executive branch oversight of signals intelligence activi- ties and positions the United States to address threats from terrorism and cyber attacks, en - hances the protection of U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel overseas, meets our peacekeeping commitments for the world's most challenging crises, funds humanitarian and diplomatic ef - forts in Syria, and supports transition and reform throughout the Middle East and North Africa. The Budget also ensures that even after we have ended two wars, we continue to meet our obliga - tions to our servicemembers and veterans who have given so much to our Nation. Making Communities Safer by Reducing Gun Violence. The Budget supports the President's \"Now is the Time\" initiative, a set of concrete policies to help reduce gun violence in our schools and communities in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy. The Budget supports additional background checks, continued focus on inspections of federally-li-censed firearms dealers, improved tracing and ballistics analysis, and efforts to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals and other pro - hibited persons. To support those on the frontlines across the United States, the Budget provides training for State and local law enforcement to prevent and respond to active shooters and pre - vent mass casualties. The Budget also enhances our ability to identify mental health issues early and ensures individuals get referred to treatment before dangerous situations develop. To increase the safety of schools nationwide, the Budget will continue support for the Comprehensive School Safety Program, and other initiatives to enhance our schools' physical security and create safer and more nurturing school climates that help prevent violence. Reforming the Criminal Justice System with the \"Smart on Crime\" Initiative. Last summer, the Attorney General introduced the Smart on Crime initiative, which is designed to promote fundamental reforms to the criminal justice system that will improve public safety, save money, and ensure the fair enforcement of Federal laws. The Budget supports the initia-tive's strategy of containing incarceration costs over the long-term by reducing recidivism rates and encouraging Federal prosecutors to seek sentences in certain low-level drug cases that maintain the highest degree of public safety and consider the long-term incarceration costs to the taxpayer. Maintaining High Safety Standards in the Transportation Sector. As energy produc-tion in the United States continues to rapidly in - crease, the Budget seeks to maintain high safety standards. The Budget addresses risks through new investments in data-driven safety interven - tions, research and testing, additional safety per - sonnel, emergency response training, community outreach, and other strategies. In addition, the Budget proposes a Pipeline Safety Reform initia-28 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL tive to both enhance and reform the Federal stan - dards that help protect the Nation's safety. Advancing National Security Priorities. The Budget advances the Administration's na- tional security objectives and provides the re - sources and capabilities to protect our security and interests around the world. The Budget re-flects a focused effort to address our highest de - fense priorities\u2014bringing the war in Afghanistan to a responsible end, working to disrupt and dis - able terrorist networks, combatting new threats like cyber attacks, and being ready to respond to provocations whenever and wherever neces - sary\u2014within a constrained fiscal environment. Moreover, it addresses critical national security requirements, while protecting privacy and civil liberties and providing responsible management of taxpayer resources. Investing in Long-Term Partnerships in Afghanistan. The Budget continues to sup - port U.S. security, diplomatic, and develop - ment goals in Afghanistan while scaling down military operations and assistance. The Budget includes resources to maintain a strong, long-term partnership in the coun - try by supporting military training and as - sistance as well as economic development, health, education, governance, security, and other civilian assistance programs necessary to reinforce development progress and pro - mote stability. Rebalancing American Engagement Toward the Asia-Pacific Region . The United States and its interests are inextricably linked with Asia's economies and security. The Budget makes strategic, coordinated, and Government-wide investments in a wide range of tools across the Asia-Pacific region, which will help create American jobs, em - power American businesses, and maintain the security and stability necessary for eco - nomic growth. The Budget provides resourc-es to help deepen U.S. trade and investment in the region, strengthen regional coopera - tion, and enhance regional and country-spe -cific capabilities to address security, develop - ment, and economic challenges. Powering Africa. The Administration is bringing to bear a wide range of U.S. Government tools and expertise to sup-port investment in Africa's energy sector. The Budget supports infrastructure proj-ects through the Millennium Challenge Corporation and our contribution to the African Development Bank, leverages private sector investment through the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and provides criti- cal technical assistance to African partners through the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and U.S. Trade and Development Agency. Both the investments in the power sector them - selves and the resulting economic growth will expand the markets for U.S. goods in sub-Saharan Africa. Enhancing the Protection of U.S. Diplomatic Facilities and Personnel Overseas. The Budget provides $4.6 billion for the Department of State security pro - grams, including security staff, construc - tion, and infrastructure upgrades. With a sustained level of investment in security upgrades, the Budget provides funding for the construction of new embassy and con - sulate compounds. These and other invest - ments will ensure that the Administration continues to safeguard over 86,000 U.S. Government employees, from more than 30 agency components, in more secure overseas working environments. When combined with contributions from other agencies, the Budget provides $2.2 billion for capital security construction, as recom - mended by the Benghazi Accountability Review Board. Addressing Cyber Threats. Cyber attacks targeting the financial industry, critical in - frastructure, and the Federal Government demonstrate that no sector, network, or sys - tem is immune to infiltration by those seek -THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 29 ing financial gain, perpetrating malicious and disruptive activity, or stealing commer - cial or Government secrets and property. Cyber threats are constantly evolving and require a coordinated, comprehensive, and resilient plan for protection and response. The Budget identifies and promotes cross-agency cybersecurity initiatives and pri - orities, including improving cybersecurity information sharing while protecting indi- vidual privacy and civil liberties and en - hancing State and local capacity to respond to cyber incidents. Assisting Countries in Transition and Promoting Reforms in Middle East and North Africa. Building on the Administration's significant and continuing response to the transformative events in the Middle East and North Africa region, the Budget in- cludes $1.5 billion to respond to the crisis in Syria, including providing humanitarian assistance, and continues to support transi - tions and reforms in the region. This fund - ing builds on several initiatives the United States is supporting to respond to regional developments since the beginning of the Arab Spring, including fiscal stabilization support, technical assistance, trade, and asset recovery initiatives. Supporting Global Health by Investing in High Impact Interventions. The Administration is investing in proven in - terventions to continue progress toward the goals of achieving an AIDS-free generation and an end to preventable child and maternal deaths. The Budget continues the President's pledge to provide $1 for every $2 pledged by other donors to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria by provid - ing $1.35 billion, which will increase our le - verage and accelerate progress against these three diseases. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes an additional $300 million for the Global Fund to encour - age even more ambitious pledges from other donors. The Budget supports continued ex - pansion of evidence-based HIV/AIDS pre-vention and treatment services through the Department of State's bilateral President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief program. Supporting the Nation's Servicemembers, Veterans, and Their Families. The Nation has a solemn obligation to take care of its servicemem-bers and veterans. To deliver on this commit - ment, the Budget provides significant resources to support veterans' medical care, help military families, assist servicemembers transitioning to civilian life, reduce veterans' homelessness, and improve the disability claims processing system. REDUCING LONG-RUN DEFICITS AND PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH Budgets, particularly in times of divided Government, lay out what an Administration believes is the best path forward. Last year, President Obama detoured from that path by embedding in the Budget a potential compro - mise that had been the subject of discussions with the Congress the previous year. That ap - proach was intended as a show of good faith to spark additional negotiations with congressional Republicans about our long-term debt and defi - cits, and to encourage all parties to come together to remove the damaging cuts caused by seques - tration that have hurt our economy. The compromise embedded in last year's Budget\u2014which included policies like chang - ing the measure of inflation used by the Federal Government to the chained Consumer Price Index (\"Chained-CPI\") that Republicans had asked for in previous fiscal negotiations\u2014re-mains on the table. However, in light of congres - sional Republicans' unwillingness to negotiate on fundamental issues and agree to a balanced plan to deal with our long-term fiscal challenges, this year the Administration is returning to a more traditional Budget presentation that lays out the President's vision. This includes the proposals discussed above to invest in growth and opportu -30 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL nity and pay for those investments by reforming spending programs and closing tax loopholes. With respect to the Nation's long-term fiscal challenges, this year's Budget focuses squarely on the primary drivers of long-term deficits and pro - poses further health and tax reforms to control the rate of health care cost growth and generate the revenue required to meet our obligations and make needed investments as our society ages. The President's plan includes specific reforms to Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health pro - grams that would reduce deficits by $402 billion over the next 10 years while helping keep health care cost growth low and encouraging greater efficiencies and quality of care. The President's plan also includes tax reform measures that would make the tax code more efficient and fair, and would reduce the deficit by about $650 billion over the next decade. In addition, the President is also committed to bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform. The Congressional Budget Office has found that immigration reform along the lines the President has proposed would in - crease growth while reducing the deficit by about $160 billion in the next decade, and by almost $1 trillion over the next 20 years. Building on the progress already made, the Budget's deficit reduction measures are more than enough to achieve the key fiscal goal of stabilizing the debt as a share of GDP. If the Budget's proposed policies are implemented, defi - cits will stabilize at less than 2 percent of GDP, and the Budget will be in primary surplus start - ing in 2018, meaning that revenues are cover - ing programmatic costs. Meanwhile, debt would peak at 74.6 percent of GDP in 2015 and then de-cline each year after that, falling to 69.0 percent of GDP in 2024. IMPLEMENTING ACA AND MAKING ADDITIONAL HEALTH REFORMS The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has taken his - toric and significant steps toward putting the Nation back on a sustainable fiscal course while laying the foundation for a higher-quality, more secure health care system. Through premium tax credit and cost sharing assistance to make cov-erage affordable and increased Federal support to States expanding Medicaid coverage for low-income adults, ACA ensures that every American can access high-quality, affordable coverage, pro - viding health insurance to millions of Americans who would otherwise be uninsured. 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 202468%70%72%74%76%78% Debt Steadily Declines Under President's Budget Projected Debt Held by the Public as Percent of GDP 76.4% President's Budget 69.0%BaselineTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 31 With the full implementation of ACA begin - ning this year, millions of people have enrolled in either private insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace or for coverage through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In addition, more than three million young adults already have gained cover - age under the health care law by staying on their parents' plans until their 26 th birthday. While there is much more work to be done, we now live in an era where no family will be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition like high blood pressure or asthma. No American will have to worry that losing a job means you can - not get health coverage. Small businesses may be able to get financial help to pay for new afford - able coverage options for their employees. The challenges in our health care system were decades in the making and will not be solved overnight, but every day more Americans are signing up for insurance and getting the peace of mind of knowing that they can get the care they need without losing everything they have worked and saved for. Americans across the Nation started this year with new health plans that give them the security of knowing that if they want to change jobs or start their own business, they will have access to affordable health insurance for their family. Supporting Implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Efficiently and effectively implementing ACA is one of the Administration's highest priorities. The Budget fully funds the on - going implementation of ACA, which is already providing coverage for millions of Americans that previously did not have access to affordable health care. The Budget continues to support implemen - tation of ACA's health insurance coverage improve- ments through the operation of Health Insurance Marketplaces and the delivery of premium tax credits and cost sharing assistance to help make coverage affordable, drive down long-term health care costs, and improve care for millions of citizens. Implementing Additional Health Care Reforms. In addition, the Budget strengthens Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health programs through payment innovations and oth - er reforms that encourage high-quality and effi-cient care and continue the progress of reducing cost growth. In total, these reforms would reduce deficits by $402 billion in the next decade, and about $1 trillion over the following decade. Encouraging High-Quality, Efficient Care among Medicare Providers . The Budget continues a set of proposals that build on initiatives included in ACA to help extend Medicare's solvency while encouraging pro-vider efficiencies and improved patient care. This includes proposals to encourage effi - cient post-acute care by adjusting payment updates for certain post-acute care providers and to incentivize the use of appropriate ser - vices through bundled payment and other ap- proaches. The Budget also proposes to better align payments to rural providers with the cost of care and reduce Medicare bad debt payments in a way that more closely match - es private sector standards. Additional pro - posals to promote efficiency in the Medicare program include: improving payment ac-curacy for Medicare Advantage; constrain-ing Medicare cost growth; better aligning payments to teaching hospitals with patient care costs; modifying payment updates for certain clinical laboratory services; creat - ing appropriate incentives for physicians' self-referral of specified services; addressing excess payments for Medicare Part B drugs to hospitals and physicians; and expanding the availability of Medicare data for perfor - mance improvement, fraud prevention, and other purposes. Also, the Budget builds on ACA initiatives that promote quality in the Medicare program by linking payment to the quality of care in additional provider set - tings. Together, these proposals would save approximately $229 billion over 10 years. Encouraging Beneficiaries to Seek High- Value Services. The Budget includes struc-tural changes that will encourage Medicare beneficiaries to seek high-value health care services. To help improve the financial sta-32 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL bility of the Medicare program, the Budget reduces the Federal subsidy of Medicare costs for those beneficiaries who need that subsidy the least. The Budget includes several modifications for new beneficiaries starting in 2018, such as a modified Part B deductible and a modest copayment for certain home health episodes. Research indicates that beneficiaries with Medigap plans that provide first- or near-first dol - lar coverage have less incentive to consider the costs of health care services, thus rais - ing Medicare costs and Part B premiums for all beneficiaries. The Budget applies a premium surcharge for new beneficiaries be - ginning in 2018 if they choose such Medigap coverage. In addition, the Budget modifies incentives in the Medicare prescription drug program to encourage utilization of generic drugs by low-income beneficiaries. Together, these proposals would save approximately $68 billion over 10 years. Improving Quality and Lowering Drug Costs for Federal Health Programs. The Budget includes proposals that lower drug costs, while improving quality and reduc - ing waste in the Medicare Part D program. The Budget proposes to close the coverage gap for brand drugs in the Part D benefit by 2016, four years earlier than under current law, by increasing the discounts offered by the pharmaceutical industry. The Budget also proposes to align Medicare payments for drugs with Medicaid policies for low-income beneficiaries. In addition, the Budget would improve drug plans through bonuses for the highest quality Part D plans and by pro-viding the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to suspend coverage and payment for questionable Part D pre - scriptions. Together, these proposals will save Medicare $125 billion over 10 years. In addition, the Budget includes two proposals designed to increase access to generic drugs and biologics by stopping companies from entering into anti-competitive deals intend - ed to block consumer access to safe and ef-fective generics, by awarding brand biologic manufacturers seven years of exclusivity, rather than 12 years under current law, and by prohibiting additional periods of exclusiv - ity for brand biologics due to minor changes in product formulations. These two propos - als will save the Federal Government $15 billion over 10 years, including savings in Medicare and Medicaid. Lowering Medicaid Drug Costs for States and the Federal Government . The Budget in - cludes targeted policies to lower drug costs in Medicaid. First, the Budget improves the Medicaid drug rebate program by clarifying the definition of brand drugs, collecting an additional rebate for generic drugs whose prices grow faster than inflation, clarifying the inclusion of certain prenatal vitamins and fluorides in the rebate program, and taking actions to promote the integrity of the rebate program. The Budget also corrects a technical error to the ACA alternative rebate for new drug formulations, limits to 12 quar - ters the timeframe for which manufacturers can dispute drug rebate amounts, and ex - cludes authorized generic drugs from aver - age manufacturer price calculations for de-termining manufacturer rebate obligations for brand drugs. In addition, the Budget im - proves Medicaid drug pricing by calculating Medicaid Federal upper limits based only on generic drug prices. These proposals are projected to save the Federal Government $9 billion over 10 years. Cutting Waste, Fraud, and Abuse in Medicare and Medicaid. The Administration has made targeting waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program a priority and is aggressively implementing new tools for fraud prevention included in ACA, including the fraud prevention system, a predictive analytic model similar to those used by pri-vate sector experts. In addition, the Budget proposes a series of policies to build on these efforts that will save nearly $1.1 billion over the next 10 years. Specifically, the Budget proposes to implement new initiatives to THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 33 reduce improper payments in Medicare; re - quire prior authorization for power mobility devices and advanced imaging, which could be expanded to other items and services at high risk of fraud and abuse; direct States to track high prescribers and utilizers of prescription drugs in Medicaid to identify aberrant billing and prescribing patterns; support efforts to investigate and prosecute allegations of abuse or neglect of Medicaid beneficiaries in additional health care set - tings and in the territories; and strengthen the Federal Government's ability to identify and act on fraud, waste, and abuse through Medicaid Integrity Program improvements. In addition, the Budget would alleviate State program integrity reporting requirements by consolidating redundant error rate mea - surement programs to create a streamlined audit program with meaningful outcomes, while maintaining the Federal and State government's ability to identify and address improper Medicaid payments. Making Targeted and Sensible Reforms to the Medicaid Program. The Budget pro-poses to preserve the existing partnership between States and the Federal Government while making Medicaid more efficient and sustainable. Under current law, States have experienced challenges in preventing over - payments for durable medical equipment (DME). Starting in 2015, the Budget would limit Federal reimbursement for a State's Medicaid spending on certain DME services to what Medicare would have paid in the same State for the same services. The Budget also better aligns Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments with expected lev - els of uncompensated care. These propos - als are projected to save approximately $6 billion over 10 years. Improving Care Delivery for Low-Income Medicare-Medicaid Beneficiaries. The Budget proposes a budget-neutral pilot in a limited number of States to provide qualifying low-income adults under age 55 benefits under the Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). Under current law, PACE provides comprehensive long-term services to qualifying individuals age 55 and older. Pilots will test whether PACE programs can effectively serve a younger popula - tion without increasing costs. The Budget also proposes to implement a streamlined, single beneficiary appeals process for man - aged care plans that integrate Medicare and Medicaid payment and services and serve Medicare-Medicaid enrollees to address the sometimes conflicting requirements in each program. In addition, the Budget proposes to permanently authorize a demonstration that provides retroactive drug coverage for certain low-income Medicare beneficiaries through a single plan, establishing a single point of contact for beneficiaries seeking reimbursement for claims. MAKING THE TAX CODE MORE SIMPLE AND FAIR By slowing health care cost growth, ACA and the Budget's additional health reforms will tackle one of the two key drivers of long run deficits. But over the coming decades, an aging population will also put increasing pressure on the budget. For example, by the end of the 10-year budget win - dow in 2024, the ratio of retirees to workers will be almost 50 percent higher than it was at the beginning of the 2000s, when we last balanced the Federal budget, and it will increase further over the subsequent decade. Even with reforms to Medicare and other entitlements and tough choices that will bring discretionary spending to historically low levels as a share of GDP, we will need additional revenue to maintain our commit - ments to seniors while also making the invest - ments that are needed to grow our economy and expand opportunity. The President believes that we can obtain that needed revenue by doing what leaders of both parties have called for\u2014reforming our tax code to reduce inefficient, unfair tax breaks. Tax reform holds the potential to improve economic growth 34 OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL by reducing complexity for individuals and small businesses, curbing inefficient tax subsidies that distort individual and business decision-making, and reducing the deficit. As a first step toward balanced deficit reduction and tax reform, the President proposes that the Congress immedi - ately enact two measures that would raise $650 billion in revenue by broadening the tax base and reducing tax benefits for those who need them the least\u2014without increasing marginal tax rates. Reducing the Value of Itemized Deduc - tions and Other Tax Preferences to 28 Percent for the Wealthiest Americans. Currently, a millionaire who contributes to char - ity or deducts a dollar of mortgage interest enjoys a deduction that is more than twice as generous as that for a middle class family. The Budget would limit the tax rate at which high income taxpayers can reduce their tax liability to a maximum of 28 percent, a limitation that would affect only the top three percent of families in 2014. This limit would apply to all itemized deductions, as well as other tax benefits such as tax-exempt interest and tax exclusions for retirement contributions and employer sponsored health insurance. The proposed limitation would restore the deduction rate to the level it was at the end of the Reagan Administration. Observing the Buffett Rule. The Budget also puts forward a specific proposal to comply with the Buffett Rule, requiring that wealthy million- aires pay no less than 30 percent of income\u2014after charitable contributions\u2014in taxes. This proposal will prevent high-income households from using tax preferences, including low tax rates on capital gains and dividends, to reduce their total tax bills to less than what many middle class families pay. Beyond these measures, the President is com- mitted to working with the Congress to further reform the tax code to make it fairer, promote economic growth and job creation, and improve competitiveness. FIXING OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM The President believes that we must fix our broken immigration system by continuing to strengthen our border security, cracking down on employers who hire undocumented workers, modernizing our legal immigration system, and providing a pathway to earned citizenship for hardworking men and women who pay a penal - ty and taxes, learn English, pass a background check, and go to the back of the line. In addition to contributing to a safer and more just society, common sense immigration reform will also boost economic growth, reduce deficits, and strengthen Social Security. Common sense immigration reform will contribute to growth by strengthening the workforce by attracting and retaining the best and brightest students who we train at U.S. universities, increasing capital investment and overall productivity, and increas - ing the number of entrepreneurs starting compa - nies in the United States. Moreover, by adding younger workers to the labor force, reforming our broken legal immigration system will help balance an aging population and improve the economic and budget outlook as the baby boom generation retires. The Congressional Budget Office has estimat - ed that the immigration bill that passed with bi - partisan support in the Senate last year would reduce the deficit by about $160 billion in the first decade and by about $850 billion over 20 years. Meanwhile, the Social Security Actuaries have found that the Senate bill would reduce the Social Security shortfall by $300 billion over the first 10 years and would close eight percent of the 75-year Social Security shortfall. The Administration supports the biparti- san Senate approach, and calls on the House of Representatives to act on comprehensive immigration reform this year. * * *THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 35 The Budget provides a roadmap for creat- ing jobs, growing the economy, and expanding opportunity for all Americans. The Budget invests in manufacturing, research, clean energy, infrastructure, education, and secu - rity, building a foundation for long-term economic growth. The Budget promotes economic opportu - nity and mobility by rewarding hard work with fair wages, putting a secure retirement within reach, and ensuring health care is affordable and reliable. The Budget includes enhanced efforts to deliver a 21 st Century Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth. The Budget responsibly pays for new investments, reduces the deficit as a share of the economy to below two percent by 2023, and puts debt as a share of the economy on a downward path after 2015. The Budget also addresses the Nation's long-term fiscal challenges by building on the savings and reforms in the Affordable Care Act, reforming other mandatory programs, and ending wasteful tax breaks that benefit the wealthiest. It is a Budget that shows how we can build on the progress that has been made over the last five years and ensure that our Nation remains strong and prosperous, both now and in the future.37Under the President's direction, the Administration is working to deliver a 21st Century Government that is more effective, ef - ficient, and supportive of economic growth. The President is committed to creating a Government that will make a significant, tangible, and posi - tive difference in the lives of the American people and the economy, and to driving lasting change in how Government works. The Budget supports the President's Management Agenda, a comprehensive and forward-looking plan to deliver better, faster, and smarter services to citizens and businesses; increase quality and value in the Government's core administrative functions and continue ef-forts to enhance productivity and achieve cost sav-ings across the Government; open Government- funded data and research to the public to spur innovation and economic growth; and unlock the full potential of today's Federal workforce and build the workforce we need for tomorrow. The Agenda reflects the Administration's commit - ment to building a Government that focuses on results and draws on evidence-based practices to ensure that every taxpayer dollar is used wisely and to the maximum effect. EFFECTIVENESS: DELIVER A WORLD-CLASS CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE FOR CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES Government must build, buy, and deliver ser - vices that meet the expectations of a 21st Century society, taking into account the rapid pace of in - novation and user experience to which American citizens and businesses are accustomed. With more than half of U.S. adults now using smart phones, citizens expect digital services that are simple, accessible, and easy to use. As part of the Budget, the Administration will launch new efforts to deliver a world-class customer service experience to citizens and businesses. Improving Key Citizen- and Business- Facing Transactions. By making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with the Government, online or of - fline, the Government can deliver the world-class service that citizens expect. The Budget builds on work already underway to improve key trans - actions that are large in scale, meaningful, and have the potential to significantly reduce the cost per transaction. The Budget includes ini - tiatives designed to create user-friendly experi - ences for common services in areas such as vet - erans' pension and disability applications, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance. For example, the Budget provides $100 million for the Social Security Administration (SSA) for a new custom - er service modernization initiative to significantly improve internet and in-person services at SSA. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes $150 million in additional funding to fur - ther reduce wait times and enhance services at SSA. The Administration will also invest in build - ing an eBenefits web portal at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which will allow veterans to manage their own benefits, while providing faster, more accurate benefits claim processing. For busi - nesses, the Budget proposes funds for the Small Business Administration's (SBA) SBA ONE, a single application for SBA loans that reduces time and cost for lenders to process loans, as well CREATING A 21ST CENTURY GOVERNMENT38 CREATING A 21ST CENTURY GOVERNMENT as for SelectUSA, which offers a single point of Federal contact for foreign companies that want to do business with and invest in the United States. Delivering Smarter Information Tech - nology (IT). During the first term, the Administration made progress improving the delivery of IT. By establishing new mecha - nisms such as PortfolioStat, a data-driven re-view of agency IT portfolios that has resulted in nearly $1.6 billion in savings since March 2012, and promoting new technologies such as cloud computing that give agencies the ability to pur - chase IT services in a utility-based model where they pay only for the services they consume, the Administration stopped the out of control Federal IT spending, which had been growing at seven percent per year the decade before the President took office. However, as it became clear from the problems surrounding the initial rollout of HealthCare.gov in 2013, there is still much more to do. The Administration is committed to delivering smart- er IT services, shifting the focus of Government IT projects from compliance to delivering on intended impact and meeting user needs. The Administration will begin implementing these efforts this year, and push further in 2015. To do this, we need the best talent working inside Government, the best companies working with Government, and the best processes in place to ensure accountability for delivering results for the American people. For example, the Budget funds technology-enabled solutions to create more visibility into contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies. The Budget also funds BusinessUSA, a centralized, one-stop on - line platform to make it easier for businesses to access services such as loan programs and train- ing to help them grow and hire. EFFICIENCY: INCREASE QUALITY AND VALUE IN CORE OPERATIONS AND ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS To achieve cost savings and maximize the value of Government investments, the Administration will pursue initiatives to streamline the way Government delivers services internally, with a particular focus on the core administrative functions that are common across the Federal Government. The Administration will also con - tinue ongoing efforts to enhance efficiency and identify savings. Increasing Quality and Value in Core Operations. The Budget will maximize the value of every taxpayer dollar while increasing productivity and the quality of services through: Expanding the Use of Strategic Sourcing Solutions. The Administration's efforts to better leverage the Government's buying power through the use of strategic sourcing has saved over $300 million since 2010 on commonly purchased goods such as office supplies and services such as package de - livery. Creation of central vehicles that can be used by all Federal agencies has reduced contract duplication and reduced prices for some common office supplies by over 65 percent. Such efforts save taxpayer dollars directly through reduced prices and dupli - cation that allows agencies to focus scarce human capital resources on more complex, mission-critical efforts. Expanding the Use of High-Quality, High- Value Shared Services. Today, many agen- cies are spending too much time and money on administrative and operating functions that are not central to their core mission and shared by other agencies. These functions could be handled by Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs), reducing duplication and costs while increasing quality of services through concentrated expertise. In some administrative areas, the Government has already coalesced around a small number of SSPs. For example, payroll services are provided for all Federal agencies by service centers at the Departments of Agriculture, the Interior, Defense (DOD), State, and THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 39 the General Services Administration. In the largest financial management shared service arrangement established to date, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has signed an interagen-cy agreement with the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to transition all of its core financial management func - tions to Treasury beginning in 2015. The Administration will continue to drive effi - ciencies and cost savings by increasing the performance and capacity of the SSPs. Establishing Cost and Quality Benchmarks for Core Administrative Operations. Federal agencies often do not have the tools to mea - sure their performance in key administra - tive areas such as human resources, finance, acquisition, IT, and real property. Beginning in 2014 and continuing in 2015, the Administration will leverage the Executive Councils, which represent the chief admin - istrative and operating officials at Federal agencies, to establish cost and quality bench - marks in each of these key areas. Enhancing Productivity to Achieve Cost Savings. The Administration will continue efforts to enhance productivity, reorganize or consolidate Federal programs to reduce du- plication, and identify cost savings to allow the Government to invest more in productive activities. The President is again asking the Congress to revive an authority that Presidents had for almost the entire period from 1932 through 1984\u2014the ability to submit proposals to reorganize the Executive Branch through a fast-track procedure. In effect, the President is asking to have the same authority that any business owner has to reorganize or streamline operations to meet changing circumstances and customer demand. Examples of continuing efforts to enhance productivity include: Consolidating Business and Trade Promotion Into a Single Department. As the President indicated in 2012, if given Presidential re - organization authority, the first proposal would be to consolidate a number of agencies and programs into a new Department with a focused mission to foster economic growth and spur job creation. By bringing together the core tools to expand trade and invest - ment, grow small businesses, and support innovation, this reorganization would help American businesses compete in the global economy, expand exports, and create more jobs at home. Cutting Improper Payments. The Administration has made reducing improper payments\u2014payments made to the wrong en - tity, in the wrong amount, or for the wrong reason\u2014a priority. When the President took office in 2009, the improper payment rate was 5.42 percent and rising. Since then, the Administration, working with the Congress, significantly reduced improper payments through yearly reviews by agency inspectors general and expanded audits for high priority programs. This strengthened accountability and transparency in payments resulted in the improper payment rate declining to 3.53 per - cent in 2013 when factoring in DOD commer - cial payments. Furthermore, agencies recov - ered more than $22 billion in overpayments through payment recapture audits and other methods in 2013. The Administration set a cross-agency priority goal to reach a Government-wide improper payment rate of three percent or less by the end of 2016. To support that goal, the Administration is advancing data ana - lytics and improved technology to prevent improper payments before they happen. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has begun conducting a comprehensive anal - ysis of agency-specific corrective actions to identify programs with the highest return- on-investment or potential for substantially reducing improper payments. This analysis will help shape future guidance on improper payments. Saving on Real Estate Costs. The Federal Government is the largest property owner in the United States. There are opportunities for savings by using Federal space more effi - ciently and disposing of unneeded space, and 40 CREATING A 21ST CENTURY GOVERNMENT the President has made it a priority to shrink and reduce the cost of operating the Federal real estate inventory. Laying the groundwork for the Administration's long-term strategy on real property, in 2012 the Administration issued a Freeze the Footprint policy and di-rected agencies to freeze the growth in their real estate inventory. In early calendar year 2014, the Administration will begin publicly tracking the Government's adherence to a fixed baseline\u2014730.2 million square feet\u2014composed of office and warehouse space, and agencies will continue to pursue mobile workforce strategies and tighter internal controls on space acquisitions. Through the Freeze the Footprint poli - cy, the Administration continues its work, in collaboration with the Federal Real Property Council, to improve the quality of data on the real estate inventory and to de - velop key performance metrics. In addition, the Budget includes $57 million to start up the Civilian Property Realignment Act (CPRA). CPRA would create an indepen - dent board of private and public sector real estate experts that would make recommen - dations to the Congress on properties that should be sold, consolidated, co-located, or reconfigured. Legislation to create CPRA would help to streamline the disposal pro- cess, generate $2 billion in savings through the disposal of excess properties, and pro - vide funds for real property reinvestment. Further, modernization would support the consolidation of the Federal real estate in - ventory and help reduce the Government's operating costs. Reforming Military Acquisition. DOD must procure weapon systems and critical goods and services needed by the Armed Forces to execute its national security mission. The military services and defense agencies have a portfolio of 81 ongoing major weapon sys - tem acquisition programs, and DOD con- tracts account for approximately 70 percent of all Federal procurement. The Budget continues to invest in DOD's Better Buying Power (BBP) reform, charting a path to greater productivity in the military acquisi -tion system. New BBP initiatives enforce affordability caps, measure cost perfor - mance, and align contractor profitability with acquisition goals. DOD-instituted best practices for procurement include applying lessons learned, expanding strategic sourc - ing, establishing acquisition professional reviews, and instituting peer reviews to en - sure effective competition. These actions help further the Administration's ongoing Government-wide goal to ensure smarter and more fiscally responsible buying across Government. Reducing Administrative Overhead. In November 2011, the President signed an Executive Order to promote efficient spend - ing that called for agencies to make a 20 percent reduction in their 2013 spending on administrative areas. These included travel, advisory contracts, printing, extraneous pro-motional items, and transportation. In May 2012, the Administration outlined a series of actions for further spending reductions and increasing both transparency and oversight of Federal conference and travel activity. As a result, agencies have reduced travel and conference spending alone by more than $3 billion. Overall, agencies have saved over $16 billion on administrative activities. The Administration is continuing these efforts through the strategic sourcing, shared ser - vices, and administrative benchmarking efforts outlined above. Specific examples include a 20 percent reduction in operat - ing budgets for DOD's headquarters staff through consolidating duplicative efforts and strengthening management functions. Reforming TVA. Since its creation in the 1930s during the Great Depression, the fed- erally owned and operated Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has been producing electric - ity and managing natural resources for a large portion of the Southeastern United States. TVA's power service territory includes most of Tennessee and parts of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia, covering 80,000 square miles and serving more than nine million people. TVA is a self-financing Government corporation, THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 41 funding operations through electricity sales and bond financing. The 2014 President's Budget announced the Administration's in- tentions to undertake a strategic review of options for addressing TVA's financial situ-ation, including the possible divestiture of TVA. Since then, TVA has undergone a major internal review and taken significant steps to improve its future operating and fi - nancial performance. In addition, TVA has committed to resolve its capital financing constraints. The Administration supports TVA's ongoing operating and financial initia - tives and intends to closely monitor TVA's performance. The Administration continues to believe that reducing or eliminating the Federal Government's role in programs such as TVA, which have achieved their original objectives, can help mitigate risk to taxpay - ers. The Administration recognizes the im - portant role TVA serves in the Tennessee Valley and stands ready to work with the Congress and TVA's stakeholders to explore options to end Federal ties to TVA, including alternatives such as a transfer of ownership to State or local stakeholders. Continuing PortfolioStat. In March 2012, OMB initiated the PortfolioStat process, designed as a data-driven effort with agen- cies to examine IT portfolios and identify common areas of spending to decrease du - plication and drive down costs. As a result of PortfolioStat, agencies reported nearly $1.6 billion in savings and identified more than $2.5 billion in savings that could be achieved over the 2013-2015 period. The Administration is committed to continuing the PortfolioStat process to drive further management improvements, save billions of dollars across the Federal Government, and improve services to Americans through the effective use of technology. Expanding Federal Cloud Computing. The Budget includes investments to transform the Government IT portfolio through cloud computing, giving agencies the ability to purchase IT services in a utility-based mod - el, paying for only the services consumed. As a result of the Administration's Cloud First policy, Federal agencies adopting cloud-based IT systems are increasing operational effi - ciencies, resource utilization, and innovation across the Government. To accelerate the pace of cloud adoption, the Administration established the Federal Risk Authorization Management Program, a Government-wide program standardizing how we secure cloud solutions. To further grow the use of cloud- based services, the Government is working to establish a credential exchange system that allows citizens and businesses to securely access online services at different agencies without the need for multiple digital identi - ties and passwords. Consolidating Data Centers. Under the President's Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative, the Administration is working to consolidate unnecessary Federal data centers across the Nation. Since agencies began executing their data center consolidation plans in 2011, more than 600 data centers have been closed (a complete listing of these can be found on Data.gov), leading to a net reduction in data centers for the first time in over a decade. Closing these facilities increases agency IT efficien - cies, strengthens our cybersecurity posture and decreases the Government's energy and real estate footprint. ECONOMIC GROWTH: OPEN GOVERNMENT ASSETS AS A PLATFORM FOR INNOVATION AND JOB CREATION By opening up Government-generated assets including data and the fruits of federally fund- ed research and development (R&D)\u2014such as intellectual property and scientific publications\u2014to the public, Government can empower individu- als and businesses to significantly increase the public's return on investment in terms of innova - tion, job creation, and economic prosperity. 42 CREATING A 21ST CENTURY GOVERNMENT Opening Data to Spark Innovation. The Administration has placed a high prior - ity on transparency and, in particular, on open - ing Government data as fuel for private sec - tor innovation and public use. Since 2009, the Administration has released tens of thousands of data sets to the public while protecting individ - ual privacy, on everything from credit card com-plaints, to weather and climate measurements, to what different hospitals charge for different procedures. The use of this data has resulted in new start-up companies and ventures, creating jobs and driving innovation. Private companies have used Government data sets to bring trans - parency to retirement plans, help consumers find deceptive, erroneous, and fraudulent charges on their credit and debit card bills, and increase crop yields and address climate change by enabling rapid adaptations in crop selection and manage - ment. By continuing investments in open data, the Administration supports efforts to unlock Federal data sets with a high potential for eco - nomic impact, including in the areas of health care, energy, education, public safety, tourism, and agriculture. Accelerating and Institutionalizing Lab- to-Market Practices. The Federal Government's investment in R&D yields extraordinary long- term economic impact through the creation of new knowledge, new jobs, and ultimately new industries. The Federal R&D enterprise must continue to support fundamental research that is motivated primarily by an interest in expanding the frontiers of human knowledge and diffusing this knowledge through open data and publica - tions. At the same time, economic growth can be accelerated through more effective transition of R&D results from the laboratory to the market - place, based on close collaboration with industry. The Budget reflects the Administration's com - mitment to accelerating the transfer of the re-sults of federally funded research to the commer - cial marketplace by proposing increased funding for technology transfer from Federal labs in the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and for the National Science Foundation's public-private Innovation Corps program to bring discoveries ripe for innovation out of the university lab.

Creating a Culture of Excellence and Engagement to Enable Higher Performance. Data-driven approaches to enhancing manage - ment, performance, and innovation across the Federal workforce are critical to fostering a cul - ture of excellence. In 2015, the Administration will support the development of Government- wide enterprise training and resource exchang - es across agencies to share best practices and increase leadership development opportunities within Government. Building a World-Class Federal Manage - ment Team Starting with the Senior Executive Service (SES). To ensure the Government sustains a first-class Federal work - force, the Administration will continue to invest in civil service leadership. The Administration will take administrative actions to produce a Federal executive corps with a broader, stronger experi-ence base. For example, the Budget includes funding for the Office of Personnel Management to build a stronger onboarding program for new SES, and leadership and engagement training opportunities for current SES that emphasize di- versity and the changing needs of a 21 st Century workforce. Enabling Agencies to Hire the Best Talent from All Segments of Society. The Administration is committed to working with labor groups to improve hiring outcomes by ex - ploring flexible approaches to recruit and retain individuals with high-demand talents and skills. Beginning in 2015, the Administration will launch demonstration projects to identify prom-ising practices in recruiting, hiring, onboarding, and deploying talent across agencies. The goal of these projects is to increase diversity, reduce skills gaps, and improve organizational outcomes. IMPROVE RESULTS: SETTING GOALS AND TRACKING PERFORMANCE As the Administration works to deliver on this Agenda, it is committed to driving effective per - formance management within the Government by using the framework developed with the Congress in the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and the GPRA Modernization Act. To improve outcomes, the Administration will drive progress in three ways: through a dis - crete set of Cross Agency Priority Goals, where multiple agencies come together around a cen - tral goal; through Agency Priority Goals where leaders are focused on improved implementa - tion; and through agency strategic plans covering the broad range of outcomes within an agency's mission. All three sets of goals can be found on Performance.gov. These goals and strategic plans reflect key Administration priorities and were chosen by agen-cies to achieve maximum impact. Each publicly identified goal will have Goal Leaders, an action plan, and performance indicators. OMB and Goal Leaders will regularly review progress and take corrective action as needed to keep implementation on track. Agencies will provide regular updates on their progress through Performance.gov. 45Funding Highlights: Provides $23.7 billion in discretionary resources for the Department of Agriculture to invest in rural communities; nutrition assistance for vulnerable populations; renewable energy and energy improvements to cut carbon pollution and make America more energy independent; and agricultural research in key areas such as climate resilience and improved crop production techniques. This includes: |Doubling funding for broadband access to rural communities in need; |Launching three new multidisciplinary agricultural research institutes dedicated to crop science and pollinator health, advanced biobased manufacturing and anti-microbial resistance research; |Providing the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) the resources it needs to support estimated participation, which will improve birth outcomes and support child development; and |Strengthening bee and other pollinator habitats, a key component of strong U.S. food production. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |Construction of a new biosafety research laboratory; |Reforms to encourage a shift toward competitively awarded research funding; |Forest Service construction and renovation projects, as part of the National Parks Centennial Initiative and the President's America's Great Outdoors Initiative; and |Activities to increase the resiliency of the Nation's natural resources including landscape and watershed restoration, hazardous fuels reduction, and community forest enhancement and protection.DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE46 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides leadership on issues related to food, agriculture, economic development in rural com - munities and natural resources, including energy, based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management. USDA works to expand economic opportunity through the de - velopment of innovative practices and research and provides financing needed to help expand job prospects and improve housing, utilities, and community infrastructure in rural America. The Department also works to promote sustainable agricultural production to protect the long-term availability of food. USDA programs safeguard and protect America's food supply by reducing the incidence of food-borne hazards from farm to table. The Department's programs also improve nutrition and health through food assistance and nutrition education. USDA supports agricultural and economic development in developing coun - tries through research and technical assistance to combat chronic hunger and achieve global food security. In addition, USDA manages and pro - tects America's public and private lands by work-ing cooperatively with other levels of government and the private sector to preserve and conserve the Nation's natural resources through restored forests, improved watersheds, and healthy private working lands. The recently enacted Agricultural Act of 2014 extends numerous authorities for five years and establishes stability for important agriculture, rural development, renewable energy, and nutri - tion programs. Building on this achievement, the Budget provides $23.7 billion in discretion- ary resources to support this important mission, a decrease of roughly $938 million from the 2014 enacted level. While investments are made in re - newable energy, rural development, and key re - search areas, the Budget makes tough choices to meet tight discretionary caps. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative provides additional support for key priorities. Supports Communities in Rural America Encourages Job Creation in Rural Communities. The Budget provides $58 million for a new economic development grant program designed to target small and emerging private businesses and cooperatives in rural areas. The program will utilize performance targets and evi - dence of what works best to create jobs and fos - ter economic growth, strengthening the agency's grant allocation and evaluation process. It is an - ticipated that this new program will aid in cre - ating or saving nearly 14,000 jobs and assisting over 10,000 businesses. Promotes Innovation and Job Growth Encourages Development of Rural Renewable Energy. The Budget provides $5 billion in loans to rural electric cooperatives and utilities that will support the transition to clean-energy generation and increased energy ef - ficiency. Specifically, this funding will be targeted to cut carbon pollution and promote renewable and clean energy as well as energy efficiency im - provements at electric generation, transmission, and distribution sites in rural communities. In addition, the Budget proposes a program level of $52 million for the Rural Energy for America Program to assist agricultural producers and Reforms: Brings about a fundamental shift in wildfire funding to safeguard communities and ecosystems, investing in programs to improve the resilience of the Nation's forests and rangelands and providing a stable funding source for wildfire suppression. Reforms crop insurance subsidies to companies and farmers to make the program less costly to the taxpayer while still maintaining a quality safety net for farmers.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 47 rural small businesses in developing renewable energy systems, energy efficiency improvements, and renewable energy development. Stimulates Broadband Deployment in Rural Areas. Roughly 25 percent of rural house - holds lack access to high speed internet. The Budget proposes to double the current funding for broadband grants that serve the neediest, most rural communities, which are least likely to have access to high-speed broadband infrastructure. This level of funding is anticipated to support 16 rural communities. Spurs American Innovation by Advancing Priority Research. USDA research plays a key role in fostering innovation and advancing tech - nologies that increase the efficiency, sustainabil-ity, and profitability of American agriculture. At the same time, the Administration recognizes that continued fiscal constraint requires trade- offs to focus resources on the most important na-tional priorities. As such, the Budget supports research in key areas important to American ag - riculture such as climate resilience and advanced genetics. The Budget also includes $325 million for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative competitive research program. In addition, the Budget includes $75 million to support three multidisciplinary institutes, with one dedicated to advanced biobased manufacturing, another to focus on anti-microbial resistance research, and the third on crop science and pollinator health. These institutes, recommended by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, will leverage the best research within the pub - lic and private sectors to create opportunities for new business ventures funded by the private sector. Above the base level of funding in the Budget for agricultural and forestry research, the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative pro - vides an additional $295 million to support high priority in-house research; enhance funding for competitive research, including an additional $20 million to encourage competitively awarded grants through land grant formula programs; and build a new biosafety research laboratory in Athens, GA. This modern facility is USDA's highest research construction priority and would result in the consolidation of two outdated facilities. Prevents Hunger and Supports Healthy Eating Prevents Hunger. The Administration strongly supports the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other programs that reduce hunger and help families meet their nutritional needs. SNAP is the cornerstone of the Nation's nutrition assistance safety net, touching the lives of 47 million Americans, the majority of whom are children, the elderly, or people with disabilities. In addition to supporting SNAP, the Budget also invests $30 million to support sum - mer electronic benefit pilots, which are proving successful in reducing childhood hunger and improving nutrition in the months when school meals are unavailable. Supports Healthy Eating. The Budget sup - ports the ongoing implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 with an increased investment of $35 million in school equipment grants to aid in the provision of healthy meals and continued support for other school-based re- sources. The Budget also provides $6.8 billion to support the 8.7 million individuals expected to participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which is critical to the health of pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children. The Budget also supports changes to the WIC food package that will improve consumption of nutri - tious foods that are important to healthy child development. In addition, the Budget invests $13 million in a newly authorized Healthy Food Financing Initiative, which will provide funding to improve access to affordable, healthy foods in underserved areas. Protects Natural Resources Strengthens Critical Habitats for Bees and Other Pollinators. In recent years, honey bee colony collapse disorder and other pollinator 48 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE declines have led to rising concerns among both the scientific and agricultural communities re - garding the health of these insect populations, the risks posed to pollinator services and the im- plications for agriculture. To help combat this multi-faceted problem, the Budget provides $50 million across multiple agencies within USDA to enhance research through public-private grants, strengthen pollinator habitat in core areas, double the number of acres in the Conservation Reserve Program that are dedicated to pollinator health, and increase funding for surveys to determine the impacts on pollinator losses. Agricultural productivity is directly dependent on pollinators, especially bees, for producing more than one- third of food products. Conserves Landscapes. The Budget propos- es full funding for Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) programs in the Department of the Interior (DOI) and USDA. 2015 marks the 50 th anniversary of the landmark Land and Water Conservation Act that enables vital support to sustain the outdoor recreation and conservation areas the public values. Similar to last year's pro - posal, the Budget includes a mix of discretionary and mandatory funding in order to transition to all mandatory funding beginning in 2016. These funds will assist in conserving lands for national parks, refuges, and forests, as well as State and local recreation and conservation areas. Funding will also enable collaborative projects for DOI and the U.S. Forest Service to jointly and stra - tegically conserve the most critical landscapes while improving management efficiency. These projects will support the President's America's Great Outdoors Initiative to promote job cre - ation and economic growth by strengthening the natural infrastructure for outdoor recreation and enjoyment. Continues Interagency Collaboration to Improve Water Quality. Over the past two years, USDA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and State water quality agencies have collaborated to select more than 150 priority wa - tersheds, where voluntary conservation programs could help reduce water impairments from non-point source pollution. The Budget builds upon this collaboration by having agencies work with key Federal partners, agricultural producer orga- nizations, conservation districts, States, Tribes, non-governmental organizations, and other local leaders to implement a monitoring framework and begin collecting baseline performance data to demonstrate that this focused and coordinated approach can achieve significant improvements in water quality. Implements Targeted Reforms Safeguards Communities and Ecosystems from Wildfire Damage. Fire is a natural occur - rence that can be highly beneficial to landscapes when managed properly; however, population growth near forests and rangelands, past man - agement practices, and a changing climate have dramatically increased wildfire risk and result-ing costs. The Budget calls for a fundamental change in how wildfire suppression is funded in order to help reduce fire risk, manage landscapes more holistically, and increase the resiliency of the Nation's forests and rangelands and the com-munities that border them. The Budget supports congressional proposals to fund suppression of the most severe fire activity\u2014including large fires that require emergency response, are near urban areas, or for abnormally active fire seasons\u2014as extraordinary costs that are outside the discre - tionary caps. Importantly, because this funding would not allow the total funding available un- der existing cap adjustments to grow, it would not increase overall discretionary spending. This new approach for funding suppression of catastrophic fires better safeguards non-suppres - sion programs from transfers that have dimin-ished their effectiveness in addressing threats to communities and landscapes. This allows for enhanced capabilities in programs such as the Forest Service Integrated Resource Restoration Program, the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, and the Hazardous Fuels Program, as well as the Fuels Management and Resilient Landscapes programs in DOI. Since improving community resilience to wildland fires is the responsibility of Federal, State, local, and tribal governments and homeowners, the Budget THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 49 also targets funding for fuels management and certain State programs to communities that im-plement programs to reduce fire risk on non-Fed - eral lands, including improved building standards for fire resiliency and defensible spaces. Restructures Crop Insurance Subsidies. With the recent passage of the newly en-acted Agricultural Act of 2014, many of the Administration's previously proposed reforms have been realized. However, these reforms did not include any of the Administration's propos-als for improvements and efficiencies for the crop insurance program, which continues to be highly subsidized and costs the Government on average $9 billion a year to run: $3 billion per year for the private insurance companies to administer and underwrite the program and $6 billion per year in premium subsidies to the farmers. The Budget includes proposals to reduce subsidies to farmers, as well as crop insurance companies, to more rea - sonable levels. These proposals will modify the structure of the crop insurance program so that it is less costly to the taxpayer yet still provides a quality safety net for farmers. Collectively these proposals are expected to save $14 billion over 10 years.51Funding Highlights: Provides $8.8 billion in base discretionary funding for the Department of Commerce to create the conditions for economic growth by promoting trade and investment, spurring innovation, gathering and acting on environmental intelligence, and fueling a data-driven economy. This includes: |Funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology laboratories to accelerate advances ranging from cybersecurity to advanced manufacturing, and to further expand lab-to-market transfers of manufacturing and other technologies; |Supporting key trade enforcement and promotion activities that will grow the economy, invest in underserved markets and regional economic development, and encourage greater investment in the United States; |Expanding SelectUSA, an initiative to attract, retain, and expand business investment in the United States in order to create jobs, spur economic growth, and promote U.S. competitiveness; |Continuing the Administration's strong support for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's critical weather, research, and oceans programs, including fully funding its next generation of weather satellites to maintain launch dates and provide critical, time- sensitive information to decision-makers throughout the Government and private sector; and |Providing $753 million to support key research and testing of innovative design methods necessary to achieve an effective 2020 decennial census at the lowest cost possible.

The Budget provides Commerce with $8.8 billion to support mission areas across its diverse bureaus. Key invest - ments are made in areas such as export promo-tion, investment promotion, and enforcement activities, development of weather satellites, wireless and broadband access, and research and development to support long-term economic growth. At the same time, efficiency gains, such as from streamlining operations in the Census Bureau, and reductions in lower-priority activi - ties enable Commerce to achieve administrative and programmatic savings. Invests in America's Long \u00adTerm Growth and Competitiveness Strengthens U.S. Manufacturing and Innovation. The Budget provides $141 mil-lion, a $13 million increase over the 2014 enacted level for the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, with the increase focused on ex - panding technology and supply chain capabili - ties to support technology adoption by smaller manufacturers to improve their competitiveness. The Budget also includes $15 million for the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia, a public-private partnership that will support in - dustry consortia to develop technology road maps to address common manufacturing challenges faced by American businesses. |National Institute of Standards and Technology efforts to accelerate advances in top research priorities including advanced manufacturing, forensics, cybersecurity and disaster resilience, and improve scientific facilities; |National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research, including weather and ocean research, and modernization of its observation and data gathering capabilities by replacing a NOAA research vessel; |Catalytic investments in communities and regional economies to increase their ability to accelerate production of value-added goods and services, including their capacity for advanced manufacturing; |Development of data and tools that businesses can use to help market and sell goods abroad; and |A Nation that is better prepared for the impacts of climate change by improving coastal resilience to severe weather events, climate hazards, and changing ocean conditions, including through research grants to improve severe weather prediction and the understanding of climate change impacts on various sectors, including fisheries. Reforms: Invests in regional economic competitiveness by providing $210 million to the Economic Development Administration to support community and regional economic development, commercialization of research and development, and catalytic capital projects\u2014while making reforms to ensure that these funds have the greatest impact for distressed communities. Closes one ocean science laboratory and consolidates another to improve efficiency and reduce costs.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 53 The Budget maintains the President's com - mitment to increase funding for key basic re- search agencies, including $680 million for National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) laboratories. This funding will acceler - ate advances in a variety of important areas, ranging from cybersecurity and forensic sci - ence to advanced communications and disas-ter resilience. In response to the President's 2011 Memorandum on Accelerating Technology Transfer and Commercialization, the Budget pro-vides $6 million for NIST efforts to accelerate and expand technology transfer across the Federal Government, which will enhance the competitive- ness of U.S. industry by sharing innovations and knowledge from Federal laboratories. Promotes American Exports and Investment in the United States. To promote exports and foreign investment in the United States, the Budget includes $497 million for the renamed International Trade and Investment Administration (ITIA), an eight percent increase over the 2014 enacted level. Funding for ITIA in - cludes $15 million to accelerate operations of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center, an inter - agency effort to address unfair trade practices and barriers to boost U.S. exports, and $20 mil - lion to expand SelectUSA, which promotes \"on-shoring\" and actively brings job-creating invest - ment to the United States from around the world. The Budget will expand SelectUSA, supporting the first-ever, fully coordinated U.S. Government effort to recruit businesses to invest and create new jobs in the United States. Other funds sup-port increased export promotion activities in un - derserved markets around the world and ITIA's role in the Administration's BusinessUSA initia - tive, a one-stop shop to connect businesses with Federal Government resources more effectively and efficiently. Enhances Export Control Enforcement. The Budget includes $111 million for the Bureau of Industry and Security to sustain export li - censing and enforcement activities, as well as to support the bureau's ongoing work under the Administration's Export Control Reform (ECR) initiative. The $9 million increase from the 2014 enacted level will support the bureau's expanded export licensing and export enforcement opera - tions that will improve service to U.S. exporters as controlled items shift from the State Department to the Commerce Department's jurisdiction. The Administration's continued efforts to implement the ECR initiative will advance national security and economic competitiveness by better focusing U.S. controls on transactions to destinations or end users of concern, while facilitating secure trade for controlled items with U.S. allies and close partners. Promotes Regional Economic Develop - ment. The Budget includes $210 million for the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to support innovative economic development plan - ning, regional capacity building, and catalytic capital projects. The Budget includes $25 million for the Regional Innovation Strategies Program to promote economic development planning and projects that spur entrepreneurship and innova - tion at the regional level. The Budget also pro - poses reforms to the economic development grants to ensure grantees demonstrate measurable prog - ress in achieving economic development goals, and provides EDA the flexibility to award catalytic grants tailored to address communities' specific economic needs, delivering the greatest impact for distressed regions. Continues Strong Support for Weather Satellites and Weather Forecasting. The Budget provides $2 billion to continue the devel - opment of NOAA's polar-orbiting and geostation - ary weather satellite systems, as well as satellite-borne measurements of sea level and potentially damaging solar storms. These satellites are criti - cal to NOAA's ability to provide accurate forecasts and warnings that help to protect lives and prop - erty. The Budget also fully supports the National Weather Service, including funding for research, modeling, and supercomputing capacity to accel - erate advancements in forecasting. Further, the Budget provides funding for centralized hydro - logical forecasting and studies that will inform ongoing efforts to enhance the National Weather Service's decision-support capabilities, and build a Weather Ready Nation that is more resilient to extreme weather events. 54 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Strengthens Research and Ocean and Coastal Stewardship. The Budget includes significant investments in NOAA's ocean and coastal research and observing programs, while increasing support for habitat and species con - servation activities that are essential to restor - ing and maintaining healthy, sustainable oceans. Increased funding for NOAA's research and de - velopment activities will enhance the agency's ability to detect, understand, and forecast global and ecosystem-scale changes and provide sound, science-based information to support decision-making and help communities prepare for the consequences of a changing climate. The Budget also supports investments such as coastal zone management grants, which promote well-coor - dinated ocean and coastal science and manage - ment activities. The Budget includes a proposal to close one ocean science laboratory and consoli - date another, which will allow for more efficient operations through reduced fixed costs. Prioritizes Critical Telecommunications Investments, Innovation, and Policy Coordination. The Budget demonstrates the Administration's continued commitment to broadband telecommunications as a driver of economic development, job creation, techno-logical innovation, and enhanced public safety. The President's dual broadband vision\u2014sup-ported by the Budget\u2014 of freeing up 500 MHz of Federal spectrum and connecting over 99 percent of schools to high-speed broadband con-nections through the ConnectED initiative will create thousands of quality jobs and ensure that students have access to the best educational tools available. The Budget supports imple - mentation of telecommunications provisions enacted in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, which will reduce the defi - cit by nearly $20 billion over the next 10 years through spectrum auctions. These auctions will increase commercial access to wireless broad - band spectrum while investing $7 billion to re - alize the vision of a fully-interoperable public safety and first responder broadband network. The Budget also provides $7.5 million for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's new Internet Policy Center to enhance the Department's coordination and pol - icy-making across broadband stakeholders, as well as additional investments of over $20 million for the Federal Communications Commission to make critical reforms to its Universal Service Fund program, make information technology upgrades, and provide robust program support for high priority 2015 spectrum auctions. Protects Innovators and Ensures a World- Class Patent System. Through implementation of the America Invents Act, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office continues to make it easier for American entrepreneurs and businesses to bring their inventions to the marketplace sooner, con - verting ideas into new products and new jobs. The Budget proposes several legislative reforms de - signed to improve the transparency and efficiency of the American patent system, complementing a series of administrative actions the Administration announced in June 2013, which will help to protect innovators from frivolous litigation and ensure the highest-quality patents in the system. Invests in an Efficient and Effective 2020 Decennial Census. The Budget provides $753 million, an increase of $281 million over the 2014 enacted level, to support key research and testing of innovative design methods necessary to achieve an effective 2020 decennial census at the lowest cost possible. This research and testing phase must be complete by the end of 2015 to make im - portant 2020 operational decisions. Without this additional funding for key testing, much of the cost containment efforts leading up to the 2020 Census will face increasing operational risk and decreasing accuracy. Supports Evidence \u00adBased Decision \u00adMaking Improves and Expands Federal Statistical Measures. The Budget includes $16 million to in- vest in the development of three Commerce statis - tical measures that will improve evidence-based decision-making across the Federal Government and the private sector. In the Census Bureau, $5 million is provided to improve the supplemen - tal poverty measure to allow for more fair and THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 55 accurate indexing and analysis of poverty pro - grams. An additional $5 million is provided to the Census Bureau to increase access to critical busi - ness datasets and to create a new field of research into the conditions and outcomes of business in-vestments in research, development, and innova - tion by expanding existing data projects. In the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), an investment of $4 million will improve the measurement and understanding of U.S. foreign direct investment as part of \"Build it Here, Sell it Everywhere,\" supporting the SelectUSA initia - tive and its foreign and domestic stakeholders. An additional investment of $2 million in BEA will initiate \"Big Data for Small Business,\" a new data program that will collect a new Small Business Gross Domestic Product measure to support decision-making by business owners and investors as well as small business analyses.57Funding Highlights: Provides $495.6 billion in discretionary funding for the base budget of the Department of Defense to carry out our national defense strategy and protect national security. This includes: |Ending the war in Afghanistan and, pending the signing of a Bilateral Security Agreement, maintaining a small force of Americans and international partners to train and assist Afghan forces and carry out limited counterterrorism operations in pursuit of any remnants of al Qaeda; |Supporting Government-wide efforts to rebalance diplomatic, economic, and military resources to the Asia-Pacific region while also upholding responsibilities elsewhere; |Protecting the homeland and ensuring a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; |Sustaining our ability to project power and win decisively against both state adversaries and terrorist threats; |Making progress toward restoring balance to the Joint Force by gradually raising readiness levels negatively impacted by sequestration while supporting the transition to a smaller military that is more agile and technologically superior; |Providing funds to recruit and retain the best-trained All-Volunteer Force; support military families; care for wounded, ill, and injured servicemembers; make further, measurable progress toward eliminating sexual assault in the military; and help servicemembers effectively transition to civilian life; and |Sustaining investments in science and technology programs, which drive innovation in military capabilities as well as in the civilian economy. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |Accelerated modernization of key weapons systems, faster progress toward restoring readiness lost under sequestration, and improvements to the Department's facilities. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE58 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE The Department of Defense (DOD) provides military forces and capabilities to deter war and protect the security of the United States and its interests around the world. The Budget pro - vides $495.6 billion for DOD's base budget in 2015, which adheres to the levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA). This fund - ing level will allow the military to protect U.S. in - terests and fulfill the updated defense strategy\u2014 but with somewhat increased levels of risk. The Department can manage these risks under the President's 2015 Budget plan, but risks would grow significantly if sequester-level cuts return in 2016, if proposed reforms are not accepted, and if uncertainty over budget levels continues. As the war in Afghanistan nears an end, DOD is making a strategic rebalance to the Asia- Pacific region while maintaining a military pres - ence and engagement with allies and partners in the greater Middle East and elsewhere to protect our Nation's interests. The Budget supports this adjustment and makes strategic investments in the priorities identified in the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, such as increasing our ability to effectively address the security challenges and opportunities of cyberspace, continuing to invest in research and development to feed innovation in both the military and civilian sectors, and com - batting terrorism around the world. The Budget also maintains our commitment to providing servicemembers with the right mix of equipment, infrastructure, and training to keep our forces ready for a wide range of contingencies and mis-sions. The Budget supports DOD's efforts to im - prove the defense acquisition system and, for the first time in its history, to achieve auditable finan - cial statements. The Budget sustains our commit - ment to the All-Volunteer Force\u2014the backbone of our modern military\u2014and strives to better support our servicemembers and their families, including those who are making the transition from military to civilian life. Responsibly Ends the War in Afghanistan Thirteen years after it began, the war in Afghanistan will end in December 2014, when Afghan forces assume full responsibility for their country's security. Pending the signing of a Bilateral Security Agreement, American and co-alition forces will continue to train and sustain the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) after 2014, and the United States will work col-laboratively with the ANSF to target al Qaeda and other entities that threaten the safety and security of the United States and our allies. While most U.S. troops will depart, those who remain will train key Afghan units, oversee military as - sistance programs, and support ongoing counter - terrorism efforts. To support these activities, the Budget will provide the resources necessary to maintain our commitment to sustain the ANSF, provide logistical support to coalition partners Reforms: Takes steps to slow the growth in military compensation and benefit costs to free up funds for training and modernization while ensuring we continue to honor and support our men and women in uniform. Retires aging aircraft and adjusts the planned acquisition and refurbishment of select naval assets, allowing for critical investments in new weapons systems and platforms. Aligns infrastructure with current needs and includes institutional reform efforts, such as a 20 percent cut in operating budgets for headquarters staff, which will consolidate duplicative efforts and streamline Department-wide management functions.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 59 in Afghanistan, return U.S. forces to their home stations, and repair or replace lost or damaged equipment. The President continues to assess the size of the residual force needed in Afghanistan to carry out these activities and other ongoing responsi - bilities. As a result, the Budget includes a place - holder for DOD's 2015 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding equivalent to the amount provided in the President's 2014 Budget. The Administration continues to propose a multi - year cap that limits Government-wide OCO fund - ing to $450 billion over the 2013-to-2021 period. The Administration plans to submit details of the DOD OCO request as a Budget amendment after making a determination on enduring force levels in Afghanistan. Supports Strategic Rebalancing Toward Asia DOD and other agencies are devoting increased time and resources to strengthening and trans- forming U.S. alliances and economic ties across the Asia-Pacific region. DOD's overarching objec - tive in the region is to sustain a stable security environment and a regional order rooted in eco - nomic openness, peaceful resolution of territorial and maritime disputes, free flow of commerce, democratic principles of governance, and political freedom. Toward that end, the Budget supports an integrated \"whole-of-government\" approach involving many Federal agencies, including DOD funding for continued rotational forces, military-to-military cooperation, capacity-building ac - tivities, joint training events, and essential force modernization. The benefits of these types of in - vestments were made clear in November 2013, when the United States, the Philippines, and other nations were able to respond quickly and effectively to Typhoon Haiyan. The combination of U.S. leadership and capable allies and partners will help provide for a peaceful and prosperous Asia-Pacific region supported by international norms, rule of law, and effective institutions.The Budget provides for a U.S. force posture that is geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable, giving our leaders increased options as they plan for mili - tary-to-military engagements, conduct joint and multinational training exercises, and prepare to respond to unforeseen contingencies. By the close of the decade, the majority of U.S. naval forces, in - cluding its most capable platforms and systems, will be deployed to the Asia-Pacific region. As an example of investments in this area, the Budget provides $128 million for military infrastructure; in Guam to bolster its position as a strategic hub in the western Pacific, of which $51 million will support important steps toward establishing fully capable Marine Air-Ground Task Forces through-out the region. Protects Readiness and Modernization Priorities Training and readiness are the foundation of ensuring a capable military that provides the Nation with a range of options to deter or defeat aggression or intimidation against the United States and its allies, friends, and interests. However, sequestration degraded the ability of the force to accomplish its full range of assigned missions to expected timelines and standards. The Budget provides $198.7 billion in operation and maintenance funding, in addition to other re - sources, to continue the Department's efforts to restore readiness and avoid a hollow force. The Budget also protects investments in criti - cal and emerging military capabilities, aiming to ensure that the United States maintains a decisive edge in areas such as power projection; global strike; nuclear weapons and delivery sys-tems; space and cyberspace; special operations; undersea warfare; and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. For example, the Budget invests $11.5 billion in basic and applied re - search and advanced technology development, including $2.9 billion for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which conducts high- risk, high-reward scientific research that has 60 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE fed cutting-edge technological innovation in the United States for over 50 years. Makes Hard Choices in an Era of Constrained Resources The discretionary caps originally put in place by the Budget Control Act of 2011 required all Federal agencies to make difficult choices to pri - oritize key missions and programs, streamline infrastructure and overhead, and find ways to op-erate more efficiently. In 2013, sequestration re - quired further sharp cuts, and the BBA provides modest relief in 2014 and 2015. To continue to sup - port the Nation's defense strategy in this context, DOD has made strategic choices to reduce end strength and force structure, revise some weap - ons' investment plans, and control rising compen-sation and benefits costs. The Department also seeks to rightsize its infrastructure in order to allocate scarce resources to the highest priorities. Builds a Smaller and More Agile Force. As DOD makes the transition out of a decade of war, it is reducing military end strength and force structure to build a smaller force that is more ag - ile and technologically superior. End strength in the Army and Marine Corps will gradually fall over the next few years. Once implemented, these changes will generate substantial annual sav-ings, which will help the Department fund readi - ness and training more fully. The 2013 National Defense Authorization Act requires compara - ble reductions in DOD's civilian and contractor workforces. Modernizes DOD's Compensation and Benefits System. Since 2001, military pay and benefits have grown 40 percent more than in the private sector. The Budget proposes reforms to slow this cost growth, including changes to TRICARE, lower commissary subsidies phased in over time, and modestly slower growth in the Basic Allowance for Housing, while still provid-ing a robust compensation and benefits system that honors the service of our men and women in uniform and their families. For calendar year 2015, the Budget provides a 1.0 percent increase to basic pay, a 1.5 percent increase in the Basic Allowance for Housing, and a 3.4 percent in - crease in the Basic Allowance for Subsistence. All of these changes have been recommended by the uniformed military leadership and are nec - essary to slow the growth in compensation and benefit costs in a responsible way and preserve funding needed for investments in platforms and readiness. Retires Unneeded Weapons Systems. In concert with reductions in ground forces per - sonnel, the Budget includes significant changes to many of DOD's weapons programs. For ex - ample, the Army plans to retire its aging Kiowa Warrior helicopters and instead use upgraded Apaches teamed with unmanned aerial vehicles to meet the Kiowas' armed reconnaissance mis - sion. The Navy plans to temporarily decommis-sion selected cruisers and return them to service after significant modernization overhauls. The Air Force plans to retire all of its single-mission A-10 Warthog aircraft and reduce the size of the C-130 fleet. These decisions position DOD to better support its highest priority missions. Aligns Infrastructure with Current Needs. In order to align DOD's infrastruc- ture with its mission and force structure, the Budget requests authorization for a new round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in 2017. Without a new round of BRAC, DOD will be forced to maintain unnecessary infrastructure with resources that it could otherwise use to field needed military capabilities. Further, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has directed DOD components to reduce headquarters operating budgets by 20 percent over the next five years, and it will also reorganize itself consistent with that goal. Generates More Value Out of Every Defense Dollar. Generating more value out of each defense dollar is a critical goal of DOD's ongo - ing efforts to improve the defense acquisition sys - tem, operate with greater energy efficiency, and achieve audit readiness. In the area of acquisition reform, the Department has expanded its Better Buying Power initiative to achieve affordable programs, promote effective competition, control THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 61 costs throughout the product lifecycle, and create incentives to drive productivity and innovation in both industry and Government. The Budget also continues to invest in energy efficiency ini- tiatives at DOD, which consumes almost three-quarters of all the energy used by the Federal Government. These include improving the fuel efficiency of existing equipment, developing and fielding innovative energy technologies, expand - ing renewable energy sources, and improving the energy efficiency of buildings. Importantly, DOD is executing nearly $1.2 billion in third-party-fi-nanced contracts for enhanced energy conserva - tion performance in response to the President's $2 billion goal. DOD continues to make progress in improving the quality of its financial informa-tion. The Marine Corps recently achieved the first ever clean audit opinion on a military Service budget statement, and each Service is making great efforts to build on that momentum. Strengthens the All \u00adVolunteer Force People are at the heart of our military power, and the Budget provides the resources neces - sary to sustain the All-Volunteer Force, includ- ing investments in family programs, health and wellness, and veteran transition programs. Supports Military Families. Supporting military families continues to be a top Administration priority. The Budget provides robust funding to ensure consistent and effective family services are available, including mental health and counseling services, deployment and relocation assistance, child care and youth pro - grams, military spouse employment programs, and others. In addition, the Budget invests in expanding strategies for program delivery to address the fact that most servicemembers and their families no longer live on DOD installations. For example, the Department continues to lever - age the Military OneSource platform to provide confidential, no-cost counseling and information on the full range of issues and challenges military families face, anywhere in the world. Cares for Wounded, Ill, and Injured Servicemembers. To provide quality health care for the Nation's 9.6 million eligible military beneficiaries, the Budget provides $47.4 billion for the DOD Unified Medical Budget to support the DOD Military Health System. The Budget sustains strong programs that support wounded, ill, and injured servicemembers and their fami - lies and help servicemembers transition into ci - vilian life and the workforce. In particular, DOD is improving its support for servicemember men-tal and emotional health by increasing collabora - tion among its suicide prevention programs and working to eliminate the stigma associated with accessing mental health services. Addresses Sexual Assault in the Military. Sexual assault remains a significant problem in the military, just as in the civilian world. DOD will undertake 16 distinct initiatives aimed at elimi-nating sexual assault from the military, including major efforts to ensure an appropriate command climate for every member, accountability for per - petrators and commanders, and proper care and services for victims\u2014including dedicated legal representation throughout the reformed mili - tary justice process. In addition, the President has directed DOD to complete a full-scale review of its progress in preventing and responding to sexual assault in the military by December 1, 2014. This review will include benchmarks and metrics to assess the effectiveness of DOD's ef - forts, as well as an examination of options for reforming the military justice system to enhance victim reporting, protect victims' rights, and hold offenders appropriately accountable. The Budget provides the funds needed to implement these initiatives and to continue making improvements to DOD's sexual assault prevention and response programs. Helps Servicemembers Transition to Civilian Life. The Administration continues to build on last year's work to support service men and women as they make the transition from military to civilian life. DOD has partnered with other Federal agencies to ensure that all service - members participate in effective pre-separation programs that help them plan and prepare for this major transition, including Transition GPS (Goals, Plans, Success), which reflects the first 62 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE major redesign of the interagency Transition Assistance Program in over 20 years. The Budget supports initiatives to ensure separating servicemembers have the skills needed to pur - sue employment after military service, provid - ing pre-separation counseling and employment workshops and mandating compliance with a Career Readiness Standard before transition. In addition, the Budget provides targeted resourc- es for Wounded Warriors in order to reduce dis - ability evaluation processing time, ensuring that recovering servicemembers have active recovery plans and that those who transition to veteran status will have timely access to the benefits they deserve. Proposes Additional Investments in Defense The Budget's Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative provides $26.4 billion for DOD to accelerate modernization of key weapons systems, make faster progress toward restoring readiness lost under sequestration, and improve its facilities. Accelerates Modernization of Key Weapons Systems. Consistent with the re- ductions in discretionary spending required by the Budget Control Act and the BBA, DOD has reduced or slowed down planned purchases of a variety of weapons systems and equipment over the last three Budgets. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would allow DOD to accelerate the schedules for develop - ing and buying new or upgraded systems in or - der to ensure that the United States maintains technological superiority over potential adversar - ies. For example, it provides enhanced resources for procurement of manned and unmanned air - craft, helicopters, ground vehicles, and communi - cation systems. It also expands the research and development efforts that underpin all defense modernization programs. Makes Faster Progress Toward Restoring Readiness Lost Under Sequestration. In 2013, significant reductions in funding degraded readiness throughout the Joint Force by requir - ing sharp cuts to training, maintenance, and sup - port. For example, the Air Force had to ground 33 squadrons and reduce an additional seven squadrons to basic \"takeoff and land\" training for several months. Although the base budget pro-vides the resources needed to continue gradually restoring readiness and balance, the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative provides the re - sources to expedite progress by supporting in - creased activity at depot maintenance facilities around the country; greater training support; and increased funding for fuel, spare parts, and transportation costs. Improves DOD Facilities. Sequestration required significant funding cuts for DOD facili- ties, forcing the Department to defer some sus - tainment, restoration, and modernization (SRM) costs, as well as some military construction proj - ects. The base budget provides the funds nec- essary to keep DOD bases, housing, and other facilities safe, secure, and operational, but not enough to avoid long-term deterioration. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative pro - vides additional resources for SRM and construc - tion at hundreds of DOD installations that will generate jobs and reduce future costs to replace buildings, roads, runways, and other facilities.63Funding Highlights: Provides $45.6 billion in base discretionary funding for the National Intelligence Program to support national security goals and reflect a deliberative process to focus funding on the most critical capabilities. This includes: |Funding to continue integrating intelligence across the Government to help policy officials make decisions informed by the latest and most accurate intelligence available; |Countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by strengthening collection capabilities; |Supporting military operations around the world by addressing both current and future needs; |Adapting to evolving cyberspace capabilities to help protect Federal networks, critical infrastructure, and America's economy, while improving the security of intelligence networks against intrusion and counterintelligence threats; and |Enhancing information sharing through expanded use of the IT cloud to facilitate greater efficiency and improved data security across the intelligence information environment. Reforms: Supports the new presidential policy directive that governs signals intelligence collection and strengthens Executive Branch oversight of signals intelligence activities. Continues efforts to rightsize the workforce and to preserve critical current and future mission capabilities in the current fiscal environment. Reduces lower priority programs to enable investments in the most critical National Intelligence Program capabilities.NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM64 NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM The National Intelligence Program (NIP) funds Intelligence Community (IC) activities in six Federal Departments, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The IC provides intelligence col - lection, the analysis of that intelligence, and the responsive dissemination of intelligence to those who need it\u2014including the President, the heads of Executive Departments, military forces, and law enforcement agencies. The IC's efforts play a critical role in protecting American citizens, safeguarding the U.S. economy, and fostering con - tinued economic growth. The Budget advances the Administration's national security objectives and the National Intelligence Strategy, while pro- tecting privacy and civil liberties and providing responsible management of taxpayer resources. The Budget represents a focused effort to ad-dress the most critical national security require - ments while accepting and managing risk within a constrained fiscal environment. Savings are achieved by reducing personnel, eliminating leg - acy capabilities, scaling back operations on lower priority missions, and implementing new solu-tions for the delivery of information technology services. Reflecting the Administration's commit- ment to transparency and open government, the Budget continues the practice begun in the 2012 Budget of disclosing the President's aggregate funding request for the NIP. However, the details regarding the NIP budget remain classified, so the Budget highlights key NIP-funded activities but does not publicly disclose detailed funding re - quests for intelligence activities. Advances National Security Goals Integrates Intelligence. The Budget con - tinues to support efforts to improve intelligence integration to more efficiently and effectively harness the strengths and capabilities across the IC. Through National Intelligence Managers and their associated Unifying Intelligence Strategies, the Director of National Intelligence has brought together the expertise to fulfill the goals of the National Security Strategy and the National Intelligence Strategy, as guided by the National Intelligence Priorities Framework. The IC is working to ensure that integrated intelligence information flows anywhere and anytime it is re - quired by any authorized user, from the President to U.S. troops on the ground. Continues Key Capabilities to Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction and Disrupt Terrorism. The IC enhances collection capa - bilities to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The IC continues to lead opera - tions to defeat al Qaeda and other violent extrem-ists, penetrate and analyze targets of interest, identify and disrupt counterintelligence threats, and provide strategic warning to policymakers on issues of geopolitical and economic concern. The Administration also remains committed to measuring performance to evaluate progress, en - sure key intelligence gaps are closed, and create accountability for results across the entire NIP. Supports the Military Services. The Budget supports the ability of the IC to play a key role in informing military strategy and deci - sion-making. The IC provides situational aware - ness for military leaders, particularly as needed for force protection, targeting support, and other timely and actionable intelligence. Planners look to the IC for adversary plans, intentions, and ca - pabilities. The Budget balances its focus between current, immediate needs for U.S. military forces engaged in operations with enduring intelligence requirements for potential future military and security needs. Adapts to Evolving Cyberspace Oper - ations. Cyber threats are constantly evolving and require a coordinated and comprehensive way of thinking about cyberspace activities. No U.S. sector, network, or system is immune from penetration by those who seek to make financial gain, to perpetrate malicious and disruptive ac-tivity, or to steal commercial or government se - crets and property. The IC's goal is for relevant pieces of information to be available\u2014to those with appropriate access\u2014in order to connect the dots in identifying cybersecurity threats while protecting individual privacy and civil liberties.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 65 Enhances Information Sharing While Safeguarding Intelligence Networks. The IC depends on robust information technology ca - pabilities to support operations and information sharing and collaboration with authorized users. The Budget expands the use of common, secure, shared IT capabilities and services through the integrated cloud hosting environment, continues support for the protection of the critical networks that facilitate information sharing and operation- al requirements, and accelerates various informa-tion protection and access control mechanisms. The IC supports the Senior Information Sharing and Safeguarding Steering Committee, which the President established by Executive Order in 2011, to guide and prioritize Government-wide investments in classified networks and to support the Administration's National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding. Makes Difficult Cuts and Reforms Enhances Transparency and Reforms Signals Intelligence Programs. After a com- prehensive review of signals intelligence pro- grams, and in light of new and changing technol- ogies, the President announced how the IC will use its signals intelligence capabilities in a way that protects national security while supporting foreign policy, respecting privacy and civil liber - ties, maintaining the public trust, and reducing the risk of unauthorized disclosures.In addition, the President has issued a new policy directive for signals intelligence activi- ties at home and abroad. This directive lays out new principles that govern how the IC conducts signals intelligence collection and strengthens Executive Branch oversight of signals intelli-gence activities. The Budget fully supports this new directive. Rightsizes the Workforce. Recognizing the challenges of this fiscal environment, the IC continues to review its operational, investment, and infrastructure programs to identify efficien - cies. The Budget reduces Government person - nel levels, as supported by the Congress, with a continued aim to rightsize the workforce while focusing on sustaining the skills in the current IC workforce that have been developed over the past decade. Achieves Savings Through Reducing Lower Priority Programs. The NIP budget reflects a deliberative process to ensure that the IC focuses on those programs that have the most significant return on investment and terminates or reduces those considered lower priority or un - derperforming. For example, the Budget contin - ues the IC's migration to more efficient informa - tion technology and collection architectures that posture the IC for future capabilities.67Funding Highlights: Provides $68.6 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Education to build upon investments in preschool access, ongoing K-12 reforms, and efforts to make college an affordable and valuable investment for all Americans. Activities supported at the Department include: |Establishing a landmark Preschool for All initiative, to ensure that America's four-year-olds have access to a high-quality early education; |Introducing a new Race to the Top Equity and Opportunity competition centered on increasing the academic performance of high-need students and closing the achievement gap; |Supporting the ConnectED initiative that will connect 99 percent of American students to the digital age, by providing teachers the professional development and support they need to take full advantage of next-generation broadband and high-speed wireless networks in schools and libraries and provide high-quality instruction that prepares students for college and careers; |Investing in high school redesign, to create more innovative schools that personalize teaching and learning for students, prepare students early to succeed in college and careers, and expose them to the demands of our high-tech economy; |Making our schools safer through the President's Now Is the Time initiative to reduce gun violence and prevent future tragedies; |Maintaining investments in formula programs that support low-income and high-need students, including Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies and Special Education Grants to States; |Investing in programs that are driving change on the ground for school-aged children such as Promise Neighborhoods, the Teacher Incentive Fund, Investing in Innovation, and School Improvement Grants; |Implementing the President's plan to make college more affordable and improve outcomes by supporting the development of a new college ratings system, spurring performance-based reforms at the State level, rewarding institutions that produce strong outcomes for Pell Grant recipients, and helping borrowers manage their student loan debt; andDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION68 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Americans must be prepared with the skills and knowledge necessary to compete in the 21st Century economy. Expanding educational oppor - tunities is critical to equipping all children with these skills and positioning them to succeed as adults. Under the leadership of the Department of Education (ED), the Administration has in-creased access to preschool, spurred sweeping re - forms in K-12 education that are showing results, and made going to college an accessible dream for more Americans. For example, high school gradu- ation rates have reached the highest level on re - cord, and students are making gains in reading and math, especially in States that have under - taken reforms to raise standards, improve teach - er effectiveness, and turn around low-performing schools. Pell Grants are larger than when the President took office and are currently help - ing nearly nine million students afford a college education. The Budget continues an emphasis on early education and on making college more affordable\u2014investments that lead to a brighter future. In addition, the Budget builds on ongoing K-12 reforms with a new Race to the Top Equity and Opportunity competition that will help en-sure all children have access to a high-quality education that helps them meet high academic standards. The Budget also includes new invest - ments to help school districts prepare teachers for the digital age, and to redesign America's high schools to prepare students early for success in college and in high-demand careers. Enhances Access to High \u00adQuality Early Childhood Education The President believes that all children should have access to a high-quality preschool education. Research has shown that supporting children at this stage of life leads to significant benefits in school and beyond. This is particularly true for low-income children, who often start kindergar - ten academically behind their peers by many months. Providing high-quality early childhood |Supporting and testing innovative strategies and practices that improve college completion rates and make college more affordable, particularly for low-income students, through the First in the World fund, to help meet the goal of having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |Additional Preschool Development Grants to reach two-thirds of States by 2015, laying a stronger foundation for Preschool for All; and |Additional funds to expand access to professional development to a total of 100,000 teachers in 500 districts to take greater advantage of the universal broadband provided through the ConnectED initiative; supporting 35 additional Promise Neighborhoods; and investing more intensively in high school redesign and closing the achievement gap through Race to the Top. Reforms: Improves the impact of the Federal investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education by creating a fresh framework for delivering STEM education, supporting what works, and reducing fragmentation. Targets campus-based student aid programs so that funding goes to institutions that are effective in enrolling and graduating Pell Grant-eligible students and keeping their costs low.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 69 education to all children will enable them to start school ready to learn and realize their full poten - tial. The Budget maintains support for the land - mark 2014 Preschool for All proposal to ensure four-year-olds across the Nation have access to high-quality preschool programs. The proposal, financed through an increase in the tobacco tax, establishes a Federal-State partnership to pro - vide all low- and moderate-income four-year-old children with high-quality preschool, while pro - viding States with incentives to expand these pro - grams to reach additional children from middle class families and put in place full-day kindergar - ten policies. To support this effort, the Budget also proposes to double the Department's current discretionary investment in preschool by fund - ing Preschool Development Grants at $500 mil-lion in 2015. An additional $250 million would be provided through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, for a total discretionary investment of $750 million. This would be suf - ficient funding to reach two-thirds of States by 2015, laying a stronger foundation for Preschool for All. These grants will ensure that States and localities willing to commit to expanding preschool access are able to make the critical investments necessary to support high-quality programs. The preschool initiative is coupled with companion investments in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in voluntary home visit-ing and high-quality early care and education for infants and toddlers. Targets the Achievement Gap Through a New Race to the Top Competition As the 2013 report by the Equity and Excellence Commission made clear, the problem of inequi- table opportunities for students in the Nation's highest poverty schools denies those students the quality education needed to compete successfully in the global economy and imposes a substantial economic cost on the Nation. The Budget acts on the findings in this report by proposing a new $300 million Race to the Top (RTT) Equity and Opportunity competition centered on closing the achievement gap. Additional resources would be provided through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative. The RTT initiative will link together State and local fiscal, student achieve - ment, and human resource data systems, allowing them to work in concert to provide underserved students access to high-quality teachers and lead - ers, coursework, and other evidence-based sup-ports. RTT Equity and Opportunity grants will reward tracking resources at the school level and using data, including return on investment met - rics, to target intensive interventions to schools that most need the extra help. The initiative will also leverage resources from other Federal programs, such as Title I Grants and State Longitudinal Data Systems, which the Budget proposes to double in funding to $70 million. The Budget maintains significant investments in Title I Grants and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Grants to States to ensure communities receive a critical base of support for their low-income and high-need students. Supports Teachers and Helps Prepare Them for the Digital Age The President has called on the Federal Communications Commission to take steps to connect 99 percent of American students to the digital age through next-generation broadband and high-speed wireless networks in their schools and libraries. The Budget proposes $200 million for a ConnectEDucators initiative to ensure that students receive the full benefit of this connec - tivity by providing professional development op - portunities and high-quality digital instructional resources to teachers to help them make effective use of these new resources. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would add $300 million to this initiative to provide a total of 100,000 teachers in 500 school districts across the United States with access to professional devel - opment in this area. In addition, the Budget pro - poses $5 billion in mandatory funds for RESPECT (Recognizing Educational Success, Professional Excellence, and Collaborative Teaching) grants to support teachers by improving preparation and early career assistance; helping teachers as they lead the transition to college- and career-ready standards; and ensuring that teachers have a supportive work environment.70 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Redesigns High Schools to Teach Real \u00ad World Skills The President has called for a comprehensive effort to rethink the high school experience, chal- lenging schools to scale up innovative models that personalize teaching and learning for stu- dents, so that they receive the rigorous and rel-evant education needed to graduate and transi - tion into postsecondary learning and adulthood. The Budget provides $150 million for a new pro - gram to redesign high schools to focus on provid - ing students with challenging, relevant learning experiences, and reward schools that build new partnerships with colleges, employers, and other partners to enhance instruction and to help de-velop the knowledge and skills students need for success in today's economy. Additional resourc- es would be provided through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative. Builds on High \u00adPriority School Safety and STEM Initiatives The Budget invests in the President's plan to reduce gun violence and increase school safety, building on efforts underway in 2014. The Budget provides $80 million to help schools create safer and more nurturing school climates through ev - idence-based behavioral intervention practices, provide support and services to children exposed to pervasive violence, collect data on school safety and climate, and disseminate best practices. This investment will continue the collaboration with the Department of Justice and HHS to support comprehensive school safety strategies and to increase access to mental health services. The Budget proposes a fresh Government-wide reorganization of STEM education programs de - signed to enable more strategic investment in STEM education and more critical evaluation of outcomes. This proposal reduces fragmentation of STEM education programs across Government, and focuses efforts around the five key areas identified by the Federal STEM Education 5-Year Strategic Plan: P-12 instruction; undergradu - ate education; graduate education; broadening participation in STEM to women and minorities traditionally underrepresented in these fields; and education activities that typically take place outside of the classroom. In line with the reorga - nization, the Budget provides $170 million to ED to lead a cohesive and robust initiative around transforming STEM teaching and learning and working toward the President's goal of recruiting, preparing, and retaining 100,000 effective STEM teachers over the next decade. Advances K \u00ad12 Reforms Through Programs Showing Results The Department of Education has focused its reforms on building evidence and improv-ing outcomes. ED's most mature reforms are its signature K-12 initiatives\u2014RTT, Investing in Innovation (i3), School Improvement Grants (SIG), Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF), and Promise Neighborhoods\u2014which have contributed to a sea change in how schools across the Nation deliver education. The Budget continues to invest in these priority programs, the successes of which are now becoming apparent: States have made major reforms in their teacher and principal evaluation policies, supported by investments in TIF and RTT that will help identify, reward, and support effective teachers and principals; The i3 program is helping to uncover what works in education through rigorous evalu- ations of projects focused on supporting our educators in delivering effective instruction; ensuring successful implementation of high- quality standards and assessments; and improving our low-performing schools; By next year, nearly 40 percent of the Nation's 5,000 lowest achieving schools will be imple - menting turn-around strategies; early data indicate significant achievement gains in many of the SIG schools that outpace the na - tional average; Forty-six States are implementing rigor - ous college- and career-ready academic standards and nearly all will field test THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 71 performance-based assessments tied to those standards this spring, a movement fueled by previous RTT grants. The eight States that implemented college- and career-ready standards (as part of RTT) in time for the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress exams showed improvement from 2009 to 2013 in either reading or math scores, and large cities made even greater gains; and The President named the first five Promise Zones in January 2014, and 15 other com - munities will be created in the year ahead. In support of the goals of this initiative, the Budget requests $100 million to support cur - rent Promise Neighborhoods and create up to five more and the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative adds $200 million to support another 35 awards. Makes a High \u00adQuality College Education More Affordable The President has placed a high priority on making college affordable and helping Americans obtain a meaningful college degree. Beginning in 2009, the Administration has increased the maximum Pell Grant by $1,000, to $5,730 in school year 2014-15, and provided additional tax benefits to help families pay for college. The Administration ended the inefficient guaranteed student loan program, using those savings to fund the Pell Grant program, and has expanded the income-driven repayment options available to borrowers so they can manage their student loan debt. In addition, in 2013, ED introduced the College Scorecard to assist prospective students and their families when searching for and select - ing a college, and the President announced the development of a college ratings system to iden - tify schools providing the best value and encour - age all institutions to improve student access, af - fordability, and outcomes. The Budget builds on this progress and charts a path forward on the President's plan to make college more affordable and provide a better bargain for the middle class. Supports a New College Ratings System, Bonuses, and Pell Grant Reforms to Improve Performance and Outcomes in Higher Education. In August, the President directed ED to develop and publish a new college ratings system that will identify colleges that provide the best value to students and encourage all colleges to improve. The Budget supports the development and refinement of the ratings sys-tem through funding for data initiatives or other necessary projects. The Budget provides new College Opportunity and Graduation Bonuses to reward colleges for improving educational out-comes for low- and moderate-income students. In addition, the Administration will provide Pell Grant eligibility to students who are co-enrolled in adult and postsecondary education as part of a career pathway program to allow adults with - out a high school diploma to gain the knowledge and skills they need to secure a good job. The Administration will also strengthen academic progress requirements in the Pell Grant program to encourage students to complete their studies on time. Promotes Innovation and Competition in Higher Education. There are many promis-ing reforms at both the State and institutional levels that the Administration seeks to encour - age. In particular, there is the potential for breakthroughs on cost and quality through State reforms\u2014such as performance-based funding and strong alignment between the K-12, post - secondary, and workforce systems\u2014and institu - tional innovations, such as accelerated degrees and competency-based education. The Federal Government can act as a catalyst for innovation by investing in promising policies and practices and challenging States and higher education institutions to offer students a greater range of affordable, high-quality options. The Budget increases investment in the First in the World fund to $100 million, which will support and test promising institutional innovations and practic - es that improve educational outcomes and make college more affordable for students and families. 72 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION The Budget also provides $75 million for College Success Grants to support sustainable strategies to reduce costs and improve student outcomes at Minority Serving Institutions. In addition, the Budget funds pilot and demonstration programs to test various approaches that improve student outcomes, supports post-secondary evaluation, and provides for more frequent data collection through the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey. In adult education, the Administration is spurring innovation through the creation of mod-el public-private partnerships to increase access to high-quality programs and improve partici - pant outcomes. In addition, the Budget proposes a $4 billion mandatory fund to support States that are committed to investing in higher educa - tion and improving performance and outcomes at their public higher education institutions.Ensures that Student Debt Remains Affordable. The Administration is helping stu-dent borrowers with existing debt manage their obligations through income-driven repayment plans such as Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) that cap student loan payments at 10 percent of discre - tionary income. ED has contacted struggling borrowers to make sure they are aware of these new options, and ensure that they have the in- formation they need to choose the best plan for them. The Budget proposes to extend PAYE to all student borrowers and reform the PAYE terms to ensure that the program is well-targeted and provides a safeguard against rising tuition at high-cost institutions.73Funding Highlights: Provides $27.9 billion in discretionary funds for the Department of Energy that will: position the United States to compete as a world leader in clean energy and advanced manufacturing; enhance U.S. energy security; cut carbon pollution and respond to and prepare for the threat of climate change; and modernize the nuclear weapons stockpile and infrastructure.

The Budget also supports technical assistance to States and local communities to help ensure shale gas is |Strengthened national resilience to the effects of climate change, including investments specifically for identifying and analyzing critical infrastructure vulnerabilities as well as funds for grants to support State and local level resilience planning; and |Accelerated national security investments within the National Nuclear Security Administration, including facilities construction, deferred maintenance projects, and research and development to keep nuclear weapons safe, reliable, and effective. Reforms: Achieves savings and efficiencies by eliminating $4 billion annually in fossil fuel subsidies, cutting low priority and low performing programs, and increasing utilization of existing facilities and infrastructure. Supports ongoing efforts to improve management and performance through the reorganization of the management structure and by supporting a more robust policy analysis process.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 75 developed in a safe, responsible way that helps build diverse and resilient regional economies that can withstand boom-and-bust cycles and can be leaders in building and deploying clean ener - gy technologies. Within the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, the Budget also invests $180 million in R&D and other activities that will facilitate the transition from the cur - rent electricity delivery infrastructure to a Smart Grid. The Budget also provides $863 million for the Office of Nuclear Energy, which includes fund-ing for R&D on advanced small modular reactors. The Budget provides $476 million for the Fossil Energy Research and Development program pri - marily dedicated to further lowering the costs of carbon capture and storage and advanced power systems, which are key elements of achieving the President's climate goals and the all-of-the-above energy strategy. In addition, the Budget requests $325 million for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, a program that seeks to fund transformative energy research, and over $900 million for basic clean energy research in the Office of Science. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative accelerates research and the develop - ment and deployment of new, high impact clean energy technologies by providing an additional $484 million for activities leading to innovative materials, processes, and system designs; valida - tion of new technologies; and increased Federal energy cost savings. Invests in Energy Productivity and Advanced Transportation to Reduce Costs and Strengthen Domestic Manufacturing. The Budget supports progress toward the President's goal of cutting energy wasted by homes and businesses\u2014doubling energy produc-tivity by 2030. The Budget provides $227 mil-lion for the Weatherization Assistance Program to help tens of thousands of low-income families save hundreds of dollars a year on their energy bills by making their homes more energy ef-ficient. DOE's Federal Energy Management Program will continue to assist agencies to im - prove the energy efficiency of Federal buildings by investing in both efficiency and new renewable energy. The Budget invests in a national effort to develop and commercialize emerging energy-efficient and cross-cutting manufacturing tech - nologies. As an integral part of this initiative, the Budget provides DOE with $305 million to expand efforts on innovative manufacturing pro - cesses, including Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institutes as part of a larger national network of manufacturing innovation institutes. In addition, the Budget helps States and locali - ties improve the integration and utilization of natural gas in manufacturing and transportation. Building on previous investments supporting U.S. electric and alternative-fuel vehicle development and manufacturing, the Budget provides $359 million in discretionary funding for DOE vehicle technology activities. These activities include the EV Everywhere initiative, a targeted effort to make electric-powered vehicles as affordable and convenient as gasoline-powered vehicles for the average American family within a decade, and support, through the Clean Cities program, to promote the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles. The Budget also promotes fuel supply diversifi-cation by providing $253 million at DOE to de- velop and demonstrate conversion technologies to produce advanced biofuels, such as \"drop-in\" replacements for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. In addition, the Budget invests $2 billion over the next 10 years from Federal oil and gas develop - ment revenue in a new Energy Security Trust that would provide a reliable stream of manda - tory funding for R&D on cost-effective transpor - tation alternatives utilizing cleaner fuels such as electricity, homegrown biofuels, renewable hydrogen, and domestically produced natural gas that reduce U.S. dependence on oil. To further increase U.S. energy productivity, the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes one-time funding for Race to the Top performance-based awards to support State gov- ernments that implement effective policies to cut energy waste and modernize the grid, and additional funds to strengthen national resil - ience to the effects of climate change, including investments for grants to support State and local level resilience planning.76 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Invests in Basic Research and Re search Infrastructure to Keep America Compe - titive. To continue the cutting-edge R&D that is essential to U.S. innovation and economic compet - itiveness, the Budget provides over $5 billion to the Office of Science, which funds research grants and unique scientific facilities in multiple areas of science, including physics, biology, climate and environmental sciences, fusion, computational science, materials science, and chemistry. Cuts Wasteful Spending and Improves Efficiency Eliminates Unnecessary Fossil Fuel Subsidies. As the Nation continues to pur - sue clean energy technologies that will support future economic growth, it should not devote scarce resources to subsidizing the use of fossil fuels produced by some of the largest, most prof - itable companies in the world. That is why the Budget proposes to eliminate unnecessary fossil fuel subsidies that impede investment in clean energy sources and undermine efforts to ad - dress the threat of climate change. In total, the Budget would repeal over $4 billion per year in tax subsidies to oil, gas, and other fossil fuel producers. Protects Americans from Nuclear Threats Ensures a Safe, Secure, and Effective Nuclear Deterrent. The Budget proposes $8.3 billion for Weapons Activities, an increase of $533 million, or 6.9 percent above the 2014 en- acted level, to maintain a safe, secure, and ef - fective nuclear deterrent as described in the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) of 2010. Building on last year's jointly conduct - ed cooperative analysis and planning process, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) agreed on a prioritized plan and associated bud - get to meet the key NPR goals within the fiscal constraints of the Bipartisan Budget Act. Key nuclear stockpile programs, like the W76 and B61 life extensions, are sustained.The Budget continues to make investments in improving or replacing aging facilities; adding funds for tritium production and plutonium man - ufacturing and experimentation; and sustaining the existing stockpile by maintaining the under - lying science, surveillance, and other support pro-grams. These foundational capabilities provide the bedrock that supports a safe, secure, and ef - fective nuclear deterrent, and enables the United States to continue its nuclear testing moratorium in place since 1992. The Budget reflects a concert - ed effort to reduce the impact of the current fiscal environment on these capabilities. The Uranium Processing Facility, which has experienced cost growth in the design, will apply lessons learned from the analysis of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement-Nuclear Facility. To accelerate modernization and maintenance of nuclear facilities, the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative accelerates funding for infra - structure planning and improvements found in the Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities and the Site Stewardship programs. The Budget also includes funds to increase nuclear science and engineering research and development found in the Campaigns. The Budget also proposes $1.4 billion to fund naval reactors. This funding contin - ues operational support to nuclear powered sub-marines and aircraft carriers, and development of the reactor for the replacement to the OHIO class ballistic missile submarine, and recapital - ization of the program's 55-year old nuclear fuel infrastructure. Reflecting a close partnership and shared com- mitment between NNSA and DOD to the Nation's defense, a portion of future funding for NNSA will continue to be included in DOD's outyear budget, providing allocations to NNSA in each budget year. Prevents the Proliferation of Nuclear Material, Technologies, Facilities, and Expertise. The Budget proposes $1.6 billion to prevent the proliferation of nuclear materials, technologies, and expertise that can support the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear terrorism. THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 77 This funding supports Administration priorities by securing and eliminating unnecessary prolif - eration-attractive nuclear and radiological mate - rial, developing and fielding technologies to deter or detect nuclear proliferation, and implementing international nonproliferation regulatory con-trols and working to strengthen international nuclear safeguards and security regimes. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would accelerate nonprolifera - tion research and development and expand international scientific engagement. Following a year-long review of the plutonium disposition program, the Budget provides funding to place the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility in South Carolina into cold-standby. NNSA is evaluating alternative plutonium dis - position technologies to MOX that will achieve a safe and secure solution more quickly and cost effectively. The Administration remains commit - ted to the U.S.-Russia Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement, and will work with its Russian partners to achieve the goals of the agreement in a mutually beneficial manner. Protects the Public from Harmful Exposure to Radioactive Waste and Nuclear Materials at DOE Sites. The Budget includes $5.6 billion for the Environmental Management program to ensure that nuclear waste from the production of weapons during the Cold War is safe - ly processed, secured, and disposed of in a timely manner. The program's cleanup actions include removing radioactive waste from underground storage tanks, decontaminating and decommis - sioning old production facilities, and remediating soil and groundwater. Securing the Long \u00adTerm Disposal of Nuclear Waste Supports the Administration's New Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste. The Administration re - leased its Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High Level Radioactive Waste in January 2013 after deter - mining that Yucca Mountain was not a work - able solution for disposing of the Nation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Fundamentals of the Strategy include the cre - ation of a well-defined consent-based facility sit - ing process, implementation of interim storage in the near term, development of geologic disposal as a permanent solution, establishment of a new body to run the program, and an approach to make funds collected to support nuclear waste management more directly available for that pur - pose. The Strategy provides a framework for an integrated program for nuclear waste manage - ment and the Budget continues to lay the ground - work for full implementation, including sustain - able funding mechanisms. The Budget provides $79 million for R&D and process development activities in the areas of transportation, storage, disposal, and consent-based siting.79Funding Highlights: Provides $77.1 billion in base discretionary resources for the Department of Health and Human Services to help make coverage affordable, drive down long-term health care costs, and improve care for millions of Americans, as well as to train new health care providers, address public health priorities, assist vulnerable populations, and support medical research. Activities supported at the Department include: |Supporting the Affordable Care Act's health insurance coverage improvements that are already providing coverage for millions of Americans through the operation of Health Insurance Marketplace and the delivery of subsidies to make coverage affordable; |Investing in a new initiative to improve access to high-quality health care providers and services; |Promoting innovative medical research by providing $30.2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, including increased resources for Alzheimer's disease research and its contribution to the BRAIN initiative; |Improving and expanding mental health services for youth and families through the President's Now is the Time initiative and targeted investments in the Medicaid program; |Strengthening national preparedness for naturally occurring and terrorist threats to public health through the development and acquisition of next generation medical countermeasures; |Investing in high-quality services for the Nation's youngest children, with increased funding for Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships and additional funds to expand evidence-based, voluntary home visiting; and |Assisting vulnerable populations by investing in improving outcomes for children in foster care and supporting services for the victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |Preparing our children to succeed in life, by providing high-quality early learning opportunities to a total of more than 100,000 children through Early Head Start-Child Care DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES80 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the principal Federal agency charged with protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services. The Budget includes $77.1 billion in discretionary funding to support HHS's mission, $0.8 billion below the 2014 enacted level. The Budget prioritizes core services and programs and makes targeted in - vestments in training and support of health care providers, innovative biomedical research, food and drug safety, mental health services, health care for American Indians and Alaska natives, early childhood programs, and services for other vulnerable populations. Improves Health Care Access, Research, and Quality of Services Ensures Quality, Affordable Health Care by Implementing the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act ensures that every American has access to high-quality, affordable coverage, providing health insurance to mil - lions of Americans who would otherwise be un - insured. The Health Insurance Marketplace pro-vides millions of Americans and small businesses with \"one stop shopping\" for affordable, private coverage. The Affordable Care Act also provides premium tax credit and cost sharing assistance to make coverage affordable and increases Federal support to States expanding Medicaid coverage for newly eligible low-income adults. Efficiently and effectively implementing these coverage im - provements is one of the Administration's highest priorities. The Budget provides resources to con-tinue to support these efforts, including the oper - ations of the Marketplace to help individuals en-roll in the best health insurance coverage option available for themselves and their families. The Affordable Care Act is also contributing significantly to putting the Nation back on a sus - tainable fiscal course, while laying the foundation for a higher-quality, more efficient health care system. The Congressional Budget Office has es - timated that the Affordable Care Act will reduce the deficit by about $100 billion over the first de - cade and by more than $1 trillion in the second decade. At the same time, the Affordable Care Act is already delivering better care at lower cost. To help ensure the prudent use of Federal funds, the Budget includes $25 million over two years to monitor and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in the Health Insurance Marketplace.Partnerships, and supporting Head Start grantees who are expanding program duration and investing in teacher quality; |Long-term public health improvements, including additional funding to increase biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health to improve the health of Americans and to promote economic growth through innovation, and accelerate the Department's advanced development of a universal flu vaccine; and |Construction of two new Indian Health Service healthcare facilities to improve the health of American Indians and Alaska natives. Reforms: Implements payment innovations and other reforms in Medicare and Medicaid and other Federal health programs that encourage high-quality and efficient delivery of health care, improve program integrity, and preserve the fundamental compact with seniors, individuals with disabilities, and low-income Americans. These improvements will save approximately $402 billion over the next decade.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 81 Trains New Health Care Providers and Improves Access to High-Quality Health Care Providers and Services. The Budget in- vests approximately $14.6 billion over 10 years to implement innovative policies to train new health care providers and ensure that the future health care workforce is prepared to deliver high- quality and efficient health care services. To en - courage and enhance training of primary care practitioners, and other physicians in high-need specialties, the Budget proposes $5.23 billion over 10 years to support 13,000 new residents through a new competitive graduate medical education program that incentivizes high-quality physician training. In 2015, this new program includes $100 million in mandatory funding to support pediatric training in children's hospitals. To continue encouraging provider participation in Medicaid, the Budget extends increased pay-ments for primary care services delivered by cer - tain physicians by one year, through 2015, with modifications to expand provider eligibility to ad-ditional primary care providers and better target primary care services. The Budget also invests more than $3.9 billion over the next six years in the National Health Services Corps to place 15,000 health care providers in the areas of the Nation that need them most. Across the United States, 1,200 health centers operate nearly 9,200 primary care sites that serve as high-quality, dependable sources of primary care services in communities. In addition to the investments in provider training, the Budget invests $4.6 bil-lion in the Health Centers program in 2015 and $8.1 billion in new resources over the following three years to support services for an estimated 31 million patients. Improves and Expands Access to Mental Health Services. The Budget includes $164 mil - lion to support the President's Now is the Time initiative, to expand mental health treatment and prevention services across the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Now is the Time initiative includes $55 million for Project AWARE (Advancing Wellness and Resilience in Education) to help States and communities implement plans to keep schools safe and refer students with behavioral health challenges to the services they need, as well as to provide Mental Health First Aid train - ing in schools and communities to equip adults who work with youth to detect signs of mental illness; $50 million to train 5,000 new mental health professionals to serve students and young adults; $20 million for Healthy Transitions to help support transitioning youth (ages 16-25) and their families in accessing and navigating behav - ioral health treatment systems; and $5 million to change the attitudes of Americans about behavioral health workforce needs. The Budget also makes targeted improve- ments to the Medicaid program to increase ac - cess to mental health services, particularly for youth. The Budget establishes a new Medicaid demonstration project in partnership with the Administration for Children and Families to en - courage States to provide evidence-based psy - chosocial interventions to children and youth in foster care. The goal is to reduce reliance on psy - chotropic medications, which are disproportion- ately prescribed to foster children, and improve outcomes for these young people. The Budget works to ensure Medicaid enrollees receive the most appropriate care, by improving access to mental health services in the community for youth in psychiatric residential treatment facili - ties and providing a pathway for certain individu - als in eligible mental health facilities to receive home and community-based care services. Improves Access to Health Care for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The Budget includes $4.6 billion for the Indian Health Service (IHS) to strengthen Federal, tribal, and urban programs that serve over two million AI/AN at over 650 facilities in 35 States. The Budget provides increased resources to purchase health care services outside of the Indian health system when services are not avail - able at IHS-funded facilities. To increase access to health care services and improve the Indian health system, the Budget also funds construc - tion of, and staffing at, new and replacement 82 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES health clinics. The Budget fully funds tribal con - tract support costs. In addition, the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes an ad - ditional $200 million for the construction of IHS healthcare facilities, which on average are 25 years older than other health care facilities. Supports Biomedical Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Biomedical research contributes to improving the health of the American people. The Budget in-cludes $30.2 billion for NIH to support research at institutions across the United States, continuing the Administration's commitment to investment in Alzheimer's research and NIH's contribution to the multiagency BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) ini-tiative. The Budget increases funding for inno - vative, high-risk high-reward research to help spur development of new therapeutics to treat diseases and disorders that affect millions of Americans, such as cancer and Alzheimer's dis - ease. The Budget includes funding for a new ad - vanced research program modeled after the cut - ting-edge Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program at the Department of Defense. NIH will also implement new policies to improve transparency and reduce administrative costs. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes an additional $970 million for NIH, which would support about 650 additional new grants and further increase funding for the BRAIN and DARPA-inspired initiatives, and invest in other critical priorities. Strengthens National Preparedness for All-Hazards, Including Naturally Occurring Threats and Intentional Attacks. The Budget includes $462 million to enhance the advanced development of next generation medical counter - measures against chemical, biological, radiologi - cal, and nuclear threats, including resources for the NIH Concept Acceleration Program, and the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) medical countermeasures regulatory science initiatives. The Budget also provides $415 million for the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund, continu- ing the Government's long-term commitment to the acquisition of new medical countermeasures against chemical, biological, nuclear and radio-logical threats. The Budget provides an addition - al $170 million to continue support for high-pri - ority pandemic influenza activities. In addition, the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative supports $50 million to enhance progress on pan - demic influenza preparedness, including sup - porting clinical trials for promising universal flu vaccine candidates. Expands Capacity to Detect, Prevent, and Respond to Infectious Diseases. The goal of the Global Health Security (GHS) Agenda is to reduce risks posed to the United States and global interests by emerging infectious diseases. The Budget increases CDC's GHS activities by $45 million to train epidemiologists and expand public health emergency management capacity and Global Disease Detection Centers in up to 10 countries. The Budget also invests $30 million for the Advanced Molecular Detection Initiative to identify the sources of emerging infectious dis - eases faster, determine whether microbes are re - sistant to antibiotics, and study how microbes are moving through a population. The Budget more than doubles CDC funding to combat antibiotic resistance. Expands Access to HIV/AIDS Treatment, Care, and Prevention. The Budget expands access to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment activities and supports the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and HIV Care Continuum Initiative to reduce HIV incidence, increase ac-cess to care and improve health outcomes for people living with HIV, and reduce HIV-related health disparities. The Budget invests $2.3 bil- lion for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and $1.1 billion for CDC HIV/AIDS, sexually trans-mitted diseases, tuberculosis, and hepatitis activ-ities. The Budget also focuses HIV resources on implementing effective, scalable, and sustainable prevention strategies for persons living with HIV and populations at highest risk for HIV. Strengthens the Safety of U.S. Food and Medicines. The Budget includes $2.6 billion in budget authority and $4.7 billion in total resourc - es for the FDA. Within this total, the Budget THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 83 invests $24 million in new resources to support food safety, and with new clarity provided by the Drug Quality and Security Act, $25 million to strengthen oversight of compounding pharma- cies. These resources will support inspectors and the food industry by enhancing FDA's capacity with regard to produce commodities and process - ing operations. In addition, FDA will conduct routine and follow-up inspections of high-risk compounding pharmacies. Improves Conditions for Vulnerable Populations Continues Strong Support for High- Quality Early Childhood Programs. The Budget supports initiatives that will help every child reach his or her potential and strengthen the Nation's competitiveness. This includes $650 million in the base Budget and $800 million in the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative for Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships to provide access to high-quality infant and tod- dler care for more than 100,000 children, and ad - ditional resources in the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative to support Head Start grantees who are expanding program duration and investing in teacher quality. Further, the Budget provides discretionary and mandatory re - sources for States to support higher-quality child care, and dedicates $200 million in discretionary funds to improve the quality of child care. In ad - dition, the Budget invests $15 billion in manda - tory funds over the next 10 years to extend and expand evidence-based, voluntary home visiting programs, which enable nurses, social workers, and other professionals to connect families to services and educational supports that improve a child's health, development, and ability to learn. Promotes Responsible Fatherhood and Prevents Teen Pregnancy. The Budget proposes to modernize the Child Support Enforcement Program, which touches the lives of one-quarter of the Nation's children and helps secure contributions toward their financial and emotional well-being from non-custodial parents. The Budget proposes to change current law to en - courage non-custodial parents to take greater re-sponsibility for their children while maintaining rigorous enforcement efforts. The Budget also continues funding for evidence-based models that prevent teenage pregnancy to build on the dra - matic progress that has been made in this area. Supports Victims of Domestic Violence and Human Trafficking. The Budget provides $140 million for shelters, supportive services, and a hotline for victims of domestic violence. The Budget also includes $10 million for an HHS ini - tiative to prevent and address domestic human trafficking in addition to anti-trafficking efforts by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. This initiative will provide direct ser - vices to domestic victims of trafficking, train service providers, and invest in data collection, research, and evaluation. Supports Work Opportunities for Low- Income Parents. The Budget proposes to redi- rect $602 million in annual Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funding to a Pathways to Jobs initiative, which will support State partnerships with employers to provide subsidized job opportu - nities for low-income individuals. This proved in recent years to be an effective strategy for getting disadvantaged adults back into the workforce, and the Budget proposes to build on that success. Provides Targeted Energy Assistance to Low-Income Families. The Budget provides $2.8 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families with resi - dential heating and cooling costs, including $200 million in contingency funds to address extreme weather conditions or short-term spikes in ener - gy prices and $50 million for competitive grants to reduce energy burdens. The requested funding level represents a difficult decision in a challeng - ing budget environment. The Administration will continue to invest in weatherization and energy efficiency to help cut costs for low-income households. 84 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Improves the Way Federal Dollars are Spent and Strengthens Long \u00adTerm Viability of Current Programs Improves Medicare's Sustainability by Encouraging High-Quality, Efficient Care. The Budget proposes a robust set of initiatives to strengthen Medicare by implementing pay - ment innovations that encourage high-quality and efficient care, with enhancements to propos - als addressing payments to skilled nursing facili-ties, Medicare Advantage plans, and program in - tegrity. Structural changes that will encourage Medicare beneficiaries to seek high-value health care services are also included from last year's Budget. The Budget also retains a modified ver - sion of last year's proposal for income-related pre - miums. The revised proposal simplifies the prior proposal, but still improves the fiscal stability of the program by reducing the Federal subsidy of Medicare costs for those who need that subsidy the least. The Budget also includes new propos - als that would build a stronger foundation for Medicare's future by expanding value-based pur - chasing, strengthening quality incentives and re - ducing the risk of prescription drug abuse in the Medicare Part D program. These Medicare pro-posals would extend the solvency of the Hospital Insurance trust fund by approximately five years. Supports Permanent, Fiscally Responsible Reform to Medicare's Payments to Phy - sicians. Medicare payments to physicians are determined under a formula, commonly referred to as the \"sustainable growth rate\" (SGR). This formula has called for reductions in physician payment rates since 2002, which the Congress has consistently overridden for over 10 years. Under the SGR, physician payment rates would be reduced by about 24 percent in April 2014. The Administration applauds the bipartisan re- form efforts in the Congress and is committed to working with the Congress to continue progress toward reforming Medicare physician payments to provide predictable payments that incentiv - ize quality and efficiency in a fiscally responsible way. As part of these ongoing reform efforts, the Administration supports a period of payment stability lasting several years to allow time for the continued development of scalable alterna - tive payment models. After such a period of pay - ment stability, the Administration supports in-centives for providers to join such models, with a streamlined value-based purchasing program for providers who do not join. Such models should encourage integrated care where networks of providers work together to coordinate care and are rewarded for providing high-quality, efficient care. Successful care delivery models should en-gage seniors and individuals with disabilities in achieving this goal. Input from physicians and other professionals is important in design - ing these models as well. To complement these changes, the Administration also supports re - forms to improve the accuracy of Medicare's cur - rent physician payment system. Provides Tools to States to Improve Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Medicaid is critically important to providing health care coverage to the neediest Americans, and the Administration strongly supports State efforts to expand Medicaid with the increased Federal funding provided in the Affordable Care Act. The Budget strengthens Medicaid and CHIP by pro-viding tools to States, territories, and the Federal Government to fight fraud, waste, and abuse, and make it easier for eligible children to get and maintain coverage. The Budget also includes other program improvements aimed at improv-ing efficiency and effectiveness as States expand Medicaid. The Administration remains commit - ted to providing affordable, comprehensive cover - age for children covered by CHIP, and the Budget proposes to extend the CHIP performance bonus fund in anticipation of work with the Congress to ensure their coverage. Cuts and Reforms the Community Ser - vices Block Grant (CSBG). CSBG provides funding for the important work of community action agencies, but the program's current struc - ture does little to hold these agencies accountable for outcomes. The Budget provides $350 million for CSBG and proposes to competitively award funds to high-performing agencies that are most successful at meeting community needs. THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 85 Eliminates Duplicative Programs. The Budget makes room for new investments through a series of eliminations and reductions among programs, such as the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant (PHHSBG). The PHHSBG is duplicative with existing activities that could be more effectively implemented through targeted programs within CDC. In addi - tion, the Budget proposes small, targeted reduc-tions in select HHS direct health care programs (e.g., immunizations and cancer screenings) because these services are now financed and provided through expanded insurance coverage for those gaining new coverage. 87Funding Highlights: Provides $38.2 billion in non-disaster, net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security to protect the Nation from terrorist attacks, address critical capital needs, and carry out core homeland security functions such as transportation security, cybersecurity, disaster preparedness, and border security. This includes: |Funding for major asset acquisitions, such as completing construction of the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility, and resources to procure the Coast Guard's eighth National Security Cutter; |Supporting the EINSTEIN intrusion detection and prevention system and continuous diagnostics and mitigation, key Administration cybersecurity initiatives to address threats and vulnerabilities against Federal computer systems and networks; |Funding for programs that lead to job growth and expansion of the U.S. economy, including a historic 25,775 Customs and Border Protection officers resulting in faster processing and inspecting of passengers and cargo at U.S. ports of entry, as well as more seizures of illegal items, such as drugs, guns, and counterfeit goods; |Focusing resources for immigration detention of mandatory and priority individuals, such as violent criminals and those who pose a threat to national security, while expanding less costly alternatives to detention programs; and |Providing $6.8 billion for disaster relief, of which $6.4 billion is requested as a discretionary cap adjustment pursuant to the Budget Control Act. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |State and local investments in homeland security and emergency preparedness through a reformed National Preparedness Grant Program; and |Efforts to strengthen national resilience to the effects of climate change, including investments specifically for identifying and analyzing critical infrastructure vulnerabilities as well as funds for grants to support State and local level resilience planning and climate adaptation projects. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY88 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) mission is to ensure that America is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards. DHS has responsibility for leading all levels of government and working with the pri - vate sector to prepare for and respond to natural disasters and other threats, and for facilitating information sharing and collaborative planning between Federal, State, local, and tribal partners. DHS interacts with millions of people each day, from processing one million international arriv - als at U.S. ports of entry, to screening approxi - mately 1.8 million air passengers and their lug - gage, patrolling 3.4 million square miles of U.S. waterways, and naturalizing almost 3,100 new citizens. The Budget supports these priorities by including $38.2 billion for the Department and $6.8 billion for disaster relief. Protects the Homeland Continues Strong Support for Cyber - security Initiatives. The Budget includes $549 million to support the EINSTEIN intrusion detection and prevention system and continuous diagnostics and mitigation, key Administration cybersecurity initiatives that work to identify and address threats and vulnerabilities against Federal computer systems and networks. These initiatives are conducted through the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), which protects Federal computer systems and networks from cyber attack, disruptions, and exploitations, strengthens State and local gov-ernments' cybersecurity capacity, and supports private sector efforts to protect critical infra - structures. The Budget also supports the design of a Federal Cyber Campus to co-locate key civil - ian cybersecurity agencies to promote a whole of government approach to cybersecurity incident response. Sustains Essential Fire and Emergency Response Coverage. The Budget provides $1 billion in assistance to States and local governments for the retention, rehiring, and hiring of firefighters and emergency management personnel in 2015. Sustains and Expands CBP Staffing Levels. The Budget proposes an historic level of 25,775 Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, including the 2,000 new CBP officers fund - ed through 2014 appropriations as well as 2,000 additional officers through proposed increases to user fees. These officers will help CBP process increased travel and trade that flows through our air, land, and sea ports of entry. This investment is projected to add nearly 66,000 new jobs and $4 billion to the Gross Domestic Product, while help - ing to reduce wait times, and expediting the flow of trade and tourism. In addition, these officers will conduct 46,000 more seizures of illegal items, including potentially over $5.5 million in counter - feit and fraudulent goods, further protecting U.S. businesses. Supports \"Now Is the Time\" by Strength - ening Training and Public Awareness to Enforce Gun Safety Measures. To better protect American communities from gun related violence, the Budget includes $10 million in tar - geted investments at DHS. These funds will be used to train local law enforcement to respond to Reforms: Supports risk-based security initiatives at the Transportation Security Administration that enhance the efficiency of passenger screening operations, while improving the customer experience for the traveling public. Eliminates duplicative, stand-alone Federal Emergency Management Agency grant programs, consolidating them into a new homeland security grant program to better develop, sustain, and leverage core capabilities across the United States to support national preparedness.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 89 mass shooting events and for the DHS \"If You See Something, Say Something\" public awareness program, which helps individuals understand the need for community involvement in efforts to pre - vent gun violence. Promotes Secure Long \u00adTerm Growth Supports Individuals on the Path to Citizenship. The Budget includes $10 million to assist individuals on the pathway to natural - ization and increases support for local programs that develop innovative techniques to improve citizenship education and naturalization prepa-ration. Also, the Budget proposes directing $3 million in application fees toward establishing the United States Citizenship Foundation, a new public-private partnership to support citizenship and the integration into American communities. Invests in Research and Development in Homeland Security. To continue progress in enhancing homeland security technology and developing state-of-the-art solutions for first re - sponders, the Budget proposes $514 million for re - search and development activities. This funding will target opportunities in cybersecurity, explo - sives detection, nuclear detection, and chemical and biological detection. In addition, the Budget includes $300 million\u2014the amount needed to le - verage existing resources to initiate construction in 2015 of the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility\u2014to study large animal zoonotic diseas - es and develop countermeasures to protect our citizens and agricultural economy from future threats. Makes Smart Choices to Balance Priorities Reinvests Savings from TSA Risk- Based Security. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Risk-Based Security ini - tiatives, such as TSA Pre-Check, use informa - tion, intelligence, and technology to focus agency resources on high-risk passengers while stream - lining security procedures for low-risk passen - gers. Currently over 35 percent of the traveling public enjoy expedited screening through TSA Pre-Check lanes or other Risk-Based Security programs. By moving away from a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to passenger screening, TSA will improve the customer experience while enhanc - ing the efficiency and effectiveness of its screen- ing operations. In 2015, Risk-Based Security will yield over $100 million in staffing efficiencies for TSA. The Budget reinvests a portion of this savings to fund the tools and technology needed to support and expand these programs. Streamlines and Restructures FEMA Grant Programs. First responders are at the forefront of addressing natural disasters and other threats. The Budget provides $2.2 billion for State, local, and tribal governments to hire, equip, and train first responders and build pre - paredness capabilities. To better target these funds, the Budget proposes eliminating duplica - tive, stand-alone grant programs, and consolidat - ing them into the National Preparedness Grant Program. This initiative is designed to build, sus - tain, and leverage core capabilities as established in the National Preparedness Goal. The National Preparedness Grant Program will apply a com - prehensive process that identifies and prioritiz - es deployable capabilities, ensures grantees put funding to work more quickly, and requires grant - ees to regularly report progress in the acquisition and development of these capabilities. Aligns Immigration Detention and Alternatives to Detention Capabilities with Risk. To ensure the most cost effective use of Federal dollars, the Budget aligns Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) capabilities with immigration enforcement priorities and pol - icies so that mandatory and priority individuals, including violent criminals and those who pose a threat to national security, are kept in deten - tion, while low-risk non-mandatory detainees are allowed to enroll in alternatives to deten - tion programs, including electronic monitoring and supervision. As ICE continues to focus on mandatory and priority cases, it will work to reduce the time that removable aliens spend in detention custody. To achieve this goal, ICE will continue to work with the Department of Justice to expedite removal of convicted criminal aliens, 90 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY reducing costly stays in immigration detention prior to deportation. Keeps Capital Investment on Track. The Budget provides approximately $3 billion for major asset acquisitions planned in 2015. In ad - dition to funding Coast Guard recapitalization priorities, including the eighth National Security Cutter, the Budget continues to procure new bor - der surveillance technology and aircraft for CBP to improve the security of U. S. borders. Enhances the Administration's Employ - ment Eligibility Verification System, E-Verify. While repairing the Nation's broken immigration system will require congressio - nal action, the Budget continues investments to streamline the current system while looking forward to comprehensive reform. To assist U.S. employers with maintaining a legal workforce, the Budget provides $124 million to support, ex - pand, and enhance E-Verify. The Budget also funds an expanded administrative review process in E-Verify that will further empower employ - ment-authorized individuals to ensure their gov-ernment records are correct. Proposed funding bolsters the system's fraud prevention and detec - tion capabilities, provides for additional customer service enhancements, and supports E-Verify's continued expansion. Over half a million em - ployers are currently enrolled in E-Verify and the program continues to grow by approximately 1,500 new employers each week. 91Funding Highlights: Provides $46.7 billion for Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs, including funding to expand the number of rental assistance vouchers and increase homeless assistance for vulnerable families, as well as for targeted neighborhood investments to help revitalize high-poverty neighborhoods. This includes: |Funding rental housing assistance to support 4.5 million low-income families, including Housing Choice Vouchers for 2.2 million very low-income families; |Investing $2.4 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants to continue progress toward the Administration's goals of ending chronic homelessness and homelessness among veterans and families; |Expanding affordable housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities by providing $45 million to assist over 5,000 new households; |Investing $120 million to transform neighborhoods with distressed HUD-assisted housing and concentrated poverty into opportunity-rich, mixed-income neighborhoods through the Choice Neighborhoods program; |Investing $15 billion in the Project Rebuild program to help hardest hit communities reduce blight from foreclosed and abandoned homes and turn the corner to recovery; |Providing $1 billion to capitalize the Housing Trust Fund to expand the supply of housing targeted to extremely low-income families; and |Providing $650 million to address the housing needs of Native American Tribes and $332 million for the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |An additional 7 to 10 Choice Neighborhood grants to revitalize distressed areas; and |Increased job training and financial incentives for a total of 50,000 households in public housing through Jobs-Plus, an evidence-based program that has been shown to boost annual incomes by $1,300 on average. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT92 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and help all Americans who need quality, affordable hous - ing. To achieve this mission, HUD supports home ownership, access to affordable housing free from discrimination, and community development. HUD's work is critical to the Administration's efforts to strengthen communities, bolster the economy, and improve the quality of life for the American people. The Budget provides $46.7 bil-lion for HUD programs to support these efforts, $1.2 billion above the 2014 enacted level. Funding is prioritized to protect vulnerable families and to revitalize neighborhoods with distressed HUD- assisted housing and concentrated poverty. At the same time, the Budget includes tough choices required by the constrained fiscal environment, including funding reductions to project-based rental assistance and community development, and some curtailment of the expansion of new construction of affordable housing. Provides Housing Assistance to Vulnerable Families Supports Affordable Rental Housing for 4.5 million Families. The Budget includes $20 billion for the Housing Choice Voucher program, $0.9 billion more than the 2014 enacted level, to help more than 2.2 million very low-income families afford decent housing in neighborhoods of their choice. This funding level not only sup - ports all existing vouchers, but restores reduc-tions in assisted housing units that resulted from the 2013 sequestration funding cut and provides an additional 40,000 new vouchers, including 10,000 for homeless veterans as discussed be-low. The Budget also includes $9.7 billion for the Project-Based Rental Assistance program to maintain affordable rental housing for 1.2 mil - lion families. This amount is $0.2 billion below the 2014 enacted level, but sufficient to contin - ue assistance to the same number of units cur - rently subsidized. Further, the Budget provides $6.5 billion in operating and capital subsidies to preserve affordable public housing for 1.1 mil- lion families, an increase of $0.3 billion over the 2014 enacted level. An additional $10 million for the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) will be targeted to public housing properties in high-poverty neighborhoods, including designated Promise Zones, where the Administration is also supporting comprehensive revitalization efforts. RAD leverages private financing to reduce back - logs of capital repairs and the Budget proposes to eliminate the cap on the number of units eligible for this demonstration. Makes Progress on the Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness. The Budget provides $2.4 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants, $0.3 billion above the 2014 enacted level. This funding supports new per - manent supportive housing units and maintains over 330,000 HUD-funded beds that assist the homeless nationwide. In addition, under the Housing Choice Voucher program, the Budget proposes $75 million to expand assistance under the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program to 10,000 homeless veter - ans. Supported by the collection of robust data and using best practices from across the Nation, this evidence-based investment will continue to make progress toward the President's homeless- ness goals, including providing the resources needed to end veterans homelessness by 2015 and to end chronic homelessness by 2016. Between 2010 and 2013, homelessness among veterans declined by 24 percent, and the total number of Reforms: Proposes a series of reforms to the Community Development Block Grant and HOME Investment Partnerships programs to improve administrative efficiency, drive regional coordination, and ultimately strengthen the long-term viability of the programs.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 93 individuals experiencing chronic homelessness on a single night declined by 15.7 percent. Invests in High \u00adPoverty Communities Transforms Distressed HUD-Assisted Housing and High-Poverty Neighborhoods. The Budget provides $120 million for Choice Neighborhoods to change neighborhoods of con- centrated poverty into opportunity-rich, mixed-income neighborhoods. This funding level, $30 million above the 2014 enacted level, will be used to revitalize HUD-assisted housing and sur - rounding neighborhoods through partnerships between local governments, housing authorities, nonprofits, and for-profit developers. Preference for these funds will go to designated Promise Zones\u2014high-poverty communities where the Federal Government is working with local lead - ership to invest and engage more intensely to create jobs, leverage private investment, increase economic activity, reduce violence, and expand educational opportunities. To further support Promise Zones, the Budget includes companion investments of $100 million in the Department of Education's Promise Neighborhoods program and $29.5 million in the Department of Justice's Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Grants pro-gram, as well as tax incentives to promote invest - ment, jobs, and economic growth. To help public housing residents increase their employment and earnings, the Budget also provides $25 million for the evidence-based Jobs-Plus program, a $10 mil - lion increase over the 2014 enacted level. Through Jobs-Plus, public housing residents receive on-site employment and training services, financial incentives that encourage work and \"neighbor- to-neighbor\" information-sharing about job open - ings, training, and other employment-related op-portunities. Rigorous evaluations have found that this program improves employment outcomes for public housing residents who participate. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes $125 million more for Jobs- Plus to increase employment opportunities for a total of 50,000 public housing residents. It also includes an additional $280 million for Choice Neighborhoods and $75 million for Integrated Planning and Investment Grants. These invest - ments will help fully realize the President's vi-sion for Promise Zones, and assist communi- ties in developing comprehensive housing and transportation plans that help expand economic opportunity. Helps Hardest Hit Communities Turn the Corner to Recovery The Budget provides $15 billion for the Project Rebuild program. This funding builds on the proven success of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program by helping hardest hit communities address blight and rehabilitate homes in strug - gling neighborhoods. In addition to partnering with local governments, Project Rebuild fund-ing will support new and existing community land banks, incentivize private investments in hardest hit communities, and fund job training programs to strengthen local workforce capacity. Collectively, these programs will stabilize neigh - borhoods and help the worst-affected communities turn the corner to recovery. Supports the Housing Sector with Household Counseling The Budget provides $60 million for the HUD Housing Counseling program, a $15 million in- crease over the 2014 enacted level. This funding increase recognizes the program's improved per - formance, including grant administration that is timelier and less burdensome on applicants. The Budget also includes $50 million for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling program, which is administered by the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a federally-chartered non-profit organization. The Budget includes a demonstration project for the Homeowners Armed With Knowledge project (HAWK) program. This program will test designs and incentives for combining Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgages with housing counseling to improve the availability and sustainability of homeownership for first-time homebuyers.94 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Makes Tough Choices, but Strengthens the Long \u00adTerm Viability of Block Grant Programs The Budget provides $2.8 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program and $950 million for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. These funding levels represent a total decrease of $280 million below the 2014 enacted level for these two programs. However, the Budget also proposes a series of reforms to improve the programs' performance by eliminating small grantees, thereby improving efficiency, driving regional coordination, and sup - porting grantees in making strategic, high-im- pact investments that address local community goals. To support affordable housing priorities, the Budget also proposes an investment of $1 billion in mandatory funding for the Housing Trust Fund to create approximately 16,000 affordable units for extremely low- and very low-income households.95Funding Highlights: Provides $12 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of the Interior, reflecting ongoing commitments to protect critical national landscapes, responsibly manage energy development on Federal lands and waters, and support Federal trust responsibilities to Native American Tribes and communities. This includes: |Launching an historic effort to revitalize the Nation's parks for the next century in commemoration of the National Park Service Centennial; |Proposing a dedicated source of long-term funding\u2014reaching $900 million in 2015\u2014for Land and Water Conservation Fund programs to support land conservation and resource protection, in collaboration with Federal, State, and local partners; |Investing in the safety, reliability, and efficiency of America's water infrastructure and in conservation, reuse, and applied science to address the Nation's water supply challenges; |Supporting tribal priorities in Indian Country, including full funding for contract support costs and a new initiative to address high rates of poverty, substance abuse, and homelessness; and |Investing in science to support decision-making in managing natural resources and carrying out tribal trust responsibilities, including $889 million for research and development. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |Full support for the National Parks Centennial Initiative, which will create thousands of jobs over three years and make America an even more attractive destination for travel and tourism; |Additional resources for the Department, especially the U.S. Geological Survey, to conduct scientific monitoring, research, and analysis that advances priorities such as energy development, ecological restoration, and climate resilience; |Enhancements in the climate resilience of landscapes, water resources, and other infrastructure; and DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR 96 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR The Department of the Interior's (DOI's) mis- sion is to protect America's natural resources and cultural heritage, manage development of energy and mineral resources on Federal lands and waters, provide scientific and other informa-tion about the Nation's natural resources, man - age and develop water infrastructure, and honor trust responsibilities to American Indians and Alaska Natives and commitments to Insular ar - eas. In support of this mission, the Budget pro - vides $12 billion for DOI, a three percent increase over the 2014 enacted level. The Budget contin - ues the Administration's historic commitment to America's natural heritage by proposing manda - tory funds for Land and Water Conservation Fund programs. This funding will provide the stability needed for agencies and States to make strategic, long-term investments in the Nation's natural infrastructure and outdoor economy to support jobs, preserve natural and cultural resources, bol - ster outdoor recreation opportunities, and protect wildlife. The Budget also includes legislative pro - posals that will save taxpayers more than $2.7 billion over the next 10 years, including reforms to fees, royalties, and other payments related to oil, gas, coal, and other mineral development on Federal lands and waters.Promotes Economic Growth by Investing in Natural, Cultural, and Energy Resources Creates Jobs Through Conservation and Recreation. The America's Great Outdoors (AGO) initiative supports Federal, State, local, and tribal conservation efforts, while reconnect - ing Americans, particularly young people, to the outdoors. Investments for AGO programs sup - port conservation and outdoor recreation activi-ties nationwide that create and maintain millions of jobs, generate hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue, and spur billions in total national economic activity. 2015 marks the 50 th anniversa- ry of the landmark Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act, which authorizes the use of receipts from oil, gas, and other non-renewable resources to reinvest in conserving public lands. The Budget proposes full funding for LWCF pro - grams in DOI and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Starting in 2015, the Budget proposes to invest $900 million annually, equal to the amount of receipts deposited in the LWCF each year. In 2015, $575 million is proposed to conserve lands in or near national parks, refuges, forests, and other public lands, including collaborative LWCF |Economic development and educational investments in Indian Country to support tribal self-determination and nation-building. Reforms: Supports a fundamental shift in wildfire funding to safeguard communities and ecosystems, improve the resilience of our Nation's forests and rangelands, and provide stable funding for wildfire suppression. Continues efforts to manage and promote the ecological sustainability and resilience of ecosystems on a landscape and watershed scale, such as the California Bay-Delta, the Everglades, the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, and the Gulf Coast. Proposes oil and gas management reforms to generate $2.5 billion in savings over 10 years, building on the Administration's efforts to encourage diligent development of Federal energy resources while improving the return to taxpayers from royalty reforms. Reforms oversight of mining on Federal lands and reduces the environmental impacts of coal and hardrock mining by dedicating and prioritizing funds to reclaim abandoned mines.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 97 funds for DOI and the USDA's Forest Service to jointly and strategically conserve the most criti - cal landscapes. Other AGO programs include $325 million in grant programs that assist States, Tribes, local governments, landowners, private groups, and sportsmen in preserving wildlife habitat, wetlands, historic battlefields, regional parks, and the countless other sites that form the mosaic of the Nation's cultural and natural legacy. Launches Historic Effort to Revitalize National Parks for the Next Century. For nearly 100 years, National Park Service (NPS) parks and historic sites have preserved and shared America's cultural and historical iden - tity. These places represent America's unique history and draw tourists from across the United States and around the world. To help achieve the President's America's Great Outdoors goals, the Budget proposes to invest in an historic effort to upgrade and restore national parks, while engag - ing thousands of youth, veterans, and others and leveraging private donations to build a legacy for the second century of NPS. In particular, the Budget\u2014including mandatory, discretionary, and Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative re-sources\u2014will allow NPS to ensure that 1,700 (or 20 percent) of the highest priority park assets are restored to good condition. The effort cre - ates thousands of jobs over three years, provides over 10,000 work and training opportunities to young people, and engages more than 265,000 volunteers in support of public lands. Safeguards Communities and Ecosystems from Wildfire Damage. Fire is a natural occur - rence that can be highly beneficial to landscapes when managed properly; however, population growth near forests and rangelands, past man - agement practices, and a changing climate have increased wildfire risk and resulting costs. The Budget calls for a fundamental change in how wildfire suppression is funded to help reduce fire risk, manage landscapes more comprehensively and increase the resilience of the Nation's for - ests and rangelands and the communities that border them. The Budget supports congressional proposals to fund suppression of the most severe fire activity\u2014including large fires that require emergency response, are near urban areas, or for abnormally active fire seasons\u2014as extraordinary costs that are outside the discretionary spending caps. Importantly, because this funding would not allow the total amounts available under ex - isting cap adjustments to grow, it would not in - crease overall discretionary spending. This new approach for funding suppression of catastrophic fires better safeguards non-sup - pression programs from transfers that have di-minished their effectiveness in proactively ad-dressing threats to communities and landscapes. This proposal allows for enhanced capabilities in programs such as the Forest Service's Integrated Resource Restoration Program, the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, and the Hazardous Fuels Program, as well as the Fuels Management and Resilient Landscapes pro - grams in DOI. Since responsibility for improv- ing community resilience to wildland rests with Federal, State, local, and tribal governments and homeowners, the Budget also targets funding for fuels management and certain State programs to communities that implement programs to re- duce fire risk on non-Federal lands, including im - proved building standards for fire resiliency and defensible spaces. Protects and Restores Water Resources and Infrastructure. The Budget invests in the safety, reliability, efficiency, and ecological sus - tainability of our water infrastructure, to ensure the continued delivery to millions of customers of water and power, which serves as a foundation for a healthy economy, especially in the arid Western United States. The Budget invests in implemen - tation of Indian water rights settlements in sup - port of Federal trust responsibilities to Tribes and in the protection and restoration of fragile aquatic ecosystems, such as California's Bay-Delta and the San Joaquin River, to ensure that such environmental treasures are available for future generations. These investments are made possible by limiting the study of new projects and construction of ongoing projects and emphasiz-ing water reuse, recycling, and conservation pro - grams, in partnership with States and others, over new construction. 98 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Makes Public Lands Available for Clean Energy Infrastructure Projects. To enhance energy security and create green jobs in new in - dustries, the Budget invests in core DOI renew - able energy development programs, providing roughly $95 million to review and permit new renewable energy projects on Federal lands and waters. These funds will allow DOI to continue progress toward its goal of permitting 20 giga- watts of renewable energy capacity and related transmission infrastructure by 2020 as part of the President's Climate Action Plan. Continues Support for Responsible Development of the Nation's Oil and Gas Resources. The Budget proposes $170 million and $205 million, respectively, to fund the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which share responsibility for overseeing development of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The current OCS five-year leasing program will make more than 75 percent of es - timated undiscovered technically recoverable oil and gas resources on the OCS available for devel - opment. Funding supports continued reforms to strengthen oversight of industry operations fol - lowing the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with an additional emphasis on ensuring the safe and responsible development of Arctic OCS resources. The Budget also provides support for onshore energy permitting and oversight on Federal lands, with an 18 percent increase in discretionary and fee-based funding for the oil and gas program of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), relative to the 2014 enacted level. Combined with an ex - tended and reformed permitting pilot office au - thority and ongoing administrative efforts, these resources will facilitate improved responsiveness to permit requests while strengthening oversight and enforcement of industry operations. BLM's costs would be partially offset through new in - spection fees totaling $48 million in 2015, requir - ing the onshore industry to bear a greater share of the cost of managing the program from which it benefits, just as the offshore industry currently does.Strengthens Tribal Nations. The Admini - stration strongly supports the principle of tribal self-determination and improved outcomes across Indian Country with a $34 million increase over the 2014 enacted level for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and through implementation of the Executive Order establishing the White House Council on Native American Affairs. BIA fully funds contract support costs that Tribes incur from managing Federal programs. Recognizing the need to address high rates of poverty, sub - stance abuse, and homelessness in Indian Country, the Administration proposes to imple - ment a new initiative called the \"Tiwahe\" or Family Initiative. The Tiwahe Initiative would support an integrated approach to providing culturally-appropriate human services, with the goal of empowering Native American families through social programs, family stability, and strong tribal communities. Fulfills Commitments to Insular Communities. The Administration supports fulfillment of the commitments made through the Compact of Free Association with the Government of the Republic of Palau, as agreed to in September 2010. The Budget proposes man - datory funding, as negotiated in the Compact of Free Association, to fund U.S. financial commit - ments, promote economic development and stabil - ity for Palau, ensure U.S. strategic security in the Pacific, and demonstrate U.S. resolve in honoring U.S. agreements to Insular communities. Improves Oversight and Use of Federal Dollars Reforms Federal Oil and Gas Management. The United States Treasury received over $13 billion in 2013 from fees, royalties, and other payments related to oil and gas development on Federal lands and waters. A number of recent studies by the Government Accountability Office and DOI's Inspector General have found that taxpayers could earn a better return through policy changes and more rigorous oversight. The Budget proposes a package of legislative reforms to bolster administrative actions to reform the management of DOI's onshore and offshore oil THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 99 and gas programs, with a key focus on improv - ing the return to taxpayers from the sale of these Federal resources and on improving transpar - ency and oversight. Proposed statutory and ad-ministrative changes focus on advancing royalty reforms, encouraging diligent development of oil and gas leases, and improving revenue collection processes. Collectively, these reforms will gen-erate roughly $2.5 billion in net revenue to the Treasury over 10 years. Many States will also benefit from higher Federal revenue sharing payments as a result of these reforms. Reforms Mining Operations and Reduces the Environmental Impacts of Mining. In order to increase safety and minimize environ-mental impacts, the Budget proposes an aban - doned mine lands (AML) fee on hardrock mining, with receipts used by States, Tribes, and Federal agencies to restore the most hazardous hardrock AML sites on both public and private lands. For non-Federal lands, each State and Tribe would select its own priority projects according to na - tional criteria, similar to how coal AML funds are allocated. Eliminates Wasteful Spending and Provides a Fair Return to Taxpayers from Mineral Development. The Budget proposes a number of other actions that eliminate wasteful spending and ensure taxpayers receive a fair re-turn from mining on Federal lands. This includes charging a royalty on select hardrock minerals\u2014such as silver, gold, and copper\u2014and terminating unwarranted payments to coal producing States and Tribes that no longer need funds to clean up abandoned coal mines. Increases Investments in Science to Support Decision-Making. The Budget pro - vides strong support for basic and applied sci - ence, including $889 million for research and development, which is a seven percent increase over the 2014 enacted level. This funding sup - ports scientific monitoring, research, and analy - sis to assist decision-making in natural resource and land management and in fulfilling the spe - cial trust responsibilities of DOI and other fed- erally mandated programs. Specific activities include science needed to conduct energy per - mitting, ecosystem restoration and manage - ment, Earth observations\u2014such as water and wildlife monitoring\u2014and tribal natural resource management.101Funding Highlights: Provides $27.4 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Justice to fund core law enforcement needs, safe and secure prisons, and other Federal, State, and local programs. This includes: |Providing new resources in support of the Now is the Time initiative to ensure that those who are not eligible to purchase or possess guns are prevented from doing so; |Funding to enhance criminal history records information, improve required inspections of licensed firearms dealers, and continue the Comprehensive School Safety Program; |Continuing strong support for law enforcement components focused on national security, cyber security, and counter terrorism efforts and reducing illegal trafficking and violent and financial crimes; |Reducing the time it takes for the Department to respond to legal assistance requests from foreign partners and to help develop legally sufficient requests, thereby improving the Department's ability to support foreign partners in investigating and prosecuting criminals; |Investing in efforts to combat and respond to violent crimes against women; and |Improving reentry initiatives by expanding Second Chance Act programs and working to reduce recidivism rates by providing drug treatment, increasing alternatives to incarceration, and strengthening family and parental ties.

The Budget supports these commitments and continues the progress that has been made in key areas. The Budget provides $27.4 billion for DOJ in 2015, $122 million above the 2014 enacted lev - el. In addition, the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes funding for targeted investments for State and local justice assis - tance grants, including the Comprehensive School Safety Program, the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Hiring Program, and a new youth investment initiative that will encourage State ef - forts to increase the availability of alternatives to incarceration, re-enroll youth into school after con - finement, and reduce ethnic and racial disparities in the juvenile justice system. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative also provides addi - tional resources for the Bureau of Prisons for infra-structure and personnel to continue the process of bringing on-line newly completed or acquired pris - ons, thereby reducing prison overcrowding, and for improved capacity for financial fraud enforcement at the Department, including hiring additional criminal prosecutors, civil litigators, investigators, and forensic accountants.Enforces Laws and Protects U.S. Interests Supports Now is the Time by Improving Law Enforcement's Ability to Implement and Enforce Gun Safety Measures. To protect American communities from gun-related violence and mass shootings, $182 million is provided to DOJ to help Federal, State, and local law enforce - ment continue to combat gun violence. These funds will support additional background checks, allow for continued focus on inspections of fed - erally-licensed firearms dealers, improve tracing and ballistics analysis, and keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals and other prohib - ited persons. Of this amount, $13 million is pro - vided to the FBI for investment in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Promotes Cybersecurity Initiatives. Cyber threats are constantly evolving and require a coordinated and comprehensive plan for protec-tion and response. The Budget identifies and promotes cross-agency cybersecurity initiatives and priorities, including improving cybersecurity information sharing while protecting individual privacy and civil liberties and enhancing State and local capacity to respond to cyber incidents. The Budget also supports the design of a Federal Cyber Campus to co-locate key civilian cybersecu - rity agencies to promote a whole-of-Government approach to cybersecurity incident response. |Additional funding for investigating and prosecuting the full spectrum of financial fraud, helping to protect investors, consumers, and taxpayers. Reforms: Supports the Administration's Smart on Crime initiative by providing dedicated funding to the United States Attorneys for Prevention and Reentry Coordinators, while improving reentry initiatives by expanding Second Chance Act programs and reducing recidivism rates by expanding drug treatment. Ensures that Federal funds flow to evidence-based activities by making additional resources available for alternatives to incarceration, gun safety initiatives, police hiring, and other initiatives to improve the targeting and effectiveness of grant assistance.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 103 Preserves the Integrity of Digital Communications and Accelerates Legal Assistance. In order to better assist foreign government partners with investigating and prosecuting criminals, the Budget provides an additional $24 million to implement a strategy to reduce the current backlog of Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty requests, cut overall response times in half by the end of 2015, and process requests in a matter of weeks. Maintains Safe and Secure Prison Capacity. The Budget proposes $8.4 billion for Federal prisons and detention facilities. These funds are provided to maintain secure, controlled detention and prison facilities and to continue bringing newly completed, or acquired, prisons on-line to protect public safety by alleviating prison overcrowding. Further, the Budget includes re - sources to support implementation of the Prison Rape Elimination Act in Federal, State, and local prisons and jails and to help inmates successfully transition back into the community. Combats Financial Fraud, Promotes Innovation, and Protects Civil Rights. Ensuring honest and fair competition and pro - tecting the rights and property of citizens are paramount to the economy and American com-petitiveness. The Budget maintains support to investigate and prosecute financial and mortgage fraud, and counter intellectual property crimes. In addition, the Budget proposes enhancements to ensure the protection of civil rights, including enforcing Federal prohibitions against racial and ethnic discrimination. Improves the Way Federal Dollars are Spent Supports the Smart on Crime Initiative and Enhances Reentry and Recidivism Initiatives. In August of last year, the Attorney General introduced the Smart on Crime initia- tive, which is designed to promote fundamen-tal reforms to the criminal justice system that will improve public safety, save money, and en - sure the fair enforcement of Federal laws. The Budget strongly supports the Smart on Crime initiative, including $15 million for prisoner re - entry programs and for Prevention and Reentry Coordinators in United States Attorneys' offices. The Budget also supports assisting inmates with reentering society and reducing the population of individuals who return to prison after being released, including $15 million for the Bureau of Prisons to expand the Residential Drug Abuse Program at the Federal level and $14 million in the Office of Justice Programs to expand the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment program at the State and local level. In addition, through State and local assistance programs, the Budget provides $115 million for the Second Chance Act Grant program to reduce recidivism and help ex-offenders return to productive lives. Addresses the Immigration Case Backlog. To help increase efficiency in the immigration courts, the Budget provides enhancements to the Executive Office for Immigration Review to add 35 new immigration judge teams, expand the successful Legal Orientation Program, and es - tablish a pilot program to implement additional efficiencies in the immigration court system. Supports Program Evaluation and Policy Analysis. Evidence and rigorous evaluation of budget, management, and policy decisions are es - sential to ensuring that Americans are receiving the maximum value for each Federal dollar spent. The Budget invests $1.7 million to develop new multidisciplinary program evaluation and policy analysis capability within the Department. The objective is to strengthen analysis of the poten-tial impact of policy options and then track and monitor implementation of policy decisions. Invests in State and Local Public Safety Initiatives that Work Expands Gun Safety Initiatives and Works to Prevent Mass Casualty Violence. The Budget includes $147 million to help State and local governments continue implement - ing the Administration's proposals for increas - ing firearms safety and supporting programs that help keep communities safe from mass casualty violence. Included in these initiatives 104 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE are $75 million for the Comprehensive School Safety Program, $55 million in grants to improve the submission of State criminal and mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, $15 million to im-prove police officer safety, and $2 million to devel - op better gun safety mechanisms to prevent the use of firearms by unauthorized users. Renews Efforts to Promote Juvenile Justice and Fight Youth Violence. The Budget proposes $299 million for the Department's Juvenile Justice Programs and includes evi-dence-based investments to prevent youth vio- lence. This includes $18 million to fund the Community-Based Violence Prevention Initiative and $4 million for the National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention. Further, the Budget makes available $23 million for research and pilot proj - ects focused on developing appropriate responses for youth exposed to violence. Continues Efforts to Combat Violence Against Women. The Budget provides $423 million to reinforce efforts to combat and respond to violent crimes against women. This includes $193 million for Services, Training, Officers, and Prosecutors (STOP) Grants to Combat Violence Against Women, $27 million for the Sexual Assault Services Program, and $11 million to reduce vio-lent crimes against women on campuses. The Budget also provides $35 million for a new grant for communities to develop plans to address their untested sexual assault kits at law enforcement agencies or those backlogged at crime labs. These grants play a critical role in helping to create a coordinated community response to this problem. As a result of prior investments in this area, civil and criminal justice systems are more respon - sive to victims, and crimes of violence commit - ted against women have declined in recent years. Even so, reducing such violence and meeting the needs of the almost 1.3 million women victim - ized by rape and sexual assault annually, and the nearly seven million victims of intimate partner violence each year, remains a critical priority.Promotes Community Policing. The Budget includes $274 million to support evidence-based community policing in the Nation's local law enforcement agencies. Of the amount pro - vided, $247 million is for the hiring and retention of approximately 1,300 police officers and sher - iffs' deputies across the United States. To help ensure the safety and security of tribal partners, $35 million of the total is set aside for Tribal Law Enforcement. Promotes Fair and Equal Treatment in the Justice System. The Budget invests in sev - eral programs to promote access to justice and to build community trust, including $24 million for indigent defense and civil legal aid initiatives and $9 million to establish a National Center for Building Community Trust and Justice, which will promote procedural fairness in policing, use deterrence strategies to reduce crime, and en - courage police departments to track the quality of their interactions with the public. Prioritizes Evidence-Based Practices that Work at the State and Local Level. The Budget bolsters the Administration's efforts to ensure that more Federal grant funding flows to evidence-based activities that work in State and local criminal justice. The Budget increases set-asides for research, evaluation, and statistics; couples the formula Byrne Justice Assistance Grant and Juvenile Accountability Block Grant programs with competitive incentive grants that provide \"bonus\" funds to States and locali - ties that adopt evidence-based practices, strate - gies, and programming that incorporate outcome driven performance measures; expands the Pay for Success initiative, which leverages philan - thropic and private dollars to fund services up front, with the Government paying after they generate results; adopts a more evidence-based, data-driven use of competitive grant funds; and invests in the expansion of CrimeSolutions.gov, a \"what works\" clearinghouse for best practices in criminal justice, juvenile justice, and crime victim services.105Funding Highlights: Provides $11.8 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Labor by making targeted investments to improve job training and employment programs; strengthen enforcement of laws that protect workers' wages and working conditions; ensure a strong safety net for workers who lose their jobs or are hurt on the job; and promote a secure retirement for workers at the end of their careers. Activities supported at the Department include: |Raising the minimum wage so that hard-working Americans can earn wages that allow them to support their families and make ends meet; |Ensuring that Americans have the help and support they need to develop their skills and secure good jobs; |Building on proven strategies by providing increased funding for in-person reemployment services to reach unemployed workers who are most at risk of exhausting their benefits and all recently separated veterans; |Increasing support for agencies that protect workers' wages and overtime pay, benefits, health and safety, and investing in preventing and detecting the misclassification of employees as independent contractors; and |Assisting Americans who need to take time off from work to care for a child or other family member by helping States launch paid leave programs. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |Investment in a Community College Job-Driven Training Fund, which includes grants that would support doubling the number of apprenticeships in America over the next five years; |Increased innovation and performance incentives in the workforce system and additional resources targeted to populations that face significant barriers to employment; and |Additional funding to help more States launch paid leave programs.DEPARTMENT OF LABOR106 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR The Department of Labor (DOL) is charged with promoting the welfare of American work- ers, job seekers, and retirees, a mission critical to America's continued economic recovery and long- term competitiveness. To support this mission, the Budget provides more than $11.8 billion in discretionary funding for DOL. This funding lev-el, coupled with new dedicated mandatory funds, allows for substantial investments in American workers as well as significant reforms to help workers acquire skills, regain their footing af-ter a job loss, and find new employment oppor - tunities. The Budget also makes investments to bolster the enforcement of critical wage and hour, whistleblower, and worker safety laws. Invests in a Competitive Workforce Promotes Innovative, Job-Driven Appr - oaches to Training and Employment Services. As the economy changes, training and employment programs must continually innovate and improve to make the most of constrained resources and help American workers gain the skills to find good jobs and move up the career ladder. The Administration believes that govern - ment should be doing everything it can to make it easier for people who need help finding a job, or build their skills for a better one, and for employ - ers who need help finding qualified workers. Invests in Training and Employment Services. The Budget invests more than $3 billion in formula grants to States and locali - ties to provide training and employment ser - vices to more than 20 million Americans at 2,500 American Job Centers across the coun - try. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would add another $750 million to restore prior cuts to these grants; increase the investment in innovation, evidence-based practices, and performance in the workforce system; and provide additional funding for programs that serve populations with sig-nificant barriers to employment, including Native Americans, ex-offenders, and people with disabilities. This would complement the Budget's new investments through the Social Security Administration in the devel - opment of innovative strategies to help peo - ple with disabilities remain in the workforce, in partnership with other Federal agencies. Creates New Pathways to Jobs and Careers. The Budget proposes to include in the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative Reforms: Promotes innovative, job-driven approaches to training and employment services and higher performance through the Workforce Innovation Fund and improved Incentive Grants, so American workers can gain the skills to find good jobs and employers can find the workers they need. Creates a single program to help all displaced workers as part of a larger effort to modernize the Federal job training system. Safeguards workers' pensions by encouraging companies to fully fund their employees' promised benefits and assuring the long-term solvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Strengthens the Unemployment Insurance safety net by supporting work-based reforms, encouraging States to fully fund their Unemployment Insurance systems, and reducing improper payments.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 107 $1.5 billion in 2015 to support a four-year, $6 billion Community College Job-Driven Training Fund, which will offer competitive grants to partnerships of community col- leges, public and nonprofit training entities, industry groups, and employers to launch new training programs and apprenticeships that will prepare participants for in-demand jobs and careers. The fund will also help to create common credentials and skill assess - ments to allow employers to more easily identify and hire qualified candidates. Of each year's funding, $500 million will be set aside for grants to States and regional con - sortia to create new apprenticeships and in - crease participation in existing apprentice-ship programs. This four-year investment will support doubling the number of ap - prenticeships in America over the next five years. The Budget also invests $2.5 billion in mandatory funding for Summer Jobs Plus, which will fund summer and year-round job opportunities for 600,000 youth as well as innovation grants aimed at improving skills and career options for disadvantaged youth. Drives Better Performance and Innovation. The Budget invests an amount equal to five percent of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) formula grants in driving in - novation and performance at the State and local level through: $60 million in the Workforce Innovation Fund to support inno-vative State and regional approaches to ser - vice delivery; and $80 million for improved Incentive Grants to reward States that suc - ceed through their WIA programs in serving workers with the greatest barriers to em-ployment. Combined, these funds will fuel innovative approaches to workforce system service delivery and incentivize better pro-gram coordination to serve those who need the most help to find high-quality jobs. Streamlines the Delivery of Training. Today more than 40 Federal programs across the Government deliver job training and related employment services. The Administration is exploring opportunities to streamline access, more fully engage employers to ensure that training is well matched to jobs, and improve efficiency and employment outcomes. For ex- ample, the Budget proposes a New Career Pathways program that will reach as many as one million workers a year with a set of core services, combining the best elements of two existing programs\u2014Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers and WIA Dislocated Workers. The Administration is proposing strong accountability for outcomes and en - suring that the needs of all job-seekers and workers, including those with barriers to employment, continue to be met. Reconnects Unemployed Workers to Jobs. As the Nation works to strengthen and rebuild the economy from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, it is critical to provide a helping hand and a path back to work for those whose lives have been disrupted by unemploy - ment. The Budget makes an investment of $158 million in reemployment and eligibility assess - ments and reemployment services, an evidence-based approach to speed the return to work of Unemployment Insurance (UI) beneficiaries. This investment will reach those who are most likely to exhaust their UI benefits, as well as all recently separated veterans transitioning to ci - vilian jobs. The Budget also provides $2 billion in mandatory funding to encourage States to adopt Bridge to Work programs, which would allow in- dividuals to continue receiving their weekly UI check while participating in a short-term work placement and support other strategies for get - ting UI claimants back to work more quickly. In addition, the Budget provides $4 billion in man - datory funding to support partnerships between businesses and education and training provid - ers to train approximately one million long-term unemployed workers for new jobs. Beyond these investments, the Administration supports exten- sion of emergency unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed. If not extended, 3.6 million additional people are estimated to lose access to extended UI benefits by the end of the year, despite remaining unemployed and looking for work.108 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Provides Security for American Workers and Retirees Maintains Strong Support for Worker Protections. The Budget includes nearly $1.8 billion for DOL's worker protection agencies, putting them on sound footing to meet their re - sponsibilities to protect the health, safety, wages, working conditions, and retirement security of American workers. Supports Raising the Minimum Wage. In a nation as wealthy as the United States, far too many full-time workers are living below the poverty line. Over the past 30 years, mod - est minimum wage increases have not kept pace with the higher costs of basic necessi - ties for working families. The Administration supports raising the minimum wage so that hard-working Americans can earn wages that allow them to support their families and make ends meet. Many companies, from small businesses to large corporations, also see higher wages as the right way to boost productivity, reduce turnover, and increase profits. Raising the minimum wage is good for workers, their families, and for the econ - omy. The Administration is ready to work with the Congress to pass legislation to in- crease the minimum wage as soon as pos - sible. The President took an important step in this effort by signing an Executive Order to increase the minimum wage to $10.10 for those working on new and replacement Federal service, construction, and concession contracts. Ensures that Workers Get the Pay and Overtime They Have Earned. The Budget provides an increase of more than $41 million for DOL's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) to increase enforcement of the laws that ensure that workers receive appropriate wages and overtime pay, as well as the right to take job-protected leave for family and medical pur - poses. WHD will be able to hire 300 new in-vestigators across the United States to help in this effort, and use risk-based approaches to target the industries and employers most likely to break the law. Enhances Worker Safety and Protections for Whistleblowers. The Budget provides $565 million for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), allowing OSHA to inspect hazardous workplaces and work with employers to help them under - stand and comply with safety and health reg - ulations. The Budget includes an additional $4 million to bolster OSHA's enforcement of the 21 whistleblower laws that protect work - ers and others who are retaliated against for reporting unsafe and unscrupulous practices. Detects and Deters the Misclassification of Workers as Independent Contractors. When employees are misclassified as independent contractors, they are deprived of the benefits and protections to which they are legally entitled, such as minimum wage, overtime, unemployment insurance, and anti-dis- crimination protections. Misclassification also unfairly disadvantages businesses who comply with the law and costs taxpayers money in lost funds for the United States Treasury, and in Social Security, Medicare, the Unemployment Trust Fund, and State programs. The Budget includes nearly $14 million to combat misclassification, in - cluding $10 million for grants to States to identify misclassification and recover unpaid taxes and $4 million for personnel at WHD to investigate misclassification. Encourages State Paid Leave Initiatives. Too many American workers must make the painful choice between the care of their families and a paycheck they desperately need. While the Family and Medical Leave Act allows many work - ers to take job-protected unpaid time off, millions of families cannot afford to use unpaid leave. A handful of States have enacted policies to of-fer paid leave, but more States should have the chance to follow their example. The Budget sup- ports a $5 million State Paid Leave Fund to pro-vide technical assistance and support to States THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 109 that are considering paid leave programs. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative pro - vides an additional $100 million in support of this effort. Strengthens the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to Protect Worker Pensions. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) acts as a backstop to insure pension payments for workers whose companies have failed. PBGC's single employer program covers plans that are normally sponsored by an individual company; the multiemployer program covers plans set up by collectively bargained agreements involving more than one unrelated employer. Both pro - grams are underfunded, and PBGC's combined liabilities exceeded its assets by more than $36 billion at the end of 2013. The Congress has raised premiums twice since 2012, but rates remain much lower than what a private financial institution would charge for in - suring the same risk. Although PBGC will be able to pay benefits for years to come, it is still project - ed to be unable to meet its long-term obligations under current law. Any further premium increas- es need to be carefully crafted to avoid worsening PBGC's financial condition and harming workers' retirement security by driving healthy plans that pose little risk of presenting a claim to PBGC out of the system. To address these concerns, the Budget propos - es to give the PBGC Board the authority to adjust premiums in both the single employer and multi-employer programs and directs PBGC to take into account the risks that different sponsors pose. In the multiemployer program, these premium in - creases are crucial to improving solvency but will not be sufficient to address the complex challeng-es facing these plans. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to develop a more comprehensive solution. This proposal is estimated to save $20 billion over the next decade. Strengthens the UI Safety Net and Improves Program Integrity. The combination of chronically underfunded reserves and the eco - nomic downturn has placed a considerable finan - cial strain on States' UI operations. Currently, 16 States owe more than $21 billion to the Federal UI trust fund. As a result, employers in those States are now facing automatic Federal tax in - creases, and many States have little prospect of paying these loans back in the foreseeable future. At the same time, State UI programs have large improper payment rates. It is important to put the UI system back on the path to solvency and financial integrity while maintaining benefits for job seekers. The Administration proposes to pro- vide immediate relief to employers to encourage job creation now, reestablish State fiscal responsi - bility going forward, and work closely with States to eliminate improper payments. Modernizes Federal Workers' Compen - sation. The Budget acts on longstanding recom - mendations from the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional Budget Office, and DOL's Inspector General\u2014as well as numerous Securing Americans Value and Efficiency (SAVE) Award nominations\u2014to reform the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), which has not been substantially updated since 1974. The Budget proposes a series of FECA reforms that will generate Government-wide savings of more than $340 million over 10 years.111Funding Highlights: Provides a total of $40.3 billion in base discretionary funding for the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development, equal to the 2014 enacted level. In addition, provides $5.9 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations activity. This includes: |Dedicating $1.5 billion for the Middle East and North Africa to address the growing humanitarian crisis in Syria and support transitions and reforms in the region; |Supporting the rebalance of diplomatic and assistance resources to the Asia-Pacific region; |Advancing Power Africa, the President's historic initiative to partner with African countries and the private sector to expand electricity generation and access to power in sub-Saharan Africa; |Investing $4.6 billion to secure overseas personnel and facilities, including sufficient funding to support embassy security construction funding of $2.2 billion, as recommended by the Benghazi Accountability Review Board; |Providing $3 billion for peacekeeping missions to share global security burdens with other nations and respond to new peacekeeping requirements; |Advancing the President's commitment to global health by providing $1 for every $2 committed by other donors to the Global Fund, expanding access to HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention, and scaling up evidence-based child survival interventions to continue progress toward the end of preventable child and maternal deaths; and |Continuing a multi-year plan for Feed the Future to make strategic investments addressing the root causes of hunger and poverty and increase food security for millions by 2015. Provides $1 billion for the Millennium Challenge Corporation to support poverty reduction through economic growth. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports:DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS112 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS The Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other international programs advance the national se - curity interests of the United States by helping to build and sustain a more democratic, secure, and prosperous world. The Budget proposes smart investments in international programs that will advance peace and security, strengthen the U.S. economy, combat global challenges, and support United States citizens and the U.S. presence overseas. The Budget proposes a total of $46.2 billion for the Department of State and USAID, including costs for Overseas Contingency Operations. The Administration prioritizes responding to the hu - manitarian crisis in Syria, promoting reforms and transitions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), addressing global security challenges and peacekeeping needs, and responsibly fund- ing operations and assistance in Afghanistan. The Budget continues to provide strong support for the Administration's signature development initiatives in global health, food security, and cli - mate change. The Budget provides the necessary base resources to maintain critical diplomatic and development efforts around the world, including necessary investments in the safety and security of U.S. embassies and personnel serving abroad. At the same time, the Department and USAID are committed to managing effectively and driv- ing efficiencies wherever possible in order to give taxpayers the highest possible return on their in - vestment in U.S. global leadership. Maintains U.S. Global Leadership Responds to the Crisis in Syria and Supports Democratic Transitions and Reforms in the Middle East and North Africa. Building on the Administration's signifi- cant and continuing response to the transforma - tive events in MENA, the Budget includes $1.5 billion to respond to the crisis in Syria and con - tinue to support transitions and reforms in the region. This includes $1.1 billion in humanitar - ian assistance funding to address the crisis in Syria. The Budget also includes over $400 mil - lion to support an anticipated transition in Syria, to respond to new contingencies, and to promote long-term economic and political reforms across MENA, in addition to continuing or expanding on - going bilateral and regional programs in MENA. The response builds on several initiatives the United States is supporting to respond to region - al developments since the beginning of the Arab Spring, including Enterprise Funds, fiscal stabi - lization support through cash transfers and loan guarantees, and various initiatives through the G8's Deauville Partnership, including technical assistance, trade, and asset recovery initiatives. Prioritizes the Asia-Pacific Region. The Budget supports the Presidential priority of ad - vancing security, prosperity, and human dignity across the Asia-Pacific region. The Budget pro - vides resources to help deepen U.S. trade and investment in the region, strengthen regional cooperation, and enhance regional and country |Foreign assistance programs that have a proven track record of fostering economic growth, reducing poverty, and improving health, such as contributing to a 70 percent decline in child mortality over the last 20 years and a long-term income gain for millions of people in developing countries; and |Reserving $300 million to match more ambitious pledges from other donors to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Reforms: Proposes food aid reforms that allow approximately two million more people per year to be helped in emergencies within current resources, ensuring more cost-effective use of taxpayer resources.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 113 capabilities to address security, development, and economic challenges. These investments, along with an expanded U.S. diplomatic and public di - plomacy presence, are critical to the Government-wide effort to promote regional security and economic cooperation. Expands Electricity Generation and Access to Power Through Power Africa. The Administration is bringing to bear a wide range of Federal Government tools and exper - tise to support investment in Africa's energy sec - tor. The Budget supports infrastructure projects through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the U.S. contribution to the African Development Bank, leverages private sector in - vestment through the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and provides critical technical assistance to African partners through the Department of State, USAID, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. Both the investments in the power sector themselves and the resulting economic growth will expand the markets for U.S. goods in sub-Saharan Africa. Invests in Security Upgrades. The Budget provides $4.6 billion for the Department of State's security programs, including security staff, construction, and infrastructure upgrades. With a sustained level of investment in security upgrades, the Budget provides funding for the construction of new embassy and consulate com-pounds. These and other investments will ensure that the Administration continues to safeguard over 86,000 Federal Government employees, from more than 30 agency components, in more secure overseas working environments. When com - bined with contributions from other agencies, the Budget provides $2.2 billion for capital security construction, as recommended by the Benghazi Accountability Review Board. Supports Peacekeeping Missions. The Budget provides $3 billion to fund continued, sustained support for the United Nations (UN) and non-UN peacekeeping missions, enabling the United States to advance global security while sharing the burden with other nations. The Budget pursues a new approach to improve U.S. support for complex and urgent peacekeep-ing needs by proposing a $150 million peacekeep - ing response account, which enables the United States to support initial urgent and unexpected requirements of new UN and non-UN missions without compromising support for existing U.S. peacekeeping commitments. Invests in a Long-Term Partnership with Afghanistan. The Budget continues to support U.S. security, diplomatic, and development goals in Afghanistan. The Budget supports a strong, long-term partnership and includes core opera- tional support funding, as well as economic devel - opment, health, education, governance, security, and other civilian assistance programs necessary to reinforce development progress and promote stability. The Budget is consistent with the July 2012 Tokyo Conference commitment to request civilian assistance for Afghanistan \"at or near levels of the past decade.\" The Budget provides for near-term development assistance related to stabilization and counterinsurgency programs, extraordinary costs of operating in a high-threat environment, protection of civilian personnel, and oversight activities of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. Supports Global Health by Investing in High Impact Interventions. The Admini - stration is investing in proven interventions to continue progress toward the goals of achieving an AIDS-free generation and an end to preventable child and maternal deaths. The Budget contin- ues the President's pledge to provide $1 for every $2 pledged by other donors to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria by provid-ing $1.35 billion in 2015 base funding, which will increase U.S. leverage and accelerate progress against these three diseases. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would provide an additional $300 million for the Global Fund to en-courage even more ambitious pledges from other donors. On World AIDS Day 2013, the President announced impressive results in the treatment and prevention of HIV, including that the United States was supporting 6.7 million people on anti - retroviral therapy, exceeding the goal of putting 114 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS 6 million people on treatment that he had set two years prior. The Budget supports continued ex - pansion of evidence-based HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services. The Budget also builds on the momentum of the Child Survival Call to Action by continuing investments in proven child survival interventions. Additional funding for maternal and child survival in the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would lever - age a strong evidence base to expand access to and improve the quality of life-saving interven-tions for mothers and children. Funds would tar - get the leading causes of death, including diar - rhea, pneumonia, malaria, and complications in childbirth. Fights Hunger by Improving Food Security. The Budget continues to fund a multi- year plan for the President's food security initia - tive, Feed the Future, to address the root causes of hunger and poverty through agriculture de - velopment, resilience, and nutrition programs intended to reduce extreme poverty and malnu - trition and increase food security for millions of families by 2015. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would provide additional funds for bilateral food security in order to deepen and intensify the impact of the initiative, as well as $80 million for multilateral food security fund - ing. The Budget also maintains strong support for food aid and other humanitarian assistance, providing $4.8 billion to help internally displaced persons, refugees, and others affected by natural or man-made humanitarian disasters. Supports Efforts to Cut Carbon Pollution, Promote Sustainable Landscapes, and Enhance Climate Change Resilience. Established in 2010, the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) enables the United States to provide international leadership to promote cleaner and more efficient energy, to conserve the world's remaining tropical rainforests, to phase down chemicals with high global warming po - tential, and to support the most vulnerable com - munities in their efforts to cope with the adverse impacts of severe weather events and climate change. The Budget advances the goals of the GCCI and the President's Climate Action Plan, including by supporting bilateral and multilat - eral engagement with major and emerging econo-mies; reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; and expanding clean energy use as well as energy efficiency. Engages the Global Community and Empowers the Next Generation of Global Leaders. The Budget advances efforts to make U.S. global engagement and public diplomacy more flexible tools to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals. To engage and empower emerging leaders in key regions, the Budget provides $44 million for youth leadership programs in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Global events and trends now start, spread, and shape countries in an instant. The Budget includes $25 million for a rapid response exchange program to enable im - mediate engagement with key actors and groups when opportunities for engagement emerge. In addition, the Budget increases funding to pro - mote private educational exchanges, particularly in target areas such as the Western Hemisphere and China, as well as economic opportunity devel - opment and the engagement and strengthening of civil society. Invests in Poverty Reduction Through Economic Growth. The Budget provides $1 billion for MCC, whose core mission is to reduce poverty through economic growth. These re - sources will be used for programs which address the binding constraints to economic growth in developing countries that have been deemed eli - gible for MCC assistance based on performance on independent policy indicators. MCC has a robust model for projecting and measuring the impact of its programs, has demonstrated a com - mitment to evidence-based decision-making from its inception, and anticipates having a large role in the President's Power Africa initiative. MCC has invested nearly two-thirds of its portfolio in increasing global trade and creating enabling environments throughout the developing world where the American private sector can partner, compete, succeed, and bring key benefits, like jobs, back home. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would provide an additional $350 million for MCC, which will support at least THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 115 one additional compact in 2015 or enhancements to multiple compacts with a focus on enduring partner country policy reforms and sustainable development based on robust and transparent evidence and evaluation. Makes Contributions to Economic Growth, National Security, and Multilateral Poverty Reduction Efforts. The Budget pro- vides $2.6 billion to the Department of the Treasury for economic growth, national secu - rity, and multilateral poverty reduction efforts. These resources fund all annual general capital increase and replenishment commitments to the multilateral development banks, as well as criti - cal contributions to international environmental, food security, and technical assistance activities. These programs leverage the resources of other donors to support U.S. and multilateral objectives in key international institutions. Leverages Science, Technology, Inno - vation, and Partnerships (STIP) in Deve - lopment. The Budget invests in USAID's initia - tive to modernize global development through the expanded use of science, technology, innovation, and partnerships in its programs and to establish the Global Development Lab. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would provide additional STIP funding to scale up innovative solutions and fund new programs focused on achieving transformational development results and accelerating progress toward development goals. Improves Efficiency and Transparency Reforms Food Aid for More Cost-Effective Use of Taxpayer Resources. The Budget pro- poses reforms within P.L. 480 Title II, the Nation's largest international food aid program, to make it more cost-effective and increase its impact, while maintaining robust levels of emergency food and development assistance. Most food aid funding would be used to purchase and ship food from the United States. The remaining flexible resources would be used for interventions such as buying food near crises or cash transfers and vouchers. In addition to saving time and money, this type of flexible funding has been critical to reaching those most in need in complex environ - ments such as Syria and fast onset disasters such as the Philippines' Typhoon Haiyan. The reform would allow around two million more people per year to receive food aid without additional fund - ing. The Budget also proposes $25 million per year through the Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration for additional targeted operating subsidies and incentives to facilitate the retention of mariners. Improves the Efficiency of U.S. Inter - national Broadcasting. The Opportunity, Gro - wth, and Security Initiative would provide $29 million to the Broadcasting Board of Governors to enable the use of long-term contracts for satel- lite services, which will yield a 31 percent savings over current contract levels over a seven-year timeframe. 117Funding Highlights: Provides a total of $91 billion in discretionary and mandatory budgetary resources for the Department of Transportation. Includes $302 billion for a four-year, surface transportation reauthorization proposal to support critical infrastructure projects and create jobs while improving America's roads, bridges, transit systems, and railways. This includes: |Proposing new performance measures to prioritize Federal transportation funding for \"Fix it First\" projects that emphasize maintaining existing infrastructure in a state of good repair; |Providing $1.25 billion per year for the competitive TIGER Grant program, which helps States and localities support innovative projects that deliver exceptional transportation benefits; |Implementing a new four-year, $10 billion freight program designed to eliminate existing freight transportation bottlenecks and improve the efficiency of moving goods in support of the President's National Export Initiative; and |Increasing funding for transit and passenger rail programs from $12.3 billion to $22.3 billion in 2015, expanding transit capital investment grants, significantly improving existing and new intercity passenger rail service, and strengthening the economic competitiveness of the Nation's freight rail system. Provides $14 billion in discretionary resources to fund air, maritime, rail safety, and pipeline and hazardous material transportation activities, including: |$836 million for the Next Generation Air Transportation System, a revolutionary modernization of the Nation's aviation system; |$370 million to support a National Airspace System Sustainment Strategy to reduce the Federal Aviation Administration's multi-billion dollar maintenance backlog; |$40 million for a multi-modal fund to support safe shipping of crude oil via rail and truck by ramping up inspection resources, research and development and testing, and response capability; andDEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATIONUNITEDSTATESOFAMERICA DEPARTMENTOFTRANSPORTATION118 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION A well-functioning transportation system is critical to America's economic future. Americans rely on the transportation system to move people and goods safely, facilitate commerce, attract and retain businesses, and support jobs. The Budget provides a total of $91 billion in discretionary and mandatory funding in 2015 for the Department of Transportation (DOT) to support infrastructure projects critical for long-term growth; improve America's roads, bridges, transit systems, rail - ways, and aviation system; enhance safety; spur job creation; and improve the way Federal dollars are spent. Invests in Infrastructure Critical for Job Creation and Long \u00adTerm Growth Improves the Nation's Infrastructure While Creating Jobs and Ladders of Opportunity. To spur economic growth and al- low States to initiate sound multi-year invest- ments, the Budget proposes a four-year, $302 billion surface transportation reauthorization package. This would support critical infrastruc - ture projects and create jobs, while improving America's roads, bridges, transit systems, and railways. The reauthorization proposal will also include reforms to improve the review process and delivery of infrastructure projects; support American exports by improving movement within the Nation's freight networks; increase economic mobility by linking economically isolated commu- nities to job opportunities; permanently authorize the TIGER grant program to help spur innova - tion by competitively awarding funding to proj - ects around the Nation; improve regional coordi - nation by Metropolitan Planning Organizations to stimulate economic development; and advance the Climate Action Plan by building more re - silient infrastructure, reducing transportation emissions by shifting travel growth from roads to transit, and encouraging sounder transporta - tion planning. The Administration is committed to supporting the ongoing bipartisan dialogue on surface transportation by providing a legislative proposal that reflects this critical blueprint. |$158 million for a more robust, rigorous, and data-driven pipeline safety program to ensure the highest level of safety for America's pipeline system. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |An additional $186 million investment in the Next Generation Air Transportation System, which makes the total request roughly $1 billion. This funding provides the Federal Aviation Administration flexibility to aggressively develop and deploy more time and fuel saving capabilities while also addressing serious maintenance backlogs. Reforms: Modernizes the permitting process for infrastructure projects by expanding a Permitting Dashboard to track the timeliness and outcomes of project permits and reviews, and by assigning responsibility for implementing reforms to a new Interagency Infrastructure Permitting Improvement Center, to be housed at the Department of Transportation. Focuses airport grants to support smaller airports, while giving larger commercial service airports additional flexibility to raise their own resources. Provides $4 billion for a new competitive surface transportation program that would incentivize States and localities to pursue ambitious performance improvements.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 119 Supports New Transit Investments. The Budget nearly doubles annual transit investments over the prior authorization, with resources supporting both existing capacity and expansion through projects involving bus rapid transit, subway, light rail, and commuter rail sys-tems. These investments\u2014driven by data show - ing that demand for public transit continues to climbwould represent an historic increase in transit funding. Additional funding would enable a major expansion of new transit projects in sub - urbs, fast-growing cities, small towns, and rural areas across the United States, while meeting the growing needs of establishedand agingtransit systems, which will improve the quality of life in United States' neighborhoods and communities by providing affordable transportation options. All of these efforts will help ensure that workers can access jobs, supporting economic mobility and opportunity. Emphasizes a \"Fix it First\" Approach for Highway and Transit Grants. Too many elements of the U.S. surface transportation infrastructurehighways, bridges, and transit assetsfall short of a state of good repair. This can impact the capacity, performance, and safety of the Nation's transportation system. At the same time, States and localities have incentives to emphasize new investments over improving the condition of the existing infrastructure. The Administration's reauthorization proposal will underscore the im - portance of preserving and improving existing as - sets, encouraging government and industry part - ners to make optimal use of current capacity, and minimizing life-cycle costs through sound asset management principles. Accountability is a key element of the Administration's approach, as the reauthorization proposal will improve transpar - ency into States' and localities' use of funds by strengthening performance measures that track how the States' choices of projects impact safety and overall highway conditions. Proposes Dedicated Funding for Multi- Modal Freight and High Performance Rail Investments. The Budget provides $10 billion over four years for a dedicated regional freight infrastructure investment program to support multi-modal, corridor-based projects designed to eliminate existing freight transportation bottle-necks and improve the efficiency of moving goods in support of the President's National Export Initiative. The Budget also provides $19.1 bil - lion over four years to fund the development of high-performance rail and other passenger rail programs as part of an integrated national trans - portation strategy. The proposal also benefits freight rail and significantly restructures Federal support for Amtrak to increase transparency, accountability, and performance. Pays for Transportation Investment with Savings from Comprehensive Business Tax Reform. The President is committed to ensuring that critical transportation investments are fis - cally sustainable. Because rebuilding the trans-portation infrastructure is an urgent need, the Budget reinvests the transition revenue from pro-growth business tax reform to fully offset the baseline Highway Trust Fund solvency needs and the out-year surface and rail transportation re - authorization proposal. The President will work with the Congress to develop fiscally responsible solutions to address funding needs beyond the reauthorization window. Responds to Emerging Concerns with the Transport of Crude Oil by Rail and Truck. As the Nation's ability to extract energy resourc - es increases, one of DOT's priorities is to en - sure safe transportation of these materials. The Budget establishes a new fund to provide $40 million in discretionary resources to support pre - vention and response activities associated with the safe transportation of energy resources. The funds would be available for multiple DOT modes to address risk through data-driven safety inter - ventions, additional safety personnel, training and outreach, collaboration with other Federal stakeholders, and other strategies. Based on the activities supported by this fund, DOT will report on best practices and lessons learned to help with the implementation of safety measures going for - ward. Because this effort is a partnership with in - dustry, the Budget proposes to give the Secretary additional authority to share costs associated with ensuring that these cargoes move safely.120 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Enhances Pipeline Safety. In order to ensure the highest safety standards for the U.S. pipeline system, the Budget proposes a Pipeline Safety Reform initiative to enhance the Department's Pipeline Safety program. The need for reform is acutepipeline safety inspectors, who work in collaboration with State partners, are spread too thinly across the 2.6 million miles of pipeline, and the current staffing levels cannot ensure prompt investigations following incidents. The Budget increases funding for the State Pipeline Safety Grant program and funds the next phase of a multi-year effort to increase the number of Federal pipeline safety inspectors. In addition, the Budget modernizes pipeline data collection, map- ping capabilities and analysis, improves Federal investigation of pipeline accidents of all sizes, and expands public education and outreach. Modernizes and Sustains the Nation's Air Traffic Control System. The Budget provides over $1 billion in 2015 for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), the multi-year effort currently underway to improve the efficiency, safety, capacity, and environmental performance of the aviation system. The Budget includes $836 million in the base request for NextGen and an additional $186 million through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative. These funds will continue to support the transfor - mation from a ground-based radar surveillance system to a more accurate satellite-based surveil - lance system; the development of a 21 st Century data communications capability between air traf- fic control and aircraft to improve efficiency; and the improvement of aviation weather information. The Budget supports taking a coordinated and targeted approach to deploying readily-available NextGen capabilities, and to developing new op - erational procedures, systems, and infrastructure that benefit the traveling public and all aviation stakeholders. However, while NextGen is being deployed, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has to balance investments in future capa-bilities with maintaining currently operational, but aging equipment. Therefore, the Budget also provides $370 million for the National Airspace System Sustainment Strategy to reduce some of FAA's multi-billion dollar maintenance backlog.Improves the Way Federal Funds are Spent Modernizes the Infrastructure Permitting Process. In order to accelerate economic growth and improve the competitiveness of the American economy, the Administration is taking action to modernize and improve the efficiency of the Federal permitting process for major infrastructure projects. By cutting through red tape and getting more timely decisions on Federal permits and reviews, the Budget will ensure that projects that are approved lead to better outcomes for communities and the environment. In support of this effort, the Budget includes funding for a new Interagency Infrastructure Permitting Improvement Center and a Permitting Dashboard to be managed by DOT's Office of the Secretary. The Center will spearhead the Administration's reform efforts, including implementing over 80 actions laid out in the implementation plan for the Presidential Memorandum on Modernizing Infrastructure Permitting. Given the highly decentralized nature of the current permitting process, the Center will play an unprecedented role in driving change across nearly 20 Federal agencies and bureaus. The Permitting Dashboard, a publicly available website, will be expanded to track project schedules and metrics for all major infrastructure projects, further improving the transparency and accountability of the permitting process. Encourages Innovative Solutions Through a New Fix ing and Accelerating Surface Transportation Competition. The Administration's four-year reauthorization plan would dedicate approximately $4 billion for a competitive grant program, Fixing and Accelerating Surface Transportation, designed to create incentives for State and local partners to adopt critical reforms in a variety of areas, includ - ing safety and peak traffic demand management. Federally-inspired safety reforms, such as seat belt and drunk-driving laws, have saved thou - sands of American lives and avoided billions in property losses. This initiative will seek to repeat past successes across the complete spectrum of transportation policy priorities. Specifically, the THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 121 Department will work with States and localities to set ambitious goals in different areas. For ex - ample, implementing distracted driving (safety) requirements or modifying transportation plans to include mass transit, bike, and pedestrian options, and tie resources to goal-achievement. Reduces Funding in Targeted Areas. The Budget lowers funding for the airport grants program to $2.9 billion, offset in part by eliminating guaranteed funding for large hub airports. The Budget focuses Federal grants on supporting smaller commercial and general aviation airports that do not have access to additional revenue or other outside sources of capital. At the same time, the Budget allows larger airports to increase non-Federal passenger facility charges, thereby giving larger airports greater flexibility to generate their own revenue. 123Funding Highlights: Provides $13.8 billion for the Department of the Treasury to maintain a strong economy by promoting the conditions that enable economic growth and job creation. This includes: |Continuing to implement the Affordable Care Act to provide quality, affordable health care for millions of Americans who would otherwise be uninsured, including through the delivery of tax credits and cost sharing assistance to make coverage affordable while reducing health care costs and the deficit; |Continuing to implement the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to create a more stable and responsible financial system; |Investing $12.5 billion, including a program integrity initiative, in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to improve service to taxpayers and reduce the deficit through more effective enforcement of tax laws; |Investing $1.5 billion for a new round of the successful State Small Business Credit Initiative, enabling States to support innovative partnerships of their design that increase small business lending and investment; and |Investing $225 million in the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund to spur jobs and healthier communities in underserved areas. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |Additional IRS customer service improvements, including increasing toll-free telephone level of service from about 60 percent to 80 percent when combined with base funding, driving responsiveness to taxpayers through correspondence inventory reduction, and bolstering resources to help tackle more resource-intensive identity theft and refund fraud cases; and |An expansion of the level of detail and capabilities of sorting Federal spending data to enable more effective Federal and non-Federal use of this data. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY124 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY The Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) mission is to maintain a strong economy and cre - ate economic and job opportunities by promoting the conditions that enable economic growth and stability at home and abroad, strengthen nation - al security by combating threats and protecting the integrity of the financial system, and manage the Federal Government's finances and resources effectively. Treasury also performs an array of core Government functions such as tax law en - forcement, financial management, and debt col - lection that are vital to the overall financial in- tegrity of the Federal Government. In support of Treasury's essential and diverse mission, the Budget provides $13.8 billion in total resourc - es, an increase of nearly $1.2 billion\u2014partially funded through the proposed program integrity cap adjustment\u2014or 9.2 percent above the 2014 enacted level. The Budget enhances the Department's lead - ership role in ensuring the safety and soundness of the U.S. economy and the global financial sys - tem through key investments in Treasury's es-sential functions: domestic finance and economic policy; international economics; tax policy and administration; financial management; and cur - rency production. The Budget also recognizes the indispensable role that Treasury plays in implementing essential reforms that have been enacted over the past four years to the Nation's healthcare and financial systems. The Budget also invests in upgrading technologies to enable the Department to secure efficiencies and realize savings for taxpayers.Supports Individuals, Businesses, and Communities, and Strengthens the U.S. Financial System Continues Successful Implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget provides the resources necessary to carry out key tax-re- lated provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The tax filing season in 2015 is a critical period for ensuring the delivery of healthcare to millions of Americans in a timely and accurate fashion. The Budget makes the investments necessary for the IRS to better respond to taxpayer inquiries, as well as to verify income, provide benefit calculations, and reconcile tax accounts in support of greater access to healthcare for all Americans. Protects Consumers and Supports Continued Implementation of Wall Street Reform. The Budget continues responsible implementation of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to ensure a stronger and fairer financial system for investors and con-sumers. The Budget fully supports the efforts of the Financial Stability Oversight Council and Treasury's Office of Financial Research to iden - tify, monitor, and respond to emerging threats to U.S. financial stability. The Budget also provides critical funding increases for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose funding in the Budget increases 30 percent and 26 per - cent, respectively, over their 2014 enacted lev-els. These independent financial regulators have already taken decisive action to rein in excessive Reforms: Provides for a comprehensive review of U.S. currency production and use, including developing alternative options for the penny and the nickel. Proposes a multi-year program integrity cap adjustment for the IRS, including $480 million in 2015, to deliver additional resources to critical tax enforcement and compliance functions that reduce the deficit and narrow the tax gap by nearly $6 for every $1 spent once fully implemented, with total savings of $35 billion over the next 10 years.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 125 risk-taking and market manipulation, and the Budget will allow them to fully execute their responsibilities for financial oversight under the Wall Street Reform Act. Provides Significant New Support for Small Business Lending and Investment. The Budget provides $1.5 billion for a second round of Treasury's successful State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) in order to support State-sponsored public-private partner - ships to increase lending, investment, and tech-nical assistance to small businesses and manu - facturers. SSBCI is already achieving results: the first $271 million in program expenditures supported lending and investments of $1.9 bil - lion to more than 4,600 small businesses across the United States\u2014creating or saving more than 53,000 American jobs. The Budget proposes to im - prove the targeting of SSBCI funding so that the funds are put to even more effective use. Of the $1.5 billion provided, $1 billion will be competi - tively awarded to States best able to target un-derserved groups, leverage Federal funding, and evaluate results. An additional $500 million will be allocated to States according to a need-based formula. Responsibly Winds Down the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The Budget supports the effective, transparent, and account - able winding down of TARP programs, as well as Treasury's continuing efforts to help prevent avoidable home foreclosures. Of the $412 bil - lion in support that TARP provided to the finan - cial and automotive sectors, only $12.4 billion remains outstanding. Taxpayer proceeds from repayments, redemptions, and sales of TARP investments continue to exceed expectations. TARP's banking programs have already generat - ed a positive return, with more than $273 billion recovered for taxpayers as of December 31, 2013, compared to the $245 billion originally invested, and in 2013, with the auto industry back on its feet, Treasury sold TARP's remaining shares in General Motors. The Budget estimates that ex - cluding assistance to distressed homeowners, taxpayers will realize a positive net return of $16 billion from TARP investments and additional Treasury AIG (American International Group) support. Supports Struggling Homeowners. With the housing sector still healing, the Budget contin - ues to support key programs to assist homeown-ers. Since April 2009, TARP's Home Affordable Modification Program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Federal Housing Administration, and the private sector HOPE Now alliance have initiated more than 7.4 million foreclosure prevention actions for dis - tressed homeowners, which is nearly double the number of foreclosures completed in the same pe - riod. In addition, as of December 31, 2013, more than three million borrowers have lowered their monthly payments by refinancing mortgages through the Home Affordable Refinancing Program. Spurs Jobs, Healthier Communities, and Delivers Healthy Foods to Underserved Communities. The Budget provides a to - tal of $225 million for Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI), which plays a key role in providing financial and technical assistance to advance community development in impoverished or underserved ar - eas. By facilitating capital, credit, and financial services to low-income communities, this unique program helps spur job creation and investments that improve communities and opportunities for their residents. Within CDFI, $35 million is pro-vided to support Treasury's lead role in an inter - agency effort to reduce \"food deserts\" that lack nutritious foods such as fresh fruit and vegeta - bles, by supporting businesses that will provide them, and the supply chain to deliver them, to these areas. The Budget also extends by one year the CDFI Bond Guarantee program to provide a source of long-term capital to CDFIs that support lending in underserved communities. Manages the Federal Government's Finances Effectively and Efficiently Invests in the IRS to Boost Customer Service and Improve Compliance with Current Laws. The IRS is responsible for 126 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY securing over 90 percent of the revenue that funds the Federal Government and ensuring the integrity of U.S. tax laws. The Budget pro - vides $12 billion in base funding for the IRS, an increase of 6.3 percent over the 2014 enacted level. The Budget also proposes a $480 million program integrity cap adjustment to support ef - forts aimed at improving enforcement of current tax laws and reducing the tax gap, currently es - timated at $450 billion in gross revenues annu - ally. Research shows that every additional dol-lar invested in IRS tax enforcement activities returns six times its value in increased revenue, and this enforcement initiative is estimated to yield a net deficit reduction of $35 billion over the next 10 years. The lack of sufficient IRS fund - ing in recent years has caused a deterioration in the service to taxpayers that the IRS can provide, reflected in longer wait times on the phone when taxpayers call in with questions, and in the time it takes to respond to taxpayer correspondence. The Budget begins to reverse this trend through a more than $100 million increase to improve customer service, which will secure rapid and no - ticeable improvements in taxpayer interactions with the IRS. The Budget also includes an Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative to generate add- ed value for taxpayers and the economy, and one of its areas of particular focus is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Government pro - grams. For the IRS, an additional $165 million is proposed through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative to further enhance the agency's customer service performance across its service offerings, including an increase to the toll-free level of service from an estimated 60 percent to 80 percent when combined with the base discretionary funding request. Improves Government Operations and Promotes Efficiencies. The Budget proposes a number of initiatives to make Government work more effectively. For example, Treasury will take action to help improve the Government's abil-ity to collect delinquent debt across all agencies, enhance program integrity, and return greater resources to taxpayers. Treasury, given its fi - nancial management expertise and leadership, will also work with other agencies to improve USAspending.gov, the Government's website de - signed to track and share data on how Federal funds are spent and promote spending transpar - ency. In addition, the Budget will create a new $300 million Pay for Success Incentive Fund that will encourage State and local governments to support evidence-based programs that will yield Federal savings through improved out- comes in areas such as juvenile justice, workforce development, and homelessness. Assesses the Future of Currency, Including the Penny. The production and circulation of currency in the United States have been large - ly unchanged for decades, despite the growth in electronic financial transactions. Treasury is undertaking a comprehensive review of U.S. cur - rency, including a review of both the production and use of coins, in order to efficiently promote commerce in the 21 st Century. These studies will analyze alternative metals, the United States Mint facilities, and consumer behavior and pref - erences, and will result in the development of alternative options for the penny and the nickel. 127Funding Highlights: Provides $65.3 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to provide needed care and other benefits to veterans and their families. In addition, the Budget includes $3.1 billion in estimated medical care collections, for a total budget authority of approximately $68.4 billion. This includes: |Protecting critical funding for VA medical care by providing $56 billion, in addition to requesting $58.7 billion in 2016 advance appropriations for medical care programs, to ensure continuity of veterans' health care services; |Funding programs that, along with programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other Federal agencies, aim to end veterans' homelessness; and |Supporting continuing improvements in the delivery of mental health care and the development of telehealth technologies, specialized care for women veterans, and benefits for veterans' caregivers. Includes $1 billion in mandatory funding to create the Veterans Job Corps program that would put thousands of veterans back to work over the next five years protecting and rebuilding America. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |An additional $400 million investment in high priority capital projects to address critical safety issues, improve services, and meet increased demand for veterans' services. Reforms: Addresses the VA claims backlog and improves the Department's efficiency by investing $138.7 million in the Veterans Claims Intake Program, continuing to implement the paperless claims system, and undertaking additional efforts to provide faster and more accurate benefits claims processing and improve veterans' access to benefits information.DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS128 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS The Nation has a solemn obligation to take care of its veterans and to honor them for their ser - vice and sacrifice on behalf of the United States. To deliver on this commitment, the Budget pro - vides $65.3 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a three percent increase above the 2014 enacted level. In addition, the Budget includes $3.1 billion in esti - mated medical care collections, for a total budget authority of approximately $68.4 billion. This funding will continue to drive improvements in efficiency and responsiveness at VA, enabling the Department to better serve veterans and their families. The Budget supports efforts to ensure the needs of today's veteran population are met and invests in the continued modernization of VA to meet 21 st Century challenges. The Budget also addresses anticipated growth in the number of veterans, dependents, and survivors projected to use VA services in 2015\u2014an estimated 9.3 mil - lion veterans enrolled in VA's health care system and 4.9 million veterans and survivors receiving disability compensation. Sustains and Strengthens Services for Veterans and Their Families Protects Critical Funding for VA Medical Care. The Budget provides $56 billion for VA medical care, a 2.7 percent increase above the 2014 enacted level, to provide high-quality and timely health care services to veterans and other eligible beneficiaries. These services include in-novative programs to educate and support veter - ans' caregivers, enhance veterans' access to care through telehealth technologies, and support eq - uitable, high-quality care for women veterans in an appropriate and safe environment. In addi - tion, the Budget proposes $58.7 billion in advance appropriations for the VA medical care program in 2016, which will provide timely and predict - able funding for VA's medical care to prevent vet - erans from being adversely affected by any poten - tial delays in annual appropriations. In addition, the Administration's Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes a one-time invest-ment of $400 million to support one additional major construction project and other high priority capital projects to address critical safety issues, improve services, and meet increased demand. Strengthens Mental Health Care Services. The Budget provides over $7 billion to continue VA's focus on expanding and transforming mental health services for veterans to ensure accessible and patient-centered care, including treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, ensuring timely access to mental healthcare, and treat - ment for Military Sexual Trauma. This funding will allow VA to continue its collaborative efforts with the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Health and Human Services, as directed in the President's Executive Order on improving access to mental health services for veterans, service - members, and military families, to help veterans receive timely access to mental health services, including through enhanced partnerships with community providers. Ends Veterans' Homelessness. Between 2010 and 2013, the number of homeless veterans has decreased by 24 percent. The Budget invests $1.6 billion to serve homeless and at-risk veter - ans, including $500 million for the Supportive Services for Veteran Families program to provide homelessness prevention and rapid re-housing services, and $321 million for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-VA Supportive Housing program (HUD-VASH) for VA case management services. The Budget also includes $75 million in HUD funding for 10,000 new HUD-VASH vouchers to permanently house homeless veterans. Through these investments and collaborative partnerships with local gov - ernments, non-profit organizations, and Federal agencies, the Administration will continue to make progress toward the President's goal to end veterans' homelessness in 2015. Addresses VA Claims Backlog and Con - tinues Implementation of the Paperless Claims System. Over the last decade, VA has received an increasing number of disability claims from veterans. Past growth in the dis - ability claims backlog has been due to a variety of circumstances, including the 255,000 claims THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 129 received because of VA's decision to expand dis - ability compensation eligibility to veterans for their exposure to Agent Orange. To eliminate the backlog, the Budget includes $138.7 million to enhance VA's Veterans Claims Intake Program, allowing the Department to continue to directly receive and convert paper evidence, such as med - ical records, into a digital format for increased efficiency in claims processing. The Budget also supports transformation ini- tiatives, including the continued development of a digital, near-paperless environment that al-lows for greater exchange of information and in - creased transparency for veterans. Specifically, the Budget includes $173.3 million for the Veterans Benefit Management System, designed to reduce the processing time and the claims backlog, automate claims tracking, and facilitate quality improvements including service-connect- ed disability evaluations. These overall efforts support VA's efforts to eliminate the claims backlog and achieve the Department's goal of processing all claims within 125 days with 98 percent accuracy in 2015. VA continues to make considerable progress in re - ducing the disability claims backlog, defined as those claims pending longer than 125 days. Advances Medical and Prosthetic Re - search. The Budget includes $589 million for medical and prosthetic research to support veter - ans wounded in service. As part of the largest in - tegrated health care system in the United States, the VA research program benefits from clinical care and research occurring together, allowing research to be directly coordinated with the care of veterans. Supports Veteran Employment. To help the newest veterans transition to civilian life and find good jobs, the Budget provides $33 million to continue the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) and VetSuccess on Campus initia - tives. IDES and VetSuccess counselors ensure that veterans, especially wounded warriors and students, receive timely information about educa - tion opportunities, job counseling, and placement. The Budget also proposes $1 billion to create the Veterans Job Corps program that would put thousands of veterans back to work over the next five years protecting and rebuilding America. In addition, the Department of the Interior's histor - ic Centennial Initiative will engage hundreds of veterans to upgrade and rebuild national parks. Improves Access to Comprehensive Services and Benefits. The Budget supports VA's efforts to ensure consistent, personalized, and accurate information about services and benefits, especially in the delivery of compensa - tion and pension claims processing. To improve the speed, effectiveness, and efficiency of benefits service delivery, the joint DOD/VA eBenefits web portal provides veterans with critical self-service capabilities to manage their VA, military and personal information, apply online for benefits, and check the status of a claim.131Funding Highlights: Provides $4.5 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers civil works program, focused on investments in areas that will yield high economic and environmental returns or address a significant risk to public safety. This includes: |Investing in restoring significant aquatic ecosystems to help promote their ecological sustainability and resilience; and |Supporting investment in maintenance work and related activities at the most heavily used coastal ports and inland waterways in the Nation. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |Improvements in the resiliency of federally developed and managed water resources infrastructure to address a changing climate. Reforms: Reforms how the Federal Government finances capital investments in support of navigation on the inland waterways, including a new user fee. Increases the organizational efficiency of the Corps and improves the management, oversight, and performance of ongoing programs to meet water resources needs and achieve savings.CORPS OF ENGINEERS\u2014CIVIL WORKS The Army Corps of Engineers civil works pro - gram (Corps) develops, manages, and restores water resources to promote economic growth, increase public safety, and protect the environ - ment. The Corps work focuses primarily on the construction, operation and maintenance of wa-ter resources projects, studies of potential new projects, and its regulatory program. The Corps also works with other Federal agencies to help States and communities respond to and recover from floods and other natural disasters. To sup - port this work, the Budget provides $4.5 billion, a $934 million, or 17 percent, decrease from the 2014 enacted level. The Budget focuses resources on the highest priority work within the agency's three main missions: flood and storm damage reduction; commercial navigation; and aquatic ecosystem restoration. In addition, the Budget 132 CORPS OF ENGINEERS\u2014CIVIL WORKS supports reforms within the Corps that will im- prove its efficiency and ensure projects deliver the highest return for taxpayers. Invests in Water Resources to Support Economic Growth and Protect the Environment Emphasizes Investments in Construction Projects with High Economic and Environ - mental Returns While Addressing Pub lic Safety. The Budget pro vides $1.1 billion for Corps construction projects with an empha - sis on projects that provide high economic and environmental returns to the Nation or ad - dress a significant risk to public safety. The Administration's Task Force on Ports continues to develop a national strategy for investment leading to a network of ports and related infra - structure that is more efficient, safe, secure, re - silient, and environmentally sustainable. The strategy will be informed by stakeholder input. Restores High Priority Aquatic Eco - systems. The Budget provides funding to restore significant aquatic ecosystems based on sound science and adaptive management. Funds are provided for work on priority aquat - ic ecosystems, including the California Bay- Delta, Chesapeake Bay, Everglades, Great Lakes, and Gulf Coast. Funds are also pro - vided for other aquatic ecosystem restoration efforts, such as endangered species recovery in the Columbia River, restoring Puget Sound, and improving environmental outcomes in the Upper Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. Invests in Existing Water Resources Infrastructure. The Budget includes fund - ing for the operation and maintenance of exist - ing infrastructure and improving its reliabil-ity. The Budget prioritizes the operation and maintenance of key infrastructure, including navigation channels that serve the Nation's largest coastal ports and the inland waterways with the most commercial use, such as the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and the Illinois Waterway.Improves Funding and Management Reforms Inland Waterways Funding. The Administration has proposed to reform the laws governing the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, in - cluding an annual per vessel fee to sufficiently in-crease the amount paid by commercial navigation users to meet their share of the costs of activities financed from this fund. The additional revenue would help finance future capital investments in these waterways. The amounts collected would re - flect the actual costs incurred, so any cost savings would translate over time directly into lower fees. Enhances Non-Federal Leadership in Water Resources. Building and maintaining U.S. water resources infrastructure is a shared responsibility between Federal and non-Federal beneficiaries. The Administration supports efforts to encourage States and communities to assume responsibility for the development, management, restoration, and protection of water resources, in- cluding two new navigation studies that will al - low local sponsors to assume greater ownership. This includes removing unnecessary obstacles and streamlining procedures for non-Federal parties to pursue investments independently that are im - portant to their communities, while ensuring ap-propriate Federal interests are maintained. Increases Organizational Efficiency. The Administration continues to work to improve the re - sponsiveness, accountability, and operational over - sight of the civil works program in order to best meet current and future water resources challenges. For example, as part of the President's Executive Order on Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects, the Corps is working to promote early collaboration and part - nership among agencies, project sponsors, affected stakeholders, and the public in project planning, de - velopment, and permitting processes. These efforts are intended to lead to more timely decisions while also reducing adverse impacts to communities and the environment or to mitigate effects that may oc - cur. In addition, the Corps is implementing steps to reduce cost overruns and achieve efficiencies through life cycle project cost management.133Funding Highlights: Provides $7.9 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect human health and the environment. This includes: |Supporting the President's Climate Action Plan to reduce carbon pollution from power plants, vehicles and other sources and prepare the Nation for the unavoidable impacts of climate change; |Improving coordination with other Federal agencies and State, local, and tribal emergency planning and response organizations in assessing and managing chemical facility safety and security; and |Increasing support for State and tribal environmental protection by $76 million for implementation of delegated authorities, including support for air and water quality management and building tribal program capacity. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |A Nation that is better prepared for the impacts of climate change by protecting and enhancing coastal wetlands and supporting urban forest enhancement and protection. Reforms: Reforms processes to increase program effectiveness by implementing the E-Enterprise Initiative, which includes transitioning from paper-based to electronic reporting, and using strategic sourcing for EPA's contract needs. Redesigns how EPA does business through realigning its workforce while ensuring staff have the skills they need to address today's environmental protection challenges in partnership with States.ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) mission is to protect human health and the environment. EPA was formed in 1970 in order to implement major pollution control programs, which were carried out primarily by EPA employees at the Federal level. In the de - cades that followed, new environmental statutes were enacted that expanded EPA's mandate and 134 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY workload. Federal environmental programs were designed by the Congress to support strong col - laboration with State, tribal, and local partners wherever possible, and most major environmen - tal statutes have since been delegated to, and are largely administered by, States and Tribes. As a result of the successful efforts of these col - laborations, environmental quality has improved substantially during this time. In recognition of evolving responsibilities, EPA has strategically evaluated its workforce and facility needs and will undertake a comprehensive effort to modernize its workforce in 2015. By implementing creative, flexible, cost-effective, and sustainable strategies to protect public health and safeguard the envi - ronment, EPA will target resources toward de - velopment of a workforce and structure that can address current challenges and priorities. Meets the Climate Change Challenge Supports the President's Climate Action Plan. EPA will continue to address climate change through careful, cost-effective rulemakings that focus on the largest pollution sources and volun - tary programs that encourage businesses to cut carbon pollution. The President's Climate Action Plan focuses on three areas: cutting carbon pollu-tion; preparing the Nation for the impacts of cli-mate change that cannot be avoided; and leading international efforts to address climate change. EPA plays an important role in the plan by set - ting carbon dioxide (CO 2) standards for power plants and heavy duty trucks, and in partnership with other agencies, taking other actions to ad - dress hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and methane. The Budget supports implementation of green-house gas standards by the States, who will be close partners in successful reduction of carbon pollution from power plants. EPA also has a role in preparing the Nation for the unavoidable im - pacts of climate change, including through tech - nical assistance to communities and by integrat - ing considerations of climate change impacts and adaptive measures into existing programs.Builds a High Performing Environmental Protection Enterprise Redesigns how EPA does Business. Strengthening the partnership with States and increasing the efficiency of EPA's core functions are both key to building a high performing en - vironmental protection enterprise. EPA will re- design its business processes, including contracts and grants management, the regulation devel - opment process, and records management, and implement approaches such as strategic sourcing in order to increase EPA's effectiveness in an en - vironment of constrained resources. This rede- sign effort has been largely developed through an EPA-State workgroup. At the center of EPA's redesign effort is E-Enterprise. Through E-Enterprise, EPA will modernize business processes and systems to re - duce reporting burden on States and regulated facilities and improve the effectiveness and ef - ficiency of regulatory programs for EPA, States, and Tribes. The Budget includes an additional $7 million to support the e-Manifest program to provide information on hazardous waste ship - ments electronically, rather than the current cumbersome, paper-based approach. When fully implemented, the e-Manifest program will result in annual savings of $75 million for over 146,000 waste handlers. Modernizes EPA's Workforce.

They create two out of every three net new jobs in the United States and half of all working Americans own, or are employed, by a small business. The Small Business Administration's (SBA) mission is to help Americans start, build, and grow businesses, which in turn fuels the growth of a strong middle class. To achieve this mission, the Budget pro - vides $710 million through appropriations and an additional $155 million in disaster relief fund - ing. Small business loan guarantees are funded at levels sufficient to meet expected demand, but continue at a reduced subsidy cost relative to the 2014 enacted level, largely due to improv - ing economic conditions and lower estimated loan defaults. The savings realized through lower credit subsidy costs allow investments to be made in SBA's technical assistance programs and other initiatives aimed at growing America's small businesses, thus delivering impact to more communities across the United States. Provides Small Businesses with Access to Capital and Disaster Assistance Spurs Economic Growth and Job Creation by Providing Access to Capital. To encourage economic growth and job creation, the Budget pro - vides $47.5 million in subsidy for SBA's business loan programs. This funding supports $17.5 bil - lion in 7(a) loan guarantees for operating expens - es and other purposes, which supports more than 45,000 loans to help small businesses operate and grow their businesses; $7.5 billion in guaranteed lending under the 504 Certified Development Company (CDC) program to finance more than 10,000 loans to small businesses for commercial real estate development and heavy machinery purchases; and $25 million in direct microloans to assist more than 3,500 small businesses in get - ting started and expanding. In addition, the Budget supports guarantees for the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program at the program level of $4 billion at no cost to the taxpayer, to enable SBICs to contin - ue to invest in high-growth and impact-oriented small businesses that create jobs and strengthen communities, as well as to support early financing of innovative startups via the Impact Investment Fund and the Early-Stage Innovation Fund. Within these funds, the Budget also includes an emphasis on supporting lending to young and in- novative U.S. manufacturing firms to enable their scale-up to a full commercial production facility. Strengthens U.S. Manufacturing and Innovation. In addition to the efforts within ex - isting SBIC funds, the Budget also calls on the Congress to work together with the President to launch a public-private investment fund as part of the Administration's manufacturing initiative. This will help emerging advanced manufacturing technologies reach commercial viability, ensur - ing that if a technology is invented in the United States, it can be made in the United States. To address the gap in financing for these new man - ufacturing firms, the Budget proposes, in the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, a fund of funds to support transformative manufac-turing technologies in the United States by help - ing entrepreneurial firms secure capital to scale from idea to prototype and into full commercial production. Once fully deployed, this fund could eventually leverage up to $10 billion in total public-private investment to build first-of-a-kind manufacturing production capabilities here.Reforms: Creates a single, streamlined application for SBA loan products called SBA ONE, which will reduce the time and cost for lenders to process loans and encourage lenders to make more loans.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 147 Waives Fees for Small Dollar and Veteran- Owned Business Loans. The Budget waives fees on loans of $150,000 and less in SBA's 7(a) loan program to promote lending to small busi - nesses that face the greatest constraints on credit access. For veteran-owned businesses, upfront fees are fully waived on all 7(a) SBA Express loans up to $350,000 and waived by 50 percent for all non-SBA Express loans above $150,000 to support the entrepreneurial efforts of veterans, a group comprised of individuals who are well-positioned to be successful entrepreneurs as they transition from their military careers to working as a civilian. Expands Refinancing Opportunities for Sm all Bus inesses. Con sistent with the Administration's plan to help responsible home - owners refinance their mortgages, the Budget proposes to reauthorize the 504 Loan Refinancing program through September 30, 2015, to provide up to $7.5 billion in guaranteed loans. The suc - cessful program, originally established in 2010, has been temporarily suspended since its autho - rization expired at the end of 2012, and will re - sume at no cost to taxpayers. This will help small businesses lock in low, long-term interest rates on commercial mortgage and equipment debts and free up resources that can be re-invested in their businesses. Fully Funds Disaster Assistance Loans. SBA's Disaster Loan Program provides low-in-terest disaster loans to homeowners, renters, and businesses of all sizes whose property is damaged or destroyed in a disaster. The Budget supports more than $1 billion in direct disaster assistance loans for 2015, the normalized 10-year average demand for these loans. In the continued wake of Hurricane Sandy and to prepare for future ma - jor disasters, the Budget provides $187 million for loan administrative expenses to operate the Disaster Loans Program. Of this total, $155 mil- lion is designated as qualifying disaster funding under the Budget Control Act's cap adjustment.Streamlines and Simplifies Loan Applications for SBA Lenders. The Budget supports SBA ONE, a reformed lending platform that will streamline and simplify the loan pro- cess by using one set of forms for all 7(a) loans. The platform will serve as a single entry point for all steps of the loan process, from determin - ing eligibility through closing out the loan, and provide one data management system to measure and evaluate loan trends and performance. SBA ONE will simplify the lending process by lower - ing the cost of underwriting small dollar loans, thereby increasing the expected total number of lenders offering SBA financing and expanding small business access to capital. Fosters Entrepreneurship and Expands Opportunities for Small Business Growth Invests in Small Business Leadership Program. The Budget provides $15 million to expand the Emerging Leaders program, an en- trepreneurial education initiative, to 1,750 more small business owners who have growth poten - tial. The program has a proven track record of helping small businesses in increasing their reve - nue, creating jobs, and spurring economic growth in their communities. The expanded program will become a public-private partnership to support a small business leadership model built on the best practices of private sector and non-profit models. Invests in Entrepreneurship Training for America's Transitioning Veterans. The Budget provides $7 million to support SBA's Boots to Business initiative, which is expected to reach an estimated 25,000 veterans across all military branches and build upon SBA's successful pilot program that provides veterans transitioning to civilian life with the training and tools they need to start their own businesses. Supports Entrepreneurship Counseling and Regional Economic Development. The Budget includes $198 million for SBA's technical assistance programs, including $114 million for 148 SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 63 Small Business Development Center grants to support 940 locations and $20 million in tech-nical assistance for microloan programs, to help businesses get started. The Budget also includes $5 million for SBA's growth accelerators pro - gram and $6 million for the Regional Innovation Clusters program, which help connect small busi-nesses with universities, venture capitalists, and regional industry leaders to leverage a region's unique assets to turn entrepreneurial ideas into sustainable high-growth small businesses. Provides a One-Stop Shop for Federal Business Assistance Resources. The Budget provides $6 million for SBA's contribution to BusinessUSA, a one-stop shop for businesses looking for assistance from, or business oppor - tunities with, the Federal Government. In 2015, SBA will continue scaling BusinessUSA into a robust, customer friendly system that supports U.S. small businesses and exporters to access the broad range of Federal, State, and local business- facing resources. As the website continues to mature, BusinessUSA will further enhance the customer experience by incorporating a more personalized web design that will adapt the lay - out presented to users based on their preferenc - es. BusinessUSA will also aim to create a leaner, more performance-focused website, enabling SBA to more closely monitor small business trends and increase relevant content on the website. BusinessUSA will seek to achieve interoperabil - ity across all platforms, browsers, and operating systems. BusinessUSA also plans to upgrade the Content Management System, allowing bet - ter maintenance and management of the con - tent presented to website users. In addition, BusinessUSA will ensure that only the best and most relevant content is integrated into the site by assigning subject matter experts from other agencies to manage key business areas such as taxes and healthcare.149Funding Highlights: Provides $12.1 billion in funding for the operations of the Social Security Administration to provide services to the American public, including workers, retirees, surviving spouses and children, and people with disabilities. This includes: |Investing in customer service, including $100 million in a new modernization initiative to improve online and in-person services; and |Establishing a dependable mandatory source of funding for Continuing Disability Reviews and Supplemental Security Income Redeterminations, which reduce program costs and enhance program integrity by ensuring that only those eligible for benefits receive them. Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative: Through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, supports: |Expanding on the new customer service modernization initiative, investing an additional $150 million to further reduce wait times and enhance services for the public. Reforms: Funds pilot projects to test innovative strategies to help people with disabilities remain in the workforce, in partnership with other Federal agencies. Prevents duplicative or excessive benefit payments through a series of targeted reforms.SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION The Social Security Administration (SSA) ad - ministers the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. The President believes that Social Security is critical to en-suring that all Americans have the opportunity to retire with dignity and that Americans with disabilities do not have to experience economic hardship. To fund this commitment, the Budget includes $12.1 billion for SSA operations. The Budget also supports pilot programs to improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities and enhancements to program integrity. Protects Social Security for Future Generations The President believes that Social Security is indispensable to workers, retirees, survivors, and people with disabilities and that it is one of 150 SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION the most important and successful programs ever established in the United States. Although cur - rent forecasts indicate that Social Security can pay full benefits until 2033, the Administration is committed to making sure that the program is sol - vent and viable for the American people, now and in the future. The President is strongly opposed to privatizing Social Security and looks forward to working in a bipartisan way to strengthen the program for future generations. Improves Customer Service. As part of the Administration's second term management agen - da's focus on improving key citizen- and business-facing transactions, the Budget includes $100 million for a new customer service modernization initiative to significantly improve internet and in-person services at SSA. These investments will save time for the agency as well as for the public. In addition, the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes $150 million in addi - tional funding to further reduce wait times and enhance services for the public. Enhances Program Integrity in Disability Programs and Pilots Pro \u00ad Work Interventions Reduces Program Costs by Providing Reliable Funding for Program Integrity Work. The Budget proposes to establish a de- pendable source of mandatory funding in 2016 for Continuing Disability Reviews (CDRs) and SSI Redeterminations, which ensure that only those eligible for benefits continue to receive them. SSA estimates that each $1 spent on CDRs would save the Federal Government $9. SSA could save an estimated $35 billion over 10 years through this proposal and reduce the current backlog of 1.3 million overdue CDRs. Prevents Duplicative or Excessive Benefit Payments. The Budget enhances collection of delinquent debts owed to the Government by applying the Treasury Offset Program to retro - active Disability Insurance (DI) payments, and proposes to automate coordination of disability benefit payments between the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and SSA, which would sub - stantially reduce overpayments. Further, the Budget proposes to reduce an individual's DI benefit in any month in which that person also receives a State or Federal unemployment bene - fit. In addition, the Budget proposes to eliminate aggressive Social Security claiming strategies, which allow upper-income beneficiaries to ma - nipulate the timing of collection of Social Security benefits in order to maximize delayed retirement credits. Improves Tax Administration by Restruc - turing Federal Wage Reporting. The Budget proposes to restructure the Federal wage report - ing process by moving from annual to quarterly wage reporting. Increasing the timeliness of wage reporting will enhance tax administration and improve program integrity for a range of pro-grams. The Administration will work with States to ensure that the overall reporting burden on employers is not increased. The Budget also proposes to lower the Electronic Wage Reporting Threshold for W-2s/W-3s from 250 employees to 25. The vast majority of employers with between 25 and 250 employees already choose to report electronically. Tests New Ways to Boost Employment. The Budget provides new authority and $400 million in new resources for SSA, in partnership with other Federal agencies, to test innovative strate - gies to help people with disabilities remain in the workforce. Early-intervention measures, such as supportive employment services for individuals with mental impairments, targeted incentives for employers to help workers with disabilities remain on the job, and incentives and opportu - nities for States to better coordinate services, have the potential to achieve long-term gains in the employment and the quality of life of people with disabilities, and the proposed demonstra - tion authority will help build the evidence base for future program improvements. The cost of the demonstrations could be offset by the proposal to automate coordination of disability benefit pay - ments between OPM and SSA and other program integrity measures.151Funding Highlights: Provides $1.05 billion for the Corporation for National and Community Service to support efforts to address national and local challenges. This includes: |Supporting the service of a record 114,000 AmeriCorps members across the United States, and encouraging people of all ages and backgrounds to serve; and |Investing in promising new approaches to major community challenges through the Social Innovation Fund, and continuing to allow the use of up to 20 percent of the funds for Pay for Success projects. Reforms: Incorporates the Senior Companion and Foster Grandparent models into AmeriCorps to achieve administrative efficiencies, increase competition, and more effectively engage older Americans in national service. Integrates RSVP , a program that supports senior volunteer opportunities, into the Volunteer Generation Fund to improve the Corporation for National and Community Service's ability to support older Americans in volunteer activities.CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE Through national service, volunteering, and other forms of civic participation, millions of Americans each year help to address the Nation's greatest challenges, accelerate economic re - covery, and strengthen our communities. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) provides opportunities for Americans of all ages to serve their community and country in sustained and effective ways, from tutoring at-risk youth to responding to natural disasters to building homes for low-income families. Many of the most creative solutions to America's chal - lenges have been developed at the grassroots level in cities and towns across the Nation, where citizens work hand in hand to make a difference. The Budget proposes $1.05 billion for CNCS, which reflects the Administration's continu - ing commitment to providing opportunities for Americans to address local challenges through service. Invests in Community Solutions Supports National Service. The Budget supports a record 114,000 AmeriCorps members, 34,000 more members than projected for 2014. These members support the efforts of nonprofit organizations to address a wide range of critical 152 CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE community challenges, from disaster response to homelessness to low-performing schools. The Budget encourages people of all ages and back - grounds to serve in AmeriCorps, and provides more positions for disconnected and low-income youth that can serve as pathways to higher edu - cation and employment. The Budget maximizes the total number of members by providing only the education awards and loan forgiveness bene- fits for programs in which another entity pays the full cost of the members' service stipends. The Budget uses these savings to expand opportuni-ties for others to serve. Engages Older Americans in High-Impact Service. The Budget simplifies and maximiz - es the impact of national service programs by transitioning the Senior Companion and Foster Grandparent models to AmeriCorps and expand - ing the Volunteer Generation Fund to support the most competitive RSVP grantees. These reforms will support an over 40 percent expansion in the number of AmeriCorps members and align and integrate CNCS's service and volunteering pro - grams. The Administration continues to believe strongly in the value of engaging older Americans in addressing the needs of their communities and will preserve this commitment in its implementa - tion of this reform. In 2015, the AmeriCorps pro - gram will surpass the goal of reserving at least 10 percent of member positions for seniors, as es - tablished in the 2009 Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. This reform will continue CNCS's efforts to ensure that all national service pro - grams are competitive, effective, and accountable for achieving results, which has become a central focus of the AmeriCorps program.Increases Capacity of Nonprofits to Support Volunteers. The Budget provides approximately $19 million for the Volunteer Generation Fund. The Fund will focus on strengthening the ability of nonprofits and other organizations to recruit, retain, and manage vol - unteers, especially senior volunteers. In particu - lar, the Fund will support organizations as they help volunteers build skills and match volunteers with opportunities that take advantage of their existing skills. Invests in Evidence-Based and Innovative Solutions. Nonprofits cannot seed and scale effective innovative solutions to critical national challenges without adequate capital to develop, evaluate, and replicate what works. The Budget invests $70 million in the Social Innovation Fund (SIF) to test promising new approaches to major challenges, leverage private and philanthropic capital to meet these needs, and expand evidence- based programs that demonstrate measurable outcomes. The Budget continues to allow the use of up to 20 percent of SIF funds to support Pay for Success projects. Pay for Success models leverage philanthropic and private dollars to fund services up front, with the Government paying only after they generate results. This funding level also includes $4 million for a pilot to improve grant - ee access to State and Federal administrative data. This investment has the potential to make it easier and less costly for grantees to track performance, conduct rigorous evaluation, and demonstrate measurable impact.153As part of the President's Management Agenda, the Administration will build upon the successful efforts started in the first term to maximize the val- ue of every taxpayer dollar while increasing pro- ductivity and the quality of services. The Budget continues efforts from the Presi- dent's first-term Campaign to Cut Waste, such as reducing administrative overhead, cutting improper payments, saving on real estate costs, reforming military acquisition, and consolidating data centers. Further detail on these initiatives is provided in the Creating a 21 st Century Government chapter. The Budget also continues efforts to reorganize and consolidate Federal programs to reduce du - plication and improve efficiency. The President is again asking the Congress to revive an authority that Presidents had for almost the entire period from 1932 through 1984\u2014the ability to submit proposals to reorganize the Executive Branch via a fast-track procedure. In effect, the President is asking to have the same authority that any business owner has to reorganize or streamline operations to meet chang- ing circumstances and customer demand. The Budget specifically proposes a fresh Gov- ernment-wide reorganization of science, technol - ogy, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) edu- cation programs designed to enable more strategic investment in STEM education and more critical evaluation of outcomes. In 2012, there were more than 200 STEM education programs across Gov- ernment. Already, a substantial number of program consolidations and eliminations have been imple - mented or will be completed in 2014, through ac-tions by the Congress or internal consolidations or eliminations undertaken by the Administration. The Budget continues to reduce STEM fragmenta -tion by proposing 31 additional program consolida - tions or eliminations, and focuses ongoing efforts around the five key areas identified by the Federal STEM Education 5-Year Strategic Plan. The Budget also continues to target unnecessary or lower priority programs for reduction or elimi - nation. For example, at the Department of De- fense, based on recommendations from uniformed military leadership, the Budget would cancel the Ground Combat Vehicle Program, which is no lon- ger needed under the current defense strategy, sav- ing $51 million in 2015. The Budget would also close or consolidate 250 offices at the Department of Agriculture as part of streamlining Farm Service Agency operations that would save a total of $39 million in 2015. In each of the President's first three Budgets, the Administration identified, on average, more than 150 terminations, reductions, and savings proposals, totaling nearly $25 billion each year. In the 2013 and 2014 Budgets, the Administration detailed more than 200 cuts, consolidations, and savings proposals, again totaling roughly $25 billion each year. This year's Budget shows the tradeoffs and choices the Administration is making to adhere to the funding levels established in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. It includes 136 cuts, consolidations, and sav - ings proposals, which are projected to save nearly $17 billion in 2015. The cuts, consolidation, and savings proposals this year reflect the deep spend - ing reductions that occurred in 2013, some of which have continued in 2014, and the fact that many of the Administration's previous cuts, consolidations, and savings proposals have now been implemented. Dis - cretionary and mandatory cuts, consolidations, and savings proposals in this year's Budget are detailed on the following tables, as well as internal efficien -CUTS, CONSOLIDATIONS, AND SAVINGS154 CUTS, CONSOLIDATIONS, AND SAVINGS cies agencies are undertaking that require no further action by the Congress, many of which were sug - gested through the President's SA VE Award program. Savings from the Administration's program integ - rity proposals, totaling $99 billion through 2024, are detailed in the Budget Process chapter of the Analyt - ical Perspectives volume. As these tables show, the Budget includes a robust package of proposals that modify Medicare provider payments totaling about $354 billion over the next 10 years. These include a number of measures detailed in Table S-9 (see Sum-mary Tables section of this volume), including a pro- posal to align Medicare drug payment policies with Medicaid rebate policies for low-income beneficia - ries, reducing the net cost of this valuable benefit. This change alone will save about $117 billion over the next 10 years. The Budget takes other critical steps to save money, such as preventing individuals from collecting disability and unemployment ben- efits for the same period of time. This reform will save $3.2 billion over 10 years.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 155 DISCRETIONARY CUTS, CONSOLIDATIONS, AND SAVINGS (Budget authority in millions of dollars) 2014 20152015 Change from 2014 Cuts 317 Immunization Program, Department of Health and Human Services ........................................................................................... 612 561 -51 Access to Recovery, Department of Health and Human Services ...................................................................................................... 50 ......... -50 Area Health Education Centers, Department of Health and Human Services .................................................................................... 30 ......... -30 Beach Grants, Environmental Protection Agency ................................................................................................................................ 10 ......... -10 Brownfields Projects, Environmental Protection Agency ..................................................................................................................... 90 85 -5 C-130 Avionics Modernization, Department of Defense .................................................................................................................... 47 ......... -47 Capacity Building, Department of Housing and Urban Development .................................................................................................. 35 20 -15 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Direct Healthcare Screenings, Department of Health and Human Services ................. 251 209 -42 Christopher Columbus Fellowship Foundation 1 ................................................................................................................................... ......... ......... .........

The budget estimates do include $150 billion in temporary revenues that would be generated by the transition to a reformed business tax system, shown as part of the proposal to reauthorize surface transportation above.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 201 Table S-10.

The levels shown here for the non-defense category do not include the reclassification of surface transportation programs shown later in the table. 2 The 2015 Budget provides a detailed request for 2015 at the cap levels provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA). The Budget also proposes for 2015 an Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative to provide investments in both defense and non-defense programs; these amounts are not programmatically allocated. 3 Where applicable, amounts in 2013 through 2024 are existing or proposed cap adjustments designated pursuant to Section 251(b)(2) of BBEDCA, as amended. The 2015 Budget proposes new cap adjustments for program integrity and wildfire suppression activities. For 2016 through 2024, the cap adjustment levels for wildfire suppression are a placeholder that increase at the policy growth rates in the President's Budget. The existing disaster relief cap adjustment ceiling (which is determined one year at a time) would be reduced by the amount provided for wildfire suppression activities under the cap adjustment for the preceding fiscal year . The amounts will be refined in subsequent Budgets as data on the average costs for wildfire suppression are updated annually. 4 Because the Administration has not yet made final decisions about an enduring presence in Afghanistan after calendar year 2014, the Budget includes a placeholder for the Department of Defense's 2015 OCO funding, equivalent to the amount requested in the 2014 Budget. Once DOD's OCO needs for 2015 are determined, the Administration will transmit a budget amendment package. 5 The 2015 Budget includes placeholder amounts of nearly $30 billion per year for Government-wide OCO funding from 2016 to 2021. These amounts reflect the Administration's proposal to cap total OCO budget authority from 2013 to 2021 at $450 billion but do not reflect any specific decisions or assumptions about OCO funding in any particular year.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 203 Table S-11.

In addition, 2013 levels include the effects of the March 1, 2013 Joint Committee sequestration reductions. 2 The Department of Defense (DOD) levels in 2016-2024 include funding that will be allocated, in annual increments, to the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Current estimates by which DOD's budget authority will decrease and NNSA's will increase are, NNSA's outyear requirements and these will be included in future reports to the Congress. 3 Funding from the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds for administrative expenses incurred by the Social Security Administration that support the Medicare program are included in the Health and Human Services total and not in the Social Security Administration total. 4 The 2015 Budget provides a detailed request for 2015 at the cap levels provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA). The Budget also proposes for 2015 an Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative to provide investments in both defense and non-defense programs; these amounts are not programmatically allocated. 5 The 2015 Budget includes allowances, similar to the Function 920 allowances used in Budget Resolutions, to represent amounts to be allocated among the respective agencies to reach the proposed defense and non-defense caps for 2016 and beyond. These levels are determined for illustrative purposes but do not reflect specific policy decisions. 6 Where applicable, amounts in 2013 through 2024 are existing or proposed cap adjustments designated pursuant to Section 251(b)(2) of the BBEDCA, as amended. 7 Because the Administration has not yet made final decisions about an enduring presence in Afghanistan after calendar year 2014, the Budget includes a placeholder for the Department of Defense's 2015 OCO funding, equivalent to the amount requested in the 2014 Budget. Once DOD's OCO needs for 2015 are determined, the Administration will transmit a budget amendment package. 8 The 2015 Budget includes placeholder amounts of $29.9 billion per year for Government-wide OCO funding from 2016 to 2021. These amounts reflect the Administration's proposal to cap total OCO budget authority from 2013 to 2021 at $450 billion but do not reflect any specific decisions or assumptions about OCO funding in any particular year. 9 For 2016 through 2024, the cap adjustment levels are a placeholder that increase at the policy growth rates in the President's Budget. The existing disaster relief cap adjustment ceiling (which is determined one year at a time) would be reduced by the amount provided for wildfire suppression activities under the cap adjustment for the preceding fiscal year. Those amounts will be refined in subsequent Budgets as data on the average costs for wildfire suppression are updated annually. 206 SUMMARY TABLES Table S-12.

An increase in checks outstanding (which is a liability) is also a means of financing a deficit and therefore also has a negative sign. 2 Includes checks outstanding, accrued interest payable on Treasury debt, uninvested deposit fund balances, allocations of special drawing rights, and other liability accounts; and, as an offset, cash and monetary assets (other than the Treasury operating cash balance), other asset accounts, and profit on sale of gold. 3 Consists mainly of debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank (which is not subject to limit), Treasury securities held by the Federal Financing Bank, the unamortized discount (less premium) on public issues of Treasury notes and bonds (other than zero-coupon bonds), and the unrealized discount on Government account series securities. 4 Legislation enacted February 15, 2014, (P.L. 113-83) temporarily suspends the debt limit through March 15, 2015. 5 Treasury securities held by the public and zero-coupon bonds held by Government accounts are almost all measured at sales price plus amortized discount or less amortized premium. Agency debt securities are almost all measured at face value. Treasury securities in the Government account series are otherwise measured at face value less unrealized discount (if any). 6 At the end of 2013, the Federal Reserve Banks held $2,072.3 billion of Federal securities and the rest of the public held $9,910.3 billion. Debt held by the Federal Reserve Banks is not estimated for future years.209OMB CONTRIBUTORS TO THE 2015 BUDGET The following personnel contributed to the preparation of this publication.
