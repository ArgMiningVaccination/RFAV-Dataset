Register data will be added to the service. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, Business Finland and the Social and Health Data Permit Authority Findata are involved in the development of the Fingenious\u00ae service. 'The aim is to increase health and biomedical research in Finland - and particularly the secondary use of information - by enabling different kinds of register studies,' explains Marco Hautalahti, CEO of FINBB. Secondary use of data means the use of client and register data in social welfare and health care for purposes other than the primary purpose for which they were originally stored. 'The Fingenious\u00ae service benefits the entire Finnish health sector ecosystem and an expanding number of Finnish analytics, research and service companies,' Hautalahti continues. Currently, the participating biobanks are Auria Biobank, Helsinki Biobank, Eastern Finland Biobank Borealis, Tampere Biobank and THL Biobank. So far, the service has enabled as many as 400 research projects, and there are already over 500 researchers registered for the service. 'Through Fingenious\u00ae, biobank research has become easier and faster. It is a natural step to extend the service to other key information resources and Finnish analytics services,' says Senior Adviser Jukka L\u00e4hesmaa from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. Finland provides world-class analytical and expert services Finland has exceptionally comprehensive and high-quality information resources for its social and health care sector. The Act on Secondary Use of Data from 2019 enables not only research and statistics, but also innovation work and knowledge management. Data permits for register data are granted by the Social and Health Data Permit Authority Findata in accordance with the Act. 'Working on the basis of the one-stop-shop principle, Findata provides data permits and permit-based data collection for both public and private sector social welfare and health care data,' explains Findata Director Johanna Sepp\u00e4nen, whose organisation is involved in the cooperation. 'Biobanks and secondary use offer Finnish service companies a significant international business opportunity that is already showing signs of traction in the pharmaceutical industry,' adds Sampo Sammalisto from Business Finland. The Fingenious\u00ae service will be developed in 2021-2022 through a secondary ecosystem development project. The project is funded by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and coordinated by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). The service is owned by the Finnish Biobank Cooperative (FINBB). 'Finland has all the prerequisites for providing world-class analytical and expert services based on the scientific utilisation of extensive data resources and sample data for customers such as international innovative pharmaceutical industries. Taking hold of this opportunity requires vision, cooperation and courage, and so this is the spirit in which we are setting out to build the Fingenious\u00ae ecosystem together with our partners,' summarises Terhi Kilpi, Assistant Director General of Research, Development and Innovation at THL.
