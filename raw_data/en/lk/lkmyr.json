Such networks allow consumers and providers to discover, identify each other and perform transactions with each other without the need for a central intermediary. It can be thought of as a common set of rules of communication mutually agreed upon by several platforms to allow their users to perform discovery, ordering, fulfilment and post-fulfilment activities between each other in a standard way. It is a sector-agnostic protocol, meaning, any industry-specific taxonomy or knowledge model can be represented using the data model of beckn protocol. build with beckn beckn protocol's layered design allows independent evolution of its components. it allows building of rich integrated experiences in consumer applications while simultaneously allows independent services to be built and plugged into the open network infrastructure.
