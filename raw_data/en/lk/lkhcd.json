Following the fire that destroyed the first Goetheanum building in Dornach, Switzerland, Steiner had focused his efforts on rebuilding and reorganizing the Anthroposophical Society. But he also continued to travel and speak to the public--in Prague, Vienna, and Basel--to explain the purpose of the Goetheanum and to elucidate the broader aims of his spiritual work. These lectures, including a semi-public series in Dornach, are collected here in English for the first time, along with an introduction, notes and index. This volume is a translation from German of Was wollte das Goetheanum und was soll die Anthroposophie? (GA 84). "}
