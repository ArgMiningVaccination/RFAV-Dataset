Individualized treatments to fit your unique needs. TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE We at the Acupuncture & Integrative Wellness Center combine Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and current scientific knowledge to offer an array of traditional and modern modalities to accommodate the needs of our patients. TCM integrates many therapies, and is applied by practitioners to treat illness and pain. ACUPUNCTURE Acupuncture can be used as an alternative way to treat a wide variety of conditions. Each person is composed of bio-energetic systems, and when these systems become unbalanced, pain or illness result. Acupuncture is used to treat this energy imbalance by inserting fine, flexible needles at specific points in the body along the energetic pathways that lead to the organs, muscles, and nerves. Most people find that their problems are relieved rapidly by acupuncture, but the longer you have been suffering, the longer it will take to feel some relief. INTEGRATIVE WELLNESS Integrative medicine is a healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the whole person, (body, mind, spirit) including all aspects of their lifestyle. We are trained in a variety of techniques, including but not limited to; acupuncture, tui na massage, cupping, graston, athletic taping, and Chinese herbal medicines. Integrative wellness means incorporating change into your entire lifestyle, and influencing patients to commit to the process of self-exploration and self-development . We will help you get there! TUI NA Tui Na is a type of Chinese medical massage that can be used to treat a wide variety of health complaints. To enhance the healing process, Tui Na is used in conjunction with herbal medicine and acupuncture. Tui Na resembles a sports medicine massage, in that it can both be used as a preventative treatment, and it hastens the healing process for those areas already in disrepair. Acupressure is applied by hand to directly affect the flow of energy, or Qi, at the different points in the body.
