Greetings from the President \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved www.vegheaded.blogspot.com Just felt like sharing a little insight into my world ... Michele A. Miller -Clarke 4 Kelly Holland Azzaro Greetings from the President Communication Styles -walk your talk or better yet, save on gas, time and money! Another fun, going -green option is offering online classes, workshops and courses. I personally have tested the waters with offering my first online course and I have to say I love it! It offers me a way to reach students from Florida and even Canada. I really enjoy this option and I was able to mail the stu- dents their essential oil testers to use during online classes. Its true that they have expressed interest in getting together in person for future classes, but in the meantime we are building a strong founda- tion in their studies. Tele-seminars, online courses and web -inars is the wave of the future in regards to opening another level of communication via t he internet and one that eliminates the added expense of travel, gas, time, missed work and packing bags. Many businesses and in di- viduals are offering free tele -classes and online courses as a way to reach many people all over the world. Its an amazing tool for expanding your education network and to meet new people. Still, with Aromatherapy, nothing can replace the in -class style of tea ch- ing and that allows for experiencing the wide array of scent the each essential oil has to offer. Meeting people in person an d enjoying making new friends and business contacts is also a benefit that many seek out by way of group events, classes and seminars. I have had the most wonderful opportunity during my years as volunteer for NAHA as a board member to have international and n a- tional communications with fellow Aromatherapists through email. And even those I have not met in person feel like been lifet ime friends. The bridges that have been built and the immense amount of shared communication and educational awareness would not have occurred during a class or attending an event. This type of quality sharing will always be cherished and honored. Much of the data shared has been posted to the NAHA website so that the membership and general public has access to the vast knowledge shared by such generous educators and fellow professionals. Check the NAHA website monthly for continued updates to the Aromatherapy sections and check the Announcement section for membership and book specials. If you would like to contribut e to the NAHA website or submit an article, research, personal story or aromatic poem for the Journal, please visit the NAHA Write rs Guidelines http://www.naha.org/writers.htm for more details. This is an avenue to contribute and share with others. Its another way to walk your talk! Aromas that support opening, removing blockages and bringing balance in communication between body -mind -spirit: A Basic First Aid Kit for the Soul. Frankincense (Boswellia carteri) : used in many ancient traditions in the form of incense for purification, cleansing and meditation. Many find this essential oil useful when working with people who are dealing with grief, despair and sadness. Inhaling a drop or two allows one to find a space of calm and the possibility of being open to expressing blocked emotions. In Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine Theory, grief belongs to the lung meridian; despair and sadness the Heart Meridian. Allowing the heart to heal from long time grieving helps the body can communicate with the emotions and then the emotions can communicate with spirit. Rose ( Rosa damascena ): The flower that symbolizes love and joy. Inhale a drop of rose oil and allow joy to enter the heart once again. Lemon (Citrus limon): Inhale this fresh tangy and tart aroma and you cant help but be transported to a clear state of mind. Who wouldnt want increased alertness, focused energy and clear thought? In TCM theory, lemon is a wonderful cleanser for the Liver Meridian or for Liver Qi Stagnation. This type of blockage can manifest in the emotional imbalance of anger, impatience and frustration often translating into the physical body sensation of poor sleep with \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved Photo By Todd Bush 5 nightmares, headaches, indigestion and hormonal imbalance. Start you day with a cup of room temperature distilled water and f resh squeezed lemon juice. Youll perk up your taste buds, start the digestive process and allow your body to communicate to your mind that its time to start a fresh new day! Peppermint (Mentha piperita): Ah the great tummy oil. Nausea, travel sickness and dizziness can be experienced when the body is not communicating with what the internal eye perceives. You may have experienced this during a car ride when the driver is fine, yet the passenger is rolling down the window trying to cool off or, worse, vomiting. Travel by boat or plane for some can be even worse. Just the thought of it makes me queasy. Bring on the peppermint! If you did not pack your travel bag with essen- tial oils try using a breath mint or having a cup of peppermint tea soothing to the stomach and the weary traveler. Peppermint tea in the mornings with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice makes a perfect mix for getting the stomach/spl een me- ridian Qi flowing! Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) : The great angelic oil of all oils. One of the most popular and widely used oils, Lavender is truly one essential oil you dont want to be without. The aroma can soothe, comfort and energize with just a single inhalation of one drop. Lavender will sooth a tired body, bring comfort at the end of a long day and even help with a little grounded energy boost when kidney meridian energetics are on overdrive from chronic anxiety, fear and tension. Calling all angels to the rescue, Lavender is sure to help during times of apprehension, when feeling overwhelmed or uncertain. A few drops in a warm bath or foot soak is a simple and easy way to send a message to your body to relax, breathe and let go. Used in an aromatic massage to lower back, feet and ankles L aven- der brings a sure way to balance this meridian channel allowing for courage and acceptance to conquer fear and burnout of bod y, mind and spirit. So there you have it: a basic and simple kit with essential oils of Frankincense, Lavender, Lemon, Peppermint and Rose. These five oils are easy to use for balance of body -mind and spirit. Wonderful communication by aromas is just a whiff away! Speaking of Important Communications and Walking your Talk: Please be sure to check out the information put forth by Donna Ma ria Coles Johnson of Indie Beauty Network http://www.indiebeautynetwork.com/media where you will find updates about the Coalitions efforts in supporting the small business owners that make, sell and purchase natural ingredients for their natural product busi- nesses. The FDA Globalization Act Petition documents and blog are also posted to their website. Please take the time to check out this important information and share it with others. I agree with Shellie's update and ask that you be a part of the flow of communication and support for protecting our rights as small business owners and creators of wonderful natural products. Greetings from the President \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 6 Greetings, There is a new administration coming to Washington and that gives some of us great hope, but while this could be a welcome ti me for the US to regain strength and restore the security of the common man, there are still plans afoot to remove the viability of owning a small cosmetic business and other moves to take our precious essential oils from us by proving them unsafe. We can choose to bury our heads and allow things to take their course or we can choose to stand up and be counted. As we have recently seen, stand- ing up has success, so I hope that all of us in the Aromatherapy community in the US and abroad will rally to the call of tho se who are working to insure that our aromatic rights are safe and our access to essential oils remains unhindered. In my personal opinion, one of these heroes is Tony Burfield and his agency Crop Watch. If you havent already seen his news letters, I heartily recommend that you subscribe and more than this, I hope you will choose to support Tony in his work by making a co ntribu- tion. Find him here: www.cropwatch.org . Tony is a regular contributor to the Safety section on our website and is a wonderful re- source for questions. He has a wealth of information that we may benefit from and his newsletter is a great way to stay in t ouch with breaking news. Another is Donna Maria Coles Johnson, a longstanding NAHA member, owner of Handmade Toiletries Network and a lawyer in Washington, DC. Donna contacted NAHA recently to say that The Indie Beauty Network is fighting draft legislation pending in the House Energy & Commerce Committee that would impose fees of up to $12,000 on cosmetics manufacturers. This could force the small cosmetic business owner out of business. She has devoted her energy to lobby against this and invites everyone who wou ld be affected by the fees to join the Micro Cosmetic Companies Coalition in their efforts to stand up to this threat. Find out more here: http://www.indiebeautynetwork.com/media/ . With Board permission, I have written to the NAHA Directors and asked them to distribute the information widely and I hope th at they have done this. I hope you will, too. But please understand that the opinion and plea I express in this letter is not an offi cial NAHA position, but my own desire for our community wake up and take action before its too late. Sounds dramatic, but the reality is that our aromatic way of life is being threatened. It is heartening to me to see people come forward to stand up for us and for the p lants them- selves. I hope you will be one of them! Blessings, Shellie SHELLIE ENTEEN Greetings from the President \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 7 MD3, HISTORY Perfume was first used by Egyptians in religious rituals by the burning of incense accounting for its Latin derivation, \" per fumum \" meaning through smoke. . Perfumed oils, balms and ointments were also applied to the skin for either cosmetic or medicinal purposes. The world's first perfume maker is considered to be a person named Tapputi , mentioned in a cuneiform tablet from the second millennium BC in Mesopotamia.[1] . During the Old and Middle Kingdoms, perfumes were reserved exclusively for religious rituals such as cleansing ceremonies. Then during the New Kingdom (1580 -1085 BC) they we re used during festivals and Egyptian women also used perfumed creams and oils as toiletries and cosmetics and as preludes to love -makin g. The use of perfume then spread to Greece, Rome, and the Islamic world. Ancient Indians have also mentioned elaborately the vario us fragrant pastes to be used during different seasons of the year to maintain a general well being 2 In seventeenth century, the use of perfume in France grew steadily and perfumed gloves became popular. The court of Louis XV was even named \"the perfumed court\" due to the scents which were applied daily to the skin and also to clothing, fans and furniture. The eighteenth century saw a revolutionary advance in perfumery with the invention of eau de Cologne, a blend of rosemary, ne roli, bergamot and lemon used in different ways: diluted in bath water, mixed with wine, eaten on a sugar lump, as a mouthwash, an enema or an ingredient for a poultice, and so on. The fine art of making perfumes may have developed in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt but was develo ped further, refined and made famous by the Romans and the Arabs. Recently, archaeologists have uncovered perfumes which are believed to be the world's oldest perfumes in Pyrgos , Cyprus . The perfumes date back more than 4,000 years.[3] In ancient times people used herbs and spices , like almond , coriander , myrtle , conifer resin , bergamot , but not flowers .[4] SOURCE OF PERFUMES Perfumes have been obtained from diverse sources such as animals which include musk, honeycomb, civet, ambergris and castoreu m; vari- ous parts of plants; and synthetic sources like coal tar, petroleum distillates and pine resins. The type of perfume can be i n the form of smoke by burning sandal wood and other trees, or the same wood can be used as an unctuous preparation as preferred by many Arabs an d Indians, or in a spray form. CONCENTRATON OF PERFUMES Perfume oil is diluted with solvents like ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water or jojoba , fractionated coconut oil or wax to avoid allergic reactions when applied.. The concentration by percent/volume of perfume oil is as follows: Perfume extract (Extract): 20% -40% (IFRA: -30% (typical ~15%) aromatic compounds Eau de Toilette (EdT): 5 -20% (typical ~10%) aromatic compounds Eau de Cologne (EdC): 2 -5% aromatic compounds As the percentage of aromatic compounds increases, so does the intensity and longevity of the scent created. Therefore, altho ugh the oil concentration of a perfume in Eau de Parfum (EdP) dilution will necessarily be higher than the same perfume in Eau de Toilette (EdT) . Health Issues Perfumes have numerous positive effects on the social and health life of any individual. However synthetic chemical constitue nts, not typically used in alternative medicines as a part of aromatherapy, can cause health problems. Since the mode of use of perfumes can be varied from something being applied to some being inhaled during spraying, a range of side -effects have been described. Allergic reactions Some fragrances can cause asthmatic reactions even when the participants could not actually smell the fragrances[5] . For instance, acetophenone , ethyl acetate and acetone while present in many perfumes, are also known or potential respiratory allergens . It is also true that sometimes inhalation alone can cause skin irritation[6]. Many fragrance ingredients can cause allergic skin reactions like allergic/ irritant contact and photocontact dermatitis.[6].Photoallergic contact dermatitis coumarin in musk perfumes.(7- 8) Pigmentary contact dermatitis is a distinctive pattern of dermatitis in far east due to perfumes. (9) Endocrine dysfunction There is scientific evidence that some common ingredients, like certain synthetic musks, can disrupt the balance of hormones in the human body (endocrine disruption)[10] [11] Synthetic Perfumes in Medicine and Dermatology From Saudi Arabia \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 8 Carcinogenesis especially in the case of the ubiquitous synthetic polycyclic molecules, assigned to the musk odor group). (12 -13) Atopic dermatitis Fabric softeners and fragrances added during washing of clothes may exacerbate atopic dermatitis. Ophthalmic Use of spray perfumes may cause eye allergies and other complications when directly sprayed. Adulteration Lead has been used in some smoky and oily perfumes to increase their weight. Lead poisoning can occur Intoxication Cologne is used in many houses and restaurants has been banned in supermarkets in Saudi Arabia as it was consumed by some teenagers in place of alcoholic beverages which is banned by Islamic law in the country. The perfume industry is not directly regulated for safety by the FDA in the US. Instead the FDA regulates the ingredients in the perfumes themselves and require that they be tested to the extent that they are Generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Protection of trade secrets pre- vents the listing of ingredients that might or might not be hazardous in perfumes. In Europe, the mandatory listing of any of a number of chemi- cals thought to be hazardous has just begun. Nevertheless these listing may themselves be misleading, since the harm presente d by many of these chemicals (either natural or synthetic) are dependent on environmental conditions. For instance, linalool, which must b e listed as an irritant, only causes skin irritation when it degrades to peroxides, and the use of antioxidants in perfumes could prevent th is. European ver- sions of some old favorite perfumes, like chypres and fougeres, which require the use of oakmoss extract, are being reformula ted because of these new regulations. REFERENCES 1.

It is used in cosmetic for oily skin and to cleanse and detoxify. In India a full body mask is applied on a bride before the marriage ceremony made up of Indian Chick Pea (very therapeutic) flour, Turmeric (haldi) and Sandalwood paste. The paste is used over the en- tire body and there is a special Pre - nuptial ceremony called the Haldi ceremony and the bride is made to sit with this mask on until it dries. She is then given a bath and the skin literally glows after this treatment and the texture is silky soft. We prepare a similar pack using a couple of drops of essential oils instead of the herb powders and the results are astounding. One can also use this in a clay mask. For this purpose the best oil to use is the Curcuma Aromatica (details given below) or the wild turmeric which does not give the strong yellow colour to the skin. Turmeric Oil is a thick yellow viscose oil. Curry powder owes its aromatic taste and smell to this oil. Its powder is sprinkled on ulcers to stimulate them to healthy action. In Ayurveda for shingles, a thick layer of mustard oil is first smeared on the affected part and then dusted on with Turmeric powder. Healing takes place within 3 -4 days. My Ayurveda Prof Dr P H Kulkarni always talks of how they managed to save a young ladys leg in Adelaide, with an incurable cancerous ulcer. There was talk of amputation by the medical profession- als. Poultices of turmeric powder were applied regularly for approximately six months. calls it \" the well wisher of Women \" as according to Ayurveda it can penetrate through the minute of channels and open up blockages. Turmeric is also used for small pox and chicken pox. It has an energising affect on the immune system and is being used to assist in some treatments of AIDS. It is a favourite with the food flavouring industry because of its bright yellow colour. It works as a blood thinner, purifier and helps to also coagulate blood. If s omeone has had a fall or an accident in India the person is made to immediately have Turmeric powder (1/2 a teaspoon) with sugar as it helps to dissolve any blood clots or prevent internal bleeding. It helps to coagulate the blood in bleeding occurring through an injury and therefore is valuable to have as part of your first aid kit. For a sore throat it is a common household remedy to ingest a little turmeric in warm milk with a little sugar . We have had a lot of suc- cess with different disorders and Turmeric as can be seen in a couple of case studies given below. An article was given on Turmeric in the Readers Digest recently and a friend sent a copy to me. It says, \"That a compound whi ch makes curries yellow could help inhibit skin cancer. US researchers have found that curcumin, the pungent yellow pigment found in turmeric and curry powder, stops laboratory strains of melanoma from proliferating. The University of Texas researchers added curcumin to lab grown mela noma cells to see if the spice could stop the cells from surviving and reproducing. The more curcumin they added to the melanoma, the more cells d ied. The research- ers believe that the curcumin could shut down a powerful protein that promotes an abnormal inflammatory response, which is be lieved to cause a variety of disorders, including arthritis and cancer. Human trials to test the ability of curcumin capsules to retard the growth of pancreatic cancer and multiple myeloma are unde rway and another trial into its effects on breast cancer is planned.\" No wonder at one stage the US wanted to patent this amazing belonging to the dicinnamoyl methane group. Anti -inflammatory activity of the active princi-TUMERIC Author: Farida Irani \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights 10 ple curcumin was similar to cortisone and phenylbutazone in carrageenin induced oedema in rats with an equivalent dose. Stabi lising effect on lysosomal membranes also has been reported. Application of Turmeric powder over septic as well as aseptic wounds in rats and rabbits ac- celerated the process of healing to the extent of 23% -24% in both the cases. Hepatoprotective effect of 50% ethanol extract of curcuma longa was shown in CCL induced liver lesions in mice and in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. (Selected Medicinal Plants of India: Chemexcil: 1992) Using just Turmeric oil also helps in wound healing as experienced by us several times. Therapeutic Value: Body : antibacterial, poor circulation, anaemia, stimulant, tonic, carminative cough, anthelmintic, diabetes (helps stabilise bloo d sugar) re- moves liver obstruction, dropsy, Jaundice, amenorrhoea, arthritis, ulcers, anti -inflammatory, blood seases, aids. Skin: antiseptic, ringworms, itching, eczema, parasitic skin diseases (excellent results combined with Neem), wounds, bruises, heating, moisturising, cleanser, detoxifier, oily skin. Mind / emotions : grounding, confusion, anxiety. We also have another variety of turmeric called wild turmeric or Curcuma called Vanaharidra/ Jungli Haldi/Ambe It has similar uses to that of Curcuma Longa. It is ideal to use in skin masks, blends, facial and moisturiser blends as it does not have the intense yellow colour like Curcum Longa and therefore does not stain clothes or skin! It is highly effective in assisting in respiratory disorders. It is useful in snake bites and as an application to sprains and bruises. Therapeutically it is similar to Curcuma Longa especially in skin and respiratory disorders. We use the Wild turmeric in a lot of facial blends as it is great for the skin balances the sebaceous glands and gives a glow to the complexion without turning it yellow. It is also excellent for blemishes and acne. Chemical Constituents: similar to Curcuma Longa but has more Terpenes in it. The rhizomes are a pale yellow colour, have an agreeable fragrance and the fresh root has a camphoraceous odour. Case studies: An 85 year old gentleman had Squamus Cell Carcinoma (SCC), a skin cancer on the lobe of the ear. The following Oils were used on the SCC: In base oil of Ashwagandha ( Withania Somnifera ( Ocimum sanctum ) 3 drops After using the oils twice daily for two months, the pain stopped and the SCC reduced from the size of a 20cent coin to the size of a 5 cent coin. He was also taking natural alternative medication and vitamins. I had to go overseas, so the client ordered local Neem. It grew again. He was admitted to hospital and the hard tissue was removed surgically. The oil could then penetrate better. After three mon ths of treat- ment, there was no sign of the SCC and there was no damage, not even scarring. It did not appear again. This has been documen ted by the gentleman himself. After treatment, he kept applying the blends as a preventative precaution and it gave him great relie f from itching skin and sores on the rest of the body. The same man was given oils for his recurrent urinary tract infection due to catheterisation. The oils used were: - In Base oil of Ashwagandha ( Withania Sandalwood ( Sanatalum album ) 3 drops Ajowan (Trachyspermum Ammi ) 2 drops The oils were applied on lower back and lower abdomen and he used to get a lot of relief. Also I made a special blend as follows for the penis as the catheter used to tear his skin. This was extremely beneficial. Base oils of Ashwangandha 5 mls and Brahmi ( Bacopa Mniera were used with 4 drops of Turmeric and 4 drops of Gulheena (infused in sandalwood). This helped in heal- ing the skin very effectively. Another case study was of a man who was an engineer and had an accident. His thumb was squashed flat by some machinery. He had to have microsurgery on his thumb and came to me the next day in a lot of pain. I worked on him energetically and he said the pain dissipated. I gave him a blend to apply once the dressings were taken off. The do ctors had said that the surgery was done for cosmetic reasons and the chances of getting his sensation and feelings back a hundred perc ent were not so good. The blend was made of Ashwagandha 20 mls, Neem 5mls, Turmeric (6 drops), Gul (4 drops), Patchouli (Pogostemon patchouli ) (5 drops) . He applied the blends religiously morning, afternoon and night. Not only did the thumb grow back beautifully, his sensation, feeling and movement were intact and just a tiny portion of his skin felt numb near his nail. The nail which was totally gone, grew back normally. In chicken pox a blend with Base oil of Brahmi ( Bacopa Moniera ) 10 oils of tur- meric 6 drops, Gul heena(infused in sandalwood) 5 drops and Kewda (Pandanus odoratissimus ) (infused in sandal- wood) 3 drops has excellent results. I always have mothers coming to my clinic for their children as by word of mouth they know that I have used this blend with success. (You would reduce the dosage for children under 7 to half the drops of essential oils) These rare and unique Ayurveda aromatherapy oils can easily be blended with our common Aromatherapy oils and you can get some profound results. In Ayurveda, the Indian science of medicine, it is stated by the ancient Rishis and Vaidyas(Physicians) that it is not just t he chemistry or properties of the plant or the standard tastes but the \"PRABHAV\" which is the special energetic glow or effect that makes the plant have unusual therapeutic qualities! Oils especially have a Pranic energy field of their own! We, the practitioners have seen that happening time and time again. The proof is in the pudding! \"A flower is the smile of God. Its fragrance is his hidden presence!\" -Paramahansa Yogananda References Miniature painting is from the book the Garden of life by Naveen Patnaik 1994 Harper Collins publications Chemexchil. 1992.

Ancient reference of rose distillation is found in books by Charak and Susruta (Ayurveda sanhita). Mogul emperor Jahangir filled canals of his Palace Garden with distilled rose water. The oil, which was found to float over it, was collected and named as Itr -e- Jahangiri. This oil was nothing but the rose oil. Legends about rose: Some say that rose was created from a drop of sweat falling from the brow of Mohammad. Some say, it was due to Bacchus. He fell is love with a beautiful nymph and to appreciate her beauty, covered a thorny bush with red perfumed flowers, we now call Rose. Cupid said to have given the God of silence a rose to bribe him, not to reveal the amours of venus. The rose then became the emblem of silence. Cleopetra was bathing in Rose water and used absolute Rose to seduce her lover Antony. Lord Krishna's favorite was Rose. Hindus wash and clean their alter of Gods with Rose water. Roman ban- quets were decorated with Roses. When Alexander the Great came to India, He fell in love with beautiful gardens of India, nicely decorated with various kind of fragrant Roses. Rose species : There are more than 5000 varieties of roses, known to botanists. Only few of them are fragrant and the fragrance varies according to the plant variety. Most of the fragrant roses are hybrids and the fragrance, referred by perfumers as ROSE is found exclusively in the roses belonging to the group cetifolia of family \"Roseaceae\". Out of these only three are commercially exploited for the pro- duction of oil. Rosa damascena: Also known as Pink Damask Rose. Found in wild in Syria, Morocco, and Andalusia. This variety contains relatively high amount of volatile oil. The oil required for perfumery is obtained from Rose cultivated in Bulgaria and Turkey. The volatile oil obtained is light yellow, slightly greenish and is semisolid at room temperature. Odour is powerful and is characteristic of fresh roses. Flavour is sweet, strong and honey like. Damascena rose absolute is orange yellow, orange reddish or slightly olive yel lowish viscous fluid with extremely rich, warm, spicy floral deep rose odour, with honey undertone. Rosa alba: Also known as white cottage rose. This contains much less volatile oil and is of inferior quality compared to damask rose. This variety is resistant to unfavourable climatic conditions and hence is preferred by farmers. It is also grown in Bulgaria. Rosa centifolia (L): Also known as Light Pink Cabbage Rose. This variety is grown exclusively in the Grasse region of southern France. It is also grown in Morocco and there it is also referred to as Rose de mai. It is difficult to distill oil from this variety using steam distillation. Hence solvent extraction is used to prepare concrete and absolutes from this rose. This variety appears to be related to Rosa damascena. \"Rose de mai is orange yellow to orange brown viscous liquid, with rich sweet honey like tenacious odour. Rose plantation : Soil in which rose thrive best is clayey, rich in humus, slightly sandy containing traces of ferrous salts. The soil should be slightly moist, not too dry. Hill slope at the altitude of 2500 -3250 feet are very much suitable for the growth of rose plant. The plant should be well protected against cold winds as well as hot winds. Climate should be humid. New fields are started in fall. The first harvest can be obtained in third year after planting. Normal harvest is obtained after five years. Rose: King of Indian flowers \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved Dr. Geetanjali Ranade 15 Harvesting : Rose begins to bloom in the second week of May and lasts for 3 to 4 weeks. Harvesting begins as soon as flowers open. They are collected by hands; nipped off just below the calyx. Usually plucking starts at day break and continuew till 8 -9 am. Perfumery and flavour application of Rose oils: Rose oil adds beauty and depth to the odour blend. When solubility in dilute alcohol is important, rose oil is used. Rose absolute can be used only when high grade alcohol is used. It is very important in rose - jasmine complex found in fashion perfumes. Rose de mai is useful in rounding up sharp notes in syn- thetic compositions. It is useful to flavour a variety of tobacco, snuff and chewing tobacco, soft drinks and alcoholic liqueurs. Also, to add interesting effect in fruit flavours such as apricol, raspberry, bitter almonds etc. ROSE IN INDIA : The introduction of scented rose cultivation in India was started during Mughal time. Major rose oil producing region in India are Kashmir valley, mid hills of Himachal Pradesh, upper plains of Uttar Pradesh, and upper Punjab. More than 50% of produc- tion is confined to the state of U.P. & Rajasthan. We have been credited for introducing large scale culti- vation of Rosa damascena in Shivalik zone and upper plains of Punjab. The jawala variety of Damask rose developed by IHBT, CSIR has been standardized for the cultivation of this valuable crop in the plains of Punjab. Therapeutic application of Rose: The rose has many therapeutic values as long as it is of good grade, pure natural oil. Arab healers believed rose jam could heal lung complaints. Dr. Leclerc, in Plan- tes Condimentaires published in 1950,valued it as a gentle laxative. It is astringent, antiseptic, soothing to eyes. A recipe by Galen suggests use of rose in cold cream. Galen was great Greek Physician. In cosmetic applications, rose is useful in eczema, to cure broken skin, against wrinkles and help re- move skin puffiness. It is suitable for all skin types. It increase smoothness, reduce wrinkles on the face and helps the skin of the body glowing and charming Rose oil helps patients suffering from depression, fear, nervous tension, insomnia and gives the feeling of well -being. It is helpful in womens Gynecological disorders, menopausal symptoms. It reduces excessive heat of the body. If used before menstrual cycle, it reduces P.M.S. problems.

Your meridians are the channels through which your emotions flow. The natural and free flow of life force energy (your e -motions - energy in motion) coursing through your meridians ensures your health and longevity. While blocked or suppressed emotions result in clogged meridian channels and imbalances of health. In classic, Oriental, or Chinese, Medicine all disease is seen as disordered elements. Restoring balance of the five elements and the harmonious flow of Chi is at the heart of Chinese medicine. Essential oils can help balance the five elements and restore the flow of chi through your meridians. The results of using aromatherapy to restore energetic balance and flow of chi may be enhanced through a regular practice of diaphragmatic breathing. The power of Earth is the call \"to be\" awakened fully to life and your full potential. Properties of the earth element: SEASON: Indian Summer CLIMATE: Damp TASTE: and radiant EMOTION: Worry/desire BODY PARTS: Pancreas, spleen, stomach, muscles, mouth COLOR: Yellow SWEET ACTION: Warming, soothing, nourishing, restorative, body -building and tonic. Most foods are classified as sweet. There are complex sweet flavors like grains, beans, dairy products and meat. Simple sweets like honey, sweet fruits and juices are less satisfying and intensify your sweet craving rather than satisfy it. A balanced earth element supports your personal freedom and autonomy to direct your spirit to realize your highest poten- tial. You are a creator of your reality and manifest easily all that you desire into the physical world. In balance you trust yourself and take full responsibility for your life. You feel a strong sense of self worth and positive self value. You may experience imbalance as an inability to take responsibility for yourself and your life experiences. You may lack self control, and blame and criticize others for your problems. Keywords: Stability, Security, Connected, Self Motivation, Self Esteem, Commitment, Personal Power, Self Control, Honor, Integrity, Self Respect, Self Approval, Willingness to Change and take Responsibility.

The choice of delivery method often depends on your intended goal. Here are some of the most practical and therapeutic methods for using your aromatic oils for balancing the 5 elements. Direct inhalation is the method I primarily use in my practice. Research shows that aromatic vapors will remain in your bloodstream for up to 4 -6 hours. PLEASE NOTE: Stimulating circulation of your blood, lymph and nerve flow through rhythmic breathing in conjunc- tion with inhalation of aromatic oils enhances their delivery into your system! Steam Inhalation is one of the easiest and most direct ways to support your respiratory system with essential oils. Use steam inhalation to soothe and promote healing for your respiratory system, clearing nasal passages and enjoying therapeu- tic benefits for your lungs. Great method to prevent or treat respiratory infections, support your health and prevent colds a nd the flu. Add 4 -8 drops of oil to a large bowl of steaming hot water, but not so hot it will burn your skin or mucous mem- branes. Put a towel over your head to capture the steam. Close your eyes and inhale until the water cools or until you stop smelling the oil. Breathe in the steam for a few minutes, as long as you desire. Please keep your eyes closed to prevent any of the essential oil vapors from getting into your eyes! Repeat, the treatment if necessary, every 4 -5 hours. Relieves sinus congestion, coughs, colds, flu and sore throats. Suggested oils to use: eucalyptus, ravensara, lavender, peppermint, lemon and tea tree. Bathing is an age -old method for using aromatic oils to balance the 5 elements and is great for stress reduction, relaxation, soothing sore muscles and joints, supporting respiratory health, mood enhancement, and treating your senses to the full aroma of an essential oil. Fill your tub with water, add 5 -8 drops of oil that has been mixed in a dispersant such as a water soluble carrier oil, milk or cream, or a spoonful of honey, swish to disperse in the water. A half cup each of Epsom Salts (muscle relax- ant, detoxifier) and Baking Soda (skin softener) can also be used to disperse the oils in your bath water. PLEASE NOTE: Essential oils are not water soluble you must use a dispersant when adding them to a facial steam or bath and water may cause the oils to penetrate your system more quickly or cause irritation to sensitive or dam- aged skin, i.e. blemishes, sores or rash. Compress ~ Excellent for topical application to ease pain from strained muscles, menstrual cramps, etc. Disperse 4 -8 drops of oil in a teaspoon of milk or honey and add to a small stainless steel bowl of hot water. Absorb the \"HOT\" water into a wash cloth, using protective gloves, wring out excess water and apply compress to area of discomfort, repeat when your cloth cools. You may cover the warm cloth with a hot water bottle, plastic sheet or a towel to keep it \"HOT\" longer. ________________________________________________________________________ KG STILES, LMT, CAT, RBT, CBP, NCTMB (OR Lic #2313) is a specialist in the field of Aromatic Plant and Energy Medi- cine.

ESSENTIAL OILS TO BALANCE THE FIVE ELEMENTS ~ THE EARTH ELEMENT ~ \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 19 By David Crow, L.Ac. All creatures are born of the earth, and nourished by her rich flavors. I am the fra- grance of the soil, Lord Krishna proclaims in the Bhagavat Gita, reminding us of Gods life -giving presence within the most humble of the elements. Every plant absorbs the prana (life force) and ojas (nutritive essence) of the soil into its body, transforming them into foods, medicines, and oils for the benefit of other beings. Yet none capture the subtle complexities of the earths mysterious fragrances as completely as vetiver grass, known in India as khus . Khus (Vetiveriazizanioides) is a grass that grows up to six feet high. Vetivers deeply penetrating roots and thou- sands of tiny fibrous rootlets reach out to drink in the aromatic molecules from the surrounding soil, which in turn become the multi -layered perfume notes of its dark amber oil. Sweet and heavy, with rich undertones reminiscent of precious woods and marshlands, the oil has widely varied olfactory characteristics depending on the type of earth it grows in. Because of the diversity of compounds present in different soils, vetiver oil is one of the most biochemi- cally complex of all essential oils. Silently enjoying a secret banquet, only the plants know that the soil is a feast of flavors. Vetiver grows primarily in Indonesia, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, and India. In India the grass grows wild in many ar- eas, and it is often harvested as a cash crop by nomadic tribal people. The roots are woven into sweet -smelling sleeping mats, and hung as curtains in desert homes; when the fierce hot winds blow people sprinkle water on these curtains, which then release their cooling vapor into the air. Khus oil has been used in the perfume trade for centuries. One of the most unusual, rare, and unique of the vetiver oils is ruh khus . The ruh (an Arabic word meaning essence) of khus is distilled from the wild roots that grow in the blazing expanses of Rajasthans deserts. After the roots are carefully dried, they are slowly reconstituted while im- mersed in water during hydro -distillation. Another beloved vetiver preparation is khus attar, which is created by re- peatedly distilling the fragrant steam of vetiver roots into sandalwood oil. The preparation of these aromatic treas- ures is a vanishing art and science. Ayurvedic medicine describes vetiver oil as cooling to pitta (anti -inflammatory), yet pacifying to vata (calming and comforting to the mind). A traditional method of using the root is to apply it as a paste, which reduces fevers and cools the body. Used in massage oils, its relaxing effects spread through the skin and muscles into the deeper lev- els of the nervous system, helping to counteract nervousness, stress, and exhaustion. The relaxing fragrance of the roots stabilizes concentration and works as a rejuvenating tonic. Vetiver is considered to have mild estrogen -like effects that are balancing for a womans hormones; it is used in lotions for enhancing fullness of the breasts. Vetiver oil is used in cosmetic products for its skin -regenerating powers, which make it helpful for counteracting aging of the skin and preventing stretch marks after pregnancy. It is an ingredient in liniments used for rheumatic pains and ar- thritis, and a compassionately soothing remedy for enthusiastic yogis who strain their muscles and joints with ex- cessive asana practice. Through purification and regeneration, plants cure diseases of the earths ecological terrain in the same way that they cure diseases of the bodys inner terrain. Vetiver grass is one of the worlds most important botanical solutions for a wide range of environmental problems. Its deep roots hold the topsoil and prevent its erosion by wind and wa- ter. These roots also capture the rain and percolate it into the soil, preventing runoff, recharging depleted ground- water, and bringing springs back to life. Like many other plants, vetiver has amazing metabolic powers that allow it to thrive in polluted environments and digest the endless stream of man -made poisons that we dump everywhere. Because the grass has a special appetite for pesticides and agricultural toxins, it is now used in over a hundred countries for phytoremediation purposes, helping to cleanse the environment in the same way that medicinal plants detoxify the organs of the body. Vetiver is beloved to perfumers, esteemed by traditional physicians, and appreciated by people who need its heal- ing virtues. It is also a great friend to farmers, who use it as mulch for improving the fertility of the soil; animals, too, are pleased with finding the sweet grass in their meal. It gives livelihood to nomadic tribal people, and it is a treas- ure to alchemists who distill its rich essence. Vetiver is only a simple grass, yet its multitude of benefits and its earthy aroma reminds us that we need not look far to find the life -giving powers and presence of the Creator.
