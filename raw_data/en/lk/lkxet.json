It is a practice of making things real. Do not practise while driving or operating machinery. The disciplined practice of living in stillness can lead to seeing new pathways. It can enable new choices for action that you might not have seen before the practice of stillness. Meditation: A place of peace An hour of relaxation, stillness, meditation, and visual imagery. Below are four music tracks from Meditation: A place of peace. Our Spiritual Care Department have made this recording. It makes a meditation session suitable for a beginner and a practiced meditator.

Guidance in using the breath, use a mantra or simple prayer. The practice of quiet mind skills to build peace within. Periods of silence with the sound of bells. White light meditation. Imagery can give a profound spiritual experience. It's one of the ways to activate one's spiritual life. It can act as a link between spirit, consciousness, and matter.
