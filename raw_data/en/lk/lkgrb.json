This also means that you may be unaware of how to prepare, how to protect yourself and how to process a vaccination so that you can have the best possible outcome. The first thing is to understand who should not be vaccinated ... the jury is still out as to whether those who have tested positive for CoVid during this time, should now be vaccinated. But there is a definite consensus that pregnant women and those who have experienced allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) should not have the vaccination. The Mayo Clinic states that there is limited information currently about the safety of the vaccine in people who have weakened immune systems or autoimmune conditions. There is also no vaccine available yet, nor clinical information, for children under the age of 16 although Astra-Zeneca is planning a clinical study in children. So what can you do if you are a part of these populations? The answer is to create your own immune barrier not just to CoVid and not just to variations both current and future, but to all challenges to your immune system that will ever come down the road. This is actually what many of us do instead of vaccinating against the flu, shingles and many other viral illnesses. I have frequently said that this is not the first virus nor will this be the last to visit us, so creating a vaccine for every virus and every strain of virus is a chaotic approach to individual wellness. The new CoVid variant that has appeared recently is just the first acknowledged variant and it is very possible that a future variant will \"escape\" the vaccines that have just been developed. So instead of simply relying on one vaccination after another, create your own natural vaccination by developing a personalized immune barrier. Like conventional vaccinations, natural immune development will not prevent you from ever getting sick, but it will reduce the severity of an illness and speed recovery time. The goal is not to avoid all illness, the goal is to recover well from illness. My tried and true daily triad for this is an imported Echinacea blend of Angustifolia and Purpurea, Astragalus and a good immune system medicinal. This triad is essential for every person's immune system and then you can customize your protocol by choosing from longer-term essential immune builders including ionized calcium, chelated zinc, mushroom extracts such as ganoderma and shitake plus non-synthetic Vitamin C & D, all of which have long been known to support the immune system. Choosing from these essential immune builders provides the best offensive defense against all pathogenic challenges. But what if you do choose to get vaccinated? How can you have the best experience with your vaccination? Herbs and homeopathy have great options to help modulate conventional vaccinations, limiting uncomfortable side effects and minimizing post-vaccination symptoms. I love to use high grade St. John's Wort, Licorice and Thuja as my herbal extracts of choice. Begin dosing at least one week before your vaccination and continue for two weeks after. It will not interfere with the vaccination, it simply modulates and supports your body's adaptation and regulation. Another important consideration to minimize negative effects is to avoid receiving your vaccination if you already have symptoms of illness. Fever, headache, digestive upset or any unusual symptoms are a sign that your immune system needs to focus on one challenge at a time. Respecting this fact will protect your health and prevent complicated secondary effects from your vaccination. This is the mistake that often leads to an autoimmune situation or even an histamine storm within the body tissues. Now if you already know that you tend to have a pattern of illness, such as poor breathing, severe fatigue, migraines or weeks of digestive upset, then begin supporting these tendencies at least three weeks before your vaccination and for two weeks after. This way the body is already having these tendencies reduced before adding another immune challenge in the form of a vaccination. The goal of immune system regulation is not to strengthen the immune system, it is to keep everything within normal homeostatic boundaries so that the body's important daily processes can continue. So whether you decide to conventionally vaccinate or not, you can protect your health and your body now and in the future with the balance and support of natural medicine. "}
