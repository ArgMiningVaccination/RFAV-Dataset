It can cause anxiety, depression, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. While many opt to combat stress with prescriptions, there are various natural remedies to use alongside more conventional medical therapies. Meditation Meditation helps to slow racing thoughts, making it easier to manage stress and anxiety. A wide range of meditation styles, including mindfulness and meditation during yoga, may help. Mindfulness-based meditation is becoming increasingly popular in therapy. A [2010 study](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-05835-004) suggests that it can be highly effective for people with disorders specifically relating to mood and anxiety. Herbal Teas Many herbal teas promise to help with stress and ease sleep. Some people find the process of making and drinking tea soothing, and some teas have a direct effect on the brain that results in reduced anxiety. [A 2018 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395617307434) suggests that chamomile can alter levels of cortisol, a stress hormone. Exercise Just 30 minutes of exercise a day can have huge effects on your mental health, leaving you feeling calm and at ease. Not only will it help reduce feelings of stress, but exercise also helps combat anxiety and depression. Aromatherapy Smelling soothing plant oils, particularly lavender, can help to ease stress. Results from a [2012 study](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/740813/abs/) suggest that aromatherapy may reduce the heart rate in the short term and help to ease sleep issues in the long term. Some natural supplements can change the way anti-anxiety medications work. Always consult a doctor before trying any of these remedies. "}
