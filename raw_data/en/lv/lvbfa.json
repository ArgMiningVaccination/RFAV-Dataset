USAID MEDICINES, TECHNOLOGIES, AND PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES (MTaPS) PROGRAM Improved Access. Improved Services. Better Health Outcomes . Minimum Common Standards for Regulatory Information Management Systems in Low - and Middle -Income Countries Report on the Consultative Process 1 About the USAID MTaPS Program Funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by a team led by Management Sciences for Health (MSH), the purpose of the five -year Medicines Technologies and Pharmaceutical Services (MTaPS) pr ogram (2018-2023) is to provide pharmaceutical system strengthening assistance for sustained improvements in health system performance and to advance USAID's goals of preventing child and maternal deaths, controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and combating in fectious disease threats, as well as expanding essential health coverage. The goal of the MTaPS Program is to help low - and middle -income countries (LMICs) strengthen their pharmaceutical systems to ensure sustainable access to and appropriate use of safe, effective, quality assured, and affordable essential medicines, vaccines, and other health technologies and pharmaceutical services. About the USAID PQM+ Program The Promoting the Quality of Medicines Plus (PQM+) program is a USAID funded cooperative agreement with the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) with a goal to sustainably strengthen medical product quality assurance (QA) systems by providing technical assistance to manufacturers of priority health products and build in -country capacity of Medicine s Regulatory Authorities to improve product registration, inspection, and post -marketing surveillance for product quality. PQM+ support also includes accreditation of national drug quality control laboratories per ISO/IEC 17025 and/or WHO pre - qualification standards in LMICs . PQM+ uses a system strengthening approach to program implementation to enhance sustainability.1 The program considers the entire system when designing and delivering technical assistance, focusing on the interaction among all health s ystems functions2 as they relate to medical product quality assurance. To implement PQM+, USP joined forces with a diversified consortium of four core partners, six field -led extension partners, and eight technical resource partners3 whose extensive technical expertise can be drawn on to achieve desired results. 1 Chee G, Pielemeier N, Lion A, Connor C.

Adoption of these common standards will streamline regulatory processes and help ensure that national medicine regulatory authorities ( NMRAs ) make technical decisions with a degree of consistency and uniformity. M CSs would als o enhance the ability of NMRAs to collaborate and share information with one another, including use of reliance and recognition mechanisms. The MCSs will enable uniform data capture and standardize the data, design, and workflow of digitalized regulatory functions. Specifically, MTaPS and PQM+ convened a group of international stakeholders and subject matter experts to: Clearly identify the critical gaps and challenges NMRAs and other stakeholders are facing with regulatory IMS for the eight regulatory functions outlined in the W orld Health Organization (WHO) Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) for evaluation of national regul atory systems4 Use existing relevant IMS and regulatory standards to derive a recommended set of MCSs for regulatory IMS to address identified gaps and challenges ; this includes developing the selection criteria for prioritizing which standards to incl ude in the set of recommended standards Develop the use case for the MCSs and promote their adoption and use The consultations spanned a 10 -month period and consisted of 4 virtual meetings, supplemented by written feedback and one-on-one and small group sessions to achieve the stated process objectives. Through this process, a minimum common set of standards for digitalization of regulatory IMSs was identified ( figure 2), as well as an advocacy b rief and pathway to digitalize regulatory IMSs (see Outputs of the Consultative Process ). 4 World Health Organization (2021).

These systems are often disparate and lack interoperability or are nonexistent, partially implemented, or nonfunctional. Many regulatory functions use paper -based systems, which results in inefficient workflows, backlogs a nd delays, lack of transparency, mismanagement, and vulnerability to corruption. Digitalization efforts aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and accountability in pharmaceutical regulatory service delivery. However, digitalization approaches vary across NMRAs, which often struggle with fully operationalizing their regulatory IMS s, either desk -based or web -based systems, which limit the availability of real -time data and collaboration between NMRAs.5 Ongoing regional regulatory harmonization efforts in b oth Africa and Asia will rely not only on common documents and processes, but also shared regulatory IMS that are fully interoperable. This work increases the need for a set of MCSs for regulatory IMS to help clarify how regulatory IMS should capture and r eport information to promote system interoperability within national regulatory systems and support regulatory harmonization efforts. It is not feasible for countries to apply all the relevant standards to each regulatory IMS, so it is necessary to identif y a set of MCSs for regulatory IMS that NMRAs should prioritize to streamline their workflows and documentation of regulatory processes, ensure uniform data capture, and enable data exchange within and between NMRAs and other stakeholders. The USAID -funded Medicines Technologies and Pharmaceutical Services (MTaPS) and USAID -funded PQM+ program s engaged global stakeholders and subject matter experts to help identify and recommend a set of MCSs for regulatory IMS. The adoption of these common standards will s treamline regulatory processes and help ensure that NMRAs make technical decisions with a degree of consistency and uniformity. M CSs would also enhance the ability of NMRAs to collaborate and share information with one another, including use of reliance and recognition mechanisms. OBJECTIVES OF THE CONSULTATIVE PROCESS The primary objective of the consultative process was to derive and recommend a set of MCSs for regulatory IMS s that will enable uniform data capture and standardize the data, design, and workflow of digitalized regulatory functions. Specifically, MTaPS and PQM+ convened a group of international stakeholders and subject matter experts to: Clearly identify the criti cal gaps and challenges NMRAs and other stakeholders are facing with regulatory IMS for the eight regulatory functions outlined in the WHO GBT for evaluation of national regulatory systems4 Use existing relevant IMS and regulatory standards to derive a recommended set of MCSs for regulatory IMS s to address identified gaps and challenges ; this includes developing the selection criteria for prioritizing which standards to include in the set of recommended standards 5 BEWSYS.

Software developers and programmers and managers/administrators of regulatory IMSs develop and manage the systems for NMRAs. Global and regional regulatory experts : This group includes the regional regulatory harmonization initiatives ; other global and regional experts and normative bodies working in RSS; and subject matter experts who can provide technical inputs on the recommended MCSs and promote the adoption and use of standards. Examples of stakeholders in this group include WHO, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, South -East Asia Regulatory Network (SEARN), African Union Devel opment Agency -New Partnership for Africa's Development (AUDA - NEPAD), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other regional economic communities, and pharmaceutical industry associations. Funders : This group supports RSS development and implementation and may overlap with the global regulatory experts' group. Examples include the World Bank and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. This report documents the outcomes of the consu ltative process . 14 CONSULTATIVE MEETING I The USAID -funded MTaPS and PQM+ programs convened a virtual consultative meeting on September 15, 2021. The meeting is the first in a series of consultations aimed at identifying and recommending a set of MCSs for regulatory IMS s that will enable uniform data capture and standardize the data, design, and workflow of digitalized regulatory functions. The complete report of the first consultative meeting can be found in Annex 1 . MEETING I OBJECTIVES The meeting brought together experts in RSS and IMSs from a variety of global, regional, and national organizations (See Annex 1B for a complete list of meeting participants) , and objectives were to: Clearly identify the critical gaps and challenges NMRAs and other stakeholders are facing in regard to regulatory IMS s Discuss how a set of MCSs for regulatory IMS s can best address or mitigate these challenges Start building the use case for a set of MCSs for regulatory IMS MEETING I OUTCOMES The discussions were structured around introductory presentations given at the beginning of each session (see Annex 1 A: Meeting Agenda for details) and a set of session -specific prompts/question s. During the meeting, more than 50 participants representing over 20 organizations working to strengthen regulatory systems identified the following challenges to successful implementation of regulatory IMS s: Lack of interoperability Lack of integration Varying requirements/standards for regulatory processes High cost Unsustain able political will and commitment The complete list of the challenges identified is included in Annex 1D. There was general agreement that the challenges to regulatory IMS implementation are consistent across regions. There are variations between the regions in terms of system maturity (both in terms of GBT levels and information system infrastructure) and the varying degrees of reliance/convergence that the regions have identified as the target/endpoint for their harmonization initiatives. These should be car efully considered throughout the process of identifying a minimum set of standards for regulatory IMS s and, particularly , when elaborating the use case for adoption of the standards and creating a plan for institutionaliz ing the standards when developing, improving, or implementing regulatory IMS s. 15 Meeting participants proposed that a minimum common set of standards to guide the development and implementation of regulatory IMS s could address these challenges and lead to improved: Effectiveness, efficiency, and performance o Regulatory activities can be performed faster, better , and with less cost Transparency and timely access to information and regulatory decisions o Possibility for faster and wider sharing of information Consistency in regulatory activities/fu nctions Good Governance Practices (GGP s), reduced risk of corruption Collaboration, trust, and reliance among NMRAs Finally, participants agreed on the following working definition of the term \"standards\" and the scope as it applies to this activity: Standards refer to the basis of measure, norms, and guidelines for regulatory IMS that would enable uniform data capture, a standardized data exchange platform and workflow of digitalized regulatory functions, leading to efficiencies and enhanced governanc e. MTaPS and PQM+ proposed three categories of regulatory IMS standards: Process or workflow standards , which define standards for pharmaceutical procedures, processes, or workflows. Examples include Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and International Or ganization for Standardization (ISO) standards . Pharmaceutical standard dictionaries and knowledge trees , which are master or reference lists for terminology, nomenclature, and hierarchies. Examples include Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Te rms (SNOMED), Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification, and International Nonproprietary Name (INN). Data exchange standards pertain to information and communications technology (ICT) and management information system (MIS) functions and determine how data should be structured, defined, and formatted to facilitate sharing across computer systems. Examples include structured pro duct labelling (SPL), portable document format , and extensible markup language (XML) , and platforms , such as Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR\u00ae), which define a common standard for health system data exchange. CONSULTATIVE MEETING II The second consultative meeting focused on the development of the standards themselves. The report for the second meeting is included as Annex 2 . MEETING II OBJECTIVES Develop the use case for the set of MCSs Identify the selection criteria for the MCSs 16 MEETING II OUTCOMES Regarding the develop ment of the use case for the standards, MTaPS and PQM+ noted that the potential benefits of adopting MCSs for the different stakeholder groups must be identified . Potential benefits of adoption include creation of a common reference among stakeholders for develop ing and using regulatory IMS s; streamlining NMRAs' internal operations; and facilitating convergence and harmonization of regulatory services , both within and across NMRAs. Meeting participants acknowledged these benefits and discussed the need to learn from previous efforts of other organizations that have developed and promulgated standards. This could help identify a suitable process for identi fying stakeholders and developing and promoting the standards. Participants debated whether the GBT modules/regulatory functions or the pharmaceutical product life cycle should be used to structure further work on the standards and the use case. Participa nts agreed that the product should be the center of their thinking and that the regulatory functions at each stage in the product life cycle should be examined individually to identify stakeholders and build the use cases. Using this suggestion, meeting pa rticipants did some preliminary work identifying potential stakeholders for the different regulatory functions aligned with the various stages of the product life cycle. However, no final determination was made regarding the key stakeholders for developing use cases during the time allotted for the session. The key selection criteria that MTaPS and PQM+ proposed for selecting the MCSs were: Relevance : The standard should be critical for at least one of the eight core regulatory functions as defined in the WHO GBT Feasibility of application : The extent to which NMRAs' capacity and resources feasibly allow adoption and what are the anticipated efficiency gains Priority : How would countries benefit or lose by not applying a given standard ? Universality : Whether a given standard is recommended by WHO and the extent to which it is widely used However, participants raised concerns about how best to apply these criteria and noted that , in some cases , determinations would have to be country specific. Much of th e deliberation centered on the inclusion or exclusion of process standards \u2014several participants proposed that we differentiate between standards and guidelines and asserted that including both was outside the proposed scope of the activity and confounded t he activity objectives. Further, some meeting participants were concerned about the extent to which the applying the criteria aligned with the scope of the activity and the extent to which the objective was focused on system design versus system contents. Meeting participants further urged the team to revisit the definitions and the proposed scoring (1 being low priority, 3 being high priority) of the criteria. Given the depth of the meeting discussions, MTaPS and PQM+ noted the need revisit the consultativ e process and the proposed approach for the use case development and standards selection. The next steps include a rethinking of the process and a potential revision of the background document for recirculation to participants for reactions and feedback. 17 Recommendations and next steps for MTaPS and PQM+ that emerged from the meeting include: Draft the use case and share with meeting participants for feedback . Map the regulatory functions to the product life cycle and use the resulting matrix to identify stakeholders . Use the feedback from the meeting to rethink the selection criteria and share with meeting participants for feedback. Share the full list of standards identified from the desk review with participants for review against the revised selection criteria . CONSULTATIVE MEETING III - NMRA S The third consultative meeting, held virtually on January 26, 2022, focused on inputs and perspectives from NMRAs. Many of the authorities were participating in the process for the first time, so the agenda (Annex 4A ) set time aside to introduce the overall activity. Participants received the concept note as well as the compiled standards from the literature review and the selection criteria from the second consultative meeting in advance. The meetin g brought together NMRA experts in pharmaceutical regulatory systems and IMSs from 11 countries in Africa and Asia (Annex 4B ). MEETING III OBJECTIVES The main purpose of the meeting was to provide an overview of the process for identifying a set of MCSs for regulatory IMS, including defining the scope, objectives, benefits, and the standards selection process. MEETING III OUTCOMES During this meeting, the importance and benefits of a minimum set of standards for regulatory IMSs and the challenges with its adoption w ere discussed. The PQM+ and MTaPS programs proposed that the adoption of a minimum set of common standards for regulatory IMS s will: Create a single language or common reference for use among regulators, software deve lopers, and policymakers Guide the development of standards as developers incorporate them into software requirement specifications to design regulatory IMS software Streamline NMRAs' internal operations , such as workflow management throughout the life cycle of medical products, performance metric tracking, and reporting Facilitate convergence and harmonization of regulatory services , both within and outside a defined national regulatory authority 18 Meeting participants acknowledged these benefits ; during the first session , NMRA participants identified the following challenges regarding regulatory IMSs in their settings: Lack of information technology (IT) materials, software, infrastructure, servers, and professionals to develop these systems Improper integration or non -existent IMS s for regulatory processes Minimal internet connectivity, data storage , and backup systems for regulatory information Minimal financial resources and time constraints to develop or improve regulatory IMSs Creat ion of systems (by outsourced and expensive software developers) that are not iterative, resulting in manual interventions and a fragmented approach to automati ng regulatory business processes . Participants discussed how to address these challenges with the adoption of MCSs for regulatory IMSs. Attendees noted that MCSs can mitigate these challenges by: Providing appropriate technical support and capacity building for related IMS platforms to minimize errors and increase the accuracy of data capture Supporting reliance, harmonization, and information exchange to optimiz e regulatory resources Guaranteeing transparency and uniformity of activities, providing a structured framework for communication between the regulatory functions Improving and facilitating the product registration process in a timely manner Pressuring eac h regulatory authority to procure minimum equipment Encouraging NMRAs to adopt best practices from countries with stronger or more mature regulatory systems to improve technical capabilities Helping NMRAs better manage their policies and processes to achie ve specific objectives and outcomes Supporting good documentation practices within NMRA functions Session II of the meeting introduced the methodology for the desk review exercise conducted by PQM+ and MTaPS, which identified 56 regulatory standards organi zed into 3 categories : Process or workflow standards Data dictionary and knowledge tree standards Data exchange standards The session also presented the 4 selection criteria and process that NMRA participants and other stakeholders will use to identify a minimum set of common standards from the list of 56 to prioritize for adoption. The selection criteria are: Relevance : Applicable to at least one of the eight core regulatory functions as defined in the WHO GBT Feasibility of application : Extent to which N MRAs' capacity and resources feasibly allow adoption Criticality : Whether the standard is critical (or required) to gain efficiencies in workflow and processes for at least one regulatory function Universality : How widely a standard is used (e.g., recommen ded by large normative bodies, industrywide standards, etc. ) 19 Meeting attendees were also prompted to respond to following questions: What regulatory data standards have been adopted in your country? What is your feedback on the selection criteria used by PQM+/MTaPS to determine MCSs for regulatory IMSs? Do you have any suggestions on how these MCSs should be selected? Based on the ensuing discussion, many countries are applying some of the standards identified in the original desk review. Participants recommended that PQM+ and MTaPS consider including flexibility, universality, and/or harmonization as part of the select ion criteria for MCSs. They also discussed next steps in the engagement process to set the expectations and outline the steps and timeline for completion of the selection process for a minimum set of standards for regulatory IMSs. The meeting closed with thank s to all attendees for their active engagement and reiterat ed a request that attendees work with their colleagues to complete the standard selection activity presented during the meeting. CONSULTATIVE MEETING IV The fourth and final consultative meeti ng brought together 49 experts in RSS and IMSs, representing 9 countries and 4 regional and global organizations , combining participants from the first 3 meetings. MEETING IV OBJECTIVES Share the results of feedback from stakeholders on selecti ng MCSs for regulatory IMS s Agree on the MCSs for regulatory IMS s Propose next steps involving advocacy for adopti ng MCSs by NMRAs MEETING IV OUTCOMES During this meeting, MTaPS and PQM+ representatives provided an overview of the consultative process that led to the identification of 56 standards and culminated in the selection of MCS s for regulatory IMS s. Session 1 discussed the consultative process and methodology for selecting MCSs based on the following criteria: Relevance : The standard should be critical for at least one of the eight core regulatory functions as defined in the WHO GBT v2.0 Feasibility : The extent to which NMRAs' capacity and resources feasibly allow adoption and what are the anticipated efficiency gains Criticality : How would countr ies benefit or lose by not applying a given standard ? Universality : Whether a given standard is recommended by WHO and the extent to which it is widely used 20 The list of 56 identified standards was circulated to all participants in the preceding 3 consulta tive meetings. Participants were asked to evaluate each criterion on a scale of 1 to 3 for each of the 56 standards. Definitions for each rating are included in table 2. During this selection exercise, relevance was excluded from participant consideration \u2014the 56 identified standards were deemed relevant for inclusion by the MTaPS and PQM+ teams during the literature review process. Table 2. Rating definitions by selection criteria Rating scale Feasibility Criticality Universality 1 Adopted with greater difficulty, significant technical assistance required Regulatory performance/processes not impacted without the standard Not widely used in LMICs 2 Adopted with medium difficulty, marginal technical assistance required Regulatory performance/processes may be impacted without the standard The standard is moderately widespread 3 Adopted with minimal, if any, technical assistance Regulatory performance/processes impacted without the standard Widely used or recommended by industry or normative bodies These 56 standards were further divided into 3 categories (figure 1). Figure 1. Categories of standards The final list of MCS s was developed based on analysis of the feedback received from 11 respondents and informed by the MTaPS and PQM+ teams' expertise across regulatory functions. The first step in the data analysis was the computation of unweighted mean scores received from participants. As the analysis proceeded, MTaPS and PQM+ experts examined the results based on category of standard, respondent type (global, regional, or national), regulatory function according to the WHO 1) Process or workflow standards Apply to pharmaceutical: Procedures Processes Workflows Examples Good practices, such as GMP ISO standards, such as ISO 9001:20152) Pharmaceutical standard dictionaries and knowledge trees Master/reference lists for: Terminology Nomenclature Hierarchies Examples ATC INN3) Data exchange standards Pertains to: ICT MIS functions Determining how data should be structured, defined, and formatted Examples Common technical document format XML Platforms, such as FHIR\u00ae21 GBT v2.0, and pharmaceutical product life cycle ali gnment. The MTaPS and PQM+ teams determined that the criterion for feasibility should be excluded from the selection process \u2014this criterion should determine the order in which NMRAs should adopt each standard in the list of MCS s. Universality and criticali ty were combined to select the standards, which were then sorted by their assigned feasibility scores to recommend how countries should incorporate the selected standards in their regulatory IMS s. All the identified process standards, except for those pert aining specifically to medical devices, were selected for inclusion in the MCS s. The standards pertaining to medical devices were excluded to align with the WHO GBT v2.0 (medicines and vaccines). Participants expressed the expectation that standards for me dical devices would be included the future set of MCS s. The remaining process standards are considered prerequisite to digitalizing regulatory IMS s or adopting the other standards (data dictionaries and knowledge trees, data exchange). The list of standard s recommended for adoption (figure 2 ) are listed in order from the most to least feasible to adopt. Figure 2. Selected MCSs for regulatory IMS s The meeting was informed that MTaPS and PQM+ were developing a guidance document and advocacy brief for the adoption of regulatory IMS s. 22 Discussion included a detailed review of the data analysis process for the selection of the MCS s. Session II consisted of discussions with participants about agreement on MCS s for each of t he three categories ( process, data dictionaries/knowledge trees, and data exchange ). Particip ants strongly suggested including identification of medicinal product (IDMP) standards , such as ISO 11615, ISO 11616, ISO 11239, and ISO 11240 , as part of the list of MCS s because they are key data entry elements required to create product information and are essential for identifying medicinal product s regionally and internationally, particularly for pharmacovigilance activities. Meeting attendees were prompted t o share any challenges or lessons learn ed implementing regulatory IMSs in their context and provide general feedback on the presentations . Selected responses are below . The choice of data exchange standards was a prudent one as they are widely used . Include a comprehensive mapping of the selected standards and their respective WHO GBT function in the meeting report . Focus on incorporating IDMP standards . A feasibility analysis should be conducted before implementing regulatory IMS s. Selected standards sh ould be aligned with international data interchange standards . During the discussion, it was strong ly recommend ed to adopt IDMP standards for sharing information internationally and regionally and to think about adding implementation tools to supplement the standards . It was also suggested that the regulatory IMS implementation guidelines be developed in close partnership with WHO . OUTPUTS OF THE CONSULTATIVE PROCESS SET OF MCS S Based on the literature review, selection criteria, and extensive review and feedback over the course of the consultative process, the MTaPS and PQM+ teams selected the MCSs required for digitalization of regulatory IMS s (figure 2). ADVOCACY BRIEF A document that highlights the benefits of adopting the MCSs for digitalization of regulatory IMS s in LMICs was also developed through the consultative process.

Minimum Common Standards for Regulatory Information Management Systems in Low - and Middle -Income Countries Report of the 1st Consultative Meeting Held 15 September 2021 25 About the USAID MTaPS Program Funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by a team led by Management Sciences for Health (MSH), the purpose of the five -year Med icines Technologies and Pharmaceutical Services (MTaPS) program (2018 -2023) is to provide pharmaceutical system strengthening assistance for sustained improvements in health system performance and to advance USAID's goals of preventing child and maternal d eaths, controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and combating infectious disease threats, as well as expanding essential health coverage. The goal of the MTaPS Program is to help low - and middle -income countries (LMICs) strengthen their pharmaceutical systems to ensure sustainable access to and appropriate use of safe, effective, quality assured, and affordable essential medicines, vaccines, and other health technologies and pharmaceutical services. About the USAID PQM+ Program The Promoting the Quality of Medici nes Plus (PQM+) program is a USAID funded cooperative agreement with the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) with a goal to sustainably strengthen medical product quality assurance (QA) systems by providing technical assistance to manufacturers of priority health products and build in -country capacity of Medicines Regulatory Authorities to improve product registration, inspection, and post -marketing surveillance for product quality. PQM+ support also includes accreditation of national drug quality control l aboratories per ISO/IEC 17025 and/or WHO pre - qualification standards in low -and middle -income countries. PQM+ uses a system strengthening approach to program implementation to enhance sustainability.6 The program considers the entire system when designing and delivering technical assistance, focusing on the interaction among all health systems functions7 as they relate to medical product quality assurance. To implement PQM+, USP joined forces with a diversified consortium of four core partners, six field -led extension partners, and eight technical resource partners8 whose extensive technical expertise can be drawn on to achieve desired results. 6 Chee G, Pielemeier N, Lion A, Connor C.

The meeting is the first in a series of consultations aimed at identifying and recommending a set of minimum common standards for regulatory information management systems (IMS) that will enable uniform data capture and standardize the data, design, and workflow of digitalized regulatory functions. The meeting brought together experts in regulatory system strengthening and information managemen t systems from a variety of global, regional, and national organizations ( Annex 1B) and the objectives were to: Clearly identify the critical gaps and challenges National Medicines Regulatory Authorities (NMRAs) and other stakeh olders are facing with regards to regulatory IMS Discuss how a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS can best address or mitigate these challenges Start building the use case for a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS The discu ssions were structured around introductory presentations given at the beginning of each session (see Annex 1 A: Meeting Agenda for details), and a set of session -specific prompts/questions. During the meeting, more than 50 parti cipants, representing over 20 organizations working to strengthen regulatory systems identified the following challenges to successful implementation of regulatory IMS: Lack of interoperability Lack of integration Varying requirements/standards for regulat ory processes High cost Unsustained political will and commitment The complete list of the challenges identified is included on page 96 in Annex 1D. There was general agreement that the challenges to regulatory IMS implementation are consistent across regions. There are variations between the regions in terms of system maturity (both in terms of Global Benchmarking Tool levels and information system infrastructure) and the varying degrees of reliance/convergence that the regions have identified as the target/endpoint for their harmonization initiatives. These should be carefully considered throughout the process of identifying a minimum set of standards for regulatory IMS, and particularly when elaborating the use case for adoption of the standards and creating a plan for institutionalization of the standards when developing, improving, or implementing regulatory IMS. USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs Page | 30 Meeting participants propos ed that a minimum common set of standards to guide the development and implementation of regulatory IMS could address these challenges, and lead to improved: Effectiveness, efficiency, and performance o Regulatory activities can be performed faster, better a nd with less cost Transparency and timely access to information and regulatory decisions o Possibility for faster and wider sharing of information Consistency in regulatory activities/functions Good Governance Practices (GGP), reduced risk of corruption Collaboration, trust, and reliance among NMRAs Finally, participants agreed on the following working definition of the term \"standards\" and the scope as applies to this activity: Standards refer to the basis of measure, norms, and guidelines for regulatory IM S that would enable uniform data capture, a standardized data exchange platform and workflow of digitalized regulatory functions, leading to efficiencies and enhanced governance. MTaPS and PQM+ proposed three categories of regulatory IMS standards: Process or workflow standards , which define standards for pharmaceutical procedures, processes, or workflows. Examples include Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and International Organ ization for Standardization standards (ISOs). Pharmaceutical standard dictionaries and knowledge trees , which are master or reference lists for terminology, nomenclature, and hierarchies. Examples include Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Term s (SNOMED), Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification, and International Nonproprietary Name (INN). Data Exchange Standards , pertain to information and communications technology (ICT) and management information system (MIS) functions and determi ne how data should be structured, defined, and formatted to facilitate sharing across computer systems. Examples include Structured Product Labelling (SPL), Portable Document Format (PDF) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) and platforms such as Fast Heal th Interoperability Resources (FHIR\u00ae) which define a common standard for health systems data exchange. Next steps include agreeing on the proposed categories for the standards, developing selection criteria for a minimum set of common standards for regulatory IMS, reviewing existing standards to derive a set of minimum common standards, and finalizing the use case for the standards. These activities will be completed over the course of a six -month consultative process (Table 1). USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs Page | 31 BACKGROUND National medicines regulatory authorities (NMRAs) in low - and middle -income countries (LMICs) often lack fully operational information management systems (IMS) to perform regulatory functions. These systems are often disparate and lack interoperability or are none xistent, partially implemented, or nonfunctional. Many regulatory functions use paper -based systems, which results in inefficient workflows, backlogs and delays, lack of transparency, mismanagement, and vulnerability to corruption. Digitalization efforts a im to improve consistency, efficiency, and accountability in pharmaceutical regulatory service delivery. However, digitalization approaches vary across NMRAs, which often struggle with fully operationalizing their regulatory IMS, either desk -based or web -based systems, which limits the availability of real -time data and collaboration between NMRAs.9 Ongoing regional regulatory harmonization efforts in both Africa and Asia will rely not only on common documents and processes, but also shared regulatory IMS that are fully interoperable. This work increases the need for a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS to help clarify how regulatory IMS should capture and report information to promote system interoperability within national regulatory syste ms and support regulatory harmonization efforts. It is not feasible for countries to apply all the relevant standards to each regulatory IMS, so it is necessary to identify a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS that NMRAs should prioritize t o streamline their workflows and documentation of regulatory processes, ensure uniform data capture, and enable data exchange within and between NMRAs and other stakeholders. The USAID funded Medicines Technologies and Pharmaceutical Services (MTaPS) progr am and USAID funded Promoting Quality of Medicines Plus (PQM+) program will be engaging global stakeholders and subject matter experts to help identify and recommend a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS. The adoption of these common standar ds will streamline regulatory processes and help ensure that NMRAs make technical decisions with a degree of consistency and uniformity. Minimum common standards would also enhance the ability of NMRAs to collaborate and share information with one another, including use of reliance and recognition mechanisms. OBJECTIVES OF THE CONSULTATIVE PROCESS The primary objective of the consultative process is to derive and recommend a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS that will enable uniform data ca pture and standardize the data, 9 BEWSYS.

Specifically, MTaPS and PQM+ are convening a group of international stakeholders and subject matter experts to: Clearly identify the critical gaps and challenges NMRAs and other stakeholders are facing with regulatory IMS for the eight regulatory functions outlined in the WHO Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) for evaluation of national regulatory systems.10 Use existing relevant IMS and regulatory standards to derive a recommended set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS to address identified gaps and challenges. This includes developing the selection criteria for prioritizing which standards to include in the set of recommended standards. Develop the use case for the minimum common standards and help promote their adoption and use. Expected results of the Consultative process The consultation is expected to: Produce a set of minimum common standards for the eight GBT regulatory functions identified to support digitalization of regulatory IMS Sensitize global stakeholders in regulatory systems strengthening to the importance of adoption and institutionalization of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS Process MTaPS and PQM+ will facilitate a 6 -month consultative process with adopters and end users, global and regional regulatory experts, and funders to develop the set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS (Table 1). There are three primary groups of stakeholders involved in the consultative process: Adopters and end users. NMRAs are the primary stakeholder group as they are the users of the systems. Software developers and programmers, and managers/ administrators of regulatory IMS develop and manage the systems for NMRAs. Global and regional regulatory experts. This group includes the regional regulatory harmonization initiatives, other global and regional experts and normative bodies working in regulatory systems strengthening (RSS), and subject matter experts who can pro vide technical inputs on the recommended minimum common standards and promote the adoption and use of the standards. Examples of stakeholders in this group include WHO, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, South -East Asia Regulatory Network (SEARN), Africa n Union Development Agency - New Partnership for Africa's Development (AUDA -NEPAD), Association of Southeast 10 World Health Organization (2021). WHO Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) for evaluation of national regulatory systems.

This report documents the proceedings of the first consultative meeting, held virt ually on 15 September 2021. Also included in this report are the next steps with timeline and intermediate results in the consultative process (Table 1). Meeting Objectives The objectives of the first consultative meeting were to: Clearly identify the gaps and challenges NMRAs and other stakeholders are facing with regards to regulatory IMS Discuss the scope of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS Discuss how a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS can address or mitigate the identif ied gaps and challenges and start building a use case for the standards This meeting was structured around two sessions. The first session focused on clarifying the need for a minimum set of common standards for regulatory IMS. The presenters in this sessi on provided context for regulatory information system implementation in Africa and Asia and identified the primary benefits of digitalization of regulatory functions globally. In the second session, meeting participants discussed the role of regulatory IMS standards, and provided feedback on the proposed definition of these standards for the purpose of this activity, as well as strategies for organizing these standards and opportunities to implement regulatory IMS standards to address identified challenges. The meeting agenda can be found in Annex 1 A. Each session began with a review of the session's objectives, outputs, and discussion questions, followed by structured presentations. Presentations were followed by facilitated disc ussions in plenary. The online collaboration tool PollEv was used throughout the meeting to collect and display responses from participants in real time. A list of participants can be found in Annex 1B. Hany Abdallah of MTaPS partner U3 SystemsWork facilitated the meeting. SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS The following sections summarize the opening remarks, presentations, and ensuing discussions. All presentation slides are included in Annex 1C. Welcome and Int roductory Remarks The meeting facilitator, Hany Abdallah introduced herself and formally welcomed all participants to the meeting. She gave a brief overview of the agenda and introduced the introductory speakers. USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs Page | 34 Kofi Director, USAID MTaPS Program, MSH Mr. Aboagye -Nyame welcomed attendees and expressed thanks on behalf of the MTaPS and PQM+ programs to all the contributors and participants. He highlighted the importance of the meeting objectives to the MTaPS program's work across Afri ca and Asia in regulatory systems strengthening. He stressed the need to clarify how regulatory IMS should capture and report information to support system interoperability within national regulatory systems and support regulatory harmonization efforts at regional, sub -regional, continental, and global levels. Jude Nwokike, Vice President & Director, USAID PQM+ Program, USP Mr. Nwokike again thanked the participants and stressed the importance of this consultative process in achieving the joint activity obj ectives to identify and support the adoption of a minimum set of standards for regulatory information systems. He stated that the pharmaceutical sector is quite data -driven, from monographs to dossiers to labels and formularies, and data systems are not cu rrently advanced enough to adequately carry out and monitor these processes. He emphasized that there is tremendous value in leveraging regulatory information management systems to enable regulatory agencies to transform, unify, and drive exchange of stand ardized data to ensure safety. We all need to contribute towards ensuring that new information systems are deployed that are integrated and facilitate efficiency and transparency of regulatory operations. An ideal regulatory information management system should be: Integrated Cover all regulatory functions Reflect Good Regulatory Practices (GRP) Based on data standards Connect to computerized instruments and a network of database systems These systems should facilitate electronic transmis sion of regulatory data and enable the utilization of big data for regulatory decision making. This is a goal for the global community, particularly in low - and middle -income countries. Foundational to this goal is establishing standardized vocabularies an d terminologies. These are key enablers for meaningful discussion and form the bedrock of managing pharmaceutical products throughout the life cycle. Mr. Nwokike stressed the importance of the identification and adoption of a minimum set of relevant stand ards to guide the development of regulatory information systems, with tremendous potential benefits to regulatory agencies, manufacturers, and consumers of pharmaceutical products and services. Tobey Busch, Senior Pharmaceutical Management Advisor, USAID O ffice of Health Systems In her introductory remarks, Ms. Busch welcomed attendees on behalf of the USAID Office of Health Systems and stressed the importance of this first meeting in identifying a minimum set of regulatory information management system sta ndards and developing a use case for the standards. She emphasized the importance of this work in support of USAID's Vision for Health System Strengthening 2030.11 The Agency's pharmaceutical system strengthening approach laid out in this Vision focuses on advancing 11 USAID Vision for Health System Strengthe ning 2030, Washington DC, 2021. https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USAID_OHS_VISION_Report_FINAL_single_5082.pd f USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs Page | 35 country ownership and sustainability of health systems that are transparent and accountable, and use resources optimally to allow for effective, evidence -based decision making. A critical piece of this work includes helping NMRAs establish stabl e and functional regulatory systems. Furthermore, ongoing work in regional regulatory harmonization efforts in both Africa and Asia will rely not only on common documents and processes, but also shared regulatory information management systems that are ful ly interoperable. Ms. Busch reminded participants that their work throughout the consultative process will assist in this effort by creating a global good to help guide NMRAs in the development and strengthening of their regulatory information management s ystems. She concluded her remarks by emphasizing that the adoption of these common standards will help streamline regulatory processes and enhance the ability of NMRAs to collaborate and share information with one another, including use of reliance and re cognition mechanisms. Emmanuel Nfor, Technical Director, USAID MTaPS Program, MSH Mr. Nfor set the stage for the first session by providing some additional context for digitalization of regulatory processes. He stated that low - and middle -income countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America bear a significant proportion of the global burden of disease. NMRAs promote access to quality -assured, safe, and efficacious pharmaceutical products and combat substandard/falsified medical products to improve health out comes. Inefficient regulatory workflows, lack of transparency, mismanagement, and vulnerability to corruption undermine the ability of NMRAs in LMICs to effectively perform their designated regulatory functions. Digitalization of regulatory processes is in tended to improve consistency, efficiency, and accountability in regulatory services. He concluded by presenting the activity objectives and the meeting objectives for the first consultative meeting and thanking participants for their inputs. Session I: Clarifying the need Objective: Identify the critical gaps and challenges NMRAs and other stakeholders are facing regarding implementation of regulatory IMS Output: Critical gaps and challenges regarding regulatory IMS clearly identified Discussion Questions: What is the current landscape of regulatory IMS? What are the most critical challenges? How do these challenges vary across regions? How do these challenges vary, if at all, across regulatory functions? Presentation I: African Region \u2014current landscape of regulatory IMS and critical challenges faced by NMRAs The session began with a presentation by Mr. Abayomi Akinyemi, chair of the IMS technical committee for AUDA -NEPAD, reviewing the current progress of digitalization of regulatory functions and challenges faced in the African continent. USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs Page | 36 The African Medicine Regulatory Harmonization (AMRH) initiative provides a framework for regional economic bodies to implement regulatory harmonization and unify their r egulatory information management systems. Disparate and partially implemented regulatory IMS poses a threat to the AMRH initiative, as NMRAs are unable to produce the right information for sharing and exchange at the correct time. The various regional bodi es each have their own guidelines for harmonization and are in varying stages of implementation. The current situation by region is summarized in Figure 1. A recent scoping study conducted on behalf of AUDA -NEPAD and the World Bank found that only 26 NMRAs (47%) of the 55 AU member states have regulatory IMS and only 24 NMRAs (44%) use them in their daily operations.4 Further detail from the scoping study is available in the presentation slides, beginning on page 56 of this report in Annex 1C.

This includes: Capacity building for NMRAs on GRP Support NMRAs, Regional and Continental IMS in developing Policy, Process and Data Harmoni zation Standards and Quality for Regulatory Convergence Support in the process of implementing the common standards for regulatory IMS across the NMRAs, Regions and Continent Support in implementing Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) in alignment with regu latory IMS Support the NMRAs, Regions and Continent to implement e -Submission of regulatory documents using common standard in a predefined format (eCTD) Support AUDA -NEPAD IMS technical committee to implement Zanzibar model of Integrated Information Shari ng Platform He concluded his remarks by affirming that with common standards, policies and processes in place, a good regulatory information management system could be developed to support and provide an effective and efficient regulatory system across the regulatory functions as objectively defined in the WHO GBT requirements for countries with no IMS in place and, for regional and continental regulatory IMS. This will support seamless information sharing and information exchange among the NMRAs, regional bodies and continental body. With adequate support from the management of the continental body (AUDA -NEPAD), regional bodies (Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), East African Community (EAC), Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD ), Southern African Development Community (SADC), Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)), NMRAs (55 Member States), and development partners, common set of standards could be developed with an articulated clear use case for the regulatory IMS in Africa. USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs Page | 38 Presentation II: Asia Region \u2014current landscape of regulatory IMS and critical challenges faced by NMRAs The second presentation was given by Mr. Abdul Mughees Muddassir, Assistant Director, Quality Management System, Drug Regulatory Author ity of Pakistan (DRAP) and articulated the implementation of regulatory IMS in Pakistan as a case study from Asia. He identified regulatory IMS as a proposed solution to a multitude of challenges facing NMRAs in the region (Figure 2). Figure 4. Challenges Addressed by Regulatory IMS Mr. Muddassir presented several outcomes of successful regulatory IMS implementation that can serve to address many of the identified challenges (Figure 3). Figure 5. IMS Outcomes Additional information about regulatory processes supported by regulatory IMS and the implementation process in Pakistan is available in his presentation, beginning on page 65 in Annex 1C. He articulated several challenges to implement regulatory IMS in Pakistan, including developing standard determination, trainings, and relevant technical human resource capacity; digitization of records, integration, and USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs Page | 39 infrastructure; change management and resistance; and variations in regulations and regulated products. He concluded his remarks by emphasizing the positive outcomes from regulatory IMS implementation in Pakistan, namely improved operations, evidence -based decision making, openness and ea se of access, and harmonization, leading to ensured quality, safety, and efficacy of medical products. Facilitated Discussion I The first discussion was structured around three questions: What is the current landscape of regulatory IMS? What are the most c ritical challenges? How do these challenges vary across regions? How do these challenges vary, if at all, across regulatory functions? Participants identified the most critical challenges using PollEv, including lack of interoperability, lack of integratio n, varying requirements/standards for regulatory processes, cost, and political will. The complete list of challenges is included in Annex 1D. There was general agreement that the challenges to regulatory IMS implementation are consistent across regions. There are variations between the regions in terms of system maturity (both in terms of GBT levels and information system infrastructure) and the varying degrees of reliance/convergence that the regions have identified as the endp oint for their harmonization initiatives. These should be carefully considered over the course of this activity, and particularly when developing the institutionalization plan. A broader perspective from the Asia region would be helpful to articulate their regional harmonization strategy more fully, particularly where regulatory IMS are concerned. Participants noted that divergence across regulatory functions will increase with the complexity of the regulatory process concerned. Data -intensive processes and complex, multi -step and multi -stakeholder processes result in increased customization to national IMS and will make standardization more difficult without increased harmonization of regulatory processes. Participants stated that it would be helpful to use a regulatory process, e.g., drug recall to assess existing systems and standards and to identify challenges and gaps and what is needed to improve systems to support successful implementation in the selected use case. Presentation III: The primary benefi ts of digitalization of regulatory functions Mr. Alireza Khadem, Scientist for Regulatory Systems Strengthening at WHO gave the final presentation of the session, which articulated the primary benefits of digitalization of regulatory functions. Mr. Khadem opened his presentation noting that there is a large gap in terms of the assessment of digitalization of regulatory functions in the Global Benchmarking tool. Out of a total of 268 sub - indicators in the GBT, he identified eight that are relevant to digita lization. The complete list of relevant sub-indicators and their implementation status is included in the presentation slides included in Annex 1C. USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs Page | 40 Benchmarking and self -benchmarking in 84 countries from 2016 -2020 found that 6 4% of countries have publicly available and updated information on laws, regulations, guidelines, and procedures (Figure 4) and 33% use computerized systems to process information, manage records, and analyze data (Figure 5). Mr. Khadem noted that the mo st important benefits of digitalization include: Improved effectiveness, efficiency , and performance o Regulatory activities can be performed faster, better and with less cost Improved transparency and timely access to information and regulatory decisions o Possibility for faster and wider sharing of information Improved consistency in regulatory activities/functions Improved Good Governance Practices (GGP), reduced risk of corruption Improved collaboration, trust, and reliance among NMRAs He concluded his remarks by emphasizing that digitalization is a valuable tool to improve performance of a regulatory system and will result in improved implementation of Good Regulatory Practices (GRP) and Good Reliance Practices (GRelP) and facilitate convergence, harmonization, work -sharing, and reliance among NMRAs. However, NMRAs should have clear policy in this regard and include d igitalization of their regulatory functions in their strategic plans. In addition, digitalization needs proper planning, resources, and training as well as strong management commitment. Figure 6. GBT Indicator RS09.02 Figure 7. GBT Indicator RS09.08 USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs Page | 41 Session II: The role of regulatory IMS standards Objective: Discuss how a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS can best address or mitigate these challenges Output: The scope of the standards identified for addressing the most critical gaps and challenges associated with regulatory IMS Discussion Questions: Which of the identified challenges should we try to solve given the diversity of identified needs with respect to regulatory IMS? What should be the scope/definition of \"minimum common standards\" for regulatory IMS? How will these standards address or mitigate the identified challenges? Presentation I: \"Minimum Common Standards\" \u2014Proposed Definition and Scope The first presentation in Session II was given by Kate Kikule Principal Technical Advisor, Regulatory Systems Strength ening, USAID MTaPS. She opened by presenting the definition of the term \"standards\" that MTaPS and PQM+ propose for this activity (Figure 6). Figure 8. Definition of \"Standards\" MTaPS and PQM+ have identified three primary categories of relevant standards: Process or workflow standards , which define standards for pharmaceutical procedures, processes, or workflows. Examples include Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and International Organization for Standardization standards (ISOs). Pharmaceutical standard dictionaries and knowledge trees , which are master or reference lists for terminology, nomenclature, and hierarchies. Examples include Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED), Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC), and International Nonproprietary Name (INN). \"Standards\" refer to: Basis of measure Norms Guidelines for regulatory IMS Would enable uniform: Data capture Standardized data exchange platform Workflow of digitalized regulatory functions Leading to: Efficiencies Enhanced governance of regulatory functions Harmonized exchange of regulatory information USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs Page | 42 Data Exchange Standards ,12,13 pertain to information and communications te chnology (ICT) and management information system (MIS) functions and determine how data should be structured, defined, and formatted to facilitate sharing across computer systems. Examples include Structured Product Labelling (SPL), Portable Document Forma t (PDF) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) and platforms such as Fast Health Interoperability Given this definition and these proposed categories, MTaPS and PQM+ proposed that standards as applicable to the eight regulatory functions as defined in the WH O GBT5 be considered for inclusion in the minimum set of standards for regulatory IMS. Low -level data elements such as date, location, time, and support functions to the regulatory system, such as finance and human resources should be excluded from conside ration. Presentation II: Opportunities to leverage existing global RSS initiatives to address challenges and need to standardize regulatory IMS The final presentation of the day was given by Dr. Murray Lumpkin M.D., M.Sc., Deputy Director - Integrated Dev elopment, Lead for Global Regulatory Systems Initiatives, at The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Dr. Lumpkin began by sharing the Gates Foundation's experiences with IMS initiatives for NMRAs. He reflected that regulatory IMS efforts tend to be time and financially resource intensive, result in little progress or impact, and are frustrating. Coming up with a set of minimum standards aligned with the WHO Global Benchmarking Tool modules would be very helpful in focusing people and defining individual effo rts to develop IT systems. Dr. Lumpkin emphasized that IMS is a tool to support regulatory functions and is not the driver of those functions. As such, the business case and end users, rather than the information system technical experts, should drive syst em design and development. Regulatory IMS need to address internal operational functionalities, including workflow management (over the life cycle of the product, including digitalization of submissions and reports), performance metric tracking and reporti ng, financial management, and legacy data accessibility. Systems should also address external connectivity including maintaining confidentiality with other NMRAs and transparency with outside stakeholders. The use -case for systems should be clearly defined to support regulatory functions and processes. Later in the presentation, Dr. Lumpkin noted that regulators in LMICs aspire to have functional IMS that facilitate their regulatory work and facilitate collaboration with peer regulators and communication wi th the regulated community. Design and implementation challenges, including potentially prohibitive initial and ongoing costs, as well as the need for alignment with Ministry and other systems pose major obstacles to the development and execution of custom or commercially available regulatory IMS. Without a common set of minimum core requirements and standards for regulatory IMS, countries, regions, and their platform developers risk creating platforms that do not meet core and minimal expectations of regul ators and the regulated community. Multiple iterations of a platform may be 12 Defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (n.d.) as guiding the \"representation, format, definition, structuring, tagging, transmission, manipulation, use, and management of data.\" https://www.epa.gov/data - standards/learn -about -data-standards 13 According to the US Federal Drug Authority, a data standard is a \"set of rules on how a particular type of data should be structured, defined, formatted, or exchanged between Page | 43 required to arrive at a meaningful product, at high cost in terms of both time and financial resources. Making available open -source platforms that meet the to -be-agreed -upon IMS s tandards will be key to enabling these resource -limited agencies to enhance their operational capabilities. Dr. Lumpkin concluded his remarks by noting that we do not need to start from scratch - many IMS solutions exist, and many agencies and regions hav e made efforts to develop their own bespoke systems. Hopefully, a set of minimum standards will allow development of commercial, off the shelf solutions and provide a framework for updating existing solutions to meet these requirements as needed. Facilitat ed Discussion II Participants began the discussion by reviewing the proposed definition of \"standards\" - they were in agreement with the definition proposed: \"Standards, as used in this activity, refer to the basis of measure, norms, and guidelines for regulatory IMS that would enable uniform data capture, a standardized data exchange platform and workflow of digitalized regulatory functions, leading to efficiencies and enhanced governance.\" Regarding the proposed categories for structurin g the set of minimum common standards (Process or workflow standards, Pharmaceutical standard dictionaries and knowledge trees, and Data Exchange Standards) and the inclusion and exclusion criteria, participants suggested the following modifications: Data exchange standards should be broadened to include data standards, e.g., GS1 prescribed master data standards for pharmaceutical products Information security, cybersecurity, and business continuity standards should be considered for inclusion (alongside IS O 9001) Product and location identification standards should be considered for inclusion Traceability standards should be considered for inclusion Participants also proposed that the activity should consider developing a common core business use case for t he regulatory processes being digitalized as a starting point for the selection of a minimum common set of standards. Finally, the participants used PollEv to identify how a minimum set of common standards can address or mitigate the challenges identified in Session I ( Annex 1D). The most mentioned themes included: 1. Set common \"language\"/system designs/system architecture 2. Reduced cost of regulatory IMS system implementation 3. Improved regulatory IMS design capabilities 4. Increased transparency/enhanced information sharing 5. Improved efficiency CLOSE OUT & NEXT STEPS To conclude the meeting, an overview of the consultative process and next steps for the activity was provided on behalf of the MTaPS and PQM+ programs by Dr. Sou ly Phanouvong. These are summarized in Table 1, below. Lawrence Evans, the Technical Director of the PQM+ program provided closing remarks. USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs Page | 44 Table 1.

He proceeded to affirm that the ideal situation for regulatory systems would include a seamless, uninhibited, constant flow of information between and within NMRAs, but it will take some time to get there. This group has t he opportunity to establish the pathway to that goal, through the development of these minimum standards that are appropriately tailored to NMRAs for the development of their regulatory IMS and their capacity to implement them.

Minimum Common Standards for Regulatory Information Management Systems in Low - and Middle -Income Countries Report of the 2nd Consultative Meeting Held October 27, 2021 99 About the USAID MTaPS Program Funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by a team led by Management Sciences for Health (MSH), the purpose of the five -year Medicines Technologies and Pharmaceutical Services (MTaPS) program (2018 -2023) is to provide p harmaceutical system strengthening assistance for sustained improvements in health system performance and to advance USAID's goals of preventing child and maternal deaths, controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and combating infectious disease threats, as well as expanding essential health coverage. The goal of the MTaPS Program is to help low - and middle -income countries (LMICs) strengthen their pharmaceutical systems to ensure sustainable access to and appropriate use of safe, effective, quality assured, and affordable essential medicines, vaccines, and other health technologies and pharmaceutical services. About the USAID PQM+ Program The Promoting the Quality of Medicines Plus (PQM+) program is a USAID funded cooperative agreement with the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) with a goal to sustainably strengthen medical product quality assurance (QA) systems by providing technical assistance to manufacturers of priority health products and build in -country capacity of Medicines Regulatory Authorities to impro ve product registration, inspection, and post -marketing surveillance for product quality. PQM+ support also includes accreditation of national drug quality control laboratories per ISO/IEC 17025 and/or WHO pre - qualification standards in low -and middle -income countries. PQM+ uses a system strengthening approach to program implementation to enhance sustainability.14 The program considers the entire system when designing and delivering technical assistance, focusing on the interaction among all health systems functions15 as they relate to medical product quality assurance. To implement PQM+, USP joined forces with a diversified consortium of four core partners, six field -led extension partners, and eight technical resource partners16 whose extensive technical e xpertise can be drawn on to achieve desired results.

The meeting is the second in a series of consultations aimed at identifying and recommending a set of minimum common standards for regulatory information management systems (IMS) that will enable uniform data capture and standardize the data, design, and workflow of digitalized regulatory functions. The meeting brought together experts in regulatory system strengthening and information man agement systems from 17 global, regional, and national organizations and the objectives were to: Develop the use case for the set of minimum common standards Identify the selection criteria for the minimum common standards Regarding the development of the use case for the standards, MTaPS and PQM+ noted that this needs to involve identifying the potential benefits of adopting minimum common standards for the different stakeholder groups. Potential benefits of adoption includ e creation of a common reference among stakeholders for the development and use of regulatory IMS; streamlining of NMRAs' internal operations; and facilitating convergence and harmonization of regulatory services both within and across NMRAs. Meeting parti cipants acknowledged these benefits and discussed the need to learn from previous efforts of other organizations that have developed and promulgated standards. This could help identify a suitable process for identifying relevant stakeholders, and for devel oping and promoting the standards. Participants debated whether the GBT modules/regulatory functions or the pharmaceutical product life cycle should be used to structure further work on the standards and the use case. Participants agreed that the product should be in the center of their thinking, and that the regulatory functions at each stage in the product life cycle should be examined individually to identify relevant stakeholders and build the use cases. Using this suggestion, meeting participants did some preliminary work identifying potential stakeholders for the different regulatory functions aligned with the various stages of the product life cycle. However, no final determination was made regarding the key stakeholders for developing use cases dur ing the time allotted for the session. The key selection criteria that MTaPS and PQM+ proposed for selecting the minimum common standards were: Relevance\u2014the standard should be critical for at least one of the eight core regulatory functions as defined in the WHO GBT Feasibility of application \u2014the extent to which NMRAs' capacity and resources feasibly allow adoption and what are the anticipated efficiency gains Priority\u2014what would countries benefit or lose by not applying a given standard Universality\u2014whether a given standard is recommended by WHO and extent to which it is widely used However, participants raised concerns about how best to apply these criteria and noted that in some cases the determinations would have to be country specific. Much of the d eliberation centered on the 104 inclusion or exclusion of process standards - several participants proposed that we differentiate between standards and guidelines and asserted that including both was outside the proposed scope of the activity and confounded th e activity objectives. Further, some meeting participants were concerned about the extent to which the applying the criteria aligned with the scope of the activity, and the extent to which the objective was focused on system design versus the system conte nts. The meeting participants further urged the team to revisit the definitions and the proposed scoring (1 being low priority, 3 being high priority) of the criteria. Given the depth of the meeting discussions, MTaPS and PQM+ noted the need revisit the co nsultative process and the proposed approach for the use case development and standards selection. The next steps include a rethinking of the process and a potential revision of the background document for recirculation to the participants for reactions an d feedback. Recommendations and next steps for MTaPS and PQM+ that emerged from the meeting include: Draft the use case and share with meeting participants for feedback Map the regulatory functions to the product life cycle and use the resulting matrix to identify relevant stakeholders. Use the feedback from the meeting to rethink the selection criteria and share with the meeting participants for feedback. Share the full list of standards identified from the desk review with participants for review against the revised selection criteria MTaPS and PQM+ committed to follow up on the next steps. 105 BACKGROUND National medicines regulatory authorities (NMRAs) in low - and middle -income countries (LMICs) often lack fully operational information management sys tems (IMS) to perform regulatory functions. These systems are often disparate and lack interoperability or are nonexistent, partially implemented, or nonfunctional. Many regulatory functions use paper -based systems, which results in inefficient workflows, backlogs and delays, lack of transparency, mismanagement, and vulnerability to corruption. Digitalization efforts aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and accountability in pharmaceutical regulatory service delivery. However, digitalization approaches v ary across NMRAs, which often struggle with fully operationalizing their regulatory IMS, either desk -based or web -based systems, which limits the availability of real -time data and collaboration between NMRAs.17 Ongoing regional regulatory harmonization ef forts in both Africa and Asia will rely not only on common documents and processes, but also shared regulatory IMS that are fully interoperable. This work increases the need for a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS to help clarify how regulatory IMS should capture and report information to promote system interoperability within national regulatory systems and support regulatory harmonization efforts. It is not feasible for countries to apply all the relevant standards to each regulatory IMS, so it is necessary to identify a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS that NMRAs should prioritize to streamline their workflows and documentation of regulatory processes, ensure uniform data capture, and enable data exchange within and betw een NMRAs and other stakeholders. The USAID funded Medicines Technologies and Pharmaceutical Services (MTaPS) program and USAID funded Promoting Quality of Medicines Plus (PQM+) program will be engaging global stakeholders and subject matter experts to hel p identify and recommend a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS. The adoption of these common standards will streamline regulatory processes and help ensure that NMRAs make technical decisions with a degree of consistency and uniformity. Mini mum common standards would also enhance the ability of NMRAs to collaborate and share information with one another, including use of reliance and recognition mechanisms. OBJECTIVES OF THE CONSULTATIVE PROCESS MTaPS and PQM+ will facilitate a consultative p rocess with adopters and end users, global and regional regulatory experts, and funders to develop the set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS (Annex 2A). The primary objective of the consultative process is to derive and recommend a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS that will enable uniform data capture and standardize the data, 17 BEWSYS.

Spec ifically, MTaPS and PQM+ are convening a group of international stakeholders and subject matter experts to: Clearly identify the critical gaps and challenges NMRAs and other stakeholders are facing with regulatory IMS for the eight regulatory functions out lined in the WHO Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) for evaluation of national regulatory systems. 18 Use existing relevant IMS and regulatory standards to derive a recommended set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS to address identified gaps and c hallenges. This includes developing the selection criteria for prioritizing which standards to include in the set of recommended standards. Develop the use case for the minimum common standards and help promote their adoption and use. There are three prima ry groups of stakeholders involved in the consultative process: Adopters and end users. NMRAs are the primary stakeholder group as they are the users of the systems. Software developers and programmers, and managers/ administrators of regulatory IMS develo p and manage the systems for NMRAs. Global and regional regulatory experts. This group includes the regional regulatory harmonization initiatives, other global and regional experts and normative bodies working in regulatory systems strengthening (RSS), and subject matter experts who can provide technical inputs on the recommended minimum common standards and promote the adoption and use of the standards. Examples of stakeholders in this group include WHO, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, South -East Asia Regulatory Network (SEARN), African Union Development Agency - New Partnership for Africa's Development (AUDA -NEPAD), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other regional economic communities, and pharmaceutical industry associations. Funders. This group supports RSS development and implementation and may overlap with the global regulatory experts' group. Examples include the World Bank and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Expected results of the Consultative pr ocess The consultation is expected to: Produce a set of minimum common standards for the eight GBT regulatory functions identified to support digitalization of regulatory IMS Sensitize global stakeholders in regulatory systems strengthening to the importan ce of adoption and institutionalization of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS 18 World Health Organization (2021).

SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS The following section s summarize the opening remarks, presentations, and ensuing discussions. Annex 2C includes all the presentation slides. Welcome and Introductory Remarks The meeting facilitator, Tamara Hafner, MTaPS Principal Technical Advisor, welcomed participants who joined virtually from 17 organizations ( Annex 2 B). The USAID MTaPS Program Director, Kofi Aboagye - Nyame, gave opening remarks and thanked everyone for their collaboration. He expressed the importance of improving regulatory standards and access to quality medicines for LMICs, citing the similarity in challenges across LMICs in Africa and Asia for establishing regulatory IMS interoperability, integration, and other requirements. He stated that this group of global experts, led by the USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs, is working to address a gap that will meet a global need to assist countries adopt uniform standards for regulatory IMS and facilitate smooth exchange of information and data. He wished all fruit ful deliberations in the exercise. Activity Background and Recap of Previous Consultative Meeting To set the stage for the meeting, Lawrence Evans, Technical Director, USAID PQM+ Program summarized the overarching consultative process and reviewed the outc omes of the previous consultative meeting (held September 15, 2021). The objectives of the previous (first) meeting were to: Clearly identify the gaps and challenges NMRAs and other stakeholders are facing with regards to regulatory IMS Discuss the scope of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS Discuss how a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS can address or mitigate the identified gaps and challenges and start building a use case for the standards 108 At the first meeting, meeting p articipants discussed the importance of establishing minimum standards, which was a preliminary step in developing the use case. Participants also identified several challenges that might impede the establishment of common minimum standards, such as: Interoperability with the international systems with which LMIC national systems must communicate Costs that may be prohibitive and impact sustainability of the systems Political will and commitment to fund and implement the systems Participants in the first me eting also agreed on a starting definition for standards that would guide the process of establishing minimum common standards throughout the remainder of the consultative process. Standards were defined as the basis of measures, norms, and guidelines for regulatory IMS that would enable uniform data capture, a standardized data exchange platform and workflow of digitalized regulatory functions , leading to efficiencies and enhanced governance for regulatory IMS. MTaPS and PQM+ also proposed three categories for the minimum standards, as follows.: Process and workflow standards (e.g., good manufacturing practices) Standard dictionaries, knowledge trees standard, (e.g., international nonproprietary names) Data exchange standards (e.g., CTD and FHIR) These outc omes lay the foundation for the second consultative meeting, which aims to develop a use case for the set of minimum common standards and the selection criteria for the standards. Session I: Developing the Use Case for Regulatory IMS Standards Objective: To clearly define the importance of adopting the minimum common standards and the challenges they will address for NMRAs and other relevant stakeholders. Output: Draft of key points on the use case to be used in drafting the advocacy brief Discussion Questions: Initial reactions and reflections on the presentation Other than NMRAs, who are the target actors/stakeholders for these standards? What are the critical needs that these standards should address for each stakeholder group? What is the ultimate value for each stakeholder group? Presentation I Kate Kikule, Principal Technical Advisor, Regulatory Systems Strengthening, USAID MTaPS, presented an overview of some of the existing standards and some potential benefits to start the discussion of the use case. She also reviewed the working definition o f standards agreed upon in the previous meeting and the key challenges identified, which are also summarized in the Activity Background and Recap of Previous Consultative Meeting section above. Her overview also explained how the standards would address those challenges and serve as a reference for software development. The potential benefits for the standards include: Creation of a single language or common reference for use among regulators, software developers, and policy makers for regulatory IMS 109 Guidance for the development of regulatory IMS as they are incorporated into software requirement specifications used by software developers to design regulatory IMS software Streamlining NMRAs' internal operations suc h as workflow management throughout the life cycle of medical products, performance metric tracking, and reporting Facilitation of the convergence and harmonization of regulatory services both within and outside of a defined national regulatory authority The overview presented considerations for adoption of standards by countries and other stakeholders, such as advocacy needs, guidance (or a roadmap) for adoption and dissemination to development partners. Her presentation also included illustrative examples of each category of standards. The full presentation is included in Annex 2C. Facilitated Discussion I Initial reactions and reflections to the presentation centered around the proposed benefits to the implementation and adopti on of the standards. Participants emphasized the importance of a common language for use by stakeholders in different countries, especially from the perspective of those working on the collection of safety data. The adoption of these standards will also al low for interoperability considerations to be included during system design, rather than retroactively updating systems after launch, which is a much more resource - and time -intensive process. Participants recognized that the potential benefits apply to bo th LMICs and countries that currently employ advanced regulatory IMS and underscored the need to develop multiple use cases for the standards. Several contributors suggested that the discussion of standards should be more inclusive of standards for medicin es, medical devices, and combination products to ensure inclusion of devices for the systems we are discussing (e.g., close relationship between needles and vaccines/insulin as devices and medicines that are used in combination). The USAID MTaPS and PQM+ p rograms explained that as a result of the desk review exercise, 56 relevant standards were identified. This full list of examples will be shared for review against the selection criteria following the meeting, as part of the consultative process. Participa nts were asked to identify the target actors and stakeholders for the regulatory IMS standards and were prompted to consider the use case for NMRAs as a starting point. One response suggested that the team examine the experiences of other standard setting organizations (e.g., Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences) to identify stakeholders at each point in the regulatory process (e.g., development, clinical trials, registration, surveillance, pharmacovigilance, procurement, waste). This led to a comprehensive discussion of how the standards should be organized/framed and how the participants should think about stakeholder identification for the development of the use cases. Participants debated whether the GBT modules/regulatory function s or the pharmaceutical product life cycle should be used to structure further work on the standards and the use case. One participant referred to a WHO graphic that overlays the GBT modules with the product life cycle and suggested this could be used as a starting point. The meeting organizers located and projected the graphic for participants to discuss (figure 1). 110 Figure 1. WHO Global Benchmarking Modules and Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle19 Participants agreed that the product should be in the center of their thinking, and that the regulatory functions at each stage in the product life cycle should be examined individually to identify relevant stakeholders and build the use cases. It was suggested that just looking at regulatory functions may mi ss key points in the product lifecycle that should be considered for adoption of the standards, for example the clinical perspective. Several stakeholders or categories of stakeholders were then proposed by various participants. No final determination was made regarding the key stakeholders for developing use cases during the time allotted for the session. The initial stakeholders discussed during the session are: Borrowing from the pharmaceutical inspection cooperation scheme (PICS) process, which is revising the risk mitigation guidance document for PICS member states, some categories that we can build into the various stages of the product life cycle are: o Primary audience, such as NMRA, contract research organizations o Stakeholders expected to comply with the standards (e.g., manufacturers, distributors, procurement agencies) o Those who make the decisions to implement the standards (e.g., policy makers) o Those involved in the process of implementation of the standards (e.g., disease programs, development /implementing partners, donor, and funding organizations, etc.) 19 World Health Organization.

This was noted for further discussion and for future development of guidance documents for adopti on that will be developed following the selection of the standards. Next steps: Internal exercise to share with group for reaction/review: Overlay appropriate international standards on the product lifecycles in the slide (e.g., those in the slide, IMDRF, ICH, ISO, etc.) and then as a matrix approach look at who are the stakeholders to which they are applicable. Questions to consider: o To whom would these standards add value and how do we rank them by priority here? o What are the critical needs that these sta ndards should address for each stakeholder group? o What are potential consequences for each group if the standards are not adopted? o What are some necessary preconditions for adoption? Session II: Identifying Selection Criteria for Minimum Common Standards Objective: Identify the criteria the group will use to select the regulatory REGULATORY IMS standards Output: List of selection criteria Discussion Question: In light of the challenges identified and our agreed -on use cases, what should be the selection criteria? Presentation II 112 Chinwe U. Owunna, Senior Manager, Health Elements, USAID PQM+ Program provided an overview, which started with a recap of agreed upon approaches from the first consultative meeting. Participants of the first consul tation had agreed: That the standards are applicable to 8 regulatory functions defined in WHO GBT That we would exclude low -level data elements (e.g., date, location, time) and support functions to the regulatory system (e.g., finance, human resources). The overview summarized the desk review that was conducted internally since the 1st consultative mtg as having yielded 56 standards grouped as follows: Process or workflow standards Pharmaceutical standard dictionaries and knowledge trees standards Data exchange standards Participants were invited to add to the list any standards that they feel that the desk review missed when it will be shared with them for review. Since we are aiming to trim down the list, the ensuing discussion would identify selection criteria for doing so. An example of how we might apply selection criteria was provided for discussion purposes (figure 2). The complete presentation is available in Annex 2C. Figure 2. Selection Criteria Application Example Facilitated Discussion II Following the presentation and example exercise, participants extensively discussed the proposed scope of the activity, categories of the standards, and selection criteria. Much of the deliberation centered on the inclusion or ex clusion of process standards - several participants proposed that we differentiate between standards and guidelines and asserted that including both was outside the proposed scope of the activity and confounded the activity objectives. Others saw the benef it of including these process 113 standards or guidelines as a way to identify and harmonize the regulatory processes that are being digitalized. In this framing, the process standards can be thought of as prerequisites to the application of the data dictionar ies and knowledge trees and data exchange standards . The need to identify existing tools and standards for each regulatory process and identify gaps was also discussed. Participants proposed that non -existent standards to fill gaps and enable LMICs to coll aborate in this space should be considered for inclusion in the scope of the activity. This portion of the discussion concluded with participants wondering whether the scope of the activity should be on system design or rather the content of the system - is there a need to harmonize NMRA regulatory processes from the pre -clinical to post marketing product life cycle stages according to WHO GBT regulatory process requirements, before the selection of standards can be considered? In terms of the selection cri teria, participants discussed the addition of whether NMRAs have a legal mandate to implement a given standard, which turned the discussion to whether the proposed selection criteria could be applied generically to each standard, or whether individual coun try context needed to be considered when applying the selection criteria. Some participants stated that the selection would need to be done on a country -by-country basis, while others expressed that the selection criteria should be refined to be applicable internationally. Participants also requested clarification on the definitions for the rankings of 1, 2, and 3 for the exercise, and expanded definitions of each of the selection criteria and their relationships and/or weights relative to one another. In response to the feedback and discussions during this session, the USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs referenced the agreed definition of standards , which includes three elements - measures, norms, and guidelines for regulatory IMS for this exercise. The activity is geared towards the end user and guiding software development, which is why guidelines are included in the definition. This exercise is geared toward putting forward standards that countries can adopt, whether their processes are digitalized or not. The underlying regulatory processes must be clear and strong for any digitalization to be successful. The emphasis is on strengthening the system and ideally but not necessarily digitalizing the system for improved efficiency. Participants will have opportuni ty to review and add to the standards produced by the desk review and provide feedback on the proposed definitions for the selection criteria and other aspect of the standards selection process. Given the depth of the discussion during the meeting, the USAID MTaPS and PQM+ programs stated that they need to take a step back to consider these points and the consultative process. The next steps include a rethinking of the process and a potential revision of the background document for recirculation to the part icipants for reactions and feedback. CLOSE OUT & NEXT STEPS Comfort Ogar, Principal Technical Advisor, Pharmacovigilance USAID MTaPS Program, and Tamara Hafner delivered closing remarks, recapping the meeting's developments. The discussions highlighted the need to reconsider how the activity is defining the prioritization of selection criteria, the scope, and clarify the communication around it. Discussions were rich with feedback and ideas for how to reconsider these issues. Souly Phanouvong, Senior Techn ical Advisor, RSS, USAID PQM+ Program summarized the next steps for the consultative process as outlined in the original background document for the consultation. Based on this meeting's discussions, this process will be revised and reshared with the group for feedback and 114 agreement. Annex 2A shows the revised consultative process, based on the outcomes of the second consultative meeting. The following action items were identified during the meeting: Share the meeting report with in the next three weeks with participants Revise consultative process and background document and share with participants for feedback Propose selection criteria with revised definitions for the group's input Share the full list of standards identified fro m the desk review with participants for review against the selection criteria Organizers will draft use case and share for review, additional input, and feedback 115 ANNEX 2A: OUTLINE OF THE CONSULTATIVE PROCESS Time (Approx.)

It was the third in a series of consultations aimed at identifying and recommending a set of minimum common standards for regulatory information management systems ( REGULATORY IMS ) that national medicines regulatory authorities (NM RAs) should prioritize to streamline their workflows and documentation of regulatory processes, ensure uniform data capture, and enable data exchange within and between NMRAs and other stakeholders. The meeting brought together NMRA experts in pharmaceuti cal regulatory systems and information management systems from 11 countries in Africa and Asia. The main purpose of the meeting was to: Provide an overview of the process for identifying a set of minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS , including defi ning the scope, objectives, benefits, and the standards selection process. During this meeting, the importance and benefits of a minimum set of standards for REGULATORY IMS and the challenges with its adoption was discussed. The discussions were structure d around the two presentations given at the beginning of each session, and a set of session -specific questions. As discussed during the meeting, the PQM+ and MTaPS programs proposed that the adoption of a minimum set of common standards for regulatory IMS will: Create a single language or common reference for use among regulators, software developers, and policymakers for REGULATORY IMS ; Guide the development of standards for REGULATORY IMS as developers incorporate them into software requirement specifica tions (SRS) to design REGULATORY IMS software; Streamline NMRAs' internal operations such as workflow management throughout the life cycle of medical products, performance metric tracking, and reporting; and Facilitate convergence and harmonization of regu latory services both within and outside a defined national regulatory authority. Meeting participants acknowledged these benefits; during the first session, NMRA participants identified the following challenges regarding REGULATORY IMS in their settings: Lack of information technology (IT) materials, software, infrastructure, servers, and professionals to develop these systems; Improper integration or non -existent IMS for regulatory processes; Low internet connectivity, data storage, and backup systems for regulatory information; Low financial resources and time constraints to develop or improve REGULATORY IMS ; and Outsourced and expensive software developers sometimes create systems that are not iterative, resulting in manual interventions and a fragmente d approach to the automation of regulatory business processes. 148 Participants discussed how to address these challenges with the adoption of minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS . Attendees noted that minimum common standards can mitigate these challenges by: Providing appropriate technical support and capacity building for related IMS platforms to help minimize errors and increase the accuracy of data capture; Supporting reliance, harmoniza tion, and information exchange to optimize regulatory resources; Guaranteeing transparency and uniformity of activities, providing a structured framework for communication between the regulatory functions; Improving and facilitating the product registratio n process in a timely manner; Pressuring each regulatory authority to procure minimum equipment; Encouraging NMRAs to adopt best practices from countries with stronger or more mature regulatory systems to improve technical capabilities; Helping NMRAs better manage their policies and processes to achieve specific objectives and outcomes; and Supporting good documentation practices within NMRA functions. The complete list of responses by meeting attendees to the four formulated questions is in the Facilitated Discussion I section. Session II of the meeting introduced the methodology for the desk review exercise conducted by PQM+ and MTaPS, which identified 56 regulatory standards organized into three catego ries: 1. Process or workflow standards 2. Data dictionary and knowledge tree standards 3. Data exchange standards The session also presented the four selection criteria and process that NMRA participants and other stakeholders will use to identify a minimum set of common standards from the list of 56 to prioritize for adoption. The selection criteria are: 1. Relevance: applicable to at least one of the eight core regulatory functions as defined in the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT). 2. Feasibility of application: the extent to which NMRAs' capacity and resources feasibly allow adoption. 3. Criticality: whether the standard is critical (or required) to gain efficiencies in workflow and processes for at least one regulatory function. 4. Universalit y: how widely a standard is used (e.g., recommended by large normative bodies, industry -wide standards, etc.). Meeting attendees were also prompted to respond to following questions: 1. What regulatory data standards have you adopted in your country? 2. What is your feedback on the selection criteria used by PQM+/MTaPS to determine minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS ? 3. Do you have any suggestions on how these minimum common standards should be selected? 149 Based on the ensuing discussion, many countries are applying some of the standards identified in the original desk review. Participants recommended that PQM+ and MTaPS consider including flexibility, universality, and/or harmonization as part of the selection criteria for minimum common standards. They als o discussed next steps in the engagement process to set the expectations and outline the steps and timeline for completion of the selection process for a minimum set of standards for REGULATORY IMS. The meeting closed with thanks to all attendees for their active engagement throughout the meeting and a reiterated request for attendees to work with their colleagues to complete the standard selection activity as presented during the meeting. 150 BACKGROUND National medicines regulatory authorities (NMRAs) in lo w- and middle -income countries (LMICs) often lack fully operational information management systems (IMS) to perform regulatory functions. These systems are often disparate and lack interoperability or are nonexistent, partially implemented, or nonfunctiona l. Many regulatory functions use paper -based systems, which results in inefficient workflows, backlogs and delays, lack of transparency, mismanagement, and vulnerability to corruption. Digitalization efforts aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and acco untability in pharmaceutical regulatory service delivery. However, digitalization approaches vary across NMRAs, which often struggle with fully operationalizing their regulatory IMS ( REGULATORY IMS ), either desk -based or web -based systems. This limits the availability of real -time data and collaboration between NMRAs. Ongoing regional regulatory harmonization efforts in Africa and Asia will rely not only on common documents and processes, but also shared REGULATORY IMS that are fully interoperable. This wor k increases the need for a set of minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS to help clarify how these systems should capture and report information to promote interoperability within national regulatory systems and support regulatory harmonization effort s. It is not feasible for countries to apply all the relevant standards to each REGULATORY IMS , so it is necessary to identify a set of minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS that NMRAs should prioritize to streamline their workflows and documentatio n of regulatory processes, ensure uniform data capture, and enable data exchange within and between NMRAs and other stakeholders. Two USAID -funded programs \u2014 Medicines, Technologies, and Pharmaceutical Services (MTaPS) and Promoting the Quality of Medicine s Plus (PQM+) \u2014 will engage global stakeholders and subject matter experts to help identify and recommend a set of minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS . The adoption of these common standards will streamline regulatory processes and help ensure that NMRAs make technical decisions with a degree of consistency and uniformity. Minimum common standards would also enhance the ability of NMRAs to collaborate and share information, including use of reliance and recognition mechanisms. 151 OBJECTIVES OF THE CONSULTATIVE PROCESS The primary objective of the consultative process is to derive and recommend a set of minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS that will enable uniform data capture and standardize the data, design, and workflow of digitalized regul atory functions. Specifically, PQM+ and MTaPS are convening national medicine regulatory authorities' representatives in Africa and Asia to: Clearly identify the critical gaps and challenges NMRAs face regarding REGULATORY IMS for the eight regulatory func tions outlined in the WHO Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) for evaluation of national regulatory systems. Use existing relevant IMS and regulatory standards to derive a recommended set of minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS to address identified gaps and challenges. This includes using defined selection criteria for prioritizing the standards to include in the set of recommended minimum standards. Develop the use case for the minimum common standards and help promote their adoption and use. 152 WELCOME AND INTRODUCTORY REMARKS Kofi Aboagye -Nyame, Program Director, USAID MTaPS Program, MSH Mr. Aboagye -Nyame welcomed attendees and highlighted the importance of the meeting objectives and the benefits to NMRAs. He briefly described how the MTaPS Program's ac tivities support regulatory systems strengthening in Africa and Asia. He stressed the need for support and collaboration at the national level, to build institutional capacity, and to strengthen regional convergence and harmonization. He emphasized that es tablishing regulatory standards in addition to other regulatory system strengthening efforts will help advance NMRA goals to achieve higher maturity levels (according to the WHO GBT) to provide effective regulatory services to their populations. In closing , he highlighted that this important work aims to address a gap that will support better data and information exchange within and between regulatory authorities and to promote regulatory harmonization and convergence within regions. Jude Nwokike, Vice Pre sident and Director, USAID Promoting the Quality of Medicines Plus (PQM+) Program, USP Mr. Nwokike welcomed attendees and reiterated the importance of this effort led by USAID's PQM+ and MTaPS programs. He emphasized that every regulatory agency PQM+ assis ts has at some point explored ways to use information management tools to improve the processes and documentation of one or more aspects of their regulatory function. He stated that REGULATORY IMS in many LMICs currently are fragmented and do not serve the needs of the agencies, partly due to insufficient use of defined common standards. He stressed that efforts to retool and develop new information management systems for regulatory and quality assurance activities need to consider a REGULATORY IMS that is integrated, facilitates efficiency, and ensures transparency in regulatory operations. Mr. Nwokike closed by thanking participants for being part of this important work. 153 SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS Session I: An Introduction to the REGULATO RY IMS Activity Objective: Provide an overview of the scope and objectives of the activity and update on current status. Discussion Questions: What are other common challenges with REGULATORY IMS in your setting? How could minimum common standards address some of these challenges? What are the key considerations for adoption of data standards in your country? What regulatory data standards have you adopted in your country? Presentation I: Activity Objectives, Process Overview, and Key Outcomes Kate Kikule, Principal Technical Advisor for Pharmaceutical Regulatory Systems Kate Kikule, principal technical advisor for regulatory systems strengthening at USAID MTaPS, welcomed attendees and presented a summary of the activity, highlighting the problem statement, specific activity objectives, and the consultative process both MTaPS and PQM+ use to engage global, regional, and national regulatory experts to derive a set of minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS . She elaborated on the stakeholder engagement process that defines the scope of this activity and identifies potential challenges that can impact the adoption of the common regulatory standards. Prior to this consultative meeting with NMRAs, MTaPS and PQM+ convened two stakehold er consultations. Attendees included global, regional, and national stakeholders, such as WHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, the Global Fund, the Center for Innovation in Regulatory Sciences, the New Partnership for Africa's Develo pment (NEPAD), academic institutions, and select NMRAs in Africa and Asia. The earlier consultative process also identified the following considerations for adoption: Countries will need support to develop a roadmap and identify resources for adoption - human, financial, technical capacity (both IT and regulatory affairs), among others. Create awareness through advocacy events - identify the benefits to countries for using common standards including benefits to patients, manufacturers, distributors, regu lators, and other stakeholders. Dissemination to target groups - identify development partners and donors that will support countries on this journey. Facilitated Discussion I Following the presentation, participants answered the discussion questions below using the chat function on the WebEx platform. What are other common challenges with regulatory IMS in your setting? Challenges identified included: Lack of IT professionals and capacity to develop regulatory information management systems; 154 Improper inte gration of systems; Nonexistent IMS for regulatory processes; IT/information system policy adoption; Low internet connectivity; Data storage and backup systems for regulatory information; Level of effort associated with building a user-friendly system; Lack of IT materials/servers and low financial resources; and Outsourced and expensive software developers sometimes create systems that are not iterative, resulting in manual interventions and a fragmented approach to automating regu latory business processes. How could minimum common standards address some of these challenges? Participants note that minimum common standards can help by: Providing appropriate technical support, training, and a universal link for related IMS platforms. Minimizing errors (accuracy of captured data and information). Supporting reliance and harmonization, information sharing becomes easier and regulatory resources are optimized; Standards would be a resource during the design and development of the systems that are expensive to change. Minimum common standards may help overcome these challenges through transparency and uniformity in activities. Providing a structured framework for communication between the regulatory functions. Regulators could adopt IMS fr om other regulators with minimal changes. Improve and facilitate product registration process in a timely manner. Providing timely regulatory decision and action. Helping NMRAs manage their policies and processes to achieve specific objectives. Eliminating user confusion that may arise due to varying system designs. Supporting good documentation practices helps accelerate integration efforts in information systems design across all NMRAs and improves regulatory information processing time. What are the key considerations for adoption of data standards in your country? Feedback from attendees included: Data integrity and security; User friendliness and transparency; Procurement of IT infrastructure, availability of equipment; Implementation of effective chan ge management; Need for IT expertise and integrated data management systems; Good and unified regulatory decisions, capacity building, and enabling legislation where required; Competent personnel through capacity building; Budget allocation to purchase and implement the system; Support from stakeholders, management, ministries, etc., to ensure a seamless transition from paper -based to digitalized systems while ensuring preservation of existing data; 155 Need to implement regulatory data protection a nd privacy compliance while deploying information systems; A robust disaster management plan; Strong willingness of the NMRA and government, strong legislation, and the ability to increase support among other stakeholders; Rigid political climates, stakeho lder engagement and buy -in; Periodic training sessions concerning all the weaknesses specified; and Business continuity standards, strategies, and legislation adopted. What regulatory data standards have you adopted in your country? Attendees noted the fol lowing: International Council for Harmonization multidisciplinary guideline 4 Common Technical Document ( ICH M4 CTD) format is adopted by DGDA for biological products; United States of America Title 21Code of Federal Regulations part 11 (21 CFR part 11), National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) also adopted International Council for Harmonization multidisciplinary guideline 4 Common ( ICH M4 C TD); World Health Organization Technical Report Series 996 Annex 5 (WHO TRS 996 Annex 5) on data management is considered for other regulatory aspects United States of America Title 21Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 11 compliant23 *Question was pose d again following the second presentation to provide more information and clarity on identification and selection of standards for REGULATORY IMS . Session II: Selection of Minimum Common Standards for Regulatory IMS/Benefits Objective: Explain the standards selection process. Discuss the benefits of having common standards for REGULATORY IMS . Discussion Questions: Which regulatory data standards have you adopted in your country (Common Technical Document (CTD), etc.)? What is your feedback on the selection criteria used by PQM+/MTaPS to determine minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS ? Do you have suggestions on how the minimum common standards should be selected? Presentation II: Overview of Collated Standards a nd Selection Process Chinwe Owunna, Senior Manager, Health Elements, USAID PQM+ Program 23 Helpful links for additional context to th is bulleted list can be found here: Welcome to the ICH Official Website , Multidisciplinary Guidelines , Code of Federal Regulations - Title 21 - Food and Drugs , National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control , Annex 5 Guidance on good data and record management practices 156 Categories of Standards Ms. Owunna welcomed attendees and presented a summary of the results of the desk review conducted jointly by PQM+ and MTaPS to compile a shortli st of common regulatory standards that mature regulatory authorities use, along with recommended standards from global bodies (e.g., WHO, International Conference on Harmonization [ICH], International Organization for Standardization [ISO]).. She describ ed the three categories of standards identified through this exercise (see Figure 1). Seventeen (17) process or workflow standards were identified. She noted that the standards in this category are precursors to the adoption of the other standards, as the y are required to establish the process flow of activities for each regulatory function. Twenty -one (21) data dictionaries and knowledge trees were identified to standardize data across various systems. Twenty (20) data exchange standards that facilitate d ata and information exchange from one electronic system to the next were identified in the third category. Figure 1. Categories of standards. Detailed examples were provided. Refer to the meeting slides in Annex 3 C for m ore information. Ms. Owunna continued the presentation by presenting the steps of the standards selection process. 157 Figure 2. Steps of the standards selection process. Finally, she introduced the four criteria for selecting the set of minimum common stan dards that countries should adopt for their REGULATORY IMS . She identified four main selection criteria and explained the rationale for their selection: 1. Relevance: applicable to at least one of eight core regulatory functions in the WHO GBT; 2. Feasibility of application: the extent to which NMRAs' capacity and resources feasibly allow adoption. 3. Criticality: whether the standard is critical (or required) to gain efficiencies in workflow and processes for at least one regulatory function; and 4. Universality: hw widely a standard is used - recommended by large normative bodies, industry - wide standards, etc. Ms. Owunna provided a demonstration of the tool developed jointly by PQM+ and MTaPS for applying the selection criteria to each standard identifie d through the desk review. It was determined that the first criterion cut across all the regulatory functions and therefore did not need to be included in the tool. Ms. Owunna later informed attendees that the tool, with detailed instructions for completio n, will be emailed to participating NMRAs within a few days of the meeting. Facilitated Discussion II Ms. Rider -Araki facilitated the discussion for the second session of the meeting. Attendees used the WebEx platform chat to respond or raise a hand to spe ak. Questions and responses received are outlined below. Which regulatory data standards have you adopted in your country (Common Technical Document [CTD], etc.)? Meeting participants provided a list of standards their NMRAs has adopted: Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP); Good Distribution Practices (GDP); Good Clinical Practices (GCP); Quality Control Laboratory (QCL); International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485; International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH); MedDRA; Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC). What is your feedback on the selection criteria used by PQM+/ MTaPS to determine minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS ? Participants noted other selection criteria to consider, including flexibility, universality, and harmonization. Attendees were informed they could email the team with any follow -up feedback after the meeting. Do you have suggestions on how the minimum common standards should be selected? Participants noted they would like minimum common standards to be selected by the following criteria. By the scope of operations of the NMRA, since not all the NMRAs have the same maturity level in all nine functions defined by the Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT). REGULATORY IMS that NMRAs have already used with a high level of performance. Minimum common standards should meet a minimum of requiremen ts to perform robust, and consistently. Harmonization must be part of the selection criteria. Attendees were also asked about their preference for providing feedback on the minimum standards. The participants chose between selecting the standards during a two-hour working meeting or through independent extended review. It was agreed that countries should meet on their own to discuss and complete the Excel tool, but if another demonstration on the spreadsheet is necessary, a two -hour meeting will be conduct ed to help complete the Excel sheet. NEXT STEPS AND CLOSEOUT Gabriel K. Kaddu, technical advisor for regulatory systems strengthening at PQM+, wrapped up the meeting and summarized the next steps. See Figure 3 for details. He highlighted that the aim of th e consultative process is to consolidate and synthesize the input from the experts to finalize a draft of the minimum common standards for REGULATORY IMS . After completion of this phase, the team will have a draft document to share for further discussion i n March. He noted that in March, the MTaPS and PQM+ programs hope to have another external feedback meeting on the minimum common standards. In May the team hopes to have a consultative meeting to present the minimum common standards compiled for final fee dback. Mr. Kaddu concluded by noting that the final output will be the agreed -upon minimum common standards and the implementation pathway document that PQM+ and MTaPS will develop. 159 Figure 3. Outline of the consultative process. Emmanuel Nfor, technical director at MTaPS, delivered the closing remarks. He thanked participants, facilitators, and technical teams at PQM+ and MTaPS for their efforts, highlighting the call for participants to provide feedback on the criteria for select ing of a set of minimum common standards. This includes rating of the selected standards with some justification comments for the rating. Mr. Nfor encouraged attendees to advocate for REGULATORY IMS common standards within their regulatory agencies and amo ng colleagues so they are ready to adopt the common standards once this activity is finalized. 160 ANNEX 3A: MEETING AGENDA 8:00 - 8:20 Introductions 8:00 - 8:10 Meeting logistics Leslie RiderAraki Evaluation Monitoring and Learning (MEL) Director PQM+ 8:10 - 8:20 Welcome remarks Kofi Aboagye -Nyame, Program Director, USAID MTaPS Program Jude Nwokike, Vice President & Director, Promoting the Quality of Medicines Plus (PQM+) Program, USP 8:20 - 9:25 Session I: An introduction to the REGULATORY IMS Activity Objective: Provide an overview of the scope and objectives of the activity and update on current status. 8:20 - 8:45 Presentation 1: Activity objectives, process overview and key outcomes Kate Kikule, Principal Technical Advisor, RSS, USAID MTaPS 8:45 - 9:20 Q&A 9:20 - 9:25 Session I recap Frederick Meadows, Senior Technical Advisor, PSM & CMC, PQM+ 9:25 - 9:40 Break 9:40 - 10:40 Session II: Selection of minimum common standards Objective: Explain the standards selection process Discuss the benefits of having common standards for REGULATORY IMS 9:40 - 10:00 Presentation II: Overview of collated standards and selection process Chinwe U.

Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) or ICH Q7A system for ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. It is designed to minimize the risks involved in any pharmaceutical production that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product. ICH Q10 A model for a pharmaceutical quality system that can be implemented throughout the different stages of a product lifecycle. Much of the content of ICH Q10 applicable to manufacturing sites is currently specified by regional GMP requirements. ISO 13485 Specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organization needs to demonstrate its ability to provide medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements. Monographs Pharmacopeial monographs provide an important tool for assurance of the quality of marketed pharmaceutical ingredients and products through testing of their quality. They generally cover chemical, biological and herbal finished pharmaceutical products and their ingredients, which have either been approved by national regulatory authorities or are otherwise legally marketed. USAID MTaPS and PQM+ ProgramsExample Data Dictionaries & Knowledge Trees Standard Description International Nonproprietary Names (INN)Facilitate the identification of pharmaceutical substances or active pharmaceutical ingredients. Each INN is a unique name that is globally recognized and is public property. A nonproprietary name is also known as a generic name. Defined Daily Dose (DDD)The assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults. Drug utilization data presented in DDDs give a rough estimate of consumption and not an exact picture of actual use. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)An extensive medical terminology designed for use in the regulation of medical products with a unique architecture and features that support public health monitoring, data analysis, communication (both electronic and traditional) and data management. This terminology is hierarchical, multiaxial, multilingual, regularly-updated, and strictly maintained. ISO 3166 Defines internationally recognized codes of letters and/or numbers that refer to countries and their subdivisions.

Improved Services. Better Health Outcomes. 185 About the USAID MTaPS Program Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by a team led by Management Sciences for Health (MSH), the purpos e of the five -year Medicines, Technologies, and Pharmaceutical Services (MTaPS) Program (2018 -2023) is to provide pharmaceutical system strengthening assistance for sustained improvements in health system performance and to advance USAID's goals of prevent ing child and maternal deaths, controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and combating infectious disease threats, as well as expanding essential health coverage. The goal of MTaPS is to help low - and middle -income countries strengthen their pharmaceutical system s to ensure sustainable access to and appropriate use of safe, effective, quality -assured, and affordable essential medicines, vaccines, and other health technologies and pharmaceutical services. About the USAID PQM+ Program Promoting the Quality of Medici nes Plus (PQM+) is a program operating under a USAID -funded cooperative agreement with the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) with a goal to sustainably strengthen medical product quality assurance (QA) systems by providing technical assistance to manufac turers of priority health products and build in -country capacity of medicines regulatory authorities to improve product registration, inspection, and post -marketing surveillance for product quality. PQM+ support also includes accreditation of national drug quality control laboratories per ISO/IEC 17025 and/or World Health Organization (WHO) prequalification standards in low - and middle -income countries. PQM+ uses a system strengthening approach to program implementation to enhance sustainability.24 The prog ram considers the entire system when designing and delivering technical assistance, focusing on the interaction among all health systems functions25 as they relate to medical product quality assurance. To implement PQM+, USP joined forces with a diversifie d consortium of four core partners, six field -led extension partners, and eight technical resource partners26 whose extensive technical expertise can be drawn on to achieve desired results.

The meeting was the fourth in a series of consultations aimed at identifying and reco mmending a set of minimum common standards for regulatory information management systems (IMS) that will enable uniform data capture and standardize the data, design, and workflow of digitalized regulatory functions. The meeting brought together forty -nine experts in regulatory system strengthening and information management systems representing nine countries and four regional and global organizations, and the objectives were to: Share the results of feedback from stakeholders on selection of the minimum common standards for regulatory IMS Agree on the minimum common standards for regulatory IMS and Propose next steps involving advocacy for adoption of the minimum common standards by NMRAs During this meeting, the MTaPS and PQM+ representatives pr ovided an overview of the consultative process that led to the identification of 56 standards and culminated in the selection of minimum common standards (MCS) for regulatory IMS. Session 1 discussed the consultative process and methodology for selecting the minimum common standards based on the following criteria: Relevance\u2014the standard should be critical for at least one of the eight core regulatory functions as defined in the WHO GBT v2.0 Feasibility\u2014the extent to which NMRAs' capacity and resources f easibly allow adoption and what are the anticipated efficiency gains Criticality\u2014what would countries benefit or lose by not applying a given standard Universality\u2014whether a given standard is recommended by WHO and extent to which it is widely used The l ist of 56 identified standards was circulated to all participants in the preceding three consultative meetings. Participants were asked to evaluate each criterion on a scale of 1 to 3 for each of the 56 standards. Definitions for each rating are included i n Table 1. During this selection exercise, relevance was excluded from participant consideration - the 56 identified standards were deemed relevant for inclusion by the MTaPS and PQM+ teams during the literature review process. 190 Table 1 - Rating definitions by selection criteria Rating Scale Feasibility Criticality Universality 1 Adopted with greater difficulty, significant technical assistance required Regulatory performance/ processes not impacted without the standard Not widely used in LMICs 2 Adopted with medium difficulty, marginal technical assistance required Regulatory performance/ processes may be impacted without the standard The standard is moderately widespread 3 Adopted with minimal, if any, technical assistance Regulatory performance/ processes impacted without the standard Widely used or recommended by industry or normative bodies These 56 standards were further divided into three categories: Figure 9 - Categories of Standards The final list of MCS was developed based on analysis of the feedback received from eleven respondents and informed by the MTaPS and PQM+ teams' expertise across regulatory functions. The first step in the data analysis was th e computation of unweighted mean scores received from participants. As the analysis proceeded, MTaPS and PQM+ experts examined the results based on category of standard, respondent type (global, regional, or national), regulatory function according to the WHO GBT v2.0, and pharmaceutical product lifecycle alignment. The MTaPS and PQM+ teams determined that 1) Process or workflow standards Apply to pharmaceutical: Procedures Processes Workflows Examples: Good practices (GXPs such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) International Organization for Standardization standards (ISOs) such as ISO 9001:20152) Pharmaceutical standard dictionaries and knowledge trees Master or reference lists for: Terminology Nomenclature Hierarchies Examples: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) International Nonproprietary Name (INN)3) Data exchange standards Pertain to: Information and communications technology Management information system functions Determine how data should be structured, defined, formatted Examples: Common Technical Document (CTD) format Extensible Markup Language (XML) Platforms such as Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR\u00ae)191 the criterion for feasibility should be excluded from the selection process - this criterion should determine the order in which NMRAs should adopt each standard in the list of MCS. Universality and criticality were combined to select the standards, which were then sorted by their assigned feasibility scores to recommend how countries should incorporate the selected standards in their regulatory IMS. All the identified process standards, except for those pertaining specifically to medical devices, were selected for inclusion in the MCS. The standards pertaining to medical devices were excluded to align with The World Health Organization Global Benchmarking Tool Version 2.0 (medicines & vaccines). Participants expressed the expectation that standards for medical devices would be included the future set of MCS. The remaining process standards are considered prerequisite to digitalizing regulatory IMS or adopti ng the other standards (data dictionaries & knowledge trees, data exchange). The list of standards recommended for adoption are below, listed in order from the most to least feasible to adopt.

Discussion included a detailed review of the data analysis process for the selection of th e MCS. Session II consisted of discussions with the participants about agreement on MCS for each of the three categories. ( Process, Data dictionaries/knowledge trees, and Data exchange ). Participants strongly suggested including Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP) standards such as ISO 11615, ISO 11616, ISO 11239, and ISO 11240 as part of the list of MCS as they are key data entry elements required to create product information and are essential for medicinal product ident ification regionally and internationally, particularly for pharmacovigilance activities. Meeting attendees were prompted to share any challenges or lessons learnt implementing regulatory IMS in their context and provide general feedback on the presentation s The choice of data exchange standards was a prudent one as they are widely used Include a comprehensive mapping of the selected standards and their respective WHO GBT function in the meeting report Focus on incorporating IDMP standards A feasibility analysis should be conducted before implementing regulatory IMS Selected standards s hould be aligned with international data interchange standards During the discussion, there was a strong recommendation to adopt IDMP standards for sharing information internationally and regionally and to think about adding implementation tools to supple ment the standards. It was also suggested that the regulatory IMS implementation guidelines be developed in close partnership with the WHO. The next steps include distribution of the meeting report, the minimum set of recommended common standards for regu latory information management systems, and the advocacy brief. The regulatory IMS implementation guidelines will also be developed in collaboration with the WHO and disseminated for review. 193 BACKGROUND National medicines regulatory authorities (NMRAs) ar e increasingly implementing information management systems (IMS) to streamline their regulatory functions to improve efficiency and transparency and ensure access to access to high -quality, safe, and effective medical products. Despite the benefits, adopti on of IMS in low - and middle -income countries (LMICs) remains disproportionately low in comparison to high -income countries. Many LMICs rely on paper -based processes, IMS systems are underutilized, fragmented, non -interoperable or mismanaged. The delayed i mplementation of digital IMS has been attributed to a lack of adequate financial and human resources, as well as a lack of political will, among other factors. Consequently, there is an absence of effective communication between regulatory agencies, a lack of transparency in the regulatory process, information loss, backlogs, and delays in the regulatory approval process. The lack of interoperable IMS in LMICs, as well as the absence of standardized common technical documents (CTDs), documentation, work pr ocesses, and timelines limit the use of harmonization actions such as joint assessments and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) site inspections. Implementation of regulatory procedures such as reliance and recognition for the registration of medical produc ts, which require the deployment of systems of dependable regulatory IMS for efficient information management. To further harmonization efforts, a set of minimum common standards for regulatory IMS is required to promote interoperability and communication between international and regional NMRAs. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded Medicines, Technologies, and Pharmaceutical Services (MTaPS) and Promoting the Quality of Medicines Plus (PQM+) programs initiated a series of consultative meetings with regulatory experts to define a minimum set of applicable common standards for regulatory IMS. The purpose of the fourth consultative meeting is to submit for discussion and validation the selected minimum common standards which w ere based on feedback received from the individual NMRAs and partners from the broader list of standards identified earlier in the process. MEETING OBJECTIVES The primary purpose of the meeting was to present and discuss the findings and proposed minimum common standards to be implemented by NMRAs. The minimum set of standards was determined through a desk review that identified 56 relevant standards for regulatory IMS. The desk review process and the rationale for the list of minimum common standards, as well as their anticipated use case were presented and discussed with global, regional, and national level regulatory and IMS experts and stakeholders through a consultative process beginning in September 2021. Prior to this fourth meeting, stakeholders wer e asked to rank the identified standards according to three criteria: criticality, universality, and feasibility. This meeting was jointly coordinated by PQM+, MTaPS, and their collaborating partners to: Share the results of feedback from stakeholders on s election of the minimum common standards for regulatory IMS Agree on the minimum common standards for regulatory IMS and Propose next steps involving advocacy for adoption 194 WELCOME AND INTRODUCTORY REMARKS Kofi Aboagye -Nyame, Program Director, USAID MTaP S Program, MSH Mr. Aboagye -Nyame welcomed the participants to the meeting. He noted that National Regulatory Authorities in low - and middle -income countries face some challenges in carrying out their functions, especially in the licensing of medical produc ts. Even though well -functioning regulatory IMS would enhance consistency, efficiency, and accountability in pharmaceutical regulatory service delivery, he noted that many LMICs have been slow to achieve this, and where IMS currently exist, they are often inefficient and fragmented. He stressed the significance of harmonizing regulatory IMS across different regions and expressed his appreciation to the MTaPS and PQM+ teams and collaborators participating in the formulation of the minimum common standards fo r regulatory IMS. He encouraged attendees to actively participate in the consultative process and to validate and incorporate the selected standards into their regulatory frameworks. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS The slides for all presentations are included in Annex 4C. Session I: Proposed Minimum Common Standards for Regulatory Information Management Systems Presentation I: Overview of responses from the NMRAs and other stakeholders on selection of MCS Kate Kikule, Principal Technical Advisor for Pharmaceutical Regulatory Systems, MTaPS Program Kate Kikule presented an overview of the consultative process and methodology used to select the MCS. She provided a summary of the actions, objectives, and conc lusions of the prior sessions that culminated in the fourth consultative meeting. This included a description of the standard identification process, which consisted of a literature review to identify suitable standards based on their relevance to the acti vity objectives and scope of regulatory information management systems. Based on the previous three consultations, the selection criteria for narrowing the list of 56 identified standards from regulatory IMS to a set of minimum common standards are: Releva nce\u2014the standard should be critical for at least one of the eight core regulatory functions as defined in the WHO GBT v2.0 Feasibility\u2014the extent to which NMRAs' capacity and resources feasibly allow adoption and what are the anticipated efficiency gains Criticality\u2014what would countries benefit or lose by not applying a given standard Universality\u2014whether a given standard is recommended by WHO and extent to which it is widely used The 56 standards were circulated to stakeholders for feedback and assessme nt. Stakeholders assigned scores of 1, 2, or 3 to each of the standards according to the proposed criteria (Table 1). Relevance was excluded from stakeholder consideration because all the included standards were considered relevant to the scope based on th e desk review. As a result of the experts' evaluation, and based on the feedback received from countries, regional, and global entities, a total of 27 Minimum Common Standards were 195 selected: thirteen (13) Process Standards, eight (8) Data Dictionaries and Knowledge Trees, and six (6) Data Exchange Standards. Table 1 - Rating definitions by selection criteria Rating Scale Feasibility Criticality Universality 1 Adopted with greater difficulty, significant technical assistance required Regulatory performance/ processes not impacted without the standard Not widely used in LMICs 2 Adopted with medium difficulty, marginal technical assistance required Regulatory performance/ processes may be impacted without the standard The standard is moderately widespread 3 Adopted with minimal, if any, technical assistance Regulatory performance/ processes impacted without the standard Widely used or recommended by industry or normative bodies She presented a summary of the stakeholder responses received. Respondents were classified according to their level of operation: countries (NMRAs) , regional, and global . Eleven (11) responses were received in total. She informed the meeting that the selected minimum common standards for regulat ory IMS will be included in a guidance document to enable countries implement the standards and support digitalization of regulatory IMS. In addition, MTaPS and PQM+ are developing an advocacy brief which will be disseminated to stakeholders. Questions and Clarifications Following the presentation, participants were invited to ask questions regarding the proposed MCS. Leslie Rider Araki, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Director for PQM+ led the question -and-answer session. Will there be a consideration to include medical devices standards in future? The teams decided to align with the WHO GBT Version 2.0 (medicines & vaccines), which is restricted to medicines, vaccines, and blood products. The WHO GBT guidance for medical devices was not available for consideration during the implementation of the consultative process, thus minimum standards for medical devices may be considered in the future. Presentation II: Overview of the analysis of the responses and proposed MCS Maura Soucy Brown, Senior Technical Advisor, MTaPS Program Maura Soucy Brown presented an overview of the standards that were identified and shortlisted during the earlier standard selection process because of the desk review completed by PQM+ and MTaPS. She described the three categories o f standards identified in this exercise (Figure 1) These consisted of fifteen (15) process or workflow standards, twenty -one (21) data dictionaries and knowledge trees, and twenty (20) data exchange standards. 196 Figure 11 - Categories of Standards She then presented the data analysis process as outlined below: Each category of standards was analyzed separately (Process, Data dictionaries/knowledge trees, Data exchange) Each criterion was analyzed separately (Feasibility, Criticality, Universality) and compiled together (Overall Score) Disaggregated results bas ed on respondent type, standard category The MTaPS and PQM+ teams decided to compile country, regional and global responses together based on the response rates and consistency of responses received. They decided to use feasibility to determine the adopti on order for the proposed set of minimum common standards. Those with the greatest feasibility scores were proposed to be adopted first, proceeding to those that would be most challenging to implement (lowest feasibility scores). This eliminated the need t o benchmark NMRAs to guide the adoption of the standards and allows the proposed list of minimum common standards to operate as a top-to-bottom checklist when sorted according to feasibility. Ms. Brown provided a detailed overview of the data analysis proc edure. The criticality and universality scores were combined to inform the selection of the standards for inclusion in the minimum common set. Feasibility was omitted from the total score and used independently to determine the order of adoption for the se lected standards. Medical device standards were removed to conform to WHO GBT version 2, which pertains to only medicines and vaccines. 1) Process or workflow standards Apply to pharmaceutical: Procedures Processes Workflows Examples: Good practices (GXPs such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) International Organization for Standardization standards (ISOs) such as ISO 9001:20152) Pharmaceutical standard dictionaries and knowledge trees Master or reference lists for: Terminology Nomenclature Hierarchies Examples: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) International Nonproprietary Name (INN)3) Data exchange standards Pertain to: Information and communications technology Management information system functions Determine how data should be structured, defined, formatted Examples: Common Technical Document (CTD) format Extensible Markup Language (XML) Platforms such as Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR\u00ae)197 Process Standards The adoption of process standards is considered prerequisite to digitalization/adoption of recommende d minimum common standards for regulatory IMS. 15 identified through the desk review Two (2) pertaining specifically to medical devices were removed (greyed out) in alignment with The WHO GBT v2.0 (medicines & vaccines) The remaining thirteen (13) are re commended and sorted according to feasibility scores The list of process standards recommended for adoption, sorted according to feasibility is included in Table 2.

Attendees used the Zoom platform chat to respond or raise a hand to comment. Questions and responses received are described below. Are there standards that were left out of the final list that you think should have been includ ed and vice versa? Comments for attendees ISO 11240 and ISO 11239 are key data entry elements required to create product information. (These two are part of the five IDMP standards) IDMP standards are essential for medicinal product identification regio nally and internationally notably for pharmacovigilance activities. In addition, they are a worldwide priority being considered by the WHO, EMA, and FDA 201 After reviewing and evaluating the stakeholders' suggestion to include the suite of five IDMP standards, the PQM+ and MTaPS teams agreed to include them as part of the MCS (Table 6), since these standards provide an international framework to uniquely identify and describe medicinal products with consistent documentation and terminologies, as well to ensure the exchange of product information between global regulators, manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors. They also facilitate the unique identification of medicinal products in the context of pharmacovigilance and the safety of medications.28 Facilitated Discussion II: Data Exchange Standards Deane Putzier, Senior Principal Technical Advisor, MTaPS Program Next, the participants were asked to provide feedback on the selected data exchange standards. Attendees used the Zoom platform chat to respo nd or raise a hand to comment. Questions and responses received are described below. Deane began the discussion by describing the proposed data exchange standards: PDF Standard Developed by Adobe for use without requiring software, hardware, or any opera ting system Permits the incorporation of multimedia Includes fonts, victor graphics and rich media i.e., video content Versatile open format Enables information storage and intersystem communication Encrypts username and owner Not so much a standard as a system common tool The Common Technical Document (CTD) Standard for the registration of medicines is an internationally accepted format for new drugs applications to be submitted to the NMRA Administrative, prescribing information quality, pharmaceutica l documentation, preclinical, which includes pharmacology and toxicology, and clinical trials data components are included Non-information system standard originally created as a paper document; it is now available in electronic format as the eCTD XML Ubiquitous across several of these diverse standards Is a markup language, which means it is meant to store and transfer information in a human - readable way The purpose of XML was to stress usability and simplicity across diverse information systems Not bound to a specific hardware platform WC3 recommendation Permits users to describe data, as necessary. It is versatile. Plane XML can be used to describe virtually anything in this XML based on the two systems that are communicating with one another. 28 FDA Data Standards Advisory Board . Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP) . May 2022. 202 E2B XML standard International standard for reporting advers e events. It is necessary that adverse event reports be communicated in XML format, and it is also widely used for reporting adverse events to WHO - hosted databases Vigibase and Vigiflow. Received a very low score in terms of the first healthcare interoper ability standards, but it is a very essential forthcoming standard in healthcare and regulatory systems that defines a common language between systems. It is the format of information systems that enables users to speak with a common understanding across c ountries and systems FHIR Standard HL 7 is a comprehensive standard in XML as well HL 7 is quite broad, so Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource narrows the scope and outlines the procedure between systems. There is a major emphasis on implementation, and numerous implementation materials are available. Built on a solid foundation of web standards. While it employs XML, Additionally, it uses JSON hdp http etc. JSON is a common, more understandable format than XML, and it is also used to transport data between computers. It is also a standard utilized by all web and RESTful systems. SPL Standard Is an XML format and is mostly used by manufacturers and distributors to send product documentation Includes a summary of the space -critical, specific informat ion required for the successful and safe use of the medicine. It is essentially divided into several components: adverse reactions, indications, prescriptions, drugs, etc., for over -the-counter medications. This is the default definition of the structured product labelling, and it is also the reason why our standards employ this definition. He explained why ASCII was excluded despite being highly rated by experts. Essentially, it is a notepad document. Users could easily enter their text into a notepad and share it across several platforms. It was also eliminated due to its broadness. It is not a true standard, but rather a way for systems to share data. Please share any challenges or lessons learnt implementing IMS in your context Feedback from participants Including CTD, XML, E2B and PDF was an excellent move as they are widely used across different regions. They can be easily advocated for and adopted Please provide any general feedback from the presentation Comments from participants 203 The meeting report should include a comprehensive mapping of the selected standards and their respective WHO GBT function. Kate indicated that the mapping was completed during the beginning phases of the project and would be included in the final report. CTD and E2B are highly ranked, indicating respondents' top priorities. It appeared that there was a combination of tools, underlying software, and practical standards. It was suggested that they be delineated. Focus on incorporating IDMP standards. Deane indicated that XML and FHIR may fulfil the purpose, but the suggestion would be carefully considered. Need to identify regulatory IMS implementation tool Prior to the intr oduction of regulatory IMS, feasibility, compatibility of standards, functional systems, and system maintenance should be examined. Requirement that selected standards be aligned with international data interchange standards to allow global, regional, and institutional communication Recommendation for additional collaboration between the USAID MTaPS PQM+ team and the WHO to implement regulatory IMS. The USAID MTaPS PQM+ team is developing a guidance document for the implementation of regulatory IMS; The WHO may play a complementary role by developing recommendations for the adoption of regulatory IMS by NMRAs. NEXT STEPS AND CLOSEOUT Gabriel K. Kaddu, Technical Advisor for Regulatory Systems Strengthening at PQM+, wrapped up the meeting and summarized the n ext steps. He described the final documents that would be distributed to the stakeholders, including the meeting report, the minimum common set of standards for regulatory IMS, and the advocacy brief. He highlighted that the USAID MTaPS PQM+ team will coll aborate with WHO to develop a guideline for regulatory IMS standards adoption. Allison Collins (PQM+) made the closing remarks on behalf of Alexis Leonard, Senior Health Systems Technical Advisor USAID Bureau for Global Health. She begun by acknowledging the presence of the participants and commending them for the robust discussion regarding the proposed regulatory IMS standards. She also appreciated the efforts of the MTaPS and PQM+ teams and all collaborating partners for their contribution towards selecting the MCS. She spoke about the significance of highly functional regulatory systems and the necessity of streamlining regulatory systems in LMICs, which are frequently paper -based leading to su b-optimal results. She stressed the need for purpose -built IMS to solve the issues faced by LMICs and enhance harmonization. She emphasized USAID's support for bolstering regulatory mechanisms in accordance with its 2030 Vision for Health Systems Strengthe ning. Jude Nwokike , Vice President , USAID PQM+ Program, gave the final closing remarks. He thanked all participants for a productive engagement during the meeting. He thanked all collaborating partners including the WHO, Global Fund, ASEAN secretariat, and the World Bank. He also lauded the support provided by the MTaPS and PQM+ programs. He remarked on the increased participation of NMRAs in the consultative process. He was especially pleased that CTD, E2B, and SPL were included in the MCS, and he expre ssed optimism that NMRA's incorporating regulatory IMS to streamline regulatory operations would enhance regulatory transparency and consistency, as well as improve reliance, recognition, and information sharing. 204 ANNEX 4A: MEETING AGENDA Introductions & We lcome 8:00 - 8:10 Introductions, meeting logistics and objectives Leslie RiderAraki, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Director.
