A large number of pharmacological studies demonstratedHQT and its ingredients to be effective in treating UC. Though the therapeutic effect has been evaluated, comprehensive up-to- date reviews in this field are not yet available. Here we aim to review our current understanding of HQT and its ingredients in treating UC and how the agents modulate the main pathogenesis of the disease, including the intestinal environment, immuneimbalance, inflammatory pathways, and oxidative stress. The summary on this issue may provide better understanding of HQT anditsingredientsintreatingUCandpossiblyhelpinpromotingitsclinicalapplication. 1. Introduction Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most common form of inflam- matory bowel disease, it is characterized by chronic inflam-matory disorders of the colonic mucosa, which starts in therectum and generally extends proximally in a continuousmannerthroughpartofortheentirecolon[1].Thediseaseisbifurcated into remitting and relapsing courses [2] and mayhave significant impact on the quality of life and personalburden through reduction in the ability to work [3, 4].UC patients may require life-long treatment and have anincreasedriskofdevelopingcolorectalcancer[5,6]. The global prevalence of UC is about 8 million, and t h ei n c i d e n c ea n dp r e v a l e n c ea r ei n c r e a s i n gw o r l d w i d e[ 7 ] .W h i l et h ep r e c i s ec a u s eo fU Ci ss t i l lu n k n o w n ,i th a s been hypothesized that various factors such as geography, age, sex, genetic, environmental, gastrointestinal infection,and appendicectomy are responsible for the developmentof UC is anti-gen recognition, dysregulation of immunological responses,leucocyterecruitment,andsoforth.However,sincetheexactmechanisms of UC are still under investigation, treatment strategies are limited. The principle for UC treatment isdivided into two categories according to the clinical activity and the extent of diseases, induction of remission, and maintenance of remission. The main agents consist of top-ical or oral mesalazine, oral or intravenous corticosteroids,immunosuppressive drugs, monoclonal antibodies of TNF-,andcolectomy[1].However,thesideeffectsandhighcostlimitthelong-termapplication[12]. Recently, natural products have attracted lots of inter- est in preventing and treating UC. Traditional Chinese Medicines(TCM)andextractshaveshownvariousbeneficial treatmenteffectsincludingbacteriostasis,anti-inflammation,and anticancer abilities [13]. Among them, Huangqin-Tang (HQT)isawell-knownclassicalformulawhichderivedfrom Shang Han Lun, consisting of by experienced herbalists and manufacturedaccordingtocGMP(currentGoodManufacturingPractice), Hindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7016468, 7 pages HQT regulates the main pathogenesis of UC .AH Q Ta n di t si n g r e d i e n t sm o d u l a t ei n t e s t i n a lm i c r o b i o t aa n dt h ei n t e g r i t yo f epithelium; BHQT and its ingredients maintain the immune balance (Th17 versus Treg; M1 versus M2 type macrophages); CHQT and its ingredients target the inflammatory pathways, which could result in decrease of proinflammatory cytokines release; DHQT and its PHY906 [14]. Using stan- dardizedchemicalandbiologicalfingerprints,theconsistentpreparations of PHY906 have been made and developed asanadjuvantforchemotherapyinvariouscancers. Though HQT has been widely used in treating UC in China, the underlying mechanisms are still not clear.PharmacokineticstudiesonmulticonstituentsinHQTbythevalidated HPLC method showed that can have anti-inflammatory effect throughdifferentorsimilarmechanismsinUCtreatment.ApplicationofHQToritsingredientsinUChasbeenwidelyinvestigated;however, the systematic effect evaluation and mechanismsexploration are spotted, and we aim to summarize thecurrent studies about the therapeutic effects or mechanismsof HQT or its main ingredients in UC (Figure 1), thus tobettersupportitsclinicaluse. 2. HQT and Ingredients in Targeting Intestinal Environment on UC Imbalanced interactions with intestinal microbes lead to developmentofUC,andintestinalmicrobiotaandepithelium provideenvironmentforthepathogens. There are approximately10111014enteric commensal microorganisms in the gut. Under normal conditions, thesecommensal bacteria maintain the balance and help in reg-ulating crucial nutrient provision, immune response, andenergy metabolism. However, commensal microorganismscan be noxious for intestinal inflammation under certaincircumstances, and the diversity and amount of microbiotaarereducedinpatientswithUCcomparedtothatinhealthyhumans[14].Thoughthespecificbacteriarelatedtotheinci-denceofUChavenotbeenfound,lotsofstudieshaveshowedthatthechangeofintestinalenvironmentwascloselyrelatedtoUC,andtherewassignificantlydifferentbacterialcoloniesbetween UC patients and healthy people [16-18]. PHY906,the extracted HQT, has been reported to alter the profileof major intestinal bacteria species, and treatment of demonstrated to inhibit the growthofharmfulintestinalbacteriainhuman[20]. Theintestinalepithelialcellsstructurallyconstitutecrypts and villi in the intestine, with a single columnar cell liningwith a tight junction. The epithelial integrity is maintainedby tight junctions between epithelial cells, and externalpathogens easily pass through the injured or incompletei n t e s t i n a le p i t h e l i u m ,w h i c hi sk n o w nt ob ei n v o l v e di nt h epathogenesis of UC. Several lines of evidence showed thatthe ingredients of HQT can protect the epithelium frompathogenintroduction.WogoninisaflavonoidisolatedfromScutellaria the with wogonin pro-tects intestinal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)stressed condition.

Paeoniflorin, the main active ingredient of Paeonialactiflora Pall.,isconfirmedtoattenuateLPS-induced permeability in endothelial cells, and the 100M) could inhibit dextran extravasation and leukocyte migration in a concentration-dependent manner[22]. Furthermore, the ingredient glycyrrhetinic acid also exertedprotectiveeffectsonLPSstressedintestinalepithelial cells injury and expression of the epithelial tight junctionmolecules[23]. 3. HQT and Ingredients in Regulating Immune Imbalance The gut possesses an abundant and highly active immunesystem that is tightly regulated to prevent overreaction ofimmuneresponses[24].Studieshaveprovidedtheevidencesthatthedysfunctionofgutimmunesystem,mainlyinvolvingthe abnormal percentage and disturbed differentiation ofimmune cells, can result in the increase of proinflammatorycytokines, epithelial permeability, and subsequent intestinalmucosa damage [25-27]. Both Th17 and regulatory T (Treg)cells are originated from CD4 +T cells. Th17 cells, which secrete IL-17 and IL-22, promote inflammation process. Onthe contrary, Treg cells, which produces IL-10 and trans-forming growth factor-(TGF), inhibit the inflammatory response [28, 29]. As one important subtype of T cells,CD4 +CD25+forkhead box p3+(Foxp3+)T r e gc e l l si n h i b i t autoimmunityandprotectthetissueagainstinjuryandtheirdevelopmentiscontrolledbyFoxp3. Growing evidences suggest that the imbalance between Th17 cells and Treg cells may contribute to the developmentof UC [30-32]. The ingredients of HQT are reported toregulate immune imbalance in a series studies. In trini-trobenzenesulfonicacid-(TNBS-)inducedUCmice,baicalincould ameliorate the severity of the disease by downreg-ulating the number of Th17 cells and the levels of Th17-r e l a t e dc y t o k i n e s( I L - 1 7a n dI L - 6 )a n du p r e g u l a t i n gT r e gcells and related TGF,I L - 1 0 ,a n dF o x p 3l e v e l s[ 3 3 ] .S i m i l a reffect of baicalin was also observed in cultured T cells; itproved that baicalin induced Foxp3 protein expression andinhibited T cells proliferation [34]. CD4 +CD29+cells are helper T cells that can result in high activation of B cellsandabnormalimmuneresponse.Previousstudyshowedthepercentage of CD4 +CD29+T cells significantly increased in UC patients, indicating CD4+CD29+Tc e l l sm i g h tb ea n immunologyindexformonitoringUC[35,36].Baicalincan reduce the percentages of CD4+CD29+Tc e l l si nc u l t u r e d peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the UC patients, thus regulate immune balance, and relieve the UC-inducedinflammation [37]. These studies inferred that baicalin mayserveasapromisingnaturalimmunosuppressivecompoundfortreatingUCandrelatedinflammatorydiseases. Macrophages play critical roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses and are classified into M1a n dM 2p h e n o t y p e s .M 1p h e n o t y p ec e l l sa r es t i m u l a t e dby microbial products or other pathogens and producemany proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, M2 typeresponses are the \"resting\" phenotype and are observed inhealing-type circumstances without infections and generateanti-inflammatory cytokine. Macrophage M1 and M2 typesexecute opposite activities in tissues [38]. Once the M1/M2balance is broken, immune-mediated inflammation occurs.Baicalin is reported to polarize phe-notype in murine peritoneum and ameliorate experimentalinflammatory bowel disease in mice [39]. In mouse bone marrow precursors generated M1 and M2 cells, paeoniflorin inhibitedLPS-inducedM1activitybyreducingiNOSandNOproduction, whereas enhanced IL-4 provoked M2 functionbyupregulatingArg-1productionandactivity[40],suggest-ing paeoniflorin can suppress M1 cells activity and enhanceM2 cells function simultaneously. In addition, paeoniflorinisconfirmedtosignificantlyamelioratetheimmunecomplexinducedvasculardamage,leucocyteinfiltrates,andadhesionmolecules expression [41]. The pharmaceutical effect ofbaicalin is reported to be associated with macrophagemigration inhibitory factor downregulation, the quantityof macrophages, M macrophage-relatedcytokinesandmacrophageinflammatoryprotein-3 [42]. Bcellsareimportantinthedevelopmentofautoimmune disorders. Autoreactive B cells can present T cells, produce autoantibodies and proinflam- matory cytokines, and amplify inflammatory responses [25, 43, 44]. Inhibiting the abnormal activation of B cells is thought to be an effective strategy for UC treatment. It isreportedthattheBcellactivationcanbeinhibitedbypaeoni-florin;inLPS-stimulatedmurinespleen Bcells,paeoniflorininhibitsCD69/CD86expressionandBcellproliferation[45]. 4. HQT and Ingredients in Modulating Inflammatory Pathways Interactions between proinflammatory cytokines and theirreceptors lead to activation of intracellular signal transduc-tion. And NF-B has been recognized as a critical target in inflammatory process. The extracellular stimulus, like Ag,LPS,growthfactorsandinflammatorycytokines,signals,andso forth, could trigger NF-B activation and induce inflam-mation in tissues. Therefore, inhibited NF- Ba c t i v a t i o ni s consideredtobeaneffectivestrategyforUCtreatment[46]. Toll-likereceptor4(TLR4),akeyreceptorforcommensal recognitionininnateimmunity,isoverexpressedininflamedcolonocytes[47,48],andTLR4-mediatedsignaltransductioncan evenly lead to NF-Ba c t i v a t i o n[ 4 9 ] .I nL P Ss t r e s s e d RAW264.7cells,baicalincanblocktheTLR4/NF- Bpathway and inhibit IL-6 release and cell proliferation; in Sprague- Dawleyrats,TNBS-inducedUCstatuscanbeamelioratedby baicalin[50,51].InDSS-inducedC57BL/6mice,paeoniflorincould improve UC, and the beneficial effects are consideredto be related to the downregulation of TLR4 expression andthe of TLR4-mediated responseand maintain the single-layer membrane structure underLPS stressed Caco2 cells, and the positive effects might beachieved via TLR4-MyD88-TAK1-mediated NF- Bp a t h w a y [21]. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are con- served and participate in multiple4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine cellularprocessesincludingcellgrowth,proliferation,differ- entiation, migration, inflammation, and survival. Numerousstudies have described an increased expression of MAPKsin IBD patients [53]. There are several studies focusingon the therapeutic effects for UC by regulating MAPKs.Glycyrrhetinic acid had the inhibitory effects and NF- Ba c t i v a t i o ni ni n fl a m e d colon tissue [55]. COX-2, one isoform of cyclooxygenase(COX),canbeinductedbyactivatingMAPKactivity[56,57].And previous research has shown that the level of COX-2 increased in the intestinal tissues of UC, and COX-2inhibitor could relieve intestinal inflammation in rats withUC[58-60].PF2405,astandardizedfractionof S.baicalensis , can significantly inhibit dephosphorylation and p38 MAPK in HT-29 cells and reduced the expression of and COX-2 in TNBS-induced colitis in femaleC57BL/6mice[61]. Intercellular 1 (ICAM-1) and TNF- are the representative cytokines in inflammatory injuries. ICAM-1 induces the migration and infiltration of inflam-matory cells into the lesion, whereas TNF- can alter intestinal diammonium reduce ICAM-1 by inhibiting the NF-B activation and improveintestinal inflammatory injury in a rat model [63]. NLRP3 inflammasome is a key component of inflammatory process and its dysregulation contributes to UC. The synthesis andaccumulation of NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated byNF-B and lead to the secretion of IL-1 and IL-18. It is inflammasome activation [64]. In addition,there are studies that focus on the inflammatory cytokines.Paeoniflorin can play anti-inflammatory action by increas-i n gt h el e v e lo fI L - 1 7a n dd e c r e a s i n gt h el e v e lo fI L - 1 0in recombinant human IL-1-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro [65]. The glycyrrhizic acidcould significantly reduce TNF- and IL-1levels in TNBS- induced colitis rats, and in vitro experiments indicatedthat glycyrrhizic acid could inhibit IL-6 and significantlyinhibitlymphocytesproliferation[66].AndsimilareffectsareobtainedinDSS-inducedinflamedmucosainrats[67]. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), a member of the nuclear receptor family, has been recognizedas an endogenous regulator of intestinal inflammation. Itis reported that activating PPAR can inhibit NF-Ba c t i - vation. Oroxyloside, one of the ingredients of HQT, hasbeen reported to activate PPAR and prevent DSS-induced colitis through inhibiting NF- Bp a t h w a y[ 6 8 ] .M o r e o v e r , thioredoxin system is implicated in the regulation of NF- B transactivation potential; there is one study that focuses ontheinhibitionofbaicalinonthethioredoxinsystemandfindsthat baicalein can suppress mitogen induced thioredoxinactivity in the unclear compartment of lymphocytes, thuslimiting NF-B dependent inflammatory responses [69].In addition, it has been reported that estrogen can exertanti-inflammatory effects. Based on this background, onestudy shows that baicalein has estrogen-like activity andinhibits LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production via regulating NF-B pathway, suggesting the potential efficacy inpreventinginflammationrelateddiseases[70].Scutellariae RadixextractwaseffectiveintreatingacuteDSS-inducedUCwithimprovingmacroscopicandhistologicaldamagescoresandenhancingrecoveryofnormalcolonicsecretoryfunction[71]. 5. HQT Ingredients in Inhibiting Oxidative Stress The available evidence suggests that oxidative stress maybe involved in the pathogenesis of UC [72, 73].

One study showed thatthe possible mechanisms of baicalin in protecting UC wereassociated with the inhibition of oxidative stress; baicalincould increase the activities of CAT and GSH-Px in LPS-stimulatedRAW264.7cellsandTNBS-inducedUCrats[77]. 6. Conclusions and Perspectives Insummary,availablereportssuggestedthatthemechanismsunder the efficacy of HQT or its components on UC arerelated to intestinal environment improvement, immunemodulation, and regulation of inflammatory pathways orcytokines (Figure 1).
