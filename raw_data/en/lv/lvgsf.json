Environmental and social factors, accessibility needs and trust barriers can significantly impact their vaccination experience. Sensory sensitivities can make the process overwhelming, leading to heightened anxiety and fear. Consequently, parents like Michelle find it challenging to navigate these situations. The [Autism Society's Vaccine Education Initiative (VEI)](https://autismsociety.org/resources/covid-19-support/) is a public health model that aims to increase vaccine confidence, education and accessibility in underserved communities. \"By rewriting the vaccine experience, we are creating a path for increased vaccination rates for members of the Autism community, as well as those with complex support needs,\" said Christopher Banks, President and CEO of Autism Society of America. To better serve the Autism community, the Autism Society also provides training for healthcare providers. These training sessions equip medical professionals with the knowledge, strategies and tools needed to create a more inclusive and accessible vaccination experience for individuals with Autism. Proven strategies and tools the Autism Society can provide include modeling videos, communication boards, social stories, pain barrier tools, tips to reduce crowding, noise and visual stimulation at vaccination sites, offering fidget tools, providing alternative clinic options like drive thru vaccination and more. With informed and empathetic healthcare providers, the vaccination process becomes less stressful and more effective for children with Autism. The American Lung Association is committed to saving lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease. In the context of vaccinations, we offer science-based education about infectious respiratory diseases such as [influenza](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/influenza), [RSV](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/rsv), [pneumonia](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pneumonia), [COVID-19](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/covid-19) and [pertussis](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pertussis). This education empowers individuals to make informed decisions about infectious respiratory diseases and understand the importance of vaccinations, particularly for higher-risk communities like the Autism community. The collaboration between the Autism Society and the American Lung Association aims to increase awareness, education and accessibility of flu vaccinations across the country. By joining forces, we can make a significant impact in ensuring that all individuals, including those with Autism, have easy access to vaccinations. The organizations offer resources to find accessible clinics and promote vaccination initiatives that prioritize the needs of differently-abled individuals. It is crucial to recognize the significance of vaccinations for children with Autism and the importance of equity in healthcare. Michelle's experience as a parent underscores the need for understanding and accommodating the unique needs of individuals with Autism during the vaccination process. By supporting initiatives like VEI and collaborating across organizations, we can improve vaccination rates and ensure that every child, regardless of their abilities, has the opportunity to lead a healthy life. Together, let us prioritize the health and well-being of the Autism community and create a more inclusive and equitable healthcare system for all. Blog last updated: August 25, 2023 "}
