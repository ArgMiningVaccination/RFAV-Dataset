Inquire about carpooling options. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: -So I paid the class fee via PayPal...am I now officially registered and on the roster? Yes, your spot in class is now secure. PayPal will not accept online payments when a class is already sold out. Your payment confirmation/receipt has been sent to the email address associated with your account. -Can I bring my dog? Sorry, absolutely NO pets (for a litany of reasons). -Is it OK to bring my child? My 8-hour adult-level workshops are in no way suitable for children. Trust me: they would be bored to tears. -I see that hundreds/thousands of people have clicked on \"interested and/or going\" for this event...what are your class size limits? Don't take Facebook numbers too seriously folks...I cap these types of workshops at around 25 students :) That said, it IS true that my classes tend to fill to capacity months ahead of time...so procrastination is not recommended if you are hoping to secure a spot. -When should I expect to receive directions, carpool info, and other more specific class details?
