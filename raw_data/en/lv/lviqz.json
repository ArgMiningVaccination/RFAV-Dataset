Symptoms that may stem from a non-MS cause are often assumed to beanother symptom related to MS. Health concerns of relatively young persons receivinghome car esuch as menopause may not be adequately addressed. Furthermore, some illnesses, most notably infections and other causes of fever, may affect individuals withMS in a unique way. If you can, help individuals to identify accessible healthcar eproviders in the ar ea and encourage r egular medical check-ups. People with MS should adher eto the health-scr eening schedule recommended for all adults: Pap testing for women of r eproductive age Clinical br east or testicular examination after age 20-25 Annual mammogram for women after age 40-50 yearsFecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy for men and women who are over 50or have other risk factors Serum screening for dyslipidemia and thyroid abnormalitiesBone densitometry (such as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry or DEXA) for anyone at risk for fractures or osteoporosis (particularly those with a familyhistory and/or reduced mobility) Cholesterol once under age 50 and every 5 years over age 50Vision exam annually over age 65Hearing exam every 5 years over age 50Direct Rectal Exam (DRE) for prostate and colorectal cancers annually over age 40; PSA blood test annually for men over 50 Health screenings, such as mammography, are very important, particularly for this younger population, and may not be routinely provided. Difculty positioning someonewith impaired posture, or inability to stand for a mammogram, may lead to inattentiontothis and other important preventive health measures. Neither disability, nor the need for escort service and/or specialized transportation, should defer these screening procedures. Some medical ofces are outtted with accessible exam tables that provideease in transferring from a wheelchair and positioning for individuals with mobilityimpairments. Family members should be supported in helping their family memberwith MS seek out institutions and providers that can meet their accessibility needs. When providing care to people with MS, providers should consider: Menstrual Cycle: Sometimes symptoms such as fatigue, numbness, and neuropathic pain may increase in people with MS just before menses and improve as the flowbegins. Menstrual cycles may be altered by medications such as steroids, chemotherapyand others that may be used to treat MS. Menopause: In women with MS, as with other women, menopause can cause uncomfortable symptoms, such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, sleep disturbance,and mood changes. Some may consider hormone replacement therapy. However,there are serious risks as well as benefits of hormone replacement therapy thatshould be addressed by the person with MS and the physician. Thrombo-embolic risk,particularly that of deep vein thrombosis, is especially relevant in the person with MSwho has mobility problems and may tend to be sedentary, particularly if they areoverweight. Hor mone r eplacement therapy should be avoided in such individuals, as well as in persons with a str ong family histor yof cancer of the br east, ovarian or uterine cancers, cer ebrovascular disease, and cor onar yarterydisease. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): With regard to the risk of deep vein thrombosis and its particularly dangerous complication, pulmonary embolus, the person with MS who isimmobile and/or tends to be sedentary, particularly if he or she is overweight, should consider with their physician whether or not to be anti-coagulated and if so, which anticoagulant is appropriate. The individual should discuss risks and benets of suchtherapy with the physician. Heat and Humidity: People with MS can be extremely heat sensitive. This is traditionally avery common problem in the MS population. Those with heat sensitivity may notice an increase in their MS symptoms including fatigue, visual disturbance, balance, anddiminished strength when their body temperature rises. Cooling will likely restore aprior level of functioning but may take some time. People with MS may nd that spasticityworsens with cold. 4445TIPS: Heat and Humidity 1. Keep the environmental controls at an even temperature. 2. Put fans in the areas where exercise is performed.3. In the summer, encourage the use of cold packs, cooling vests, or cool cloths on the neck, back, or head. 4. In the summer, encourage iced drinks or \"slurpees\".5. When outdoors, limit the time in the heat, make sure shaded areas are available, and make sure the car/van is comfortable before entering the vehicle. 6. Encourage individuals to work with their physicians for appropriate changes in anti-spasmodics in the winter. 7. Air conditioners should be considered a medical necessity. Osteoporosis: All individuals with multiple sclerosis should be considered at risk for osteoporosis. Not infrequent use of steroids and reduced physical activity promoteosteoporosis in both men and women with multiple sclerosis. Treatment and preventionwith calcium rich foods and dietar ysupplements (including calcium and vitamin D), as well as with osteoporosis medication, is likely to be indicated. Particular care for transfersand prevention of falls is very important as fractures may occur easily and heal slowly inthose with reduced bone density. Regular bone density testing is recommended. Exercise: Some people with MS note worsening of symptoms, weakness, or even blur ring of vision with exer cise. Cooling strategies (wearing a cooling vest or scar f, drinking cold beverages or taking a cold bath or shower after exer cising) can alleviate these changes, caused by the temporar yelevation in cor ebody temperatur e. Avoid being over -zealous in exer cise programs. Activities such as Yoga and aquatherapy (in cool water) are particularly popular with people with MS. Exercise should target both MS impairments and generalizedtness. Supervision by a physical therapist is often of benet. Infections: While infections, such as urinary tract infections or flu, can precipitate acute attacks of MS, they may also produce fevers that temporarily worsen existing symptomsby raising body temperature. This type of pseudo-exacerbation will subside as the feversubsides. As a corollary, worsening of symptoms may herald fever and/or infection. Withthe worsening of symptoms, temperature should be ascertained and infections, particularlyrespiratory and urinary tract, ruled out and, if present, treated in a timely fashion. Symptomsthat occur in the presence of a fever should be carefully assessed to determine whetherthey are indicative of a true attack that should be treated. Hypothyroidism: This condition can cause slowing down, fatigue, weight gain, slowed thinking, and even neurologic symptoms that may be confused with MS symptoms.Refer ral to the family doctor or neurologist of the person with MS should be made if there is an unexplained worsening of symptoms.Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Pain: The aches and pains of arthritis and muscle strain and/or sprain are often ascribed to MS, since about half of people with MS have nonspe-cic pain. It is very important that assessment of pain consider non-MS causes. Sleep Disturbance: Disruption of sleep is common in the MS population and can worsen daytime fatigue. Frequent nighttime waking may be the result of muscle spasms, urinaryfrequency, pain, depression, and sleep disorders such as restless leg syndrome andsleep apnea. Such disturbances should be considered in order to determine specificcontributing factors so that treatment might be appropriately designed. Specific sleepdisorders might relate to hypersomnia and fatigue and also worsen cognitive dysfunction. Obesity: Inactivity secondary to disability and depression may contribute to obesity. Treating this common health condition is challenging, as many people with MS havelimitations to participating in vigorous exercise. However, exercise as tolerated, diet, andmedication should be considered, since obesity may contribute to a number of otherserious health disorders. Given the deleterious effects of obesity on independence formany disabled individuals, weight should be monitored and a diet that meets nutritionalneeds and prevents serious weight gain should be maintained. Obesity makes for risk interms of thrombo-embolic disease, diabetes, and other disorders. Consultation with a nutritionist may be indicated. Immunizations: Recent studies have not demonstrated that influenza vaccination causes MS attacks or accelerates pr ogression of the disease. Having MS should not preclude an individual fr om having a fl ushot. The fl ucan be a ver yserious illness, par ticularly in a person with MS who has compr omised r espiration, and the high fever accompanying influenza may exacerbate MS symptoms. The flu, a viral illness, may be associated with an MS r elapse, usually after a latent period. Altogether then, it appears that it is safer to have an infl uenza vaccination rather than to avoid one, but the decision as to whether or not to vaccinate should be made on an individual basis in consultation with thephysician taking into consideration all health risks of both receiving and avoiding fluvaccination. Pneumonia: Pneumonia in sedentary persons with MS is not uncommon. Weakness of respiratory muscles predisposes individuals to pneumonia that is more difcult to treat.When you notice an individual choking or having swallowing difculties a referral for aswallowing evaluation is appropriate. Recommendations from that evaluation shouldbefollowed to prevent aspiration that can contribute to pneumonia, especially for someone with a suppressed immune system and/or who is severely impaired. Pneumococcal vaccination (Pneumovax) should be done once every five years. 46Respiratory Status: An assessment of respiratory status in the very impaired should include observation of respiratory and pulse rates, effectiveness of ventilation, ability toclear secretions, changes in speech pattern, shortness of breath, restlessness, confusion,and change in skin color. A respiratory care plan might include the following: Proper positioning. If an individual slumps, they will restrict ventilation. A safety belt should be tied loosely around the body. When the individual is resting orsleeping, the head of the bed might be elevated, 15-30 degrees to assist in ventilation. The individual should be encouraged to cough and deep breathe at least once every four hours. An incentive spirometer might be used to encourage an individual toreach a goal with deep breathing. Because an individual with MS might have aninsufcient cough to clear secretions spontaneously, postural drainage of secretionsshould be taught to the individual with MS and their caregivers when muscles ofrespiration and or cough are limited. Suctioning can be used to clear the oral pharynx of secretions. An individual with MS can be taught how to suction himself orally to prevent drooling. With severely impaired individuals, respiratory complications are frequently life threatening. The individual, family, and physician, must openly discuss to whatextent life support measures will be used. Although these discussions are verydifficult and painful for all concerned, they are better discussed before lifethreatening complications occur .With acute reversible respiratory illnesses, sometimes temporar yintubation and mechanical ventilation might be necessar y until r espirator ymuscle str ength r eturns and infection is tr eated. Early detection of respiratory complications, especially infection and pulmonary embolus, must be emphasized. The individual with advanced MS, his family ,other car egivers and homecar eteam members must show familiarity and comfor twith pr ocedur es to maintain respiratory care. 47SECTION5 Daily Care Issues Many individuals with MS depend on assistance for their activities of daily living. The type and degree of help needed will vary from client to client and may varyeven from time to time for the same individual. Some individuals may be able toperform some tasks or parts of tasks and require help with limited aspects of care.Others will r equire full assistance. Others may be physically able to perform a task, but the energy expenditure is not practical. Still others may be able to perform tasksindependently one day but not the next. While home health staff are trained toassist clients with various diagnoses and functional limitations, below we highlightissues that may be unique to assisting home health clients with MS. Bathing/Showering: Ayounger client may pr efer showers mor efrequently than a geriatric client. Transfers to the tub or shower may be challenging, depending on the layout of the bathr oom and assistive devices available. Since the bathr oom is a fr equent location for falls, discuss the best techniques the client has developed to safely transfer and the equipment he/she uses (e.g., transfer board, shower bench or chair, hand-heldshower, grab bars, soap-on-a-rope, etc.). Some clients may need to have a bath set upwhile in the bed or wheelchair if accessibility of the bathroom presents a problem. Photos in this chapter courtesy of Greg Baird, Wesley Medical Supply, Glenside, PABathroom Equipment: Individuals who have balance and movement decits may require atransfer chair or bench to move into the tub/shower safely. Once inside, he/she may need to remain seated on the chair or bench while bathing or showering. The types ofchairs that may be used are shown above. If the individual has weakness in the legs, the use of a toilet riser can be very supportive to help prevent falls. At night, the use of a bedside commode can save walking to thebathroom and prevent falls. Commodes are particularly helpful if the bathroom is on adifferent floor, or if the bathroom is a long distance from where the individual spendsmost of his/her time. If the person cannot stand independently ,the car eprovider can use his/her feet and knees as a brace for their feet and knees. Place the chair at a 90-degree angle to the client with the str ongest side leading the movement. Have the person lean for wardand simply bal- ance on his/her feet while tur ning one' sbody and the client' sover the chair or com - mode. Bend from the knees to lower with them into the chair or onto the commode. If a person can't stand, another option is to use a slide board to assist in the transfer. If theperson is paralyzed and cannot help at all with a transfer, it can be accomplished verysafely using a mechanical lift. Climate Control: Most people with MS experience heat intolerance. The individual's symptoms may temporarily worsen when he or she is exposed to any hot environment,such as a hot room, hot and humid weather, hot showers or bath, or if they develop afever. If the client does not already have air-conditioning (or at a minimum, a fan), thehome care worker should assist him/her in obtaining one. (The National MS Societychapter can often help with doing so.) Dressing: As with all clients, personal choice in selecting clothing is important to self- esteem and independence. Some clients may use assistive devices such as r eachers, or button hooks or adapted clothing such as Velcro closures, fasten-in-front clothingitems, elastic waists, etc. As with all ADLs, allow the client to direct the care as muchas possible. 50 Eating: Assistance may range from set up of adaptive devices to feeding the client. Some people with MS experience difficulty swallowing or chewing. A speech therapist andoccupational therapist may be able to offer advice regarding positioning during eating,other swallowing and self feeding techniques, and adaptive equipment that might beuseful for those with signicant problems with this activity. Facilitate as much indepen-dence in eating as possible as self-feeding is often a priority for an individual as is aregular diet in spite of swallowing or chewing difficulties. Feeding should never berushed. The client should concentrate on eating and swallowing and should not bedistracted during meals or snacks to prevent choking or aspirating food. Eating shouldnot occur if the client is sleepy or lethargic; the client should be alert, watchful, andupright. (See Dysphagia (Swallowing Difculties), pages 18-19.) Equipment and Assistive Technology: Power wheelchairs used by many persons with MS are often complex, with many features that may be new to the home care worker (e.g.,tilt and recline devices, anti-tip devices, specialized control systems, etc.). Have the clientand/caregiver explain the safe and appropriate use of these often expensive and vital items. Do not recharge electric scooters or power wheelchairs while the client is sitting in them. In rare cases, these devices may catch fire during recharging. Recharge duringwaking hours and never while seated in the chair. The scooter or wheelchair must beturned off with the key removed while recharging. Recharge in an area where there is a smoke detector. Some clients may have other equipment or devices to incr ease independence. Such devices as envir onmental contr ol units (ECUs), which operate TVs, phones, ster eos, door locks, etc. with voice contr ol or manual switches, adapted computers, communica - tion devices and others can impr ove quality of life for many individuals in their homes. However ,it is impor tant that the home car eworker understand the cor rect use of these items so they can incorporate them into daily ADL r outines, therapies and nursing car e. Exercise: Discuss the type of exercise program (e.g., range of motion, strengthening) and the equipment and positioning required. Appropriate exercise can increase tness as wellasminimize fatigue and deconditioning. Overall, exercise is good, however, the wrong exercises can generate injury and pain. A home exercise program ought to target bothMS-related and non-MS issues. An exercise program ought to address cardiovasculartness as well as strength and flexibility. A physical therapist should work with the clientto develop a safe, appropriate program and should adjust it as necessary over time. Grooming: Age-related ADLs may include shaving and leg waxing, or applying daily makeup in addition to other activities of daily living. These activities are important toself-esteem and may be seen more often in a younger population. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs): People with MS often require assistance with IADLs and homemaking staf fmay assist with laundry, housecleaning, meal preparation, grocery shopping, chores, shopping, and managing home nances. As with any client, itisoptimal for the client to direct these activities as much as possible. 51Scheduling: Flexible scheduling is appealing to younger clients and scheduling ADL tasks to avoid periods of fatigue may be beneficial. If possible, home care staff should workaround the individual client's needs. Furthermore, many people with MS experiencedaily fluctuations of abilities so that need for assistance with activities of daily livingmay vary as MS fluctuates. Socialization: Many people with MS and other physical disabilities may become isolated as a result of mobility problems, environmental barriers, fear and embarrassment relatedtobowel and bladder incontinence, depression and lack of ease socializing with others. Home care workers should encourage clients to contact the National MS Society chapterfor information about social programs in the area and/or help with other services suchas counseling, home adaptations, accessible transportation and other support that mayalleviate this social isolation experienced by many individuals. Toileting: As with all ADLs, the client (often in collaboration with his/her physical and occupational therapist) will have developed particular techniques that work withregard to transfers to the toilet or commode and management of personal hygiene.Younger women may still be menstruating and will require assistance with managementof their periods. Discuss techniques with the client to deter mine the safest, most appro- priate way to conduct these tasks. Some clients may have an established bowel rou-tine that involves facilitating a bowel movement on a regular schedule. Many clientswith MS use catheters and will require assistance with these devices. (See sections onBladder and Bowel Dysfunction, pages 11-16.) Transfers: Home health clients with MS often ar eheavier (they ar eyounger and less frail) and because of MS spasticity ,spasms, and paralysis, are usually more dependent in transfers than geriatric clients. Many may r equir euse of lift devices (e.g., Hoyer lifts or home track lift systems) and other transfer aids (e.g., transfer belt, sliding boar d). Be aware of special considerations for transfers (e.g., shoulder pain, special techniques,protecting skin from friction or skin shear, etc.). Make sure the person has non-skidfootwear on and that all moveable furniture and chairs are locked. 52 The lumber support brace is invaluable in helping to prevent back injuries of care providers. The person with MS should tell the home health provider what part of her/hisbody is weak or paralyzed. Make every effort to use the side/part that is strong during themovement. For example, if the right side is strong, the client should get out of bed onthat side or move that side rst so that it can pull the weaker side with it. If clients havesymptoms of impaired balance and/or weakness, or if they are experiencing excessivefatigue, the use of a gait or transfer belt is very helpful. The client will feel more supported, and the care provider will be less likely to experience a back injury. Lifts: Clients with lower and upper body weakness or paralysis may require complete assistance to transfer between bed, chair, and wheelchair. Mechanical lifts are one ofthe best assistive devices to use for this type of lift and movement. Most lifts have asling that is placed under the person and then attached to the lift. They all roll andhave a locking feature. Lifts come in either manual or electric styles. If the client has a lift, proper use of the lift is necessary to avoid injury. Always review the manufacturer's instructionsthat come with the equipment before using it. Request an in-service by the medicalsupply company if additional instruction is required. Even better, have the client'soccupational or physical therapist review the transfer technique with the home careworker and client together. Body Mechanics: Body mechanics has been described as using the body in an ef cient and safe way. Proper body mechanics requires good posture and the alignment ofhead, trunk, arms and legs over a good base of supportwher ethe feet ar epositioned about 12 inches apar t. One should wear shoes with a non-skid sur face on General principles of movement and lifting ar e: Work in cooperation with the person.First deter mine what he/she can do and what help he/she needs. Explain each step and what he/she can do to help with the movement. Move together at the same time.Bend the knees and lift with the leg muscles, not the back muscles. Do not bend at the waist to lift an object. Exhale while lifting.Keep the person close to and in front of the body so as not to lean or bend at the waist. Turn the whole body rather than twist your back at the waist to complete a transfer. 53 Push, pull or slide the person if you can, rather than lift. Transfer, rather than lift, if the person can help with the movement.Don't move people who are too heavy. Ask for help or get a mechanical lift. Walking and Mobility: The client may use a cane or quad cane to help with balance, or he/she may use a rolling or non-rolling walker. Several new varieties of rolling walkersare available. One type walker that maximizes independence also has a seat if the clientbecomes tired; some have a container to hold personal items and purchases. Clients may also use a scooter or wheelchair to increase mobility. Scooters are particularly helpful when weakness and fatigue are limiting a person's ability to walk distances. To useascooter effectively, a person needs to be able to stand and transfer into the seat. Wheelchairs can either be manually driven, or powered by a battery. It is very importantthat a seating specialist prescribe the wheeled mobility for people with MS. Wheelchairsmay also need to be tted with additional padding to prevent skin breakdown. Falls andabrasions can occur with wheelchairs, so care should be taken to prevent these hazards. Manual Wheelchair Power Wheelchair 54 Power ScooterSECTION6 Safety The primary safety issues for clients with MS derive from mobility problems. Problems with mobility\u2014weakness, coordination, balance, and spasticity\u2014put an individual atan increased risk for falls and could potentially impede the ability to safely performdaily personal car etasks. Balance problems may pose safety risks, especially when coming to a standing position or transferring to or from a wheelchair. Complicationsof bowel and bladder dysfunction, especially when there is diarrhea, may generatean ambulator ysafety issue given the natur eof the emer . Diminished sensation may r epresent a safety concer n, par ticularly r egarding feeding (hot food and beverages), bathing (hot water), and smoking (bur ns). An individual with impair ed sensor yawar eness may not feel pain that they might other wise feel with nor mal sensation and be unawar eof a need to r eposition or a need for tr eatment for an ar ea of skin breakdown. Cognitive deficits and sensory deficits also place the client at risk for accidents. MS deficits that are not effectively managed may lead the individual to feelunsafe, develop fear and anxiety about leaving the home or engaging in anyactivities that are not routine. Furthermore, cognitive deficits may result in poorjudgment, inattention, and disorganization that, particularly in the kitchen and bath,may place the individual at risk for injury. An individual's judgment, organizationaland planning functioning may have impact on the safety of operating a power-operated wheelchair or scooter. There may be safety issues with regard to managingamanual wheelchair. The individual with cognitive impairment may not recognize an emergency situation and respond appropriately to it.ADDRESSING SAFETY ISSUES When going into the home of a new client for the initial visit, take special care to address safety issues: Look at safety regarding a client's ability to get in and out of the home. An occupa- tional therapist or physical therapist can often help with this assessment. Discuss emergency preparedness.Consider what to do if the battery runs out for wheeled mobility.Identify if client lives alone or has caregiver at home or attendant.Plan safety access with each individual client.Consider questions like \"What would you do if ...?\" (Discuss possible scenarios together.) If there is smoking by the client, suggest a smoking vest that is reproof.If available in the community, encourage your client to register with local re and police re: special needs for evacuation. A\"Vial of Life\" can be placed in the refrigerator containing emergency information. The vial is used by emergency responders to quickly locate helpful informationregarding medical history, medications, allergies and advance directives. A sticker isplaced on the r efrigerator aler ting responders to the existence of the vial. Proper transfer techniques and cor rect use of mobility aids will decr ease risk. Adding to risk for falls is the home envir onment. An occupational therapist or home health nurse may be able to make r ecommendations for re-arrangement of fur niture, removing small area rugs, installation of grab bars or use of other adaptive equipment to minimize this risk. Another way to maximize safety is having an easily accessible and usable phone (large buttons, hands-free dialing)or an Emergency Response System (ERS). Such a system usually consists of a call deviceon a bracelet or necklace. The device alerts an attendant who can summon necessaryemergency responders. Adjustable heat and air conditioning are necessary to avoid accidents relating to increased weakness and other symptoms generated by an increase in corebody temperature and to an increase in spasticity generated by cold. 56DEVELOPING AN EMERGENCY PLAN Home care workers can assist individuals with multiple sclerosis, whether they live independently or with others, to prepare and be ready for emergencies. Assist the individual to complete a personal assessment of what kind of help they would need in an emergency. (For example: Would he/she be able to evacuate thehome? Could he/she be trained how to self-evacuate safely?) What modes of communication could he/she use to learn of emergency instructions or to contact one's support system or emergency personnel? Is there access to anappropriate telephone (hand free dialing, for example)? If the person has a service animal or pet, can he/she care for the animal in an emergency or make other plans? Assist the individual with identifying and enlisting a personal support network in case traditional supports, such as home health services, are not available. Ensure the individual has extra supplies on hand.Give friends and family copies of essential medical and disability-related information, including assistive devices and basic supplies, and instructions on how to use. Give extra house and car keys to friends and family who have been identied to help in case of an emergency. Practice emer gency drills for evacuation in the event of re, natural disasters, etc. For the individual with multiple scler osis, medications and wheeled mobility can pr esent unique challenges. Regar ding medications : If the person with MS uses self-administer ed medications, discuss purchasing a generator for home use, or a small portable refrigerator which can be charged withaconverter connected to a car cigarette lighter. Have an insulated bag and supplies ready to use for a mobile kit.Suggest storing extra medication at the workplace or other location routinely used. Regarding wheeled mobility, the person with MS should have : An extra battery (a car battery can be used but will not last as long).Apatch-kit and can of seal-in air product in mobile emergency kit for tires. An extra supply of inner tubes.The ability to recharge or replace the battery in an emergency (jumper cables or converter for a car cigarette lighter). Alightweight portable wheelchair as a back-up. 5758For more detailed emergency procedure information, please go to Appendix E. TIPS: Safety Issues 1. Access to telephones (large buttons, volume control, hand-free dialing, etc. when necessary) is important when there are emergency situations. 2. Access to light switches is important, particularly when the individual transfers at night or is in poorly lit areas. 3. Emergency access and entry must be clearly delineated and familiar to all concerned\u2014individuals with MS, family caregivers, and home care workers.SECTION7 Emotional and Family Issues MS makes severe emotional demands on those living with the disease. Individuals and families are confronted with many functional and physical losses, major changesinfamily and social roles, and loss of control over many life decisions. Particular issues such as child r earing, marital and dating relationships, sexuality, physical attractiveness, and depression about the future (career, independence, etc.) are criticalareas of concern for this younger population. Access to social work or psychiatricsuppor tis an impor tant featur eof any car eplan for people with MS. FAMILY AND CAREGIVER ISSUES Home car eservices can bring great relief to family caregivers. These services may enable family members to continue working and pr ovide the r espite necessar yfor their emotional health. Often home care services provide the support needed to enable the individual to remain at home and may delay out-of-home placement. Most people with MS who require home care services do not meet the traditional prole of those who generally use these services, particularly with regard to age.Much of their on-going care at home is most likely provided by family members.These family car egivers ar ealso not typical. Car egivers of people with MS tend to be working spouses who may also have child care responsibilities. These MS caregivers may be stretched beyond their emotional and physical resources by the demands ofcaregiving and need the ser vices of a home care agency or other paid providers. Some MS car egivers ar eelderly par entsof adults with MS. The issues that these car egivers face include their inability to manage the physical demands of caregiving as they age or become disabled themselves and the uncertainty of who will take over these responsi-bilities when they can no longer manage them or when they die. Some car egivers ar e children .While it may be appropriate for adult children to provide care, people with MS may also be cared for by their teenagers or younger children. Whenever possible,personal car eby children must be avoided. Home care can provide the family with the services required to avoid placing young children in inappropriate caregiving situations.EMOTIONAL ISSUES While each person's emotional reactions to a chronic, unpredictable disease like MS will differ, there are some fairly common emotions that the home care staff would expect toencounter. These reactions will ebb and flow as the disease changes and the demands itplaces on the individual increase and abate. Furthermore, many individuals will experi-ence several of these emotions simultaneously. Grief is an ongoing, if intermittent, response over the course of the disease. From the time of diagnosis, and continuing throughout the course of the illness, the person willexperience periods of grief\u2014a normal reaction to any kind of loss. Every change orsymptom can represent a loss of self and personal identity, of autonomy and personalcontrol, of a particular skill or ability\u2014things that most adults cherish. Every loss ofability or control requires a change in the person's self-image; every time the self-imageundergoes a change, the person may grieve. Anxiety is a common response to the unpredictability of MS. From one day to the next as well as one year to the next, people don't know how they are going to feel, what parts oftheir bodies ar egoing to be affected, and what the future is going to hold for them. This kind of unpr edictability makes people feel out of contr ol of their bodies and their lives, and when people feel out of control, they get anxious. Family members share a similaranxiety over the unpredictable impact MS may have on their lives. Resentment isanother common r esponse to unpr edictability and loss of contr ol-for both people with MS and their family members. One of the biggest challenges people face is nding a satisfactory outlet for this resentment. They need to learn how to express their anger in a constr uctive way ,focusing it on the disease rather than each other or the doctor .Even when people with MS feel legitimate anger towar dtheir loved ones for one reason or another, they may be afraid to express it and risk driving their partner/caregiver away .They tend to feel stuck with an anger that has no outlet. Guilt: People may also experience guilt as they deal with MS. They feel guilty about their inability to fulll their roles and obligations in different areas of their lives. They worrythat they ar eletting ever ybody down, no longer pulling their own weight. Ther eis also guilt over uncomfor table feelings\u2014par ticularly the anger toward care partners, children, and God. DEPRESSION At least 50% of people with MS will experience a major depr essive episode at some point over their disease course. Because of feelings of loss, as well as neurologic changes causedby the disease itself, depr ession is ver ycommon among persons with MS. Fatigue\u2014 which can be an outgrowth of depression or occur as a primary symptom\u2014frequentlycompounds depression in persons with MS. 6061Symptoms of depression include: persistent sadness or unhappinesslethargyloss of interest in previously enjoyable activitiesirritabilitychange in appetitedisruption of normal sleep patternphysical discomfortdifculty thinking or concentratingthoughts of suicide or death In National MS Society-supported studies on suicide and MS, researchers concluded that the level of disability is not the key predictor of suicide risk. Rather, suicide risk is morerelated to a lack of connectedness with other people, and a negative self-perception ofone's self, body, and future. Warning signs of suicide risk include: talking about suicide; statements about hopeless- ness, helplessness, or worthlessness; preoccupation with death; being suddenly happieror calmer; loss of inter est in things one cares about; visiting or calling people one cares about; making arrangements; setting one's affairs in order; and giving things away. TIPS: Coping With Change Home car estaffcan help individuals to cope with change by: 1. Encouraging expression of feelings.2. Encouraging the individual to continue to pursue former interests.3. Participating in training to understand the psychosocial, emotional and family issues related to MS and how they can affect daily routine and relationships. 4. Understanding depression in MS and how to be sensitive and appropriately responsive. 5. Recognizing the challenge for individuals who must make signicant changes to their daily r outines. AFFECTIVE DISORDERS Affective release (also \"Involuntary Emotional Expresive Disorder\" (IEED)) refers to unpredictable episodes of laughing or crying, often havingnothing to do with the person's underlying mood, or to an excessive response to somestimulus or provocation. Medications are available to treat this disorder. Emotional crescendo describes an experience in which a person becomes very emotional, crying very easily in response to any stimulus that triggers intense emotion or tension.Once the response is stimulated, it feels uncontrollable until it reaches a crescendo andresolves on its own. It differs from affective release in that the person's mood andexpression are more consistent with one another. While not as upsetting or embarrassingas affective release, emotional crescendo interferes significantly with any efforts toresolve a conflict or have any kind of disagreement. Some success has been achievedwith a behavioral intervention involving focused attention on the build-up of tension,deep-breathing, and relaxation to dampen or halt the response. Euphoria ,dened as a sustained mood state involving exaggerated and inappropriate happiness and optimism in the context of a very bleak situation, is generally associatedwith extensive cerebral demyelination and dementia. Once considered the hallmark ofMS, it is actually seen in less than 10 per cent of individuals. There is no known treat- ment for this phenomenon; supportive interventions for the family are essential. FINDING NEW MEANING FOR CONCEPTS OF SELF, INDEPENDENCE, AND CONTROL Aperson who becomes increasingly dependent upon assistive devices, personal aides, and other for ms of outside assistance needs to take pride and satisfaction in being able to identify, obtain and manage these resources. In other words, he or she needs to nd newways to think about exer ting independence and contr ol in ever yday life. Finding the \"MS-Free Zone\": Severely disabled individuals, who feel that MS has altered everyaspect of their lives, need to be encouraged to look for their personal, MS-fr ee zone wher eMS has not r eached. For one it might be a sense of humor or love of music, for another a particular skill or talent, or a religious faith. For some, it might be a physical place. Whatever it is, the MS-fr ee zone pr ovides an emotional r espite fr om the day-to- day challenges and losses. Spiritual Life: Living with losses and disability of MS often pr ecipitates serious existential questions about the meaning of the illness, fate, the existence of God, God' srole in life events, life's unpredictability and injustices, values, priorities and more. Programs thatsuppor tthe spiritual life of individuals ar eimpor tant in helping them grapple with these issues. 62EMOTIONAL ISSUES RELATED TO SEEKING HOME CARE SERVICES Fear of the Unknown: Inviting a new person(s) into the home often raises anxiety\u2014What will the home health aide (or personal care assistant) be like? Will the same person comeeach visit? What if he/she doesn't come? Does he/she know about MS? Will he/she comein and dictate changes and new methods of doing things without rst spending time tounderstand how I do things now? I don't want someone here interfering with my scarceprivacy, rearranging my furniture, clothes, cherished items. Can I trust these home careproviders? I feel vulnerable because of my MS mobility problems. Fear of Being Viewed as a \"Failure\": People bring their own personal meaning to illness and disability. Some may see illness as a punishment, others as bad luck and still othersas a test of courage and spirit. When things are not going well and coping with MS ischallenging, some people may see their lack of courage or spirit as failure. These feelingsmay feed depression and poor self-esteem, further reinforcing a sense of distress andself-disappointment. Concern About Finances: Finances are often a major stressor in a home where an individual can no longer work. In par ticular ,worries about covering the costs of home care may cause signicant anxiety. Financial worries often create an increased sense of vulnerability\u2014Will I be able to maintain the level of care I need? At what expense will home care be provided?Will my spouse have to work longer hours? Will we need to sell-off possessions or assets? For information on the nancial aspects of home care, please go to Appendix F. RISK OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT In families wher ethere is chronic illness and disability, the risk for abuse and or neglect may be higher. Stress, caregiver burnout, nancial issues and limited support do notcause violence. However ,these issues can fur ther exacerbate an abusive situation and may likely lead to mor esever eabuse and neglect. Home care staff are in a unique position to recognize signs of abuse and neglect, observe some interaction between family members and otherwise notice high risk factors in the home. Factors associated with high risk of abuse, but not precise predictors include the following: Caregiver caretakers or healthcare professionals. ahistory or current abuse of substances (alcohol, prescribed or illegal drugs). attitudes of dehumanization or devaluation toward patient with MS or a specic gender, rigid ideas about gender (sex) roles. 63signs of \"burn-out\", including exaggeration of caregiving involvement or of caregiv- ingassistance or the degree of MS disability. limited or impaired ability to provide care because of their own physical or mental health issues or other related factors. acriminal history, including assault or substance-possession convictions. unrealistic expectations of abilities or capabilities of the person with MS.acontrolling attitude or forcefulness about patient rights or decisions, such as type, extent or location of care (initially may appear as overly concerned). inappropriate blame of person with MS or others for the disease.sudden changes in mood or hypersensitivity. Person with MS has: little or no access to family, friends or community support\u2014social isolation. chronic progressive disease that appears to exceed the caregiver's ability to manage.family members who are nancially dependent on them.symptoms of poorly managed mobility needs, bowel or bladder incontinence, problematic cognitive symptoms and/or personality changes or disease worsening. physical dependency that may make a person mor evulnerable to mistreatment by others. Paid caregivers, drivers, homemakers and others who provide assistance topeople with MS may behave inappropriately and take advantage of this dependence. past abuse or neglect by caregiver. Physical indicators of abuse and neglect include: bruises or welts that cannot be explained by falls or bumps related to mobility problems; br uises in the shape of a hand, ngers or familiar object, bilateral br uis- ing. Br uises ar elikely to be located in places that normally aren't viewed or in places where they wouldn't show\u2014abdomen, thighs, buttocks, back, etc. burns that cannot be explained adequately or that are in the shape of cigarette butts. abrasions, e.g., marks on the neck or marks fr om r estraints on ar ms or legs. genital pain, ir ritation, itching that may be indicative of sexual abuse. histor yof recurrent hospitalizations or r ecurrent injuries. poor hygiene, e.g., body odor ,unkempt hair ,skin, clothing. impr oper clothing for the weather . 64bed sores and skin irritation related to soiled clothing or bed linens or not being positioned or turned regularly. untreated medical conditions.medication mismanagement, such as skipped doses, over-medication, unaccounted for or missing medication. lack of necessary mobility equipment, glasses, dentures.dehydration.malnourishment.mismanaged nances.lack of supervision.unexplained injuries or explanation that does not t with observations.inadequate or unsafe living arrangements, e.g., inadequate heat, cooling, safety, electricity ,access to telephone, ar chitectural barriers. Emotional or verbal indicators of abuse include the following: Individual appears uncommunicative, defensive or frightened in the presence of caregiver. Thereis reporting of verbal or emotional abuse. There is emotional upset or agitation.Appearance is withdrawn or apathetic.Unusual behavior is exhibited, such as rocking, sucking or biting. 65SECTION8 Rehabilitation Rehabilitation services are consistently cited as a high priority for people with MS. These therapies represent an opportunity to maximize overall health, comfort, andindependence. Some home health agencies may have rehabilitation professionals on staff, others contract with therapists fr om the community and still others may refer clients when there is a distinct need. Insurance coverage for r ehabilitation ser vices may be problematic for some people with MS since impr ovement and r estoration may not be feasible goals. Maintenance of function and pr evention of fur ther disability ar eappropriate goals for many people with MS but ar enot necessarily recognized as reimbursable by third party payers. REHABILITATION REFERRAL Refer individuals to physiatrists, occupational therapists (OTs), physical therapists (PTs), speech and language pathologists (SLPs), neur opsychologists, psychiatrists, and other appropriate professionals (e.g., orthopedists, orthotists, assistive technology experts) to provide support in complex situations. These health professionals canoffer a customized approach to assessing mobility, positioning, feeding, and equipment needs as well as therapeutic exercise and training. A neurologist can often serve as aprincipal car eprovider, doing the initial assessment and sharing coordination of care with a primary care physician. Referral to rehabilitation professionals is important ifthere are changes in mobility, slurred speech or an increase in difculty communicating,swallowing difculty, an increase in stiffness or spasticity, increased tremors, fatigueinter fering with functioning, etc. Rehabilitation pr ar ealso impor tant in assessing the individual' sneed for seated mobility and other assistive technology.Physical Therapy (PT) can help strengthen weakened or uncoordinated muscles, and improve balance. PT might include range-of-motion exercises, stretching, strengthening,assistance with walking, and the best ways to be fitted for and to use canes, walkers,wheelchairs, or other assistive devices. PT can also include exercises to increase overallfunction and stamina. A physical therapist can design a home exercise program targetingboth MS and non-MS issues. Occupational Therapy (OT) is geared toward maintaining or improving independence in both basic and instrumental activities of daily living. OT includes teaching compensatorytechniques for both physical and cognitive (thinking) problems, energy conservationtechniques, strengthening methods, building tolerance for activity, and improving abilityto perform a full range of everyday activities (e.g., dressing, transfers, home managementactivities, driving). Occupational therapists provide recommendations and training foractivity and environmental modications, and assistive devices to facilitate functioning. Speech Therapy (ST) may improve communication for those who may have difculty speaking or swallowing due to weakness or poor coordination. Techniques used byspeech/language therapists (also called speech and language pathologists: SLP) mightinclude exer cise, voice training, or the use of special devices. Cognitive Rehabilitation offers strategies to improve or compensate for such problems as those involving memory, attention, information processing, and reasoning. Cognitiverehabilitation sessions may be with a neur opsychologist, speech and language pathologist, or occupational therapist. Expressive Arts Therapy uses five ar tdisciplines\u2014visual arts, music, drama, dance, and poetr y\u2014to impr ove and enhance the physical, mental and emotional well-being of individuals of all ages. Its goal is to help r educe str ess, incr ease self-esteem, and ser ve as avehicle for self expression. EXERCISE Persons with MS should be cautious about engaging in vigorous exercise. It can increase core body temperature that may augment weakness or other symptoms. Exercise and tness go along with general overall good health and wellness and should be carried out in conjunction with preventative care, with proper diet andavoidance of unhealthy habits such as smoking. Relaxation exercises should be part of the overall program with regard to wellness. Relaxation and exercise programs can reduce the effects of stress upon the bodyand improve the emotional wellbeing of an individual. 68Swimming and alternative exercise programs such as yoga or Tai Chi with supervision are excellent choices for tness. (Make sure pool temperatures are not too high, asheat can exacerbate symptoms.) An occupational or physical therapist may suggest a variety of exercises designed to compensate for lost function and/or improve overall strength, range of motion, andendurance. In a rehabilitation clinical setting, use of standing frames, adapted station-ary bicycles (that can provide upper extremity exercise) and other pieces of exerciseequipment can be used to provide a range of exercise and rehabilitation options. ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT An occupational or physical therapist can evaluate an individual's functioning in the home environment and then make recommendations for special adaptive equipment toassist weakened muscles and ways to conserve energy to make the activities of daily livingless fatiguing. Adaptive equipment for hygiene, housekeeping, cooking, laundry, etc.should be regarded as tools to augment faulty mobility, sensation and balance, a way ofgetting jobs done with more efciency and conservation of energy. Devices that might enhance ADL independence include: unbreakable dishware.strong hand rails on stairs or bathroom bedrails.big knobs on stoves, cabinets, ramps, even small ones from room to room if there is aslight change in elevation. seat in shower ,flexible shower head. light switch near bed. rounded corners on furniture. USE OF MOBILITY DEVICES Use of mobility aids, such as canes, crutches and walkers may also offset the effects of weakness and preserve independence. A physical therapist, occupational therapist,physiatrist, or orthodist can determine the best mobility aids and assistive devices. Ifthere is weakness of a foot and ankle, there will likely be foot drop and a compensatorytechnique is provided by an ankle orthosis. This can be used also to diminish the effectsof spasticity by tilting the foot upward and it will keep the foot from turning inwardor outward as well as reducing \"foot drop\". In addition to weakness, the brace willreduce imbalance and wear and tear on involved joints. It may enhance safety withreduction of falls. 69Acane is usually carried in the hand opposite a weak limb. Walking is a reciprocal activity, the left hand going forward with the right foot and vice versa. A cane held on the side ofweakness might cause an increase in limp. A cane is simply another mobility tool used tooptimize the function of weak muscles and impaired balance. It might also allow a shiftof weight off of a painful lower limb. Aforearm or Lofstrand crutch can provide greater stability than a cane when balance and/or more severe weakness are present. It requires less upper extremity strength thandoes a cane. With pronounced weakness of both legs, two canes or crutches may be required. If balance is especially poor, a walker may be the proper assistive device. For those needing maximumstability, it may be better to use a walker without wheels. Some of the new improvedwalkers have larger wheels as well as seats. They move smoothly and allow one to turn\"onadime\". They allow one to sit and rest (with the brakes locked). WHEELED MOBILITY Because of severe physical disability (weakness, paralysis, tremors, spasticity, fatigue, sensory decits, incoordination, visual decits, etc.), people with MS frequently requirepower wheelchairs, some with tilt and recline capabilities, wide dimensions, customizedpositioning, and customized drive controls. They may require complex drive systems(e.g., breath-controlled, head-controlled, tongue switches, joy sticks) due to weakness,tremors, spasticity, or paralysis generated by their MS. Proper positioning can improvecomfor t, independence, and mobility as well as pr event secondar ycomplications such can incr ease elasticity ,generate pain, and r esult in loss of skin integrity . Ensuring that an individual obtains the right type of wheeled mobility (manual or power), with the featur es that ar emost appropriate for his/her physical, cognitive and environmental situation is critical and complex. Referral to a specialized seating and mobility clinic will provide the greatest likelihood of ensuring that a person with MSobtains the best and most appropriate wheeled mobility device. Given the restrictionsthat insurance companies often place on the wheeled mobility, the importance of thesecomprehensive assessments cannot be overstated. Scooters are extremely useful for people with MS. They are best used for people with some mobility or ability to walk and who have good trunk strength, can control their lowerlimbs, and can transfer on and off completely. They do not provide a good supportive seatfor any length of time and therefore are not appropriate for one requiring good trunksupport. Cognitive impairment, lack of judgment, or poor vision could be problematic inusing a scooter or power wheelchair. 70Reimbursement by third party payers for rehabilitation services may pose a challenge, but staff should be aware that people with MS may be eligible for automatic extensionsof coverage for OT and PT. ( See Appendix G for more information about reimbursement. ) TIPS: Wheeled Mobility 1. Understand the proper use of wheelchairs, how to charge power chairs, and the proper use of devices such as splints. Wheelchairs are often costly and complexmachines that require on-going care to remain reliable. 2. Remember to clear crumbs and food stains, clean up after episodes of inconti- nence, and clean up after outdoor use (clearing mud, leaves). 3. Understand proper positioning, e.g., the wearing schedule of splints, checking for skin breakdown or irritation, and proper use of other positioning. 4. Monitor the individual's ability to safely mobilize their wheelchairs or scooters and note when a referral for new equipment may be appropriate. 71SECTION9 Wellness and Community Integration Wellness can be described as a satisfying balance among the various aspects of health and well-being. Persons with MS have described wellness as feeling enabled,not disabled, motivated to do things, and connected to others. The diagram below describes various health domains. Healthcar eprofessionals should nd ways to promote persons' productive and meaningful activity, especiallywhen work and homemaker type activities are limited due to the MS. Caregiversshould be aware of the many benets of social and productive engagement, in orderto support the person with MS in productive activities. Here are some examples of activities in each one of these health domains: Physical Health: Yoga, education and training in self-care, medication manage- ment, nutrition education, symptom management, personal health advocacy . Social Health: Community trips, dining out, shopping, cooking activities. Emotional Health: Peer counseling, individual psychotherapy ,pet therapy ,vol- unteer work, str ess management, sharing personal knowledge and exper tise. Intellectual Health: Current events discussions, reading, attending lectures, the- ater, movies, etc., computer activities, writing and journal keeping, continuing adult education. Spiritual Health: Meditation, r elaxation, expr essive therapies, r eligious activities, consultation with a r eligious leader or chaplain. HEALTH PROMOTION AND WELLNESS Health promotion and wellness should be encouraged by home care workers. Computer Literacy offers many opportunities for intellectual stimulation, increased access to health information, social interaction through chat rooms and e-mail, and fun. Home health staf fmight dir ect the individual to r esour ces to lear ncomputer skills and access options for modi cations of computer or software options for impaired vision and move- ment. (An occupational therapist can suggest these modications.) 74Social Having positive interactions with others. Communicating feelings, practicing empathy and effective listening, balancing work, family, and leisurePhysical Integrating physical activity, nutrition, sleep preventive health behaviors into lifestyle practices Emotional Maintaining good mental health, positive attitude, high self-esteem, strong self-image and ability to manage stress Spiritual The quest for meaning, value and purpose within one's own personal beliefs resulting in hope, joy courage and gratitude.Intellectual Responding to challenges and opportunities to grow, developing strategies, maintaining and enhancing the ability to engage in clear thinking and recall, and to think independently, creatively and criticallyMS Health & Wellness Program Model75If a client does not have a computer, encourage him/her to explore places that provide access to the internet free. These can include the public library, public schools, seniorcenters, and various community organizations. A variety of agencies provide refurbishedcomputers or assist with funding. Rehabilitation facilities may have departments that canadapt such equipment to compensate for a peron's disability. Computers are increasinglyused to pay bills, order groceries, record nances, etc., activities that can be made easierthrough information technology. Driving: Some people with MS, despite signicant mobility limitations, are able to drive, particularly with vehicle modications. A driving evaluation can determine if the indi-vidual is safe behind the wheel and can determine what modications may be necessary,e.g., hand controls. Help clients who cannot drive to explore accessible transportationoptions in their community and encourage participation in community events. TIPS: Health Promotion and Wellness 1. Remind clients to keep routine health appointments with their primary care physician and dentist. Regular and preventive care (e.g., mammograms, etc.)should be encouraged. See section on Primary Healthcare Needs, pages 43-47. 2. Facilitate good nutrition and eating habits. Homemakers and other personal assis- tants who help the individual shop for and pr epare food should keep in mind healthy eating, need for modi ed foods (e.g., thickeners) and pr ovision of foods that are enjoyable to eat! 3. Facilitate tness and exercise. Consult the physical therapist for advice on a home exercise program and if the use of modied exercise videotapes, stretching and strengthening routines, use of tness equipment, etc. are appropriate. 4.Pay attention to sleep and r elaxation. Help the individual access tapes for r elax- ation and str ess the importance of conserving energy and rest times. 5. Help the individual manage his/her fatigue. Consultation with an occupational therapist about energy-saving strategies to perform ADLs may be of benet. 6.Urge caution when the individual expr esses inter est in alter native approaches to health such as the use of alter native therapies or \"natural\" products. Stress the importance of discussion with their neurologist or their primary care physician on any use of \"natural\" or alter native appr oaches. Unsafe inter ventions, and/or those without a scientic basis which exhaust the reserves of an individual's and family's assets, should be avoided.COMMUNITY RESOURCES Help the individual nd and use resources in the community. Maintaining life within the community is very important to people with MS. There are many services and pro-grams available that can help to address disability issues and promote independence andcommunity involvement. Before going to a new place, identify if the site is accessible. Each state has Centers for Independent Living (CILs) that offer a range of services including peer counseling, housing referral, assistance with obtaining personalassistance, medical equipment and more. Older persons can turn to Area Agencies on Aging and Senior Centers for resource information. Adult Day Programs may be a useful resource for some clients. Sometimes personal assistants accompany the client to the adult day program. Durable Medical Equipment suppliers sell or rent wheelchairs, lifts, hospital beds, etc. Vocational Rehabilitation Services work with people with disabilities who want to stay in or r eturn to the workforce. The V eterans Administration and Paralyzed Veterans of America provide support services to veterans. TRANSPORTATION People with disabilities often r ely on accessible transportation in order to continue to be engaged and involved in their communities. They need this transpor tation to get to medical appointments, do gr ocery shopping, get to employment or volunteer work, or participate in community events and activities. This means access to vans and buses that can accommodate a wide variety of wheeled mobility, from manual wheelchairs totechnologically advanced power chairs. Paratransit services are transportation services for the disabled that the community must provide to be in compliance with the American with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADAguarantees that people with disabilities have the same access to public services, such astransportation, as people without disabilities. Public bus services are expected to providebuses with wheelchair lifts and other special devices. Curb to curb service can also beavailable, although the person with a disability is usually required to be out of the houseand on the sidewalk for pickup. 76If a person with MS is using accessible transportation, one must be sure that tie-downs and other safety features can accommodate his/her wheelchair and that drivers have receivedspecialized training in serving a population with signicant disability and complicatedwheeled equipment. Medicaid will often cover transportation expenses to medicalappointments and services. Because fatigue is a signicant factor for many people with MS, the time it takes to be transported must be considered when determining if a program or event is appropriateand practical to attend. Air-conditioning is also absolutely required for participantswith MS. Practical information about community-based accessible transportation services for people with disabilities can be found at: www.projectaction.org, a service of Easter Seals.This website has information on accessible travel options in cities across the U.S. andincludes details on transit, paratransit, taxi, airport shuttles, and many other transportationservices. 77 "}
