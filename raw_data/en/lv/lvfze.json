We work with partners across government, in the private sector and around the globe to leverage mutually beneficial investments, activities and technology development efforts that facilitate the fielding of advanced capabilities for members of the Homeland Security Science & Technology Enterprise (HSE). The R&D Partnerships Group is comprised of a select collection of offices that focus on several aspects of research, innovation and the de velopment of technology and products across all members of the HSE. This collaborative model e nhance s DHS S&T's outreach and engagement with the many entities that are actively involved with efforts that can bring greater security to the HSE. Bringing tog ether the full scope, expertise and shared knowledge of the HSE, the R&D Partnerships Group seeks to promulgate and serve as a catalyst for improved interaction and cooperative engagement between DHS and HSE members. The R&D Partnerships Group has a staff that brings years of experience in the homeland security field with diverse backgrounds and expertise that allow for a stronger connection between the HSE and DHS S&T. It is the goal of the many workshops conducted by the R&D Partnerships Group to effectiv ely and efficiently deliver the mission and vision not only of the group, but of all DHS , in order to educate the HSE through a series of briefs o n the critical mission areas of the Department, opportunities available for partnerships and collaboration, the imperative need for developing detailed requirements, the various programs and vehicles available to the HSE and guidance on how to successfully approach the Department. The roundtable discussions inherent in these workshops provide a forum for open dial ogue between members of the HSE and representatives from the R&D Partnerships Group to discuss the various topics presented and recommendations on programs and vehicles that should be considered based upon each unique and specific capability. This workshop format has been proven effective and consequently has generated enormous amounts of positive feedback from the participants as it fosters constructive and informative interactions between members of DHS S&T and the HSE through the mutually - beneficial exchange of information regarding the critical mission focus areas of the Department and the potential capabilities that can meet the needs of the Department and its stakeholders. A typical workshop agenda can be found in Appendix I.

Homeland security is a widely distributed and diverse\u2014but unmistakable\u2014national enterprise. The term \"enterprise\" refers to the collective efforts and shared responsibilities of Federal, State, local, tribal, territorial, nongovernmental, and private- sector partners \u2014as well as individuals, families, and communities \u2014to maintain critical homeland security capabilities The QHSR acknowledges existing relationships, roles, and responsibilities, and seeks to set forth a shared vision of homeland security in order to achieve unity of purpose. The Nation's first QHSR takes as its aim a vision for our homeland as safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and way of life can thrive.

It is notbased on actual requirements for any particular sector or organization, nor is it a full set of requirements. 15Remember to define the problem (not the solution) Must be expressed as a needed capability, not a needed product or system Usually expressed in broad operational terms We need to detect intruders ..We need a better camera system .. 16How to start ... Capability gaps are derived from analysis of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences Operational requirements are derived from talking to operators -Include functional requirements (\"what the product must do\") as well as operational concepts (\"how the product will be used\") Make sure you're talking with someone who has the authority and knowledge to represent both the end users and those who make buying decisions. 17Users Who are the end users? And who are the \"end customers\" (those who make buying decisions), who may be neither the end users nor a DHS Agency. Capability Gap What new capability do the end users need? Do they recognize the need? Can they articulate it? And what new capability do the \"end customers\" think the end users need? Market Survey Does the new capability really require a new product or system? What's the existing COTS product which comes closest to meeting the need, and who produces it? And if no product exists, why not? (There may be a good reason why it doesn't exist, and that reason may be a good reason why DHS should not develop it.) Logistics Requirements How will the product to be developed ultimately find its way to the field and have an impact on operations? Can it be deployed to captive users (e.g., Federal employees) or must it be adopted by independent users (e.g., first responders or shipping companies)? Who will develop the end product (prime contractor, private sector, S&T)? Who will manufacture it? Who will distribute it? How will the end users be trained, and by whom? In short, who will do the logistics planning and support?Questions to ask a customer (1 of 3) This last cluster of questions is grouped because, taken together, these questions address one of the most critical questions that DHS must answer: \"What's the channel to the end users?\" If there's no feasible channel, then why develop the product?18Functional Requirements What is the product or system supposed to do? How well does it have to do it? (e.g., for detection systems, what detection probabilities are required, and what false-alarm rates are tolerable?) Operational Concept What are the most typical use scenarios? What are standard operating procedures? Where will the product or system be used and under what conditions (dirty? cold? hot?). How often? How long? Affordability How cheap does the product have to be to be affordable? Who will be paying the bill? What's their willingness to pay? How do we know?Questions to ask a customer (2 of 3) The last topic is critical, particularly for the private sector where price (not performance) is king. If the product will be unaffordable, there's no sense in developing it, whatever its capabilities. (And remember that the \"end customer,\" for whom it must be affordable, may be neither the end user nor a DHS component.)19Other Considerations Under what conditions will the products be shipped? Stored? Any constraints on product size and weight? Any objectives for these parameters? Does the product have to be portable? How rugged and reliable does the product have to be to be useful? What other products or systems does the product have to interface with, be compatible with, or interoperate with? Are there safety issues? Privacy issues? User Contact How can we talk to and observe the intended end users in their operational environment?Questions to ask a customer (3 of 3)20Background Information21Selected Questions (Find a manager in the customer's shop who is authorized to speak for the intended end users, and use these questions to get the conversation started. In the answers to the questions, distinguish \"must -have requirements\" from \"desirable features.\") What is the capability gap? Does it really require a new product or system, or can it be addressed by other less risky means? Who are the intended end users? Do they recognize the need? What's the existing off -the-shelf product which comes closest to meeting the need? How will the product to be developed ultimately find its way to the field and have an impact on operations? Can it be deployed to captive users (e.g., Federal employees), or must it be adopted by independent users (e.g., first responders).

Human Trafficking : Awaren ess Resources ICE is the primary agency within the Department of Homeland Security that fights human trafficking . Trafficking in Persons (TIP) is a modern day form of slavery. Human trafficking is defined by Section 103 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 as '(A) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; or (B) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery . ICE is committed to a victim -focused approach to trafficking investigations that places equal importance on protecting the victims and prosecuting the traffickers. Part of this strategy includes an aggressive public outreach campaign to raise awareness of the issue and provide a mechanism for the public to report suspected trafficking activity. ICE also conducts continuous outreach and training to U.S. and foreign law enforcement, non-governmental and international organizations, in order to provide awareness and the latest inv estigative techniques and victim assistance practices.

Infrastructure Protection 23 Office of Infrastructure Protection (IP) From energy systems that power our neighborhoods, to transportation networks that move us around our communities and the country, to facilities that provide our families with safe drinking water, critical infrastructure and key resources (CIKR) impact nearly every aspect of our daily lives. In short, CIKR is an umbrella ter m referring to the assets of the United States essential to the nation's security, public health and safety, economic vitality, and way of life. CIKR is divided into 18 separate sectors, as diverse as agriculture and food, emergency services, and cyber net works. Because this critical infrastructure provides our country with the enormous benefits and services and opportunities on which we rely, we are very mindful of the risks posed to CIKR by terrorists, pandemic diseases and natural disasters. At the Depar tment of Homeland Security, we know that these threats can have serious effects, such as cutting populations off from clean w ater, power, transportation, or emergency supplies. Secretary Napolitano is working to raise awareness about the importance of our nation's critical infrastructure and to strengthen our ability to protect it.

TSA Programs and Services Air Cargo Watch program The likelihood that office staff or managers will uncover the next terrorist is not high. The likelihood that an employee or contractor will see something that is out of the normal routine, the odd out of place person, activ ity or thing , is high. If it makes that employee feel uncomfortable or take notice, it should be reported to their supervisor immediately. The chance that a driver, dockworker, or cargo agent will be the person that uncovers the next attack is very likel y. The Air Cargo Watch program involves all aspects of the supply chain reporting suspicious activity. TSA is collaborating with industry partners to increase security domain awareness so that individuals are empowered to detect, deter, and report potential or actual security threats. The resulting Air Cargo Watch campaign is consistent with U.S. Department of Homeland Security and TSA efforts. Air Cargo Watch has developed materials including a presentation, posters and a two -page guide, to encourage increased attention to potential security threats among several audiences. TSA encourages the display of posters and guides in public view to better attain its goal of maximizing security awareness along the entire air cargo supply chain. See http://www.tsa.gov/what_we_do/ layers/aircargo/watch.shtm .

Describe the analysis and rationale for acquiring a new product or system , and identify the DHS Component which contains or represents the end users. Also name the Capstone IPT, if any, which identified the capability gap. Overall Mission Area Description Define and describe t he overall mission area to which the capability gap pertains , including its users and its scope Description of the Proposed Product or System Describe the proposed product or system. Describe how the product or system will provide the capabilities and functional improvements needed to address the capability gap. Do not describe a specific technology or system solution. Instead, describe a conceptual solution for illustrative purposes. Supporting Analysis Describe the analysis that supports the proposed sy stem. If a formal study was performed, identify the study and briefly provide a summary of results. Mission the Proposed System Will Accomplish Define the missions that the proposed syst em will be tasked to accomplish. Operational and Support Concept Concept of Operations Briefly describe the concept of operations for the system. How will the system be used, and what is its organizational setting? It's appropriate to include a graphic which depicts the system and its operation. Also describe the system 's interoperabil ity requirements with other systems. Support Concept Briefly describe the support concept for the system. How will the system (hardware and software) be maintained? Who will maintain it? How, where, and by whom will spare parts be provisio ned? How, where, and by whom will operators be trained? 1 In this docum ent, the terms \"product\" and \"system\" are synonymous. The word \"system\" is used to refer to either. Threat If the system is intended as a countermeasure to a threat, summarize the threat to be countered and the projected threat environment . Existing System Shortfalls Describe why existing systems cannot meet current or projected requirements. Describe what new capabilities are needed to address the gap between current capabilities and required capabilities. Capabilities Required Operational Performance Parameters Identify operational performance parameters (capabilities and characteristics) required for the proposed system. Articulate the requirements in output -oriented and measurable terms. Use Threshold/Objective2 Key Performance Par ameters (KPPs) format and provide criteria and rationale for each requirement . The KP Ps are those attributes or characteristics of a system which are considered critical or essen tial. Failure to meet a KPP threshold value could be the basis to reject a system solution. System Performance. Mission Scenarios Describe mi ssion scenarios in terms of mission profiles, employment tactics , and environmental conditions. System Performance Parameters Identify system performance parameters. Identify KPPs by placing an asterisk in front of the parameter description. Interoperabili ty Identify all requirements for the system to provide data, information, materiel, and services to and accept the same from other systems, and to use the data, information, materiel, and services so exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together . Human Interface Requirements Discuss broad cognitive, physical, and sensory requirements for the operators, maintainers, or support personnel that contribute to, or constrain, total system performance. Provide broad staffing constraints for operators, ma intainers, and support personnel. 2 The threshold value for a requirement is the minimum acceptable performance. The objective value is the desired performance. Logistics and Readiness Describe the requirements for the system to be supportable and available for operations. Provide performance parameters for a vailability, reliability, system m aintainability, and software m aintainability. Other System Characteristics Characteristics that tend to be design, cost, and risk drivers. System Support Establish support objectives for initial and full operational capabili ty. Discuss interfacing systems, transportation and facilitie s, and standardization and interoperability. Describe the support approach including configuration management, repair, scheduled maintenance, support operations, software support , and user support (such as training and help desk) . Maintenance Identify the types of maintenance to be performed and who will perform the maintenance. Describe methods for upgrades and technology insertions. Also address post -development software support requirements. Supply Describe the app roach to supplying field operators and maintenance technicians with necessary tools, spares, diagnostic equipment, and manuals. Support Equipment Define the standard support equipment to be used by the system.

Transportation and Facilities Describe how the system will be transported to the field, identifying any lift constraints. Identify f acilities needed for staging and training. Force Structure Estimate the number of systems or subsystems needed, including spares and training units. Identify organizations and units that will employ the systems being developed and procured , estimating the number of users in each organization or unit. Schedule To the degree that schedule is a requirement, d efine target dates for system availability. If a distinction is made between Initial Capability and Full Operational Capabilit y, clarify the difference be tween the two in terms of system capability and/or numbers of fielded systems. System Affordability Identify a threshold/objective target price to the user at full -rate production. If price is a KPP, include it in the section on KPPs above. SECURE Program: Concept of Operations Thomas A. Cellucci, Ph.D., MBA Chief Commercialization Officer Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate Email: Thomas.Cellucci@dhs.gov SECURE Program: System Efficacy through Commercialization, Utilization, Relevance and Evaluation Scope: We have developed a comprehensive program to enable DHS-S&T to efficiently and cost-effectively leverage the resources, skills, experience and productivity of the Private Sector to develop technologies and products in alignment with specific requirements obtained from DHS Components, the First Responder Community and other End-Users involved in Homeland Security applications. Overall Process: Below is a graphical representation of the overall outreach process we have implemented to stimulate and engage the Privat e Sector to use its resources to rapidly develop technology, products and services that can yield significant benefits for DHS-S&T with a speed-of-execution not typically observed in the Public Sector.

Private Sector entit ies currently possessing a technology/product/system rated at a Technology Readiness Level TRL-5 (i.e. applied or advanced R&D) or above that potentially closes a de fined DHS capability gap by addressing detailed operational requirements supp lied by DHS-S&T will have the opportunity to continue development of their technol ogy/product/system to TRL-9 (i.e. fully field deployable product) at the expense of the Priv ate Sector entity with the assurance that DHS-S&T will verify t heir independent third-party test(s) of a given technology/product/system. Only when TRL-9 is achieved, will Privat e Sector entities be assured that their testing and evaluation (T&E) of the fu lly deployable technology/product/system (performed by an independent third-party) is verified by a DHS-S&T assessment of a given third party, independent T&E. DHS-S&T will publish its assessment on the DHS' public website as validation of the success (or failure) to meet the Private Sector entity's own established specifications. This approach enables DHS-S&T to review several highly dev eloped technologies/products/systems in an open and fair manner while successful Pr ivate Sector entities will share in the imprimatur of DHS-S&T. DHS Operating Components, the First Responder Community and other End- Users are enabled to make informed purchasing decisions for necessary technologies/products/systems to enhance their capabilities through meeting their detail ed requirements. In addition, these solutions are excellent candidates for liabi lity protection under the provisions of the DHS SAFETY Act. Application Publication of Results Agreement Selection Application: In the spirit of open and free competition, and in order to capitalize on the free- market system, DHS-S&T intends to publish this program and all ancillary requirements documents/information on the DHS-S&T website. These materials will be accessible by all businesses. Giv en this information, Private Sector entities may file an application to develop or enhance their technology/product/system in cooperation with DHS-S&T that will improve upon currently fielded DHS technologies. We envision a simple application for this program that can be completed via the in ternet. The contents of the application will include basic, non-proprie tary business information, contact information, alignment to widely available DHS-S&T capability gaps and ancillary requirements documents we choose to offer such as ORDs (Operational Requirement Documents), etc. Application Publication of Results Agreement Selection Selection: In order to be fully considered by DHS-S&T for cooperative development: The company entity must demonstrate they possess technology at TRL-5 (i.e. applied or advanced R&D) or above and possess the resources to invest in the commercialization of its technology to TRL-9 (i.e. fully field deployable product) The company entity must propose a technology/product development effort that has clear and substantial alig nment with published DHS-S&T capability gaps and other announced requirements A DHS selection committee will be established to review applications and monitor the mutually-agreed-upon roles and respons ibilities of the partnership. The selection committee will consider these and other DHS proprietary metrics for selection consideration. Application Publication of Results Agreement Selection Agreement: The Private Sector entity and DHS-S&T wil l execute a simple, straightforward and binding agreement whereby the Private Sector entity details milestones with dates and agrees to bear full and total financial responsibility to develop its technology/product/system to a TRL-9 state (if not already at that level). DHS-S&T will publish on the DHS-S&T webs ite the factual findings of such assessment. DHS-S&T has the right to canc el an agreement if the Private Sector entity does not fulfill/achieve any of it s milestones by the mutually-agreed-upon dates. Application Publication of Results Agreement Selection Publication of Results: It is apparent that the Private Sector highly values DHS-S&T's potential assessment of a given product's independen t third-party test and evaluation. DHS-S&T will openly publish these T&E results on the DHS public web portal for review by the DHS Operating Com ponents, First Responder communities and other end users.

Cellucci, Ph.D., MBA Chief Commercialization Officer U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate Email: Thomas.Cellucci@dhs.gov FutureTECH Program Scope : We have developed a new program to en able DHS S&T to efficiently and cost- effectively leverage the resources, skills, experience and productivity of the private sector and other non-DHS entities to devel op technologies/capabil ities in alignment with research/innovation focus areas obtained from DHS S&T. These technologies/capabilities can ultimately be used by DHS, first responder community, critical infrastructure/key res ources (CI/KR) owners/operators and other stakeholders. a \"window of visibility\" or \"preview\" of research/innovation focus areas that DHS and its stakeholders believe are essential in future product s and services where detaile d operational requirements documents (ORDs) can not be fully developed at this time. The program also provides insight into areas where Independent Res earch and Development (IRAD) monies could be spent by firms possessing funding to address DHS research/innovation focus areas. Analogous to the popular SECURE Program , FutureTECH is another innovative private-public partnership a nd outreach program that outlines focus areas for which current technology only exists at earlier stag es on the technology r eadiness scale (TRL 1-6). Technologies developed in alignment to stated focus areas could lead to cost- effective and efficient product development (TRL 7-9) when detailed requirements contained in ORDs are available. Like the SECURE Program, DHS will provide information to the public in an open and free way. The private sector and other non- DHS entities may use their own resources (including IRAD) to develop technologies/capabilities that will be of potential benefit to the DHS mission. Like the SECURE Program, DHS may enter into a simple CRADA (Cooperati ve Research and Development Agreement) with an organizati on that shows it has the ability to deliver technology aligned with the research/innovation focus ar ea sought after by DHS. To state it simply, the SECURE Program focuses on product/service development to create products and services to protec t our nation in the shorter term, while FutureTECH will focus on critical research/i nnovation focus areas at lower TRLs for eventual deployment. Like all of the Comm ercialization Office's programs, all parties \"win\" in the FutureTECH Program--the privat e sector and others by receiving valuable insight into future research/innovation focus areas needed by DHS and its stakeholders. DHS \"wins\" because it will leverage the valu able skills, experience and resources of the private sector and other non-DHS entities to expedite efficient and cost-effective technology development; the non-DHS entities \"win\" because they receive valuable information useful for their own strategic plans; and most impo rtantly, all American taxpayers \"win\" because this innova tive partnership yields valuable technologies/capabilities ali gned with research/innovation focus areas developed in a more cost-effective and efficien t way saving taxpayer money. Overall Process : Figure 1 is a graphical re presentation of the overall outreach process the Commercialization Office continues to implem ent to stimulate and engage the private sector and other non-DHS entities to use thei r resources to rapidl y develop technology aligned with research/innovation focus areas that can yield significant benefits for DHS S&T with a speed-of-execution not typi cally observed in the public sector. Outreach to the Private Sector Initial Contact with Private Sector* Private Sector requests more information \"Full Response Package\" sent to requestors, usually within same day Invited Speeches/Presentations Congressional Referrals Conference Attendance Seminar Hosting Published Articles Word of Mouth DHS Website \"Opportunities for the Private Sector\" Developing Operational Requirements \"High Priority Technology Needs\" SECURE Program CONOPS FutureTECH Program CONOPS Basic Research Focus Areas Example Company Overview Document Operational Requirements Document Template *Private Sector includes Venture Capitalist and An gel Investor Communities Company Overview and Marketing Materials Received and Communicated through S&T Figure 1: Overview of S&T Directorate Private Sector Outreach Process Expression Of Interest Publication of Results CRADA Acceptance Program Process : DHS S&T will provide this FutureTECH vehicle by which the private sector and other non-DHS entities can identify or develop t echnology aligned with research/innovation focus areas ranging from TRL-1 through TRL-6 (not fully developed TRL-9 products and/or services) based on DHS S&T's insight and knowledge mainly through its Research and Innovation portfolios/areas. This approach enables DHS S&T to colla borate on the development of technology aligned with several research/innovation focu s areas in an open and free way. The private sector and other non-DHS entities receive information on what new technologies will be required over-the-horiz on to protect our nation, removing much of the \"guess work\" normally associated with predicting future needs. As with the popular SECURE Program, DHS will review third party, recognized test and evaluation data to ensure that all milestones/objectives of an executed CRADA agreement are met and DHS will place a give n research/innovation focus area solution developed by an entity on the Futu reTECH website demonstrating that the research/innovation focus area has met DHS's broadly defined require ments (in contrast to the SECURE Program where products or services must demonstrate compliance to detailed operational requiremen ts contained in an ORD). Publication of Results CRADA Acceptance Expression Of Interest Expression of Interest: In the adherence to fairness of opportunity, a nd in order to capitalize on the free-market system, DHS S&T intends to publish this program and all anci llary requirements documents/information on the DHS website. These materials will be accessible by ALL. Given this information, the privat e sector and other non-DHS entities may contact DHS S&T if they are interested in developing or enhancing their technology within a research/innovation focus area in cooperation with DHS S&T. Potential research/innovation focus areas for this program (along with a simple CRADA agreement used in the SECURE Program) are provided on our website. The private sector organization or non-DHS entity must provide DHS S&T with basic, non- proprietary business information, contact in formation and demonstr ate their potential alignment to widely available DHS S&T research/innovation requirements that are more detailed than what are commonly refe rred to as technology need statements, yet not as detailed as a well-defined ORD. Expression Of Interest Publication of Results CRADA Acceptance Acceptance: In order to be fully considered by DHS S&T for cooperative research/innovation focus area technology development: An entity must demonstrate they either possess technology at TRL-1 or higher (i.e. basic research) or possess th e ability to develop a tec hnology aligned with the research/innovation focus area to TRL- 6 for later technology insertion into a potential acquisition or commercialization program. The private sector and other non-DHS en tities must propose a research/innovation focus area technology development effort th at has clear and substantial alignment with any published DHS S&T re quirements delineated above. A DHS committee will be established to review the private sector and/or non-DHS entities' potential alignment to DHS resear ch/innovation focus area s, and monitor the mutually-agreed-upon roles and responsibilit ies of partnership participants. The committee will consider these and other DHS proprietary metrics for determining which opportunities to pursue. Expression Of Interest Acceptance Publication of Results CRADA CRADA: The private sector and/or non-DHS entity and DHS S&T could execute a simple, straightforward and binding CRADA where by the non-DHS entity details milestones with dates and, in most cases, agrees to bear full and total financial responsibility to develop its technology aligned within the research/innovation focus area to a TRL-6 state. Under the Stevenson-Wydler Act (whi ch is the statutory authority enabling DHS to enter into CRADAs), agencies may not contribute funds under a CRADA; however, they may contribute know-how, expertise, mate rials and equipment. It is important to mention that the execution of a CRADA agreement is at the sole discretion of the corresponding DHS S&T program manager. Additionally, a CRADA with DHS S&T will not necessarily lead to any follow-on contract actions or solicitations by DHS or other government agencies. Any solicitations for fundi ng agreements related to technology areas collaborated upon in a CRA DA would be subject to full and open competition. DHS S&T will publish on the DHS S&T website the factual finding(s) of any final assessment. DHS S&T has the right to cancel an agreement if the non-DHS entity does not fulfill/achieve its milestone s or performance objectives by the mutually- agreed-upon dates. Expression Of Interest Acceptance Publication of Results CRADA Publication of Results: It is apparent that the private sector and other non-DHS entities highly value DHS S&T's potential assessment of a given tec hnology's recognized third-party test and evaluation (T&E) data. DHS-S&T will ope nly publish summary findings and an acknowledgement of an entity 's attainment of perfor mance objectives on the DHS public web portal for review by the DHS operating components, first responder communities, CI/KR owners/operators and other potential users.

I hope you find this useful. Thanks for all you do to help keep the Nation safer. Bradley I. Buswell Under Secretary (Acting) Science and Technology Directorate U.S. Department of Homeland SecurityThe S&T Capstone Transition Program DHS S&T's Transition Program is customer-focused and output-oriented. The Directorate's near- term efforts are aligned to our DHS customers' critical needs in the form of Enabling Homeland Capabilities (EHCs), consisting of technologies that can be developed, matured, delivered, and commercialized or validated as a standard within a 3-year period. A formalized, structured process, the DHS Transition Program aligns investments to Agency requirements and is managed by Capstone Integrated Product Teams (IPTs). These teams consist of our DHS customers and critical stakeholders and are specifically chartered to ensure that technologies are engineered and integrated into systems scheduled for delivery and made available to DHS customers. Investments are competitively selected and focus on DHS's highest-priority requirements that provide capability to DHS operating components and first responders. With the addition of the First Responder Capstone IPT, there are now 13 Capstone IPTs in the following functional areas: 1. First Responder 2. Border Security 3. Cargo Security 4. Maritime Security 5. Cyber Security 6. Information Sharing 7. Interoperability 8. Transportation Security 9. Counter-IED 10. Chemical/Biological Defense 11. People Screening 12. Infrastructure Protection 13. Incident Management The DHS S&T Transition Program is continuously evolving through incorporation of best practices from industry and other federal partners. As priorities change, the process is flexible enough to accommodate necessary changes while maintaining the stability of prior-year decisions. Please note that each Capstone IPT page has block text and italic text. The block text denotes information that was presented in the previous version of this booklet. Italic text denotes new/revised information. 3 High-Priority Technology NeedsDHS S&T's Six Technical Divisions The mission of the Department of Homeland Security is to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce America's vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that may occur. The strategies the Science & Technology Directorate will use to accomplish those Department goals and make the Nation safer are: The S&T Directorate's Explosives Division promotes the development of effective techniques to protect our citizens and our country's infrastructure against the devastating effects of explosives by seeking innovative approaches in detection and in countermeasures. It provides the concepts, science, technologies, and systems that increase protection from explosives and promotes the development of field equipment, technologies, and procedures to interdict suicide bombers, car and truck bombs, and shoulder-fired missiles before they can reach their targets. The S&T Chemical/Biological Division seeks out the science needed to reduce the probability and potential consequences of a biological pathogen or a chemical attack on the Nation's civilian population, its infrastructure, or its agricultural system. The division develops and implements early detection and warning systems for attack characterization. Priorities include research and development efforts on urban monitoring, detection technologies, bioassays, a bioforensics capability, and restoration and response tools and technologies. When making critical decisions\u2014from evacuating civilians from a hurricane's path to preventing a terrorist attack\u2014responders and planners need information that is relevant, accurate, and timely. S&T's Command, Control and Interoperability Division (CID) provides the technologies, processes, infrastructure, and mechanisms that allow these decision-makers to gather, analyze, manage, protect, and share critically needed homeland-security information, be it voice, data, or imagery. The mission of the Borders and Maritime Security Division is to develop and transition technical capabilities that enhance U.S. border security without impeding commerce & travelers' flow. The Division serves as the Nation's primary shepherd of Cargo, Borders and Maritime Security science and technology with areas of responsibility that encompass all air, land and maritime borders (including U.S. ports-of-entry and inland waterways). BMD understands the technical dimension of homeland security challenges and provides customers with new and/or better options to accomplish their mission. S&T looks at biometrics, motivation and intent, hostile intent, human factors engineering, and the social/behavioral/economic sciences to improve detection, analysis, and understanding of threats posed by individuals, groups, and radical movements. The efforts of the S&T Human Factors/Behavioral Sciences Division support the preparedness, response, and recovery of communities affected by catastrophic events. The need to protect the country's 18 areas of critical infrastructure from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and accident, is paramount, but so are state and local preparedness and response. S&T's Infrastructure/Geophysical Division addresses physical, cyber, and human elements of our Nation's vulnerable infrastructure, focusing on capabilities, needs, and gaps, and on known threats. In short, when dedicated scientists, engineers, and thinkers push the boundaries of challenge, and when they are committed to the security of our Nation, they can help ensure that new mission-critical capabilities are created, knowledge is generated, and needed technologies are deployed to the right places. High-Priority Technology Needs 4DHS Customers and Customers of Our Customers DHS S&T enables its customers\u2014the DHS components\u2014and their customers on the front lines, with technical capabilities to carry out their missions. Customers include state, local, and tribal entities, Border Patrol agents, Coast Guardsmen, Customs officials, Federal Air Marshals, airport baggage screeners, and first responders at the state, local, tribal and territorial levels. The responders\u2014fire fighters, police, emergency medical technicians, and bomb disposal experts\u2014act decisively to protect people and property , to tend to the injured, and to bring a measure of calm and clear thinking to chaotic situations. DHS S&T supports them with the tools they need to perform their jobs more efficiently, quickly, and safely, and with greater accuracy. S&T customers, like USCG and CBP, oversee 95,000 miles of coastline, lakes, and inland waterways and 7,500 miles of the U.S. border. They safeguard 327 official ports of entry\u2014by air, land and sea. Other customers protect the critical infrastructure that keeps our society functioning\u2014the hospitals and public health facilities, schools, transportation systems, water supply, power plants, food supply\u2014and the cyber backbone that underpins essential services\u2014and much more. Through processes like our Capstone Integrated Product Teams, S&T works with our customers in defining the capabilities they need to secure the Nation. We bring key stakeholders in the process to the table to establish a plan for getting needed capabilities into the development or acquisition pipeline so that vital needs are addressed.

Appendix IV: Articles DHS Leading the Way to Help the Private Sector Help Itself Focus on Small Business DHS Global Outreach Efforts DHS Science & Technology Laboratories DHS Science & Technology Office of University Programs: Education Program Fact Sheet DHS Centers of Excellence Fact Sheet s SAFETY Act Fact Sheet DHS: Leading the way to Help the Private Sector Help Itself The Office of Infrastructure Protection offers a window into which the private sector can realize significant business opportunities Commercialization, broadly described as \"the development of markets and the production and delivery of products/services to meet the unsatisfied needs/wants of these markets,\" represents a key process that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) now uses to generate product/services for its numerous stakehol ders in a cost -effective and efficient way. DHS's primary users of technology -based products are its seven operating components. However, DHS is also a conduit to numerous other users. For example, the Office of Infrastructure Protection (OIP) coordinates 18 Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) and Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) organized under the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). These SCCs represent various critical infrastructure/key resources (CI/KR) owners and operators found in the chemical industry to power companies, for example. See Table 1 for the list of SCCs. Critical infrastructure are the assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would create a debilitating effect on our security, national economic security, public health or safety, or any combination of the above. Key resources are publicly or privately controlled resources essential to the minimal operations of the economy and gover nment. Responsible Federal Agency Sector Coordinating Council U.S. Department of Agriculture Department of Health and Human Services Agriculture and Food Department of Defense Defense Industrial Base Department of Energy Energy Department of Health and Human Services Public Health and Healthcare Department of the Interior National Monuments and Icons Department of the Treasury Banking and Finance Environmental Protection Agency Water DHS's Office of Infrastructure Protection Chemical Commercial F acilities Dams Emergency Services Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Critical Manufacturing DHS's Office of Cyber Security and Telecommunications Information Technology Communications DHS's Transportation Security Administration Postal and Shipping DHS's Transportation Security Administration, United States Coast Guard Transportation Systems DHS's Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Federal Protective Service Government Facilities Table 1 - HSPD -7 establishes a national policy for Federal departments and agencies to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure and t o protect them from terrorist attacks. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD -7), Federal departments and agencies will identify, prioritize, and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources in order to prevent, deter, and mitigate the effects of deliberate efforts to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit them. Federal departments and agen cies work with state and local governments and the private sector to accomplish this objective. The NIPP process provides clarity into the specific needs or requirements of the SCCs, which in turn generates information that yields rough estimates of the po tential available markets (PAMs) for solutions that address a particular need. The recently adopted, commercialization process allows DHS to develop and deliver products/services for the CI/KR community in a more cost -effective and efficient manner as compared to a traditional governmental acquisition process; all at the benefit of the CI/KR owners and operators in the private sector and, just as importantly, to the benefit of the American taxpayer. Through this commercialization process, DHS is fostering new and innovative partnerships with the private sector to cooperatively develop products/services aligned to the needs of the expansive CI/KR market. In a relatively short amount of time, DHS has developed, and is now implementing, a \"commercialization m indset\" in its approach to responding to the needs of its valued stakeholders. The idea of utilizing a commercialization process at DHS is a much -needed and significant departure from the commonly employed acquisition model. Commercialization has the potential to yield significant benefits in terms of reducing federal R&D costs, enabling rapid time-to-market for newly developed commercial products/services for DHS and some of its other stakeholders like first responders and CI/KR owners/operators. Rather than have DHS pay for the development of custom \"one -off\" systems, which are frequently required in many military applications, it is apparent that DHS has much to offer the private sector in terms of its large potential available markets requiring widely distributed products. Figure 1 shows the major differences between a \"pure\" acquisition versus a \"pure\" commercialization process, and our resultant DHS \"hybrid\" commercialization process. To put it simply, when widely -distributed products or services are required, commercialization should be utilized at the benefit of the taxpayer, DHS and the private sector. Figure 1 DHS's commercialization process combines aspects of a \"pure\" Acquisition and com mercialization model resulting in the current \"hybrid\" commercialization model. The SECURE (System Efficacy through Commercialization, Utilization, Relevance and Evaluation) Program, outlined in Figure 2, is an innovative public -private sector partnersh ip effort leveraging the DHS commercialization process to meet end -user needs found at DHS, the first responder community and within the CI/KR market. Briefly, the SECURE Program is based on the premise that the private sector has shown repeatedly that it is willing and able to use its own money, resources, expertise and experience to develop and produce fully developed products and services for DHS if significant market potential exists. The private sector has shown remarkable interest in devoting its time and money to such activities if and when an attractive business case can be made related to large revenue/profit opportunities, which certainly exist at DHS and its ancillary markets. The private sector requires two pieces of information from DHS: 1. deta iled operational requirements, and 2. a conservative estimate of the potential available market(s) where a given product or service can be used. This information can then be verified by the private sector to generate a business case for their possible part icipation in the program. Figure 2 A brief overview of the SECURE Program Concept of Operations. (See http://www.dhs.gov/xres/programs/gc_1211996620526.shtm ) While the development of highly specialized products is still relevant to the Department, DHS itself represents a substantial potential available market for widely distributed products; in many instances requiring thousands, if not millions of product or service units to address unsatisfied needs. Couple to this the fact that DHS has responsibility for an array of ancillary markets: na mely, first responders and CI/KR owners/operators, representing large potential SECURE Program Overview of Concept of Operations Selection Publication of Results Application Agreement Application - Seeking products/technologies aligned with posted DHS requirements Selection - Products/Services TRL -5 or above, scored with internal DHS metrics Agreement - One -page Cooperative Research and Development (CRADA)-like document that outlines milestones and exit criteria Publication of Results - Recognized Third-Party T&E conducted on TRL -9 products/technologies share in the imprimatur of DHS DHS operating components and first responders make informed decisions on products/services aligned to their stated requirements available markets in their own right; it is evident that substantial business opportunities exist for the private sector. The NIPP process brings greater vision into the needs of the 18 SCCs previously described, which in turn generate the detailed operational requirements necessary for private sector efforts to develop potential solutions. See Figure 3 for a market potential template of the 18 sectors and their major sub- components/applications. Figure 3 - Market Potential Template for the CI/KR Market In providing critical information to the private sector in terms of the collection and articulation of detailed operational requirements and a conservative estimate of the potential available market, DHS has laid the foundation for cooperative product development with the private sector. These relationships drive the commercialization process and ensure that end -users such as CI/KR owners and ope rators receive needed products/services in a timely manner at minimal costs to DHS. Given these relationships, it is relatively easy to make a case for commercialization at the Department (see Figure 4 ) as it results in \"wins\" for the American taxpayer, public and private sectors. Benefit Analysis - \"Win -Win-Win\" Taxpayers Public Sector Private Sector 1. Citizens are better protected by DHS personnel using mission critical products/services 1. Improved understanding and communication of needs 1. Save significant time and money on market and business development activities 2. Tax savings realized through private sector investment in DHS 2. Cost -effective and rapid product development process saves resources 2. Firms can genuinely contribute to the security of the Nation 3. Positive economic growth for American economy 3. Monies can be allocated to perform greater number of essential tasks 3. Successful products share in the \"imprimatur of DHS\"; providing assurance that products really work 4. Possible product \"spin - offs\" can aid other commercial markets 4. End users receive products aligned to specific needs 4. Significant business opportunities with sizeable DHS and DHS ancillary markets 5. Customers ultimately benefit from COTS produced within the Free Market System - more cost effective and efficient product development 5. End users can make informed purchasing decisions with tight budgets 5. Commercialization opportunities for small, medium and large business Figure 4 - A benefit analysis of the SECURE Program shows a number of positive outcomes for taxpayers as well as the public and private sectors. In conclusion, our commercialization process is ideal in matching the detailed requirements of the collective CI/KR commu nity with product development efforts undertaken by the private sector who seek access to the large potential available markets. Commercialization is not only an attractive method by which DHS can develop products/services for CI/KR owners and operators - but it is also beneficial to both the public and private sectors and - most importantly - to the American taxpayers at large. Focus on Small Business Opportunities abound for \"Engines of Innovation.\" The R&D Partnerships Group prides itself with the attention it pays to small businesses of all kinds - including minority -owned, HUBZone, veteran- owned and other disadvantaged business. It is well known that much of our nation's (and the world's) innovation emanates from small business, but they often find some of their most difficult challenges with raising capital or performing effective market research necessary for business gro wth. To address these challenges, we have visited and met with thousands of small business owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs/innovators across the United States to inform them of the business opportunities that exist at the U.S. Department of Homeland Securit y (DHS). In addition, we have developed a series of books recently published by DHS that small businesses can use to augment and enhance their ability to efficiently and cost- effectively develop market -driven products and/or services. We have also produced numerous well -received articles and materials germane to small business. Refer to http://www.dhs.gov/xres/programs/gc_1234200779149.shtm for more detailed information and access to all of these useful resources. The R&D Partnerships Group continues to travel extensively throughout the United States to meet with small business through our Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate private sector outreach efforts. Statistical information on these efforts is posted to our website and updated on a quarterly basis. It is also important to note that DHS has a number of valuable resources small business may explore.

The recent establishment of the R&D Partnerships Group at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) has already made a significant impact to ensure that the Department and its members understand the value of collabo rative partnerships to satisfying the needs of the Department. Outreach efforts of the group have shown the benefits that the private sector can bring in the efforts to work in a partnership with the Department to leverage the private sector's skills, expe rience, resources and interest in creating widely distributed products to achieve the goal of developing and deploying high performance products, systems and services critical to the objectives of DHS' seven operating components (TSA, FEMA, Coast Guard, Se cret Service, ICE, CBP and USCIS) and first responders. Furthermore, the Department has made a concerted effort to reach out globally to become aware of, assess and work with technologies and products from around the globe because we understand that no one region has complete dominance in technology and product development. In so many ways, science, technology and product development transcend politics and geography. To this end, we have a keen interest in learning about all novel technologies and solutions that are available to meet our requirements. The Department has recently undertaken the critical step of \"socializing\" a \"commercialization mindset\" throughout DHS and the first responder communities. Why is there a need for a commercialization process? D HS requirements, in most instances, are characterized by the need for widely distributed COTS (Commercial -Off-The-Shelf) products. Oftentimes, there is a need for thousands, if not millions, of products for DHS's seven operating components and the fragment ed, yet substantial first responder market. To augment the commercialization process, DHS has undertaken the task of developing an easy -to-use comprehensive guide to assist in developing operational requirements. This guide now enables DHS personnel to ar ticulate, in detail, a given system's requirements and communicate those needs to both internal and external audiences. This effort addresses a long standing need for DHS to fully articulate its requirements. A copy of this guide, entitled \"Developing Oper ational Requirements,\" has been made publicly available at the previously mentioned website. Early responses from groups within DHS and in the private sector related to this guide and programs like SECURE have been very favorable. The Department plans to regularly update its website with Commercialization Operational Requirements Documents ( C-ORDs) to continually expand this innovative private -public partnership. In addition, the taxpayers, private sector and public sector view programs like this as \"win -win-win.\" It should also be mentioned that we are often asked about the \"Buy American Act\" and how that could be an issue for a non -American based firm. Simply stated, the Buy American Act is intended to provide a preference for supplies and construction ma terials that are of domestic (U.S.) origin. The Act does not affect the provision of services. Generally, when the Act applies, the preference takes the form of a pricing advantage in evaluation of offers. Because the negotiation of various treaties and tr ade agreements, however, supplies, services, and construction of non- domestic origin may be treated as though they are of domestic (U.S.) origin. Some examples are: (a) For nations who are participants in the World Trade Organization Government Procuremen t Agreement, U.S. domestic treatment will be given to supplies and services valued at $193,000 or more and construction valued at $7.407 million or more; and (b) For NAFTA signatories, supplies of Canadian origin valued at $25,000 or more and supplies of Mexican origin and services of Canadian and Mexican origin valued at $64,786 or more, and construction of both nations valued at $8.422 million or more receive domestic (U.S.) treatment. In addition, the U.S. has negotiated other Free Trade Agreements (fo r example, with Australia, Singapore, Chile, and certain Caribbean nations) and a separate agreement with Israel that may use these or other values. The message is that, depending upon the value of the procurement, goods of non- domestic (U.S.) origin may w ell receive domestic treatment and not be subject to the Buy American Act preference. As you can see, the concept is simple, but the participating nations and dollar values differ. For your specific situation, it is suggested that you consult Part 25 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which is at Title 48 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. As one can observe, there are a plethora of opportunities for global businesses with DHS available to those who possess unique technologies and produc ts.

Anthrax attacks through the US Mail, Hurricane Katrina, massive sewage spills, Salmonella in peanut butter, deadly norovirus outbreaks in nursing homes, Bird Flu infections \u2014 all these events bring attention to the serious risk microbes can pose to human health. During outbreaks of disease, whether caused by bioterrorist attacks, natural disasters, or contamination of air, water, food, or the environment, several important questions need to be answered. 1. What is the disease risk to human health? 2. How is the pathogen spread and how do we stop it? 3. How do we clean up after an incident? 4. How do we monitor to ensure people are safe? The Center for Advancing Microbial Risk Assessment (CAMRA) seeks to answer these essential questions. Through innovative research programs, scientists at CAMRA study how to protect human health from microbial agents in the natural and built environment. CAMRA is filling critical gaps in current microbial risk assessment frameworks needed to support environmental protection, homeland security, and public health objectives. What is CAMRA? The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established CAMRA in 2005 through a five-year, $10 million jointly-funded grant. The Center is a consortium of world-class scientists and engineers from Michigan State University, Drexel University, University of Michigan, Carnegie Mellon University, Northern Arizona University, University of Arizona, and University of California, Berkeley. CAMRA has two missions: 1. To develop models, tools, and information that will be used in a risk assessment framework to reduce or eliminate health impacts from biological agents of concern in indoor and outdoor environments; and 2. To build a national network for knowledge management, transfer, and learning among scientists, students, and professionals in the field of microbial risk assessment. What is microbial risk assessment? Microbial risk assessment is a way to measure the consequences of exposure to microbial agents such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It involves understanding the health hazard, the potential survival of a microbe, and the ability of this biological agent to move from a contaminated site to humans and initiate infection. This involves the integration of math, biology and medicine. Why is CAMRA Important? CAMRA is providing critical information for risk assessments to develop fact-based plans for monitoring, for communication on expected levels of the risk, for control, and for preventing exposure. The study of emerging infectious diseases, the ecology of those diseases, and the risks they pose gives professionals, from law makers to first responders, who are responsible for protecting public health the detailed knowledge they need to prepare for emergencies, save lives, and safeguard the future health of the nation.

CCI COE Overview The Command, Control and Interoperability Center of Excellence (CCI COE) provides a continuing influx of basic and applied research to the technology development and investment process of the Command, Control and Interoperability (CCI) Division. This ensures CCI is always ready to apply the latest science to the complex and continuously evolving problems confronting the homeland security enterprise. This is the 12th member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Centers of Excellence Network, managed by the Office of University Programs within the DHS Science and Technology Directorate. Center research and education efforts will directly support the activities of the CCI Division and will focus on issues related to information analysis, knowledge management, threat assessment, situational awareness, decision support, information sharing, interoperable communications, surveillance and investigative operations, and cyberinfrastructure protection. The CCI COE is organized as two teams: the Visualization Sciences Team (VACCINE), led by Purdue University, and the Data Sciences Team (CCICADA), led by Rutgers University. These teams are focusing on seven research topics: Dynamic, o n-Demand D ata P rocessing a nd V isualization Hypothesis-driven Analysis Visualization o f S tructured, U nstructured, a nd S treaming D ata Mathematics of Discrete and Visual Analytics Scalable Filtering and Dissemination Visualization and Simulation of Data Mobile a nd L ight-Weight I nformation A nalytics a nd S haring VACCINE Partners: Purdue University (Lead) Virginia Tech University Jackson State University Georgia Institute of Technology Pennsylvania State University University of North Carolina at Charlotte University of Washington Stanford University Simon Fraser University University of British Columbia University of Stuttgart University of Houston, Downtown Florida International University North Carolina A&T State University University of Texas at Austin CCICADA Partners: Rutgers University (Lead) University of Massachusetts - Lowell Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs Howard University Princeton University Carnegie Mellon University Texas Southern University Morgan State University Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign University of Southern California Tuskegee University AT&T Labs, Research Geosemble TechnologiesThe Command, Control and Interoperability Center Of Excellence A DHS Center of Excellence Visualization Sciences Team (VACCINE) The amount of information gathered during a crisis can be crushing if not managed correctly. DHS views VACCINE's research and education in visualization sciences as critical to the protection and security of America and its allies. In the event of a catastrophe, such as a chemical spill, natural disaster, disease outbreak or a terrorist attack, information will be coming from many sources, such as camera images, data from sensors and simulations, and text documents from police and health-care agencies. VACCINE focuses on education, research, development, and deployment of interactive visual analytic environments for communicating and disseminating information and deriving insight from the massive homeland security data deluge. VACCINE will create and deploy novel tools that improve the effectiveness of homeland security personnel, ranging from emergency responders and public safety officers, to investigative analysts, and to policy and decision makers. The long-term research plan of VACCINE includes three fundamental research areas that form the foundation for addressing homeland security mission directives through innovative and effective integrations of data and visual analytics environments: Interactive Visual Analytic Foundations, Visually-Adapted Analytical Techniques, and Investigative Analysis and Decision Making Environments. The goal is to not just derive ad-hoc solutions to problems, but to address fundamental research questions, advance the science of visual analytics, deliver solutions to homeland security professionals around the world, and create a solid theoretical foundation for future research.

The FAZD Center focuses on zoonotic diseases that pose catastrophic risks to public health and livestock health, as well as to the national agricultural economy, which provides about 13 percent of all U.S. jobs. Role within U.S. homeland security Ongoing threat and consequence assessments in the agriculture and public health sectors demonstrate the urgent need to develop more robust security measures to protect the U.S. against a wide range of threats. Among these are bio-threats, which include the threat of high-consequence foreign animal and zoonotic diseases being introduced into the nation. Of particular concern are zoonotic diseases, which infect both humans and animals, and which are transmissible between them. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 60 percent of all human pathogens are zoonotic, and 75 percent of emerging, infectious human diseases begin as infectious animal diseases. The ability to fully address the DHS priority areas - prevention, detection, response, and recovery - requires integration of biological, social, computational, and analytic sciences. The FAZD Center has successfully established and employed an inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional team of leading scientists, educators, and support staff to meet those priorities. Capacity and impact The FAZD Center has a national capacity with well-established collaborations with other DHS Centers of Excellence on a range of vital projects. It has a demonstrated track record of developing enduring institutional research and education programs, and an ability to apply these programs to provide a stream of meaningful products. Themes and products The FAZD Center's team of scientists and educators conduct cutting-edge inter-institutional and inter-disciplinary research across three major themes: Biological Systems - Vaccines, anti-virals, diagnostic tests and immunological platforms, with a focus on three select agents: Rift Valley Fever, Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Avian Influenza. Information Analysis Systems - Computer models and epidemiologic/economic analyses designed to enhance decision-making at multiple levels of scale for decision makers during disease outbreaks. E ducation and Outreach Systems - Graduate-level curricula, early responder training programs and stakeholder outreach programs designed to provide the next generation of science power. 200 Discovery Drive, Suite 144 College Station, TX, 77843-2129 Phone: (979) 845-2855 Email: n-clarke@tamu.edu Web site:: fazd.tamu.eduPartners: Texas A&M University (lead) | University of California, Davis | University of Texas Medical Branch University of Southern California | University of Minnesota | Purdue University | Georgetown University Research at the FAZD Center is currently focused on three select agents Select agents Rift Valley fever Foot-and-mouth disease Avian influenza Description Transmitted between animals and humans via insects Mortality and abortion in livestock Acute flu-like symptoms in humans Most contagious viral disease Highly susceptible for multiple species Multi-billion dollar impact Possible mutation to human pandemic Transmission among species Economic and public health consequences Affected regionsSub-Saharan Africa and MadagascarAfrica, South America, Asia and some parts of EuropeAsia, Europe, the Near East and Africa FAZD Center products Animal vaccine reagents Early detection and diagnostic tools Quantitative models for prevention and management strategies Rapid portable tests for detection Antiviral agents for immediate protection Quantitative models for threat and vulnerability Define relationship between birds and humans for transmission Vaccines and antiviral agents for prevention New methods for rapid detection National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease Defense A DHS Center of ExcellencePrincipal Investigator James A. Wall (center) of Texas A&M University demonstrates Biosurveillance Common Operating Picture dashboard. Development of a Dashboard Approach for the Common Operating Picture for the National Biosurveillance Information System (NBIS) - The FAZD Center developed a dashboard approach for a Biosurveillance Common Operating Picture (BCOP) for the NBIS that provides a new capability for analysts to aggregate data from multiple sources into a common framework for assessment of emerging and ongoing biological events at national and global scales with the objective of providing improved and enhanced awareness of events threatening human and animal health. The NBIS aggregates information from multiple sources and agencies for both analysis and presentation to senior decision makers. With the outbreak of H1N1 influenza, the FAZD Center was asked to participate with DHS in taking the BCOP to an immediate operational stage. This was accomplished in weeks rather than months as originally scheduled. The system is now in use by analysts from several participating agencies with the Center providing an access portal for the system at Texas A&M. The BCOP will continue to be improved by the FAZD Center and eventually located within DHS for long term use. Jose Martinez (right) and Emily Leon - undergraduates from UPR-Ponce - served as FAZD Center interns during Summer 2009. Contributions to Major Projects by MSIs and Minority Students - 59 minority students and 10 Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) play integral roles in research and development projects - as well as in education and outreach programs - at the FAZD Center. For example, the Center has provided summer internships to undergraduates from the University of Puerto Rico at Ponce since 2007. So far, six students from UPR-P have served. The Center is also currently launching new education and research initiatives with Jackson State University (JSU) Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Ultimately, these types of partnerships are intended to both leverage expertise from the Center and its MSI partners in a mutually productive manner, and to establish enduring and sustainable capacity within partner MSIs. Enhanced Immunity to Exotic Animal Diseases Affecting U.S. Public and Animal Health and the National Economy - An animal vaccine against Rift Valley fever virus, one of the priority select agents, has been developed from the MP12 antigen developed for human use and is currently moving to commercial production trials. This product is being enhanced in further research with a genetic marker that allows the immunity resulting from vaccination to be distinguished from that associated with active disease, thereby allowing immunized animals to safely move through interstate commerce. The second generation vaccine will be tested in 2010. Innovative Anti-Viral Products that Provide Greater Protection for Livestock - Vaccination remains among the most effective strategies for protecting livestock during an outbreak. The FAZD Center has developed an antiviral product (an immunomodulator) that is incorporated into the FMD vaccine being developed by the Plum Island Animal Disease Center that reduces the time to develop an effective immune response to vaccination from 10 days to 3 days or less, thus providing accelerated protection. The anti-viral is undergoing tests at Plum Island Animal Disease Center. Databases and Models for Interstate Movement of Animals to Support Models of Animal Disease Spread - Most epidemic models assume disease is spread by direct or indirect contact at local levels without accounting for the long distance movement of animals across the country that occurs in commerce. The DHS has provided special funding to the FAZD Center and NCFPD to acquire the data to build a national transportation model to generate input for multiple epidemiologic modeling efforts. The initial effort focused on beef, dairy, and swine, with other commodities to be added in the future. Known as the Food and Agriculture System Transportation (FASTRANS) model, this project is providing the first quantitative estimates of interstate livestock movement effects on the spread of high-consequence animal diseases. Research Education for Students and Fellows - A total of 147 students and post-doctoral fellows have participated in FAZD Center programs. These include 21 post doctoral fellows, 61 doctoral students, 39 master's students, 8 veterinary medicine students and 18 undergraduates. The population reflects students supported by the Center as well as those supported by leveraging funds on research directly related to the Center's agenda. Rapid Detection of Infected Animals During Disease Outbreaks - Early detection drastically reduces the spread of disease and resulting economic impact. The FAZD Center has developed an effective, accurate, and economical experimental strip test (similar to a home pregnancy test) that provides the ability to detect foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and Rift Valley fever viruses in the field. This system will be tested at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in 2010. Harbor Acoustic Monitoring Systems Research into technologies that will improve our awareness of potential threats on the spatial scales of ports through advances in active and passive acoustics is being conducted. Particular advances are sought in separating, identifying, and tracking a multiplicity of signals in a noisy coastal/harbor environment. The first test site will be at UH's Kilo Nalu field site close to Honolulu Harbor. Decision Support Systems CIMES is developing operational prototypes of Decision Support Systems (DSS) based on the fusion of the disparate sensor data described above. This DSS component will link CIMES' technical research projects to an overall Concept of Operations for a Maritime Domain Awareness system in such a way as to guide the Center's research investments. Education & Training By expanding existing educational and training programs at all levels, from K-12 through graduate courses and continuing education programs, CIMES will ensure the development and maintenance of a competent and capable, broad-based constituency that is knowledgeable in the technical approaches necessary to address maritime security risks. CIMES, by virtue of our diverse student population, is particularly well placed to bring minority students into the DHS community.

Partnerships to Solutions Strategy To leverage expertise and resources programmatically, NCFPD works in close partnership with federal and state regulatory agencies, state and local health and agriculture departments, first responder communities, professional organizations, other DHS Centers of Excellence, the national laboratories, and private sector stakeholders. Over 30 food industry experts serve as advisors, providing technical advice, critical end-user feedback, and strategic oversight. Background The University of Minnesota-led consortium was selected on the basis of a national, competitive, merit- based review process, and follows the specific University of Minnesota 200 Dinnaken Office Building, MMC 2131 925 Delaware defend the safety and security of the food system through research and education. Goals Reduce the vulnerability of the nation's food system to terrorist attack by contamination with biological, chemical, or radiological agents at any point along the food supply chain, from primary production through transportation and food processing to retail and food service. Strengthen the food system's preparedness and resiliency to threats, disruption, and attacks. Mitigate the potentially catastrophic public health and economic effects of food system attacks with effective response and recovery. Consortium Participants Led by the University of Minnesota, the National Center for Food Protection and Defense's (NCFPD's) consortium includes individual investigators from many Universities and private sector research organizations, and food and agriculture agencies. NCFPD-funded research and education projects are selected through approval of peer-reviewed research proposals submitted by teams of researchers. These projects currently involve over 140 experts from education, industry and government. A large number of graduate students and postdoctoral research trainees are successfully working in nearly all NCFPD research and education projects, demonstrating the capability of the academic Primary Production ~ Harvest ~ Transportation ~ Storage ~ Processing ~ Retail/Food Service ~ Consumer National Center for Food Protection and Defense A DHS Center of Excellencemandate for a university-based food protection and defense center in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9, Defense of United States Agriculture and Food (Jan. 2004). Developed as a multidisciplinary and mission-focused research consortium, NCFPD incorporates cutting- edge research aimed at food defense from a variety of disciplines, including supply chain management, logistics, epidemiology, public health, risk assessment, economics, molecular biology, food microbiology, biomedical engineering, toxicology, and risk communication. Following initiatives outlined in DHS's Broad Agency Announcement, 45 research projects were initiated in the first three years, with 42 ongoing projects in the fourth year. These projects focus on five research themes: event modeling, biological agent behavior, chemical agent behavior, risk communication and systems strategies, with an overarching emphasis on educating and training NCFPD Highlights to Date FAS-CAT (Food & Agriculture Sector Criticality Assessment Tool) was developed in collaboration with FAZD and CREATE, as a novel approach to identify critical food and agriculture sector assets and provide reporting mechanisms to DHS. The tool helps states determine the most critical elements, nodes, and sub-systems in the food and agriculture infrastructure. FAS-CAT 1) improves the overall process of identifying critical systems/sub-systems; 2) provides greater equity in cross-sector critical system identification for DHS; 3) enables states to identify critical food and agriculture system components; and 4) improves critical asset reporting to DHS. FAS-CAT is the system that states are required to use for the 2010 DHS data call, and the tool can be downloaded at www.ncfpd.umn.edu. Risk Communication In collaboration with the food industry, the International Food Information Council, Dairy Management Inc., and others, NCFPD's Risk Communication project team has identified best practices, key messages, and delivery methods to address the communication needs of the many audiences and stakeholders before, during, and after a catastrophic foodborne outbreak. Targeted training modules and instructional resources have been developed to enhance organizational risk and crisis communications capabilities. These strategies and key messages are being validated for use with under- represented and minority populations. FoodSHIELD (http://www.foodshield.org) FoodSHIELD addresses a major need for communication, coordination, and just-in-time training across a wide range of state and local food and agriculture laboratories, as a one-stop location for sharing information and educational resources.Botulinum Neurotoxin Sensors This project, led by Eric Johnson, University of Wisconsin-Madison, is developing sensitive nano-scale systems to detect botulinum neurotoxin in intentionally contaminated foods. Today, the detection method recognized by the FDA requires up to 48 hours for results. This project addresses the need to find a quicker, easier, and more cost-effective way to detect the toxin. One of the early detection breakthroughs are liquid crystal sensors, in which a simple color change confirms the presence of the toxi n. Event Modeling & Sampling Strategies Randall Singer's (University of Minnesota) project models the distribution chains of fruits, vegetables and seafood as they move from Latin America to the United States. This allows evaluation of the vulnerability of these systems to intentional contamination, and to evaluate sampling strategies for intentional vs. accidental contamination throughout these food systems for the rapid detection and removal of contaminated products from the food supply chain. This project operates collaboratively with Donald Schaffner's (Rutgers University) project in cross-theme partnership, developing a computer simulation model with a user- friendly interface to study a food contamination event, allowing the user to adjust sampling strategies for intentional contamination by specifying the container size, contamination prevalence, agent concentration and agent distribution in order to evaluate and optimize sampling strategies.RESEARCH DIEM is organized around four closely linked research focus areas: Center of Excellence Conceptual Diagram 1) T he Coastal Hazards Modeling focus area emphasizes the study of the physical science of hazards to understand the meteorological, hydrological, geophysical, and other characteristics of hazards, develop improved models to assess their behavior and test these models in order to predict impacts on human settlements and natural systems. 2) T he Engineering to Enhance the Resilience of the Built and Natural Environment focus area emphasizes the interaction between hazards and the built and natural environments to promote an improved understanding of how infrastructure, including natural systems, can be designed or managed to facilitate resilience. 3) The Disaster Response and Social Resilience focus area examines the institutional and social conditions that facilitate improved levels of community preparedness, emergency response and post disaster recovery. 4) The Planning for Resilience focus area evaluates planning and decision-support tools. Plan evaluation methods are used to determine the efficacy of hazard mitigation, disaster recovery and preparedness plans, including their ability to improve resilience. Cross cutting activities support the research of the four focus areas and translate that research into action and include, an Education Component , an Advisory Board , and Advanced Information Systems . The latter provides visualization, analysis, and geospatial technology that enhance the effectiveness and integration of the research and the products that are derived from it.
