Binga The S KEPTICAL INQUIRER is the official journal of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, an international organization.Protecting Our Valuable Vaccine Programs Benjamin Franklin championed vaccinations in the early years of our nation. In the past half century or so, widespread vaccination programs have wiped out or severely reduced the scourge of childhood diseases that afflicted or threatened most of us back in mid-century. Measles, chicken pox, and whoopingcough used to be common (I certainly had all three), and polio was a fearsome threatthat we could only hope didn't strike anywhere near us. All of that has changed. Thesuccess of near-universal immunizations of infants and children has rightly been calledthe greatest public health achievement in the United States in the twentieth century. But all that is under attack in some quarters by concerns fueled by bad science and misinformation, and worse, some intentional distortions. While public support forvaccination programs remains at greater than 94 percent, some parents and a tinyfringe of doctors, aided by uncritical media reporting and some out-and-out fear-mon-gering, have mounted a campaign against vaccinations. As physician and Yale neurology professor Steven Novella points out in this issue, an increasingly vocal anti-vaccination movement that blames the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) for the rise in diagnoses of autism has merged with thosewho claim that mercury in vaccines, and in the environment, is the cause of analleged autism epidemic and a host of other ills that plague mankind. We can allunderstand how anguished parents of an autism-afflicted child would want an exter-nal cause to blame. All the more reason to be wary of false cause-effect assertions. The issue is not academic. The Autism Omnibus, a special U.S. Court of Federal Claims, heard testimony from nine families with members afflicted with autism inJune. These are the first test cases among 4,800 other claims for compensation foralleged injuries from childhood vaccines. The court's decision will come early nextyear. The stakes are high. If the petitioners win, despite the overwhelming scientificevidence that vaccines and autism are not related, vaccination programs around theworld could be seriously undermined. It appears to be another conflict betweengood science and understandable, but misguided, emotion. In this special issue, Novella joins physician Richard Judelsohn and anthropologist and author Roy Richard Grinker (in an interview with Ben Radford) in examining anddispelling the claims that vaccines and autism are related. Fourteen epidemiologic stud-ies have been carried out, and all show no relationship between rates of autism and fre-quency of use of the MMR vaccine. The Institute of Medicine has reviewed all theMMR-autism data, declared there is no association, and closed the case. The authorsalso make clear that the so-called \"epidemic\" of autism is only an apparent one, result-ing from better diagnoses. Actual cases of autism appear to be static. Grinker's look atthe situation in other cultures reinforces those conclusions. * * * If you want an amusing look at some classic pseudoscience, check out HarriettHall's article \"Masaru Emoto's Wonderful World of Water.\" In Emoto's weirdworld, he can talk to water and it responds.

Thestudies forge ways to better understandboth out-of-body and near-death expe-riences and, perhaps more fundamen-tally important, the strong degree towhich our sense of self is associatedwith our mind's perception of our phys-ical body. The studies are similar in many aspects. They both found ways toinduce elements of the out-of-bodyexperience in healthy volunteers. Theyboth used head-mounted video displaysto provide people with an image ofthemselves from a different perspective.They used various controls and used thesense of touch by stimulating, in differ-ent conditions, both the actual person'sbody and seemingly the illusory one. Inboth studies, the volunteers experiencedfeelings of dissociation from their ownbodies\u2014it seemed as if the tactile sensa-tions were in the \"other\" body. The first, more detailed study, \"Video Ergo Sum: Manipulating Bodily Self-Consciousness,\" in the August 24 Science is by a Swiss-German illusion during whichhealthy participants experienced a virtualbody as if it were their own and localizedtheir \"selves\" outside of their bodies at adifferent position in space. They designed their experiment drawing on clinical data in neurologicalpatients reporting out-of-body experi-ences. These earlier data, they say, sug-gest that the spatial unity between selfand body can be disrupted, leading tothe striking experience that one's self isin another physical location. In one experiment, volunteers view- ed the backs of their bodies imaged froma distance of two meters projected onto3-D video display goggles. Their backswere stroked for one minute, sometimesin synchrony with stimulation of their\"virtual\" body. The participants wereimmediately then blindfolded, passivelydisplaced, and then asked to move backto their original position. As hypothe-sized, they moved closer to their \"vir-tual\" body's position. A second experiment tried to rule out whether this drift toward the virtualbody was due to a general motor bias to overshoot the position. Here theresearchers instituted fake bodies, virtualfake bodies, real objects, and virtualobjects. Once again, there was a sensorydrift of position toward one's own virtualbody and the fake body when thestroking was synchronous. \"With the use of virtual reality and multisensory conflict,\" the Swiss-Germanresearchers say, \"we induced an illusionthat possible to quantify selfhoodby manipulating attribution and localiza-tion of the entire body. Our results showthat humans systematically experience avirtual body as if it were their own\" whenvisually presented in front of them andstroked synchronously. They say the find- SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:26 PM Page 56Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERNEWS AND COMMENT ing is \"corroborated by the participants' mislocalization of their own bodies to aposition outside their bodies.... I llusory self-localization to a position outside one'sbody shows that bodily self-consciousnessand selfhood can be dissociated fromone's physical body position.\" The researchers acknowledge that they have induced only some aspects, notall, of out-of-body experiences. But theyspeculate that humans' daily experiencesof an embodied self and selfhood, andthe illusion they report in their study,both rely on mechanisms in the parietal junction of the brain, which is concerned primarily with sensory activities, such asreceiving and interpreting informationfrom all parts of the body. They furthersuggest that \"experimentally creating illu-sions of the globalized, multisensoryawareness of selfhood in a controlledmanner with virtual-reality technologyopens a new avenue for the investigationof the neurobiological, functional, andrepresentational aspects of embodied self-awareness.\" They urge expansion of suchstudies into all these areas. The second study (\"The Experi- mental Induction of Out-of-Body Ex-periences\") Hen-rik Ehrsson of the Karolinska Institutein Sweden and the Wellcome T rustCentre for Neuroimaging in London. Using a similar experimental setup, he likewise demonstrated \"a perceptual illu-sion in which individuals experience thattheir center of awareness, or 'self,' islocated outside their physical bodies andthat they look at their bodies from the per-spective of another person. The illusiondemonstrates [that] the sense of beinglocalized within the physical body can befully determined by perceptual processes.\" Participants were first seated in a chair wearing head-mounted displaysshowing his or her image as seen fromtwo meters behind. The experimenterthen stood beside the participant, inview, and used two plastic rods to touchsimultaneously the person's actual chest,which was out of view, and the apparentchest of the \"illusory body.\" After two minutes, the participants answered a questionnaire asking to affirm or deny tenperceptual effects. Three were designed tocapture the experience of an illusion andseven served as controls for suggestibilityand task compliance. Ehrsson reports thatthe participants affirmed the illusionstatements and denied the controls, andthat the difference in ratings was statisti-cally significant. Another experiment sought objective evidence of the illusion by registeringskin-conductance response (SCR) as ameasure of the emotional response whenthe illusory body was seemingly \"hurt\"by hitting it with a hammer after aperiod of stimulation. He observed sig-nificantly greater threat-evoked SCRsafter the illusion was conditioned. \"The observed SCR difference pro- vides objective evidence that the partici-pants were emotionally responding as ifthey were located behind their physicalbodies,\" says Ehrsson.\"The present illusion is fundamen- tally important because it informs usabout the perceptual processes thatunderlie the sense of being located insidethe body,\" he says. Correlated visual andtactile information are both important. Concludes Ehrsson: \"This rep- a experience' forms thefoundations for self-consciousness.\" An accompanying news report in Science on both experiments quotes Ehrsson, who has tried out the lab situ-ation on himself: \"You really feel thatyou are sitting in a different place in theroom and you're looking at this thing infront of you that looks like yourself andyou know it's yourself but it doesn't feellike yourself.\" \"The research provides a physical phenomena usuallyascribed to otherworldy influences,\"Peter Br ugger, a neurologist at Uni- versity Hospital in Zurich who was notinvolved in the experiment, told sci-ence journalist Sandra Blakeslee in herreport on these experiments in The New York Times (August 24). Blakeslee has just published a book on closelyrelated research titled The Body Has aMind of Its Own (Random House), on how the brain maps out every point ofthe body, helping provide our sense ofself-awareness. Brugger is also quoted in the Science news section article. He notes that nei-ther experiment replicates the full-blownout-of-body experiences in which peoplereport \"an enormously compelling sensa-tion of separation from the body.\" Evenso, he said, these illusions may be as closeas it is possible to get in the lab. Near-death and out-of-body experi- ences are frequently reported by peoplesuffering severe and sudden injury or ill-ness and by others during sleep paralysis,strong exertion, or intense meditation.According to Brugger, the new researchis a first step in figuring out exactly howthe brain creates the sensation.

However, with thepublication of the August 27, 2007,issue, that all changed. The next timethat the reporters at the WWN spot any- thing . . . unusual , you'll have to read about it on the organization's Web site atwww.weeklyworldnews.com. The black-and-white paper that un- abashedly chronicled the exploits of BatBoy and a cadre of other unlikely crea-tures and events\u2014and still had the veinsto call itself \"The world's only reliablenewspaper\"\u2014has ceased publication.The tabloid that mocked the tabloids\u2014though I always wondered if everybodywho was reading along got the joke\u2014has changed to \"Web-only\" status. According to no less a source than the respected news service Reuters(\"Weekly World News to close [aliens not blamed!],\" July 24, 2007), WWN has shut down its presses due to the pres-sures that are currently being felt byeveryone who trades in the marketplaceof periodicals, pressures generated bythe rising costs of materials and the pres-ence of the Internet as a publishingvenue, among other factors. Havingoperated at a $160 million net loss for2006 (again according to Reuters), thepoint was reached at which those pres-sures made implosion imminent, andthe parent company, American Media,decided to shut down WWN, one of itsmany supermarket tabloids. After all of those years on the racks\u2014 not to mention a brief stint as a televi-sion series in which recognizable charac-ter actors appeared as \"experts\" on avariety of subjects\u2014 WWN and its the pseudonymousEd Anger's column, \"My America,\" willbe available only in electronic form. So,the next time that a president and FirstSpouse adopt an infant extraterrestrialor the cries of the tormented souls of thedamned emanate from a newly createdfissure in the earth, you'd better hopethat you have 'Net access, because youwon't learn about it while your groceriesare being swiped across a checkout scan-ner.

The Academy of Sciences of South Africa said its studies had found no sci-entific basis for the use of nutritionalsupplements as a first-line defenseagainst HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.It was an implicit rebuke to SouthAfrica's health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, who has been much criticizedfor questioning the safety of anti-HIVdrugs and promoting homespun treat-ments such as garlic, beetroot, andlemon as effective agents against the dis-ease (New York Times, August 23, p. 2). The academy's report noted that a good diet was important in maintainingthe body's defenses against AIDS and sodidn't rule out the usefulness of goodnutrition in countries such as SouthAfrica. But it stated that a healthy dietplays a secondary role to drugs like anti-retrovirals in the body's fight againstAIDS. To make matters worse, NicoliNattrass, author of the S KEPTICAL INQUIRER cover article, now tells us that South African President Thabo Mbekicontinues to support the health minis-ter, despite recent revelations about heralcoholism (the cause of her recent livertransplant) and the fact that she wasconvicted of theft in Botswana (whilebeing treated for kleptomania). SKEPTICAL INQUIRER November / December 2007 7 Weekly World News Dies in Print, Lives On on the Web SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:27 PM Page 7NEWS AND COMMENT Barry Beyerstein is dead. I have lost a friend and colleague of thirty-plus years,and you, dear reader, have lost a cham-pion of critical thinking and skepticalinquiry. Barry died on June 25, 2007,\"with his boots on,\" working at his desk atSimon Fraser University (SI, September/October 2007). He was sixty years old. Those of you who knew Barry only through his writings will remember athoughtful man dedicated to reason andintent on exposing to critical scrutiny everysort of pseudoscientific claim. Those of youwho had the opportunity to meet him\u2014ata CSICOP conference or through partici-pation at Ray Hyman's annual Skeptics'Toolbox in Eugene, Oregon, where Barrywas on the faculty from its outset some fif-teen years ago\u2014will remember a man witha warm smile, an eagerness to engage inconversation, and a remarkable willingnessto listen to what you had to say beforeoffering his astute commentary. Few peo-ple could match Barry's ability to put oth-ers at ease and project a sincere interest inwhat they had to say. One couldn't helpbut like the man. Barry was born in Edmonton, Alberta, on May 19, 1947. His earlyyears were spent in Camrose, Alberta.He then moved with his family toBurnaby, British Columbia, when hewas in junior high school. His parentswere both born in Canada of Scan-dinavian heritage. His father, who hadbeen a bank manager before becoming acareer chiropractor, was a colorful char-acter of many talents. He graduatedfrom the granddaddy of all chiropracticcolleges, the Palmer School of Chiro-practic in Davenport, Iowa. Over-lapping his lifelong chiropractic practicewere many avocations, including that ofstage magician, real estate speculator,and building contractor. When hewould build a house, the family wouldlive in it for a while before it was sold.Indeed, Barry and his family movedthirty times within his neighborhoodwhile he was growing up! If that mixtureof careers were not enough, Barry'sfather also wrote and published his ownself-help books and operated a cosmeticsmanufacturing business that was basedon his own cosmetic preparations. Hewas also a founding member of the Al-berta-based Social Credit party, whichhad as its central political plank a bizarreeconomic notion which critics lam-pooned in terms of \"something fornothing\" and \"funny money.\" Henonetheless managed to win his seat,and he served one term in Ottawa as aMember of Parliament. In contra-balance to such paternal \"freneticism,\" Barry's mother, now inher nineties and still leading an activelife, was a strong and calming influenceand pursued only one career outside thehome: she was a school teacher. Everyone of more than only passing acquaintance with Barry will recognizethe echoes of both parents' characters inBarry's makeup. His mother's calmnessand her love of teaching provided thesteady hand to Barry's character devel-opment and probably also influencedhis career choice, but his father's wide-ranging interests and his ability tobecome expert in so many things at oncewas reflected in Barry's amazing knowl-edge of such a wide array of subjects. Barry was a member of the first grad- uating class from Simon Fraser Uni-versity, where he earned a bachelor of arts(Honours Psychology) degree. He thenattended graduate school at theUniversity of California at Berkeley,where he was awarded a PhD in Ex-perimental and Biological Psychology. Itwas in Berkeley that he met Suzi, and thetwo went on to become a poster couplefor happy marriage. After graduation,Barry fulfilled his dream of returning toteach at Simon Fraser, where he spent hisentire professional life, ultimately beingpromoted to full professor. His scholarlyresearch related to brain mechanisms ofperception and consciousness, the effectsof drugs on the brain and mind, and thecontribution of olfactory perception tohuman cognition and emotion. In terms of Barry Beyerstein the skeptic, he was a Fellow of CSI and amember of its Executive Council, asso-ciate editor and frequent contributor tothe Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine, and member of the Editorial Tributes to Barry Beyerstein, Champion of Critical Thinking, Skeptical Inquiry I found Barry through a short article in Scientific American some twenty years ago.Shortly after we met, we, along with his brother Dale, founded the BritishColumbia Skeptics. Since then, I have become close friends with Barry, his wifeSuzi, his brother Dale, his daughter Lindsay, and his son Loren. Barry Beyerstein was the quintessential skeptic: polite, learned, resolute, honest and frank. He never asked more of claimants than what they claimed. As for myself,Barry enriched my life. I learned a lot from him and got to meet many fascinatingpeople through him. Barry was a humanist. His hope was to leave this world a little better than when he entered it, and I know he did. His achievements in science are noteworthy. Toname just one accomplishment, he and his brother all but eliminated graphologyfrom the B.C. landscape. Other targets are too numerous to mention, but all wereworthwhile. Barry's sudden death was a shock.I think our only grip on immortality is what others think of us, that is\u2014the judg- ment of history. I, for one, will do my best to see that Barry's legacy lives on. \u2014Lee Moller Lee Moller, a software developer, helped to co-found the B.C. Skeptics with Barry andhis brother Dale in 1987 and serves as editor of its newsletter, The Rational Enquirer.SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:27 PM Page 8Board and again, frequent contributor to the S KEPTICAL INQUIRER . He wrote books, book chapters, and articles exam-ining various paranormal and alternativetherapeutic beliefs, founded and chairedthe B.C. Skeptics, and was interviewedrelentlessly by the media whenever anyweird claim made the news. One would think that all this should be enough accomplishment for one man,but there is more. (Remember his father,the chiropractor/politician/magician/etcetera!) Barry was also a founding mem-ber of Canadians for Rational Healthpolicy; a member of the Advisory Boardof the Drug Policy Foundation (Wash-ington, D.C.); founding board memberof the Canadian Foundation for DrugPolicy; and contributing editor of theInternational Journal of Drug Policy . He often served as an expert witness in civiland criminal trials, where he testifiedregarding drug effects on consciousness,memory, perception, aggression, and onsuch topics as addiction and recidivism.He once addressed the House of Com-mons Standing Committee on Healthduring discussions leading up to the pas-sage of the Controlled Substances Act.More still: he was active, along with hisbrother Dale, in the British ColumbiaCivil Liberties Association. And then there was Barry the Handyman. Barry and Suzi worked withan architect to design their superbhome in Port Moody, a suburb ofVancouver, and as long as I knew Barry,he was busy renovating it with greatskill. For example, while the house wasbeing built, he did all the wiring him-self, and the result passed inspectionwith flying colors. He installed severalhuge, seven-and-a-half-foot doors thatwere once part of a ship. Barry theHandyman was indeed so willing tohelp others that it was sometimes diffi-cult not to take advantage. He wouldoften, on his way to a CSICOP meetingin Buffalo, stop off at our place inToronto for a couple of days, and thenwe would drive to Buffalo together. AllI would have to do is look pensively atsome part of our house, and Barrywould immediately want to know whatI was looking at so that he could fix it.On one occasion, the eaves wereclogged with leaves, and when he sawme looking in that general direction, heinsisted on helping me clean them. Idid not have a long ladder, and so hefurther insisted that we go to a hard-ware store and buy an extension ladder.We carried the ladder several blockshome, holding up traffic whenever wehad to cross a street, and then cleanedthe eaves. That was Barry. Doorbelldidn't work wor k? Let me fix it.\" There were lots of other Barrys too, among them Barry theFamily Man: devoted to Suzi andhis children Lindsay motherChristine and Dale; Barry theJazz afi-cionado Barrys that particu-larly appealed to me): wespent many a happy even-ing lifting our spirits (sin-gle malts, of course) to thesounds of Ben Harper, Made-leine and Horace Sil-ver; Barry the Bookworm: it is rareto meet someone who has read as widelyand deeply as did Barry\u2014and many oth-er Barrys as well. When his children were young and they asked the inevitable \"What hap-pens when we die?\" Barry wisely taughtthem that we live on through theimpact that we have had on others andthrough their memories of us. Barry'simpact has been enormous, and he willlive on for a very long time. \u2014James Alcock James Alcock is professor of psychology atYork University in Toronto and a fellow ofthe Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

His father was ajanitor of Jewish immigrant descent.Encouraged by his sister, Estling showedan early, precocious literacy. After thefamily had moved to the West Coast, hesecured a place at the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley, where he earnedhis B.A. in English literature and alsoedited the humorous Pelican Magazine . After national service, his love of the classics drew him to Perugia, Italy, wherehe studied Italian. He then entered theU.S. State Department in Washingtonto train as a diplomat. His first postingin 1957 was as third secretary at theEmbassy in London, where he met hiseventual wife, Gillian, a British protocolassistant. His diplomatic career contin-ued for the next eleven years, rising toVice Consul, with postings to Athens,Teheran, Saigon (where he was caughtup in the Tet offensive), and finally HongKong. In 1968, he found himself atodds with the State Department overaspects of foreign policy and resigned hispost. He moved to San Francisco, and in1969 married Gillian to settle downtogether after their many years of sepa-rated globetrotting. For the next two years, Estling poured his efforts into writing. He penned a totalof six fiction books in differing styles,plays, and verse. His writing style wasintellectual, full of subtlety and irony butnot popularist. Being a humble manwriting primarily for enjoyment, he didnot aggressively pursue publication. Hislast book, Far House, set during theVietnam conflict, was accepted by a pub-lisher who went bust shortly before thebook was to be published. In 1971, the Estlings moved to En- gland where he trained as a teacher. Hetaught English Literature in Cornwall,and then in Somerset where he andGillian settled in the idyllic village ofDowlish Wake in a fifteenth-centuryformer parsonage. Estling taught for fif-teen years in Yeovil, where he alsobecame a school governor before retiringin 1989 due to ill health. He continued his love of reading and writing, his main activity for several hoursa day, for the rest of his life. His interestswere eclectic, covering history, literature, the arts, science, and philosophy, with a special affinity for cosmology and evolu-tion. He used his accumulated knowledgeto educate, debate, and provoke others todo the same, with a towering intellecttempered by humor* and a genuine com-passion for others. He wrote regularpieces for the New Scientist for sixteenyears, S KEPTICAL INQUIRER 'SForum sec- tion for fourteen years, and articles andshort stories for various publications,including The London Magazine.He had a lifelong interest in philat- ely, with an extensive collection coveringthe first century of world stamps, in-cluding every single American stampbefore 1940. Palaeontology also in-trigued him, the Somerset area beingabundant in fossils, which he collected.He had an extensive worldwide circle offriends and spent his final years doingwhat he enjoyed most in a place heloved with his devoted wife by his side. After an enjoyable and active sum- mer day on July 6, 2007, Estling diedsuddenly but painlessly at home in hisfavorite chair, after a remarkably richand accomplished life. \u2014Chris Brewchorne Chris Brewchorne, a potter, Estling.

Why aren't most people grate-ful for the data? It's easy to make funof others who won't give up ideas orpractices that scientific research hasshown to be demonstrably wrong\u2014 therapeutic touch, alien abduction, the Rorschach Inkblot Test\u2014 or beliefs in haunted houses and psychic detective skills that this magazine keeps expos- ing as fraud or delusion. It's harder to see that the mechanism that keeps these people from admitting they are wrong afflicts us, too\u2014all of us, even skeptics. The motivational mechanism underlying the reluctance to be wrong,change our minds, admit serious mis-takes, and accept unwelcome findingsis cognitive dissonance. The theory ofcognitive dissonance was invented fiftyyears ago by Leon Festinger, whodefined dissonance as a state of ten- sion that occurs whenever a personholds two cognitions that are psycho-logically inconsistent, such as \"Smokingis a dumb thing to do because it couldkill me\" and \"I smoke two packs aday.\" Dissonance produces mental dis-comfort, a state that is as unpleasant asextreme hunger, and people don't resteasy until they find a way to reduce it.Smokers can reduce dissonance eitherby quitting or by convincing them-selves that smoking isn't really so harm-ful and may even be beneficial. Therecent lineup of Republican men whopreach that homosexuality is a sin anda \"choice\" reduce their dissonancewhen caught in public places with theirpants down by saying, \"I'm not gay\u2014Iwas just under stress.\" In a sense, dissonance theory is a theory of our mental blind spots\u2014of how and why we block informationthat might make us question ourbehavior or convictions. The theoryhas been supported by many discov-eries in cognitive science that haveidentified the built-in biases of thehuman mind. One of the most effec-tive ways the mind maintains conso-nant beliefs is through the confirma-tion bias\u2014the fact that we tend tonotice and remember informationthat confirms what we believe andignore or forget information that dis-confirms it. (Indeed, one of the rea-sons that scientific thinking does notcome naturally to many people is pre-cisely because it requires the investi-gator to consider disconfirming\u2014dis-sonant\u2014evidence for a hypothesis.)Another central bias is the belief thatwearen't biased, everyone else is. We see things clearly; what is the matterwith those other people? What arethey thinking? What they are think- ing, of course, is that they see things clearly and we don't. Dissonance is uncomfortable enough when two cognitions conflict, but it is most painful when an important ele-ment of the self-concept is threatened:for example, when information chal-lenges how we see ourselves, chal-lenges a central belief (religious, politi-cal, or intellectual), or questions a mem-ory or story we use to explain our lives.When that happens, the easiest way toreduce dissonance is simply to rejectthe information (it's stupid; it's flat-outwrong) or kill the messenger (he's bias-ed, after all). But even more signifi-cantly, when people behave in a waythat is inconsistent with their own viewof themselves as good, smart, ethical, Social psychologists Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson are authors of Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why WeJustify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions,and Hurtful Acts (Harcourt, 2007).COMMENT AND OPINION 'Why Won't They Admit They're Wrong?' Skeptics' and N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:28 PM Page 12and kind, they tend to reduce disso- nance not by changing those self-con-cepts but by justifying their behaviorto themselves. If I am good and kind,then by definition the bad or unkindthing I did was warranted: They started it. He deserved it. Everyone does it. Iwas only following orders. The nonconscious mechanism of self-justification is not the same thingas lying or making excuses to others tosave face or save a job. It is more pow-erful and more dangerous than theexplicit lie, because it prohibits ourown awareness that we are wrongabout a belief or that we did some-thing foolish, unethical, or cruel. Dis-sonance theory therefore predicts thatit's not only bad people who do badthings. It also shows that good peopledo bad things and smart people clingto foolish beliefs precisely to preservetheir belief that they are good, smartpeople. This is why, when skepticswave their reams of reasoned data atpeople who have just sold their houseand cow to follow a delusional dooms-day prophet, what they are mostlydoing is making the followers feelreally stupid. It is much more soothingfor the followers to justify their actionsby saying, \"Thank God we sold thehouse and cow for our brilliant leader!Our devotion spared the world fromdisaster.\" This was precisely the rea-soning of the followers of one suchdoomsday prophet whom Festingerand his colleagues described in theirearly study of dissonance in action,When Prophecy Fails. Numerous examples from the vast realms of pseudoscience fill thesepages, so let's take an example that,unfortunately, is becoming increas-ingly common among real scientists.Most scientists pride themselves onmaintaining intellectual integrity. Yet,with the breakdown of the firewallbetween research and commerce, sci-entists' intellectual independence isbeing whittled away. Many scientists,like plants turning toward the sun,are turning toward the interests oftheir sponsors without even beingaware that they are doing so. Wheninvestigators have compared theresults of studies funded indepen-dently and those funded by industry,they have consistently uncovered a\"funding bias.\" In a typical example,161 studies, all published during thesame six-year span, examined the pos-sible risks of four chemicals to humanhealth. Of the studies funded by in-dustry, only 14 percent found harmfuleffects on health. Of those fundedindependently, fully 60 percent foundharmful effects. Most of the scientists funded by industry are not consciously cheating,nor are they corrupt like the few whoblatantly fabricate data to win fameand fortune. Rather, they are decentpeople who have the same cognitiveblind spots we all do. If you are anindependent scientist and yourresearch reveals an ambiguous find-ing about your new drug\u2014perhaps adiscernable but statistically insignifi-cant increased risk of heart attack\u2014you will probably say, \"This is trou-bling; let's investigate further. Is thisincreased risk a fluke, was it due tothe drug, or were the patients unusu-ally vulnerable?\" However, if you arean industry-funded scientist moti-vated to show that your new drug iseffective and better than older drugs,you may unwittingly lean in thedirection of resolving the ambiguityin your sponsor's favor. \"It was afluke. Those patients were alreadyquite sick anyway.\" This was the rea-soning of the Merck-funded investi-gators who had been studying thecompany's multibillion-dollar drugVioxx before evidence of the drug'srisks was produced by independentscientists. In the need to reduce dissonance, the Merck-funded scientists are no dif-ferent from people who believe in theefficacy of the Rorschach or therapeu-tic touch. By justifying their decision to support the drug and minimize discon- firming data, they preserved their feel-ings of integrity and of being abovethe conflicts of interest that so clearlytaint everyone else's judgments. Cognitive dissonance is hardwired, but how we choose to reduce it is not.Just as good drivers learn to correct forthat blind spot in their rear vision,good thinkers can learn to correct forthe blind spots in their reasoning.Scientists must be just as vigilant aboutaddressing potential biases and con-flicts of interest that can affect theirwork as they are about noting biases inothers' research. And we can all try toavoid that tone of \"we think skepti-cally and you don't.\" One exercise inhumility is to recall the dissonant pangsof embarrassment we felt when we,too, closed our minds to evidence topreserve a cherished belief. Our col-leagues and friends will thank us foradmitting it. And who knows, wemight actually learn a little somethingfrom the mistakes we've made. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER November / December 2007 13Cognitive dissonance is hardwired, but how we choose to reduce it is not. Just as good drivers learn to correct for that blind spot in their rear vision, good thinkers can learn to correct for the blind spots in their reasoning.SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:28 PM Page 1314 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERThe best of all health care\u2014 who wouldn't want to knowhow to achieve this meritori- ous aim? Apparently, it's not utopia;we all can go there. We need only tofollow the path of \"integrated health.\"Integrated health, we are told by ThePrince of Wales's Foundation for Inte-grated Health, a U.K. lobby group, is An approach to health that looks at the person in the round, taking into account the effects onhealth of lifestyle, environmentand emotional wellbeingIt offers patients the safest and most effective aspects ofmainstream medical science andcomplementary healthcareIt places an emphasis on preven- tion and self-care to help peopleavoid illness and stay well. (Prince ofWales 2007) An emphasis on prevention is some- thing I was taught thirty years ago in medical school. It has, of course, beenpart of medicine for much longer thanthat. But effective prevention needsevidence and, in this area, reliable evi-dence is particularly difficult to comeby. It took us decades to establish thatsmoking cessation, blood pressure,body-weight reduction, cholesterollowering, etc., are effective means ofdisease prevention. The research toidentify other preventative strategiescontinues but faces formidable prob-lems, often taking decades to gener-ate reliable conclusions. To simplyadvise consumers that homeopathy is used to treat many health problems orthat craniosacral therapy may preventmigraine attacks (Pinder et al. 2005)may look like a tempting shortcut tosome, but it is hardly good enough evi-dence. Without evidence, we have nomeans of knowing whether suchadvice is helpful, irrelevant, or perhapseven detrimental. It would be muchbetter to use patients' (often limited)enthusiasm for self-care in areas wherewe do have solid evidence, e.g., smok-ing cessation and regular exercise toimprove health, etc. I would even goone step further and postulate that anemphasis on prevention and self-carebased on wishful thinking distracts fromthe few evidence-based preventativestrategies currently available and is there-fore counterproductive. \"Looking at the person in the round\" presumably means being holis-tic. It is hard to think of a single figurefrom the history of medicine who hasnot pointed out that patients are morethan disease labels. William Osler, forinstance, said in an address to studentsin 1899: \"Care more particularly forthe individual patient than for the spe-cial features of the disease.\" Goodmedicine has always been holistic. I,therefore, find somewhat offensivethe implication that we need to adopt\"integrated health\" in order to prac-tice what essentially is good medicine.It is insulting to all those who, day inand day out, do their very best to con- sider each individual patient in all her or his complexities. And this, I would suggest, includes much more than \"lifestyle, environ- ment and emotional wellbe- ing\" (Prince of Wales 2007). The last point\u2014bringing to- gether safe and effective main- stream and complementary medi- cine\u2014seems reasonable at first glance. On closer inspection, however, it turnsout to be the most astonishing of the above three criteria. This is surprising, because it describes the well-known principle of evidence-based medi- cine: implementing health care that demonstrably generates more good than harm. Surely we don't need \"integrated health\" to practice evidence-based medicine? It gets even more baffling knowing howlittle regard the proponents of \"inte-grated health\" seem to have for evi-dence-based medicine. Their patientguide (Pinder et al. 2005), for instance,proclaims that chiropractic \"may alsobe used for asthma, digestive disorders,menstrual pain, and infant colic.\" Iteven implies that \"the laying on ofhands\" can be effective for a widerange of conditions. And, of course, itovertly promotes one of the Prince'sfavorites: homeopathy. The actual evi-dence for these treatments, however, isalmost entirely negative (Ernst andCanter 2006; Ernst et al. 2006). Despite the fact that The Prince of Wales's Foundation for Integrated Health has powerful support, not leastof all from the U.K. Department ofHealth, opposition to integrating inef-fective treatments into the U.K.National Health Service is growing. Agroup of British scientists (including The Best of All Health Care EDZARD ERNST Edzard Ernst, MD, PhD, is at the Peninsula Medical School, Universitiesof Exeter and Plymouth.COMMENT AND OPINION SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:29 PM Page 14me) have now written twice to decision makers urging them to think again. Inboth cases, homeopathy was used asan example, mostly because it is a fairlyclear-cut case of an implausible treat-ment and negative clinical evidence. Asa result, two homeopathic hospitalshave come under pressure to either useevidence-based medicine or face clo-sure. But this is clearly not a \"turf war\";it is a battle to make sure patients aretreated with the most effective treat-ments currently available. They are nothelped by misleading statements or bypolitically correct distractions. If wewant to improve tomorrow's healthcare, we need one standard, not multi- ple standards. The best health care in-cludes an emphasis on prevention, hol-ism, and evidence. But this is not thehallmark of \"integrated health\"; it ischaracteristic of all good medicine.

Just about a tenth the size ofCalifornia, the Netherlands is still one ofEurope's most densely populated countries(after Monaco and Malta). It has histori-cally been a treasure trove of geniuses\u2014from the Dutch Masters like Rembrandtand Vermeer to such scientific pioneers asAntoni van Leeuwenhoek identified bacteria, and Christ-iaan Huygens (1629-1695), who propos-ed the wave theory of light. Indeed, seatedin the front row during my talk at a skep-tics congress in Utrecht on October 28,2006, was Gerard 't Hooft, co-winner(with Martin Veltman) of the 2000 NobelPrize in Physics. Of course, like people everywhere, the Dutch can also be superstitious\u2014hencethe conference theme, \"the paranormal.\"I spoke on the relationship betweenDutch and American psychics and forseveral days before the event toured thecountry with noted Dutch skeptic JanWillem Nienhuys investigating a numberof mysteries and legends. Amsterdam woman's visions, hauntedcoal mines, the well-known boy-with-his-finger-in-the-dike tale, and more.(Our investigation of a mansion hauntedby the ghost of a walled-up nun and areport on our visit to a witch weigh-house should appear in later articles.)'Visionary of Amsterdam' In Amsterdam on March 25, 1945, the day of Catholicism's Feast of the Annun-ciation, a woman named Ida Peerdeman(1905-1996) was at home with her threeolder sisters. After a priest dropped in fora visit, Peerdeman was drawn to anadjoining room where she said she beheldan intense light from which a female fig-ure emerged and spoke to her. Thusbegan a series of fifty-six apparitions ofthe Virgin Mary, with messages from her,that allegedly occurred over the next four-teen years (the last on May 31, 1959). The first twenty-five messages (1945- 1950) were of a general nature, with imagery and prophecies that merelyreflected the political as well as the spir-itual turbulence of the period. In 1950,the Virgin, Peerdeman said, appearedatop a globe and announced, \"Child, Iam standing upon this globe, because Iwant to be called the Lady of AllNations\" (Messages 1999, p. 75). The fol- lowing year, she directed that she bedepicted in that persona in a painting(see Figure 1), and she advanced a newand \"final\" Marian dogma, that Marywas to be Coredemptrix, Mediatrix, andAdvocate. The message (May 31, 1954)implied that the dogma would be pro-claimed by the then-current pope, PiusXII, or at least sometime \"in the twentiethcentury\" (Messages 1999, p. 145-146). Neither was the case (Conte 2006). Several other messages purported to predict future events. However, the state- ments, like those of French seerNostradamus (1503-1566), are vagueand open to various later interpreta- process called retrofitting(i.e., after-the-fact matching). For exam-ple, Peerdeman claimed publicly that inone message she had predicted the AIDSepidemic but had mistaken it for cholera(Van der Ven 2002). In fact, the actualreference (December 26, 1947) was to atorpedo-like device causing \"terribledeadly diseases,\" including cholera andleprosy, and to faces \"covered with dread-ful ulcers, something like leprosy\"(Messages 1999, p. 51). No place or time period was specified. Thus Peerdemancould subsequently claim to have pre-dicted some chemical/biological attackor any of various epidemics, such assmallpox, or, later reaching for a moredramatic matching, AIDS. (For adebunking of other Peerdeman predic-tions, see Conte 2006.) Peerdeman also claimed to have had a number of \"Eucharistic experiences\" thatlasted until 1984, effectively supplantingthe apparitions. That is, during theEucharist (Holy Communion), certainvisions and supernatural phenomenaallegedly occurred. For example, her firstexperience (in 1958) involved theCatholic belief in T ransubstantiation (i.e.,that when partaken, the bread and wineof communion actually change into thebody and blood of Jesus Christ\u2014notmerely figuratively). Speaking of the Host(the consecrated Communion wafer)Peerdeman said (Daily 2003, p. 14): All of a sudden the Sacred Host began to grow on my tongue, becominglarger and thicker. It seemed to ex-pand and then suddenly it camealive.... I t r esembled a living fish, the way it moved in my mouth. Iwanted to take it out of my mouth tosee what it was but naturally out ofreverence I did not dare.The Netherlands: Visions and Revisions 16 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Joe Nickell, PhD, is the author of numer- ous books, including Pen, Ink, & Evidenceand Unsolved History.

In Amsterdam, Nienhuys and I vis- ited the chapel of the Lady of All NationsFoundation, where the inspired paintinghangs and nuns continue devotion to IdaPeerdeman and her cause. We spoke withone of the Sisters, photographed thepainting, and purchased copies of themessages, a biography of Peerdeman, andother materials. Nienhuys also subse-quently obtained some relevant articles,which he translated for me. Many indicators suggest Peerdeman was highly impressionable. The youngestof five children whose mother died whenshe was eight, she reportedly had an ap-paritional experience on October 13,1917, when she was twelve. Returninghome from confession, she allegedlyencountered a radiant Mary who made afriendly gesture to her. This was repeatedon two following Saturdays, althoughher father admonished her to keep herclaims to herself lest she be \"ridiculedand considered crazy.\" While to the cred-ulous the date seems auspicious, to skep-tics it seems suspicious, suggesting imita-tion: it was the day that, after much pub-licity, an estimated seventy-thousandpeople gathered at Fatima, Portugal,where three children claimed the VirginMary would appear and work a miracle(Nickell 1993, 176-181). On subsequent occasions at the Peerdeman home, a series of incidentsoccurred \"that would not have been outof place in a Poltergeist movie.\" Lamps began to swing, doors opened and closed,and other phenomena occurred\u2014allapparently without human agency (el-Fers 2002). However, time and again,when properly investigated, such \"polter-geist\" phenomena have turned out to bethe pranks of mischief makers, typicallychildren and teens (Nickell 1995,79-107). The phenomena attendingPeerdeman appear no different. That Peerdeman was simply acting out repressed hostilities is suggested bycertain \"demonic torments\" she suppos-edly endured as a teenager. These in-clude a claimed street attack by a man\"dressed all in black\" who allegedlygrabbed her arm and tried to drag herinto a canal, and another incident inwhich an old woman supposedly luredher into the path of an approachingtrain. Further, she was \"severely tor-mented by demons at home,\" on occa-sion exhibiting the typical, role-playingantics of those who are supposedly pos-sessed: shouting, supposedly showingprodigious strength (lifting a chair overher head), and the like. Once, after \"aninvisible hand\" allegedly choked her, anexorcism was performed, during whichthe \"Satan's revolting voice\"(i.e., Peerdeman speaking in a ed\" voice) cursing the priest (Sigl 2005, p. 13-14). (For more on possession seeNickell 2001.) Peerdeman's devotees cite local bishop J.M. Punt's conclusion that \"the appari-tions of the Lady of All Nations inAmsterdam consist of a supernatural ori-gin.\" In reaching this decision, Punt(2002) cited many reports of \"healings\"attributed in some way to Peerdeman.The occurrence of so-called miraculoushealings is now the usual basis for deter-mining that someone within the CatholicChurch is a saint. However, \"miracle\" notbeing a scientific concept, such healingsare really only held to be \"medically inex-plicable,\" and thus claimants are engagingin a logical fallacy called arguing fromignorance (that is, drawing a conclusionfrom a lack of knowledge). When prop-erly investigated, \"miracle\" healings typi-cally turn out to have alternate explana-tions: spontaneous remission (commonto certain illnesses like multiple sclerosis),prior medical treatment, or even misdiag-nosis, as well as psychosomatic condi-tions, the effects of the body's own healingmechanisms, and so on (Nickell 1993, p.133-137). The \"healings\" thus far attrib-uted to Peerdeman appear unexceptional. In contrast to Punt's opinion that the apparitions had a \"supernatural origin,\"an investigating commission foundquite the opposite. Appointed by an ear-lier bishop in 1955, the group includeda psychiatrist, psychologist, priest, semi-nary teachers, and a deacon of Amster-dam's parishes. According to theirreport, the committee was \"deeplyshocked.... The messages do not come from Heaven,\" they insisted, maintain-ing that the Holy Virgin had neverrevealed herself in such a manner. Theyadded, \"We recognize therefore that allthese revelations in whatever mannerhave a purely natural origin.\" In explaining, they observed that \"Gradually one sees, as it were, a shift inpersons.\" That is, at first Peerdeman'sexperiences were about herself; thenlater she projected her own persona that thesupposed visionary suffered from ego-centricity (Van der Ven 2002). Over the years, the Catholic press reportedly \"demonized\" her (perhapsappropriately, given the irony of herhaving acted in a demon-possessedmanner), and she was often described byCatholic officials as \"an hysteric\" (el-Fers 2002). Objectively, there seems tobe nothing in the claims of IdaPeerdeman that cannot be explained asthe result of imagination, suggestion, or,possibly, pious deception.

Nienhuys had learned of a \"haunt- ed\" mine, the Emma, but it is unfortu-nately now closed. Nevertheless, wewere able to visit, about twenty kilo-meters to the south, a historical mine,Steenkolenmijn, which is open to thepublic as a sort of mining museum. (AsNienhuys learned, however, one mustbe constantly skeptical: this \"coal\"mine is actually an old marl pit, cen-turies old, that was converted to a\"model mine\" in 1917.) In addition to touring a mine to get a sense of the setting of mine ghost tales,we also visited the Meertens Institute inAmsterdam, which conducts research onlanguage and culture, including ethnol-ogy and folklore. There we met withsenior researcher Theo Meder whohelped us sort out versions of the Emmamine's ghost tale. The story is elaborated as a children's adventure, Kaspar, by Pierre Heijboer, who was himself from the village of Hoens-broek where the Emma mine is located.In the story, Little Jo had just turned fif-teen and had gone to work in the mine,even though his grandmother thoughtthis work too dangerous for him. His jobwas to regulate the weather-doors, leatherflaps that regulated air flow. One day there were no coal cars, but as he sat there he was visited by an oldman dressed in a miner's clothes, wearinga beard, and using a walking stick. Hetold Jo his name was Kaspar and that hecould determine who could see him andwho could not. He took Jo through ahole into an old section of the mine thatKaspar said was his domain. Everywhereold supports had fallen and at one placeJo saw, sticking out, the bony hand of aminer who had been killed in a collapse.He also saw fossil trees of the type coalwas made from, as well as bright crystals,and other sights. Although hours passed,he was not tired, thirsty, or hungry. Meanwhile, Jo's grandmother was worried because he had not returned,especially when she learned that hisname-token\u2014kept on a hook duringworking hours as a safety precaution\u2014was missing. After two days, everyonehad given up hope of ever finding himalive again, although his grandmotherkept praying for his safe return. Then on the third day, Jo reappeared. When asked to explain what had hap-pened, he began by saying that no onewould believe him. In fact, as his familyrejoiced, mine officials had a doctorexamine him, and a mine policemanaccused him of deserting his post. Theminers' chaplain was also skeptical of hisstory, but his grandmother knew not toworry about him in the future because he was protected by \"Kaspar, the mine ghost\" (Meder 2005; 2006a). Obviously, this narrative has a fairy- tale quality, not the least of which is itsmotif of passing through a hole into amystical realm. (In Lewis Carroll's 1865Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, forexample, little Alice falls down a rabbithole and into a strange land where every-thing occurs with fantastic illogicality.)Then there is the supernatural figure ofKaspar. Common to Dutch mine leg-ends and myths, Kaspar is a sort of godof the underworld. He is generallymalevolent, angry at humans who pillagehis rich hoard of coal (Dieteren 1984, p.33). So when miners arrived at work andfound cracked supports, they would sug-gest, \"Kaspar has been here,\" or when acoffee can or missingthey would suggest, \"Well, taken them\" (Lemmens 1936, p. 62). Ifthe Emma-mine story is based on an actual event, it had to have occurredbetween 1913, when that mine firstopened, and 1936, when a version ofthe tale appeared in a book of mine leg-ends (Lemmens 1936, p. 77). Medersuggests (2006) that the boy may sim-ply have wandered off, become lost,and fallen asleep, dreaming about theold man or inventing him to provide analibi for himself. Asked about haunted mines, our guide at Steenkolenmijn was very dis-missive, saying that ghost stories weresimply used to scare beginning workers.Even so, Nienhuys did turn up someilluminating tales of mine \"ghosts.\" Onespecter proved to be a miner who wascovered in chalk, while another was agoat that had been surreptitiouslyreleased underground! Still another tale, \"the ghost in the mine wagon,\" tells about a miner whowas attempting to fraudulently changethe tags on coal cars to give himselfcredit for greater production. Suddenly,his hand was grabbed\u2014in one versionby a ghost, in another by the supervisorwho had hidden in one of the cars(Nienhuys 2006). As all these folk narratives about mine ghosts indicate, they have less in- sight to provide about the reality ofghosts than about the storytellers' desireto entertain or instruct within their owncultural environment. Finger-in-the-Dike Tale Another Dutch folktale is as well known to American tourists as it is otherwiseobscure to Dutch folklorists. Americanslearn it as children, an idyllic tale of a boysaving his town by plugging a leaking dikewith his finger and so preventing a flood.Although not a paranormal tale, it isnonetheless an instructive one to skeptics. Related in a text of 1865, it begins: Many years ago, there lived in Haarlem, one of the principal cities ofHolland, a sunny-haired boy of gentledisposition. His father was a sluicer,that is, a man whose business it was toopen and close the sluices, or largeoaken gates, that are placed at regulardistances across the entrances of the 18 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Figure 2.

(Photo by Joe Nickell)SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:30 PM Page 18canals, to regulate the amount of water that shall flow into them.... One lovely autumn afternoon, when the boy was about eight yearsold, he obtained his parents' consentto carry some cakes to a blind manwho lived out in the country, on theother side of the dike.... Returning home, the boy stopped to pick some flowers, but, with darkfalling, his attention was drawn by thesound of water trickling. He quicklyunderstood the danger: the dike hadsprung a leak! Quick as a flash, he saw his duty. Throwing away his flowers, the boyclambered up the heights until hereached the hole. His chubby littlefinger was thrust in, almost before heknew it. The flowing was stopped!Ah! he thought, with a chuckle ofboyish delight, the angry waters muststay back now! Haarlem shall not bedrowned while I am here! But as night fell and the air became chilled, \"Our little hero began to trem-ble with cold and dread.\" Soon, notonly was his finger tired, but his entirebody began to fill with pain. When noone answered his cries for help, he calledon God for assistance. \"And the answercame, through a holy resolution: 'I willstay here till morning.'\" He suffered on,uncertain he could even draw away hisfinger if he wanted to. Then, At daybreak a clergyman, returning from the bedside of a sick parishioner,thought he heard groans as he walkedalong on the top of the dike. Bending,he saw, far down on the side, a childapparently writhing with pain. \"In the name of wonder, boy,\" he exclaimed, \"What are you doingthere?\" \"I am keeping the water from run- ning out,\" was the simple answer ofthe little hero. \"Tell them to comequick.\" It is needless to add that they did come quickly .... ( D odge 1865) It's an inspiring little story. Unfor- tunately, Dutch folklorists do not know of the tale from oral tradition or even an oldschoolbook, but rather from an Americanchildren's novel published in 1865 byMary Mapes Dodge (1831-1905) (Har-mans 2005, p. 19). Titled Hans Brinker or the Silver Skates, the novel presents the talein a chapter titled \"Friends in Need.\"Immediately following the narrative, acharacter claims the story is \"really true.\"Another replies, \"T rue, of course it is. Ihave given you the story just as Mothertold it to me years ago. Why, there is nota child in Holland who does not know it.\"But this may be no more than what liter-ary scholars verisimilitude ploy,of fiction writers (Holman 1980, 459). Still, another reason for thinking Dodge may have had a source for thefinger-in-the-dike narrative is her abun-dant use of source material throughoutthe novel. This includes not only suchworks as Macaulay's History of England(1849-61), Charles Mackay's Memoirsof Extraordinary Popular Delusions(1841), Dodge to the Netherlands before writingher novel\u2014various reference worksreflecting Dutch art, science, and soci-ety. It children's literaturelike Clement Moore's \"A Visit from St.Nicholas\" (1823) and certain collec-tions of fairy tales, including those byHans Christian Andersen (1805-1875)and Grimm's Fairy T ales (1812-14). Indeed, the brother and novel, Gretel, evokethe Grimm brothers' fairy-tale siblings,H\u00e4nsel and Gretel. Yet, if the statement were true that \"there is not a child in Holland whodoes not know it,\" why can no trace ofit now be found earlier than Dodge's1865 text? My own search\u2014aided byCenter for Inquiry, Director of LibrariesTimothy Binga\u2014failed to turn up anyantecedent of the finger-in-the-dikemotif (neither a comprehensive Internetsearch, nor any other). Small wonderthat Dutch folklorist Theo Meder(2006b) calls the boy in the tale \"theDutch hero that never was.\" Nevertheless, as a concession to American tourists, the Dutch Bureau forTourism placed a statue of the imaginarylad at Spaarndam in 1950. Its inscriptionis in Dutch and English: \"Dedicated toour youth, to honor the boy who sym-bolizes the perpetual struggle of Hollandagainst the water\" (see Figure 2).Although the boy has no name inDodge's narrative, he is now typicallyreferred to by the name of the main char-acter in the novel, Hans Brinker. (Whilein Spaarndam, I sampled a beer spoofin-gly called Hansje Drinker; its label pic-tured a boy using his finger to plug aleaking beer barrel.) In 1954, a Dutchauthor rewrote the Dodge narrative,and\u2014in keeping with the location ofthe statue\u2014relocated the adventure inSpaarndam (Meder 2006b). In this way, what appears to have be- gun as a lighthearted example of Amer-ican fakelore is slowly metamorphosinginto a bit of Dutch verisimilitude. References Conte, Ronald L. 2006.

Yet the damage was done. Far more people read Dawkins's first book (whichwas aimed at the general public) thanthe second, more scholarly one. More-over, although The Selfish Gene was largely a popularization of technicalideas by evolutionary biologists such asWilliam Hamilton (Oxford University)and George Williams (Stony BrookUniversity, New York), it began to bediscussed in the literature as if it were aprimary source, an unfortunate outcomeboth for Dawkins (who became a targetfor the sort of heavy criticism that is notusually aimed at popular books) and forthe originators of the basic ideas them-selves (who remained somewhat periph-eral to the public discussion). Be that as it may, it is time to lay the selfish gene metaphor to rest, or at leastto seriously appreciate its strict limits.Dawkins's basic idea is that evolutionarybiologists should adopt what he calls a\"gene's eye view\" of evolution, since thegenes, not the organisms, species, or anyother level of biological organization, arereally the targets of natural selection andchief actors in the evolutionary drama.This shift in perspective, which followedthe explosive success of molecular biologybeginning with the discovery of the struc-ture of DNA in 1953, was based on thesimple idea that genes, not organisms,provide historical continuity since it isgenes, not the traits of organisms, that arepassed from one generation to the next.As Dawkins put it, evolution is about the\"replicators\" (the genes) though the lat-ter's fate is mediated at each generationby the \"interactors,\" i.e., the organismsthat interact with the environment. But a number of scientists and philosophers soon pointed out that thingsaren't quite that simple. One of the firstcriticisms leveled against the view of thecentrality of the gene was a simple obser-vation made by geneticist RichardLewontin and philosopher Elliott Sober.They emphasized that genes are neverfound isolated inside organisms, they areparts of genomes, and genes have to inter-act (through their products\u2014usually, butnot always, proteins) with other genes.Based on this logic, it is easy to constructmodels showing that\u2014at most\u2014selec-tion acts on an ensemble of genes (i.e., ongenotypes), not on individual genes. Dawkins responded with the interest- ing maneuver of treating every other geneas a part of \"the environment\" of any focalgene under study. While this in a senserescues the selfish gene idea, it begins toshow the clumsiness of the approach,because now the remainder of the genomebehaves simultaneously as a set of replica-tors, a set of vehicles (because of othergene's interactions with the focal one),and part of the \"environment.\" Things got worse from that point on. Recent research by Mary Jane West-Eberhard (Smithsonian Institution) andothers is helping to re-establish the classicDarwinian idea that selection acts (pri-marily) on organisms, not genes. Indeed,a phenomenon that had rarely been stud-ied when The Selfish Gene came out, known as \"phenotypic plasticity\" (theability of an organism to accommodateenvironmental variation by altering itsown developmental trajectory) suggeststhat the first step in evolution may oftenbe mediated by the phenotype, withgenetic changes following (as opposed to leading, as in the standard theory), even-tually stabilizing whatever outcome is ini-tially favored by natural selection.

His www.rationallyspeaking.org.SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:30 PM Page 20An even broader challenge to the gene's eye view of things has been brought by the resurgence of the idea ofgroup selection, which\u2014in its na\u00efve ver-sion\u2014was a primary target of some ofWilliams's original work that inspiredDawkins. Williams had convincinglyshown that there is no such thing asselection for \"the good of the species\" (astill amazingly popular misreading ofthe theory of evolution). However,recent work spearheaded by DavidSloan Wilson (Binghamton University,New York) and others has succeeded inoutlining what realistic conditions canin fact yield group-level selection, andempirical research supporting somegroup-selective scenarios has begun toaccumulate (this is particularly relevantto the understanding of human evolu-tion, especially evolution mediated bycultural traits). Finally, very recent evidence sup- porting the existence of an additionallayer of heritable epi-genetic informa- tion (i.e., information that is not car-ried by the genes themselves) has evenput in some doubt the sharpness of theoriginal distinction between replicatorsand interactors, as pointed out byphilosopher Paul Griffiths (Universityof Exeter, England) and biologist EvaJablonka (Tel Aviv University), amongothers. All of this is greatly expandingour concept of what counts as heredi-tary material, to the point that biolo-gists are seriously reconsidering what, ifanything, genes really are. As a result of these and other serious chal- lenges, some biologists and philosophers ofscience have come to an understandingof evolution as a multilevel process,where natural selection can act directlyon genes (there are truly selfish geneticelements that reproduce parasiticallyinside the genome itself), individualorganisms (as in classical evolutionarytheory), social groups within species, andpossibly even groups of different species(known as clades). Some authors havesuggested that genes may still retain aspecial role because whatever changehappens at higher levels is bound to bereflected (however indirectly) in changesin gene frequencies. But this \"bookkeep-ing\" role of genes in evolutionary biologyis a far cry from grand statements abouttheir alleged causal centrality. Evolutionis indeed a much more fascinating andcomplex process than we thought. /hwyhrect SKEPTICAL INQUIRER November / December 2007 21Where can you hear the leading voices of skepticism and science on a weekly basis?

The phenomenon, found all over theworld, has long kept both paranormalbelievers and skeptics wondering. Some have suggested as explanation for the strange occurrence that magneticor gravitational anomalies exist due tomysterious magnetic sources under-ground or secret military experiments.Magnetic causes can be ruled out easily,though, because effects are visible evenon nonmagnetic materials, such as plas-tic balls or water poured on the ground. The answer to this mystery is found using a simple tool. When the inclina-tion of several such roads has been mea-sured using spirit levels, the actual slopeof the surface has consistently beenfound to be opposite to the apparent one. To answer the objection that gravi- tational anomalies would influence thelevel as well, my good friend and long-time colleague Luigi Garlaschelli, fromthe University of Pavia in Italy, also tookmeasurements on an Italian spook hillin Montagnaga (Figure 1) from a dis-tance (i.e., away from the stretch of roadin question) using a professional sur-veyor's instrument called a theodolite. The parallelism between a plumb line hanging within the critical area andanother outside of it was first checkedby Garlaschelli, then height quotes weretaken on graduated yardsticks. The realslope was calculated at about 1 percentof the apparent slope in the oppositedirection. The simpler explanation for spook hills, then, is that they are visual illu-sions in a natural environment. A Portable Spook Hill Experiment Recently, Garlaschelli, along with Paola Bressan, a researcher at the Departmentof Psychology at the University ofPadua, and Monica Barracano, also ofPadua, published a report on spook hillsin Psychological Science, the journal of the Association for PsychologicalScience (previously known as theAmerican Psychological Society). In the article, they describe four experiments showing that this phenom-enon can be reproduced in a laboratory.The researchers find that the phenome-non is due to the visual anchoring of thespooky surface to a gravity-relative eyelevel whose perceived direction is biasedby sloping surroundings. In the first experiment, for example, they built a tabletop model with threehinged, moveable boards (Figure 2) toinvestigate the case in which the criticalspot is a sloping stretch of road betweentwo other stretches that both run eitheruphill or downhill as one moves forwardfrom the observation point at one end.Spook Hills in the Lab 22 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERNOTES ON A STRANGE WORLD MASSIMO POLIDORO Massimo Polidoro is an investigator of the paranormal, author, lecturer, and cofounderand head of CICAP , the Italian skepticsgroup.

Sixty undergraduate students were divided into three groups oftwenty subjects each, with eachgroup seeing two or three of theeight different levels of inclina-tion. All subjects were unawareof the actual setup and purposeof the experiment. In the experiment, the subjects sat in front of the screen one at atime. They were asked to lookinto a hole and describe what theysaw and then assess the slope ofthe three stretches on a five-pointscale that ran from strongly down-hill to strongly uphill. Each trialwas followed by a break of aboutone minute, during which thehole was occluded and the modelmodified. The results of the experiment showed that slants are generallyunderestimated. Three stretcheswith the same slant were seen ashorizontal by all subjects, wheth-er they were truly horizontal,downhill, or uphill. A slightlydownhill stretch between twostrongly downhill inclines wasseen as illusorily uphill by sixteenout of twenty subjects and as illu-sorily horizontal by the otherfour. This illusory effect explains whatoccurs at Gravity Hill in Pennsylvania. However, a slightly uphill stretch be- tween two strongly uphill inclines wasseen by all subjects as level, not as down-hill as might be expected in light of theprevious finding. This result impliesthat inducing an illusory downhill effectis not nearly as easy as inducing an illu-sory uphill effect. In a further experi-ment, Garlaschelli and his team foundthat steeper inducing slopes are requiredto suggest an uphill slant. \"After each observer's task was con- cluded,\" say Bressan and her colleagues,\"we placed a small roll of tape on themisperceived slope, and the tapeappeared to move against the law ofgravity, producing surprise and, onoccasion, reverential fear.\" Interested readers can find details on the team's various experiments in theSeptember 2003 (14:5) issue ofPsychological Science. Experience the Spooky Effect \"The visual (and psychological) effects obtained in our experiments were in allrespects analogous to those experiencedon site,\" the researchers concluded.\"The more than twenty natural cases ofantigravity hills reported to date are allvariations on a single theme. Our studyshows that the phenomenon can berecreated artificially, with no interven-tion whatsoever of magnetic, antigravi-tational, or otherwise mysteriousforces. The spooky effects experiencedat these sites are the outcome of a visualillusion due to the inclination of a sur-face being judged relative to an esti-mated eye level that is mistakenlyregarded as normal to the direction ofgravity. Using miniature or even life-size reproductions of our tabletopmodels, it should now be easy to re-cre-ate the fascination of this challenge togravity in amusement parks and, fortwice the benefit, science museums anywhere.\" If you'd like to experience a spook hill for yourself, Bressanand colleagues have prepared thislist of the best known ones: United States: Confusion Hill, Park, Ligonier, Penn- State Route 42,Mooresville, Indiana; Gravity Hill,State Route 96, south of New Paris, Bedford County, Penn-sylvania; Gravity Hill, White's Hill, Rennick Road, La FayetteCounty, Wisconsin; Gravity Road,Ewing Road, Route 208, F ranklin Lakes, Washington; M ystery Hill, Highway 321, Blowing Mystery Spot,Putney Road, County,Michigan; Hill,Gapland Road, Burkittsville, Fred-erick County, Maryland.

Cushing A: Though TV psychic Sylvia Browne has a long history of docu-mented failures and misstatements, onemust give credit where credit is due:Sylvia Browne is correct that most peopledie within three months of their birthday. While Browne probably dispensed this factoid as a bit of quasi-mystical wisdomgleaned from her (real or imaginary) infor-mants on \"the other side,\" the issue reallycomes down to science and statistics. Partof the answer depends on how strictly andspecifically you wish to interpret the ques-tion. Counting three months (or ninetydays) to the minute of a person's birthdatewill of course give a relativ ely narrow win- dow, though most people (including Browne) pr obably begin counting from the target person's month of birth. This allowsfor three months before the birth, themonth of the birth, and three months afterthe birth, for seven out of twelve months.Since this range covers well over half theyear (in fact, just under 60 percent of it),the chances are somewhat better than50/50 that a given person will die withinthree months of his/her birth, as Brownestated. (It should be noted that guessersworking games on carnival midways allowthemselves a margin of only two monthsbefore or after the mark's birth date.) The idea that there is some sort of supernatural pattern to deaths is com-mon in mystical thinking and manyNew Age beliefs. It is similar to thenotion that deaths come in sets of three.Tens of thousands of people die everyday from disease, accident, suicide, andmurder. Out of all those, which are\"counted\"(and by whom or what)toward the string of three? And wheredo you start counting? If the deaths areordered in noticeable groups of three,presumably they would come within acertain time frame, say a few days orweeks. But if you don't specify or prede-fine what time frame you're looking for,you won't know if you have the group-ing. With any set of events, if you pickand choose which ones you notice, youcan make groups of anything. Peopleoften see patterns they impose, not nec-essarily real patterns in the world. Another related idea is that dying peo- ple can control when they actually expire.Obviously no one can choose the exactmoment, with the exception of suicides,but anecdotes and folktales suggest thatdying people can in effect will themselvesto live long enough to experience a birth-day, holiday, or special event. The best research to date was a 2004 study that analyzed the records of 1.3 mil-lion people. Researchers led by Ohio StateUniversity Cancer Center's Donn Youngspecifically examined the death rates ofthree hundred thousand cancer patients.The study, published in the December 22,2004, Journal of the American Medical Association, found that there was no overallincrease in mortality after Christmas, aswould be expected if patients were able to\"hold on\" through the holidays. Nor wasthere a correlation between the date ofdeath and Thanksgiving or the patients'birthdays. So while a slight majority of uswill die within three months of our birth-days, it seems we can't make it happen. /hwysquare A Time to Die? 24 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Benjamin Radford is a writer and investiga- tor with the Commitee for Skeptical Inquiry.His Web site is at www.RadfordBooks.com.

STEVEN NOVELLA Michelle Cedillo has autism, which her parents believe is the result of her childhood vaccines. InJune 2007 they had the opportunity, along with eight other families, to make their case to the AutismOmnibus\u2014a U.S. Court of Federal Claims that was presidedover by three \"special masters\" appointed for the purpose.These nine cases are the first test cases that will likely deter-mine the fate of 4,800 other claims made over the past eightyears for compensation for injuries allegedly due to child-hood vaccines. Vaccines are one of the most successful programs in mod- ern health care, reducing, and in some cases even eliminat-ing, serious infectious diseases. Public support for the vacci-nation program remains strong, especially in the UnitedSI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:31 PM Page 2526 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERStates where vaccination rates are currently at an all-time high of >95 percent (CDC 2004). Yet, despite a long history ofsafety and effectiveness, vaccines have always had their critics:some parents and a tiny fringe of doctors question whethervaccinating children is worth what they perceive as the risks.In recent years, the anti-vaccination movement, largely basedon poor science and fear-mongering, has become more vocaland even hostile (Hughes 2007). Of course, vaccines are not without risk (no medical interven- tion is), although the benefits far outweigh those risks. Becausevaccines are somewhat compulsory in the United States\u2014although opting out is increasingly easy\u2014a National VaccineInjury Compensation Program was established to streamline theprocess for compensation for those who are injured due to vac-cines (USDOJ 2007). It is this program to which the Cedillo and4,800 other families are applying for compensation. In the last decade, the anti-vaccine movement, which includes those who blame the MMR (mumps-measles-rubella) vaccinefor autism, has largely merged with those who warn that mercurytoxicity is the cause of many of the ills that plague mankind. Thetwo groups have come together over the issue of thimerosal, amercury-based preservative in some vaccines. They believe that itwas the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines that led to theapparent autism epidemic beginning in the 1990s. Autism is a complex neurological disorder that typically manifests in the first few years of life and primarily involves adeficiency of typical social skills and behavior. In the 1990's,the number of autism diagnoses significantly increased, frombetween one and three to about fifteen cases per ten thousand,although the true incidence is probably between thirty andsixty per ten thousand (Rutter 2005). During this sameperiod, the number of vaccines given in the routine childhoodschedule also increased. This led some to assume, or at leastspeculate, causation from correlation\u2014perhaps the vaccines orsomething in them created this \"epidemic\" of autism. We can now say, from multiple independent lines of evi- dence, that vaccines do not cause autism. For one thing, theautism \"epidemic\" probably does not represent a true increasein the disorder, but rather an artifact of expanding the diagno-sis (now referred to as autism spectrum disorder, ASD) andincreased surveillance (Taylor 2006). In 1998, researcher Andrew Wakefield and some of his col- leagues published a study in the prestigious English medicalVACCINES & AUTISM: Myths and Misconceptions Steven Novella, MD, is an assistant professor of neurology at Yale University School of Medicine.

SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:31 PM Page 26SKEPTICAL INQUIRER November / December 2007 27journal Lancet that claimed to show a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism (Wakefield 1998). Wakefield's theory was that the MMR vaccine, which contains a livevirus, can cause in susceptible children a chronic measlesinfection. This in turn leads to gastrointestinal disturbances,including what he calls a \"leaky gut\" syndrome, which thenallows for certain toxins and chemicals, like those from breadand dairy that are normally broken down by the gut, to enterthe bloodstream where they can access and damage the devel-oping brain. Although the study was small and the evidence was consid- ered preliminary, this article sparked a firestorm. As a result ofthe study and the media coverage that followed (and continuesto this day), MMR compliance in Great Britain plummeted,resulting in a surge of preventable disease (Friederichs 2006). Subsequent to the seminal article in the Lancet, many fol- low-up studies were performed testing the autism-MMR vac-cine correlation. As the follow-up studies began to be pub-lished, however, it became increasingly clear that there was nolink between MMR and autism. For example, a study in theBritish Medical Journal found that autism rates continued to climb in areas where MMR vaccination rates were not increas-ing (Taylor 1999). Another study found no association withMMR and autism or GI (gastrointestinal) disorders (Taylor2002). Other studies showed no difference in the diagnosisrate of autism either before or after the MMR vaccine wasadministered (Honda 2005), or between vaccinated andunvaccinated children (Madsen 2002). Most recently, a studyfound that there was no decrease in autism rates followingremoval of the MMR vaccine in Japan (Honda 2005). In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reviewed all of the MMR-autism data available to date and concluded that there was no association and essentially closed the case (IOM2001)\u2014a conclusion confirmed by still later studies, such asthe Honda study in Japan cited above. If Wakefield had simply been wrong in his preliminary findings, he would be innocent of any wrongdoing\u2014scientistsare not faulted if their early findings are not later vindicated.However, in May 2004, ten of Wakefield's co-authors on hisoriginal paper withdrew their support for its conclusions. Theeditors of Lancet also announced that they withdrew their endorsement of the paper and cited as part of the reason anundisclosed potential conflict of interest for Wakefield, namelythat at the time of its publication he was conducting researchfor a group of parents of autistic children seeking to sue fordamages from MMR vaccine producers ( Lancet 2004). It gets worse. Investigative reporter Brian Deer has uncov- ered greater depths to Wakefield's apparent malfeasance. Wakefield had applied for patents for an MMR vaccine sub-stitute and treatments for his alleged MMR vaccine-inducedgut disorder (Deer 2007). So, not only was he allegedly paidby lawyers to cast doubt on the MMR vaccine, but he stood topersonally gain from the outcome of his research. Further, during the Cedillo case testimony, Stephen Bustin, a world expert in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), testi- fied that the lab Wakefield used to obtain the results for hisoriginal paper was contaminated with measles virus RNA. Itwas therefore likely, Bustin implied, that the PCR used byWakefield was detecting this contamination and not evidencefor measles infection in the guts of children with autism whohad been vaccinated, as Wakefield claimed. And finally,Nicholas Chadwick testified that the measles RNA WakefieldVACCINES & AUTISM: Myths and Misconceptions Andrew Wakefield.

All of this, plus other allegations still coming out, has caused Britain's General Medical Council to call Wakefieldbefore its \"Fitness to Practise\" panel for review of his allegedprofessional misconduct (GMC 2007). Believers in the MMR-autism hypothesis dismiss the find- ings of the larger and more powerful epidemiological studiesthat contradict a link. Instead, they have turned AndrewWakefield into a martyr, dismissing the evidence of his wrong-doing as a conspiracy against him designed to hide the truecause of autism from the public. Wakefield is unrepentant andmaintains his innocence (Gorski 2007). With the MMR-autism hypothesis scientifically dead, atten- tion soon shifted to thimerosal, a mercury-based preservativefound in some childhood vaccines (although not the MMR vac-cine). There is little doubt, and no controversy, that mercury, themajor component of thimerosal, is a powerful neurotoxin, orpoison to the brain. However, toxicity is always a matter of dose.Everything becomes toxic in a high enough dose; even too muchwater or vitamin C can kill you. So the real question is whetherthe amount of mercury given to children in vaccines containingthimerosal was enough to cause neurological damage. Proponents of the mercury hypothesis argue that the ethyl- mercury found in thimerosal was given in doses exceedingEnvironmental Protection Agency limits. This load of mercuryshould be considered with prenatal vaccine loads possibly givento mothers, and to other environmental sources of mercury,VACCINES & AUTISM: Myths and Misconceptions Author of the book Evidence of Harm: Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic David Kirby (center) speaks as president Harvey Fineberg (left) of the Institute of Medicine listens during an interview by moderator Tim Russert (right) on NBC's Meet the Press August 7, 2005, at the NBC studios in Washington, D.C.

Furthermore, underweight or premature infants received a higher dose by weight than larger children.Some children, they argue, may have a specific inability tometabolize mercury, and perhaps these are the children whobecome autistic. Fear over thimerosal and autism was given a huge boost by journalist David Kirby with his book Evidence of Harm (Kirby 2005). Kirby tells the clich\u00e9d tale of courageous familiessearching for help for their sick children and facing a blindmedical establishment and a federal government rife with cor-ruption from corporate dollars. Kirby echoes the core claimthat as the childhood vaccine schedule increased in the 1990s,leading to an increased cumulative dose of thimerosal, autismdiagnoses skyrocketed. In the end, Evidence of Harm is an example of terrible reporting that grossly misrepresents the science and the rele-vant institutions. As bad as Kirby's position was in 2005, in thelast two years the evidence has been piling up that thimerosaldoes not cause autism. Rather than adjusting his claims to theevidence, Kirby has held fast to his claims, which has madehim a hero alongside Wakefield of the mercury-autism-con-nection crowd as he has squandered his credibility. There have now been a number of epidemiological and eco- logical studies that have all shown no correlation betweenthimerosal and autism (Parker 2004 and Doja 2006). I havealready mentioned that the current consensus holds that thereis no real autism epidemic, just an artifact of how the diagnosisis made. If there's no epidemic, there's no reason to look for acorrelation between thimerosal and autism. This has beenbacked up by The Institute of Medicine, which has alsoreviewed all the available evidence (both epidemiological andtoxicological) and concluded that the evidence does not sup-port the conclusion that thimerosal causes autism (IOM 2004). Especially damning for the thimerosal hypothesis are the recent studies that clearly demonstrate that early detection ofautism is possible long before the diagnosis is officially made.Part of the belief that vaccines may cause autism is driven bythe anecdotal observation by many parents that their childrenwere normal until after they were vaccinated\u2014autism is typi-cally diagnosed around age two or three. However, more care-ful observations indicate that signs of autism are present muchearlier, even before twelve months of age, before exposure tothimerosal (Mitchell 2006). In fact, autism expert EricFombonne testified in the Autism Omnibus hearings thatMichelle Cedillo displayed early signs of autism clearly visiblyon family video taken prior to her receiving the MMR vaccine(USCFC 2007). Meanwhile, evidence is accumulating that autism is largely a genetic disorder (Szatmari 2007). This by itself does not rule out an environmental factor, but it is telling that geneticresearch in autism has proven so fruitful. Mercury alarmists, in the face of this negative evidence, have been looking for rationalizations. Some have argued thatthe thimerosal in prenatal vaccines may be to blame, but recent evidence has shown a negative correlation there as well(Miles 2007). What we have are the makings of a solid scientific consen- sus. Multiple independent lines of evidence all point in thesame direction: vaccines in general, and thimerosal in particu-lar, do not cause autism, which rather likely has its roots ingenetics. Furthermore, true autism rates are probably staticand not rising. The only researchers who are publishing data that contra- dicts this consensus are the father-and-son team of Mark andDavid Geier. They have looked at the same data and concludedthat thimerosal does correlate with autism. However, the ham-mer of peer-review has come down on their methods anddeclared them fatally flawed, thus rendering their conclusionsinvalid or uninterpretable (Parker 2004). Also, like Wakefield,their reputations are far from clean. They have made somethingVACCINES & AUTISM: Myths and Misconceptions A demonstrator carries a sign protesting the use of mercury in vaccines past the U.S. Capitol in Washington July 20, 2005.

However, numerous studies show no correlation between Thimerosoland autism.

The Geiers were not evencalled as experts in the Autism Omnibus hearings. The Geiers are now undertaking an ethically suspect study in which they are administering chelation therapy to childrenwith autism in conjunction with powerful hormonal therapyallegedly designed to reduce testosterone levels. Chelation ther-apy removes mercury, and so it is dependent upon the mercuryhypothesis, which is all but disproved. Moreover, there is noclinical evidence for the efficacy of chelation therapy. The treat-ment is far from benign and is even associated with occasionaldeaths (Brown 2006). With the scientific evidence so solidly against the mercury hypothesis of autism, proponents maintain their belief largelythrough the generous application of conspiracy thinking. Theconspiracy claim has been made the loudest by Robert F .Kennedy Jr. in two conspiracy-mongering articles: Deadly Immunity published on Salon.com in 2005 (Kennedy 2005), and more recently Attack on Mothers (Kennedy 2007). In these articles, RFK Jr. completely misrepresents and selectively quotesthe scientific evidence, dismisses inconvenient evidence as fraud-ulent, accuses the government, doctors, and the pharmaceuticalindustry of conspiring to neurologically damage America's chil-dren, and accuses scientists who are skeptical of the mercuryclaims of attacking the mothers of children with autism. Despite the lack of evidence for any safety concern, the FDA decided to remove all thimerosal from childhood vac-cines, and by 2002 no new childhood vaccines with thimerosalwere being sold in the U.S. This was not an admission of priorerror, as some mercury proponents claimed; instead, the FDAwas playing it safe by minimizing human exposure to mercurywherever possible. The move was also likely calculated tomaintain public confidence in vaccines. This created the opportunity to have the ultimate test of the thimerosal autism hypothesis. If rising thimerosal doses inthe 1990s led to increasing rates of autism diagnosis, then theremoval of thimerosal should be followed within a few years bya similar drop in new autism diagnoses. If, on the other hand,thimerosal did not cause autism, then the incidence of newdiagnoses should continue to increase and eventually level offat or near the true rate of incidence. In 2005, I personallyinterviewed David Kirby on the topic, and we both agreed thatthis would be a fair test of our respective positions. Also, in ane-mail to science blogger Citizen Cain, Kirby wrote, \"If thetotal number of 3-5 year olds in the California DDS[Department of Developmental Services] system has notdeclined by 2007, that would deal a severe blow to the autism-thimerosal hypothesis\" (Cain 2005). Well, five years after the removal of thimerosal, autism diagnosis rates have continued to increase (IDIC 2007). Thatis the final nail in the coffin in the thimerosal-vaccine-autismhypothesis. The believers, however, are in full rationalizationmode. David Kirby and others have charged that although nonew vaccines with thimerosal were sold after 2001, there wasno recall, so pediatricians may have had a stockpile ofthimerosal-laden vaccines\u2014even though a published inspec-tion of 447 pediatric clinics and offices found only 1.9 percentof relevant vaccines still had thimerosal by February 2002, atiny fraction that was either exchanged, used, or expired soonafter (CDCP/ACIP 2002). Those who argue for the link have put forth increasingly desperate notions. Kirby has argued that mercury from crema-tions was increasing environmental mercury toxicity and off-setting the decrease in mercury from thimerosal. The Geierssimply reinterpreted the data using bad statistics to create theillusion of a downward trend where none exists (Geier 2006).Robert Kennedy Jr. dodges the issue altogether by asking formore studies, despite the fact that the evidence he asks foralready exists. He just doesn't like the answer. Kennedy andothers also point to dubious evidence, such as the myth that theAmish do not vaccinate and do not get autism. Both of theseclaims are not true, and the data RFK Jr. refers to is nothingmore than a very unscientific phone survey (Leitch 2007). The Autism Omnibus hearings have concluded, and while we await the decision due early next year, I am optimistic thatscience and reason will win the day. Just as shown in the 2005Dover trial of intelligent design where the full body of scien-tific evidence was given a thorough airing in court and sub-jected to rules of evidence and the critical eyes of experiencedjudges, science tends to win out over nonsense. By allaccounts, the lawyers for those claiming that vaccines causedtheir children's autism put on pathetic performances withtransparently shoddy science, while the other side marshaledgenuine experts and put forth an impressive case. But the stakes are high, and not just for the 4,800 families.

This will likely bankrupt the Vaccine Injury CompensationProgram and will also risk our vaccine infrastructure.Pharmaceutical companies will be reluctant to subject them-selves to the liability of selling vaccines if even the truth can-not protect them from lawsuits. Thimerosal still exists as a necessary preservative in multi- shot vaccines outside the United States, especially in poorthird-world countries that cannot afford stockpiles of single-shot vaccines. Anti-thimerosal hysteria therefore also threatensthe health of children in poor countries. And of course a victory for the anti-vaccination activists would undermine public confidence in what is arguably thesingle most effective public health measure devised by modernscience. This decrease in confidence will lead, as it has before,to declining compliance and an increase in infectious disease. The forces of irrationality are arrayed on this issue. There are conspiracy theorists, well-meaning but misguided citizengroups who are becoming increasingly desperate and hostile,irresponsible journalists, and ethically compromised or incom-petent scientists. The science itself is complex, making it diffi-cult for the average person to sift through all the misdirectionand misinformation. Standing against all this is simple respectfor scientific integrity and the dedication to follow the evi-dence wherever it leads. Right now the evidence leads to the firm conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. Yet, if history is any guide, themyth that they do cause autism will likely endure even in theface of increasing contradictory evidence. References Brown, M.J., T. Willis, B. Omalu, and R.

Ileal-lymphoid-nodular AUTISM: Myths 9/26/07 12:33 PM Page 31Over the past decade, the public has been presented with a large amount of information about the safetyof vaccines. Among the reasons for this interest is the widespread success of routine, universal immunization ofinfants and children, beginning in the 1940s. Previouslycommon, dangerous, handicapping, potentially fatal diseases(vaccine-preventable diseases) have been wiped out with thispolicy (see table on next page). As the last century drew to aclose, immunization was declared the greatest public healthachievement in the United States in the twentieth century. The list of licensed and recommended vaccines has been growing, and not just for infants and children. There arenow schedules from professional societies, such as the 32 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER VACCINES & AUTISM: Myths and Misconceptions Vaccine Safety: Vaccines Are One of Public Health's Great Accomplishments RICHARD G.

The considerable focus on vaccines and their safety in our information-overloaded society is not surprising, with a surplusof articles in magazines, books, parenting guides, and on theInternet, and stories on radio and television. While these occa-sionally highlight the benefits of immunization, \"No One GotSick or Died from a Vaccine-Preventable Disease Today\" is nota very exciting story, so more often the emphasis in the media ison speculation that a vaccine caused a health problem. Further- more, the widespread availability of litigation and liberal tort inthe U.S. has encouraged lawsuits claiming harm from vaccines.Finally, it's human nature to assume cause and effect whensomething bad happens, so a vaccination is an attractive targetwhen administered before the onset of a medical condition. Unfortunately, most of the public receives a lot of health information from lay sources rather than their physicians.Professional knowledge of immunization is grounded in sci-ence\u2014microbiology, immunology, epidemiology, and statis-tics. Vaccines are licensed by the U.S. Federal Drug Admin-istration (FDA) only when proven safe and effective. Recom-mendations for use are promulgated by committees of scientificexperts composed of academics, clinicians, and other caregiverswho are passionately devoted to our citizens' health and safety.The committees' conclusions, and the rationale for them, areshared with practicing physicians, who are the most reliablesource of information for patients. This process is the founda- tion that has led to the conclusion that licensed vaccines are safe, and the fears that vaccines are harmful are unfounded. Nevertheless, to address these unfounded fears, these and other groups of scientific experts have undertaken investigationsVACCINES & AUTISM: Myths and Misconceptions Reduction in Morbidity: and a long track record of vaccine safety, we see public policy based on junk beliefs, misinformation, fear, and mass hysteria.SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:33 PM Page 3334 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERto determine possible relationships between vaccines and autism, asthma, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, SIDS, and otherdiseases. No studies have yet established a causal link between vaccines and these diseases. For example: Does hepatitis B vaccine cause SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome)? Looking at the numbers of dosesof the former administered and cases of the latter,one would conclude the opposite, that hepatitis Bvaccine prevents SIDS, since 90 percent of U.S. chil-dren have received hepatitis B vaccine, and SIDScases have dropped dramatically in the past decade(probably due to the American Academy ofPediatrics [AAP] recommendation that infants sleepon their backs). Does MMR vaccine cause autism? This question received extraordinary attention after it was raised in anarticle in The Lancet in 1998, by Dr. Andrew Wakefield and colleagues. The co-authors and The Lancet both have since retracted the article and its conclusions, andWakefield is currently on trial in the U.K. for conflict ofinterest at the time of its publication. (He was on retainerfrom lawyers suing for vaccine damages.) More impor-tant, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) expert panel eval-uated the issue and concluded that the evidence favoredrejection of a connection between autism and MMRvaccine. Fourteen epidemiologic studies have been per-formed, all demonstrating the absence of a relationshipbetween increased rates of autism and frequency of useof MMR vaccine. It is unfortunate that the speculationof a relationship between MMR vaccine and autism hasresulted in the occurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases(especially measles) in children whose parents refused toallow them to receive the vaccine and has diverted atten-VACCINES & AUTISM: Myths and Misconceptions Richard G.

Is thimerosal a cause of neurologic abnormalities, including autism? The preservative thimerosal, consist- ing of ethyl mercury, was used in multi-dose vaccinevials. At present, most infancy and childhood vaccinesare supplied in single-dose vials, and all such routinevaccines are thimerosal-free. Studies to answer this ques-tion, including five epidemiologic surveys, came to thesame conclusion as the MMR vaccine-autism analyses,that there is not a relationship. A pivotal study at theUniversity of Rochester quantifying thimerosal in child-hood vaccines stated that administration of vaccinescontaining thimerosal does not seem to raise blood con-centrations of mercury above safe levels in infants. Many of us recall that only two generations ago we had schoolmates who limped or had withered arms due to the par- alytic polio they were infected with. That disease is now extinctin the U.S. because of the universal use of polio vaccine.During my training, I cared for children made deaf frommeasles, infants blind and retarded from rubella, and those whodied from bacteria like pneumococcus and meningococcus.With vaccination, those conditions no longer occur. As a physi-cian in my early years of practice, the threat of infection withbacteria called Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) loomedlarge for my patients and their families, the outcomes of braindamage or death being distinct possibilities. A vaccine wasinvented, adopted as policy, and given to U.S. infants and chil-dren. I'm pleased to say I no longer worry about Hib infection. Despite scientific proof and a long track record of vaccine safety, we see public policy based on junk beliefs, misinforma-tion, fear, and mass hysteria. In 2006, a number of legislativebodies passed, and executives signed, bills prohibiting use of vac-cines containing thimerosal. From a practical perspective, theserestrictions mean little, since all but a few influenza vaccines donot contain thimerosal. But such policies send a bad message:that the vaccines that have virtually eradicated many diseases,constituting one of the greatest public health accomplishmentsof the past century, are dangerous. Furthermore, these policiesdenigrate our informed medical and scientific communities.This is a disservice to our citizens and endangers us all. /hwyhrect VACCINES & AUTISM: Myths and Misconceptions Recommended Immunization Schedule for Persons Aged 7-18 Years\u2014United States, 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Other myths include the long-discred-ited practice of facilitated communication, in which\"facilitators\" help illiterate autistic children type outwords and sentences\u2014as well as occasional unfoundedaccusations of abuse. Yet many myths and questionsremain, especially related to the prevalence and under-lying diagnosis of autism. In a new book on autism, Roy Richard Grinker (a professor of anthropology at George Washington Uni-versity and himself the parent of an autistic daughter)examines the disease from a social and anthropologicalperspective. Here is an interview based on his bookUnstrange Minds: Remapping the World of Autism . How did you first become interested in the subject of autism?I wear two hats. I am an anthropologist and the fatherof a child with autism. So, as autism awareness grew,more and more people said, \"So you're an anthropolo-gist, what does autism look like in other cultures? Is theprevalence the same as it is here? What do people doabout it?\" I wrote Unstrange Minds so that people can see that autism is universal and that autism awarenessis increasing everywhere in the world. But the mostimportant reason for writing the book\u2014though thiswas not my original intention\u2014was to tell the world asimple message: the increase in autism diagnoses is nota crisis but rather evidence that we're finally beginningto address a kind of human difference that has for toolong been misunderstood, misdiagnosed, and misman-aged. More than six decades after autism was firstdescribed by Leo Kanner, we're finally getting it right,and counting it right. Why do you challenge the idea that autism is an epidemic? Because so many Americans and Europeans are in apanic that there is a true epidemic, and that if there is anepidemic there must be some new, identifiable cause outthere somewhere to be found and eradicated. I thoughtI could articulate some of the cultural and scientific rea-sons behind the increase in rates and give a positive mes-sage: the higher rates are due to positive changes in theway we understand and treat neurological and psychi-atric disorders. If autism is not an epidemic, how did it come to be viewed as one? Autism became viewed as an epidemic for the samereason there have been fears of epidemics of other ill-nesses: there is a dramatic increase in prevalence. Butprevalence is just the number of cases counted at a par-ticular point in time and is not evidence of trueincreases in a disease. The same happened withmelanoma and prostate cancer. There were hugeincreases in prevalence in those diseases, because theywere being diagnosed so much more (skin cancer, dueto increased awareness and more biopsies of early stagecancers; prostate cancer because of the invention ofthe PSA blood test, as opposed to the painful methodof inserting a tool through the tip of the penis all theway to the prostate). It really is confusing to see diag-nosis rates of three or four in ten thousand twentyyears ago change to rates of 1 in 150. On the surfaceit sounds frightening. Benjamin Radford has investigated ghosts, psychics, lake monsters, UFOs, mass hysterias, and many other paranor-mal phenomena for over a decade. He is the author or co-author of three books; his latest (with fellow investigatorJoe Nickell) is Lake Monster Mysteries: Investigating theWorld's Most Elusive Creatures. His Web site is atwww.RadfordBooks.com.Interview with Roy Richard Grinker Author of Unstrange Minds: Remapping the World of Autism RADFORDSI pgs 9/26/07 12:34 PM Page 36VACCINES & AUTISM: Myths and Misconceptions So it's the public's lack of understanding about the methodology? I think scientists have not done a good jobof explaining to the public that compar-ing these rates is like comparing applesand oranges. The rates in, say, 1980, werederived using a narrow definition ofautism and using administrative statistics(mostly numbers of kids enrolled in pro-grams under the category of \"autism\") at atime when autism was not a popular diag-nosis. Today's rates are derived using avery broad definition of autism (peoplefrom the severely mentally retarded topeople who marry and hold jobs and mayeven be college professors) and using reli-able and valid measurements that haveonly recently been developed. In Korea, where I'm doing an epidemi- ological study, we cannot even try to useadministrative statistics, because autism isunpopular as a diagnosis. If you used theenrollment figures, you'd think autism wasalmost nonexistent in Korea. Yet, we'refinding rates not out of line with the restof the world. Second, the increased aware-ness has meant that people see autismmore\u2014the decreased stigma has helpedtoo, since people don't hide their kids any-more. So it feels like an epidemic. But afeeling is different from science. So what accounts for the apparent increase in the prevalence of autism? They are described carefully in my book:new epidemiological methods yieldmany more cases; a much larger numberof people are being diagnosed withautism today because autism is a spec-trum that can include the profoundlymentally retarded person but also a bril-liant scientist; more and more physiciansare giving the diagnosis and then kids arebeing coded in the school system withautism (some epidemiologists who dorecords-based research then rely on theschool records for their information);people who were once called mentallyretarded or schizophrenic or a host ofother things are now being diagnosedwith autism. There is no single factoramong all of these that trumps the oth-ers, but I think the least understood isthe change in epidemiological methods. What do you think are the biggest miscon- ceptions that the public has about autism?One misconception is that we need tohave an \"epidemic\" to call attention to adisorder. Some parents and philanthropicorganizations have called me a traitor andaccused me of betraying the autism com-munity. On the one hand, I don't agreewith the way philanthropic organizationshave fueled the fears of an epidemic. Anepidemic is a useful fiction for fundrais-ing. On the other hand, the organizationsdo so much for autism awareness, re-search, and services that sometimes I feela little guilty, as if by telling the truthsome people might be less likely to givemoney. But that guilt is fleeting. The reality is that (1) the higher rates mean that autism is a bigger pub-lic health issue than we ever realized;and (2) there is nothing mutually exclu-sive about saying there's no epidemicand at the same saying that we've finallyfigured out what's going on with peopleon the autism spectrum, and we needmore research and services. Irecently received an e-mail from a parent whodecried my stance:\"How can you saythere is no epi-demic of autism?\"she wrote. \"WhenI was in school, therewere no kids withspecial in myschool. Today, in mydaughter's school thereare dozens.\" Actually,that is my point. In thepast autistic people werenot included in our schools.Today they are. And that's avery good thing. Another big misconcep- tion is that autism issomehow new. I amfrequently asked: Ifthere is no epidemic,then where are all the adults withautism? The answer is easy, but also com-plicated. Finding adults with autism isvery hard, not because they do not existbut because they are dispersed in oursociety. Some live in group homes, oth-ers in institutions, others are living andworking among us in our everyday lives.Kids are easy to count because they areall in school, neatly recorded in schoolrecords. But adults are a different story.Counting adults with autism would belike trying to count adults with speechand language disorders. You can countkids, but where would we find theadults? So many people with speech andlanguage disorders don't get speech ser-vices as adults\u2014they've learned toadjust, adapt, and manage. No one\"missed\" or \"ignored\" autistic people inthe past. They were just called somethingelse, or in some cases (like people withAsperger's) called nothing at all.

Environment probablyplays some very small role in causingautism, but environment can meaneverything in the world, from chemicals,to our diet and way of life. No environ-mental factor has yet been identified byscientists to account for autism, let alonechanges in autism prevalence. Lookingfor environmental factors in autism atthis stage in our knowledge is really likelooking for needles in haystacks. Why do you think the news media have engaged in such misleading and alarmistcoverage about autism? Fear, panic, and deep parental concernget a lot of attention. Compare the twomessages: \"There's an epidemic and wedon't know what is causing it!\" and\"More people are being diagnosed withautism today because we understand itbetter.\" Plus, autism in the news is usu-ally about autism in children (despite thefact that autistic children grow intoadults), and children are very engaging astelevision, radio, and newspaper sub-jects. Advocacy by organizations whosemembership is convinced there is an epi-demic caused by an environmental toxinhas been well funded and supported bypoliticians, especially by politicians inthe states with the most autism services(and hence, because of those services, thehighest rates of diagnosis). What has been the reaction to your book, both by medical professionals and by par-ents of autistic children? The scientific community, from what Ican tell so far, supports my workstrongly (e.g., reviews in Nature and the New England Journal of Medicine ). Much of what I'm saying about the rea-sons for the so-called epidemic hasbeen said before in scientific journals.What I've done is to put all those argu-ments together and place them in alarger context of American socialchange in a way that is accessible to awide audience. The fact that the bookis being reviewed in both scientificjournals and in the popular press, suchas People magazine, is an indication to me that I've succeeded in reaching alarge readership. Among parents ofchildren with autism, the reception hasbeen mixed. Many, many parents findUnstrange Minds to be inspiring be- cause I talk about how many families inthe world have turned something poten-tially devastating into somethinguplifting and rewarding. Others havesent me hate mail and left angry tele-phone messages on my answeringmachine at work. I have been calledevery kind of name. What does the science suggest are the causes of autism? There are probably several different kindsof autism caused by several differentgenetic pathways. There may be, in total,several dozen different genes involved.Scientists at Cold Springs Harbor Labora-tory in New York have generated one ofthe most interesting genetic models, sug-gesting that some cases are heritable, butusually over the span of a couple of gen-erations through a nonaffected carrier,and other cases are de novo mutations. But the bottom line is: it is largelygenetic, so much so that environmentprobably plays [only] a small role. Oneway scientists estimate the role of genet-ics in a certain disorder is to look at con-cordance of that disorder in identicaltwins, that is, two people with identicalDNA. The concordance, or percentage ofpeople with identical DNA who bothsuffer from an autism spectrum disorder,is as high as 90 percent in some studies.That's higher than the concordance forcoronary artery disease, depression, orbreast cancer. Then, when the scientistslook at fraternal twins, who don't havethe same DNA, they find a concordanceas low as 0 percent and as high as 10 per-cent. That makes ASD strongly genetic. If autism is partly genetic, should there be prenatal testing to determine if a fetus isautistic? That is a huge ethical question, but per-haps it's premature. We know that schiz-ophrenia, bipolar disorder, breast cancer,and many other disorders have a stronggenetic component, but they cannot betested for in the womb. Multigenic com-plex disorders are very different from,say, Down syndrome, which is an identi-fiable mutation in which there is extragenetic material (a twenty-first chromo-some), so it can be tested for. Autism is atotally different kind of condition. In explaining how disease diagnosis is cul- turally dependent, you draw from manycultures and countries, including theNavajo and family lines in China andPeru. What are two of the most vividexamples in your mind? The Korean case is one of the most fasci-nating to me. This is a country in whichscientists and doctors and governmentofficials have said that autism is a rare ornearly nonexistent disorder in Korea. Theschool and clinic records support thatcontention, because one seldom finds anymention of anyone with \"autism.\"Autism, when it is diagnosed, is highlystigmatizing because it is seen as a geneticdisorder. If a disorder is genetic, the fam-ily feels that the entire family is damaged,and this brings shame and stigma. So par-ents would rather see themselves as badparents who caused autism in their childthrough bad parenting than see the disor-der as genetic. This is the opposite of whathappened in the U.S., where mothers andfathers used to be blamed, but we now seethe disorder as genetic. At any rate, I wentinto Korea with a team of epidemiologistsand psychiatrists and psychologists, andwe have screened thirty thousand kidsand done extensive testing. And we'refinding lots of autism. The kids just arenot called autistic. They are undiagnosedor diagnosed with something else. So, inKorea, we're seeing a culturally differentversion of what has already happened inthe U.S. and higher prevalence rates inKorea are on their way: not becauseautism is new as a condition, but becauseautism is new as a concept. /hwysquare SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:34 of the Einstein- Astrology-Supporter Hoax Astrology books and Web sites often describe Einstein as favorably regarding astrology.

Otherwise I would have crept fur-ther into my shell. (Calaprice 2000) I dislike very much that my children should betaught something that is contrary to all scientificthinking. (Frank 2000) It is difficult to say what truth is, but sometimesit is so easy to recognize falsehood. (Calaprice 2000) \u2014Albert Einstein Books and Web sites on astrology often boast a quote suggesting that AlbertEinstein thought favorably of astrol- ogy. However, his negative opinion of astrol-ogy is documented. If Einstein had no inter-est in astrology, then who is responsible forhaving forged this hoax? The year 2005 marked the hundredth anniversary of the pub- lication of three seminal discoveries, among them the theory ofrelativity, made by an unknown clerk working at the Bern patentoffice. It also marked the fiftieth anniversary of the clerk's death. In 1919, during a total eclipse of the Sun, a phenomenon that was predicted by this theory\u2014the deviation of a light raydue to the mass of a huge body (in this case, the Sun)\u2014wasverified for the first time. Under the supervision of ArthurEddington, a team of astronomers aimed their telescopes inthe direction of the Sun, took pictures of the surrounding skyat totality, and compared the positions of the stars close to thelimb of the Sun with pictures of the same area of the sky takenat a different time. The measured shift in the position of starsnear the Sun corresponded perfectly with the shift predictedby the theory of relativity. As soon as Eddington published hisresults, Albert Einstein was catapulted to his position amongthe greatest scientists of all time, taking his place besideGalileo and Newton. To count Einstein among the supporters of esotericism in general, and of astrology in particular, would be quite a coup foradepts of those pursuits. Unfortunately for them, Einstein'sopinion of astrology was clear\u2014and has been published. None-theless, if you open a recent book on astrology, you may find achapter containing a list of celebrities, writers, kings, popes,artists, and the like who endorse astrology. Among them yousurprisingly, if not incredulously, may find the name of AlbertEinstein, along with this quote he is alleged to have said: Astrology is a science in itself and contains an illuminating body of knowledge. It taught me many things and I am greatlyindebted to it. Geophysical evidence reveals the power of thestars and planets in relation to the terrestrial. In turn, astrologyreinforces this power to some extent. This is why astrology islike a life-giving elixir to mankind. The same quote appears on many astrology Web sites. With a search engine, just typing \"Albert Einstein astrology is a sci-ence in itself\" will find dozens of sites posting the phrase. Even at first glance, this sentence contradicts views Einstein espoused on the error of teaching \"something that is contraryto all scientific thinking\"\u2014which would include astrology. Ihave gathered convincing information pinpointing the possi-ble author of the false phrase attributed to Einstein. The Swiss-born Canadian astrologer Werner Hirsig intro- duced the epigraph to his Manuel d'astrologie pub- lished in Quebec, Canada, in 1965. However, at the end of hisbook, a postscript mentions the following: \"On the banks ofLeman Lake, February, 1950.\" 1From this, some have incor- rectly assumed that the faux quote had been introduced as early as 1950.2After some research on the Web and in various library indexes, I found that Hirsig had written a book in 1950 titledAstrologie moderne (Modern Astrology). Thanks to an interli- brary loan system, I obtained a copy of the book fromSwitzerland and realized that the Manuel d'astrologie of 1965 was a reprint of this book. Differences between the two docu-ments are minor, as both books have the same table of contentsand pagination. Only the prefaces are different. In the 1965version, a foreword is added where the sentence attributed toEinstein is introduced for the first time in Hirsig's book.Indeed, I would have been surprised if Hirsig had introducedthe quote in a book published while Einstein was still alive. I contacted Hirsig's former wife, Ms. Huguette Hirsig, to ask her if she knew the source used by her ex-husband, partic-ularly as she had used the same quote in one of her books onastrology, Pr\u00e9visions astrologiques mondiales (1993, p. 15). Unfortunately, she could not enlighten me and insteadreferred me to a former collaborator of her husband who, as itturned out, also did not know the origin of the quote. Pursuing my research, I came across a vast compilation of all the unpublished manuscripts, notes, letters, etc. of Einstein,The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein. Alice Calaprice, the co-editor of this monumental work, read or perused all documentseventually reproduced in the collection, of which nine tomes offour hundred pages each have been released to date. Each bookends with an index\u2014in which the word astrology is conspicu- ously absent. As a by-product of her work, in 1996 Calapricepublished a book comprising quotes by Einstein on varioustopics (religion, science, politics, etc.). The book, The Quotable Denis Hamel was, until his retirement in October 2006,Programme Assistant at the Scientific, T echnical, and T echnologyMatters Unit at the Secretariat of the Convention on BiologicalDiversity, under the United Nations Environment Programme(UNEP).

I contacted Calaprice and, with her permission, here are some excerpts of her reply: I can't believe that Einstein believed in astrology, and I wasn't aware that he is being quoted on it until I received an e-mailfrom someone about it over a year ago, and now your let-t e r .... M any quotations are attributed to Einstein to give them credence, and one shouldn't believe all of them .... B u t if he were a believer in astrology, I think it would have beenapparent somewhere in his writings or letters, and I've never come across even a mention of the word. Calaprice referred me to a book by Einstein as a possible source for the alleged quote, Cosmic Religion and Other Aphorisms. I read that short book (twice) and of course, therewas no trace of the quote. In fact, in Cosmic Religion Einstein is quoted as saying, \"By furthering logical thought and a logi-cal attitude, science can diminish the amount of superstitionin the world\" (Einstein 1931, p. 98). I was able to tell Calaprice that the word astrology had most likely been used only on one occasion in print by Einstein, andthen it was in order to excuse Kepler for having practicedastrology extensively throughout his life as a means to earn amore decent living. In 1951, Einstein wrote an introduction toCarola Baumgardt's 1951 book, Johannes Kepler: Life andLetters, with an Introduction by Albert Einstein. The last sen-tence of his introduction reads as follows: The reader should note the remarks on astrology. They show that [for Kepler] the inner enemy, conquered and renderedinnocuous, was not yet completely dead. It was then obvious that the other quote so popular in astrological circles could not possibly have been written by Albert Einstein. Shortly after its publication in 2000, I purchased The Expanded Quotable Einstein. It is with some satisfaction that Irealized that Calaprice took into account my communication toher. She created (on page 272) an entry for astrology and repro-duced the real opinion of Einstein on the subject, as the \"innerenemy.\" She also put the false quote that astrologers are so fondof on pages 320-321, in the section \"Attributed to Einstein\"noting it as \"an excellent example of a quotation someone madeup and attributed to Einstein in order to lend an idea credibil-ity. Yet several people have asked me to confirm it.\" From June 2001 onwards, I endeavored to contact more than one hundred Web masters I found posting the false quote ontheir sites either in English, French, or German. Many amongthem did not even reply to my messages. Others did with classicarguments against \"official science\" that cannot explain manyesoteric phenomena, for example citing the HeisenbergUncertainty Principle. A French astrologer even told me the fol-lowing: \"If this sentence is going around the world withEinstein's signature, it is the proof that he at least meant it.\"However, several people showed some open-mindedness, as witha Canadian astrologer posting on her Web site the following: It's time astrologers started being a little more intellectually honest and careful where it comes to arguments we offer insupport of Astrology. I have removed two quotes from myquotation page because I have reasonable doubts that they areaccurate. These two quotes, by Einstein and Newton, areamong the most quoted remarks in support of astrology byrecognized scientists but no-one can tell us where they comefrom. They don't seem to be in any of the historical records ofthese two scientists. I recently received a letter about them thatgoes into great detail on the subject. 3 The Origin of the Hoax A French astrologer removed the false quote from his Web page after having consulted with Andr\u00e9 Barbault, one of themost respected French astrologers. The latter recommended henot use it anymore. In July 2002, I contacted Barbault on thesubject and provided him with the actual opinion of Einsteinon astrology: the \"inner enemy\" of Kepler. Here are his reply: \"Thank you for this convincing documen-tation on Einstein. I always advised people around me againstquoting this sentence as it did not fit Einstein's character.\" Cartoon designed by Louis Dub\u00e9, editor of Qu\u00e9bec Sceptique magazine from a concept by Denis Hamel. French version of the quote and its source, the Huters astrologischer Kalender of 1960 as provided by 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:35 PM Page 4142 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERBarbault kindly provided me with an old, yellowing clipping containing a French translation of the quote. The source pro-vided in the document is the Huters astrologischer Kalender of 1960. By searching on the Web, I found that the Huters is a yearly astrological periodical. Due to this new information, I had to revise my theory on the actual source of the hoax. I obtained a copy of the 1957 to1960 editions of the Huters from a German bookshop. Indeed, the fake quote had appeared on page four of the 1960 edition(released at the end of 1959), but not in pre-vious editions. This new information proves that Hirsig could not have been the source of the original hoax. In his book of 1962, Votre destin par l'astrologie (Your Destiny through Astrology ), Hirsig did quote the great French writerHonor\u00e9 de Balzac on the subject of astrology,using a phrase whose beginning is identical tothe one attributed to Einstein: \"Astrology is a huge science and which did reign over the greatest minds\" (Balzac 2000). It seems he would definitely have included Einstein's quote alongside Balzac'sif he had been the author of the false quote,or even aware that the quote existed. AsBarbault collaborated with Hirsig in the1940s, 4I contacted him to verify his opinion as to whether Hirsig could have been the author of the quote.He replied with the following: \"It looks quite unlikely thatHirsig could have created such a forgery . . . Hirsig was anhonest and sober man. It is most likely that we should incrim-inate a crank astrologer\u2014there are so many among them\u2014Hirsig's responsibility having been to take seriously that personby publishing his/her text.\" I asked a friend whose mother tongue is German to check the language of the Huters' quote to find out if it was proper German (and so likely to have been originally written in German) or a bad translation into German from a foreign lan-guage. She confirmed that the text was indeed in \"goodGerman.\" It is interesting to note that there is only oneGerman version of the quote. However, two versions of theFrench translation exist, and the version mainly disseminatedin esoteric literature is the one used by Hirsig. Relativi-tea Given the evidence I've shown above, it is obvious that the phrase so popular among astrologers is an invention, and one mostlikely put forward by Carl Heinrich Huter. From reading hisyearly almanacs, it's quite clear that he did not work with collab-orators. As I've noted above, Einstein had a negative opinion onastrology, which he characterized as an \"inner enemy\" of Kepler. However, if one absolutely wishes to link Einstein with the world of esotericism and soothsayers, I recommend reading anarticle that Einstein published in 1926 on the \"cause of mean-der formation\" according to Baer's law. It provides a scientificexplanation for the fact that rivers from the northern hemi-sphere tend to dig banks to their right sides, whereas rivers inthe southern hemisphere erode their left sides. To illustrate theforces involved in this process, taking into account the turmoilgenerated in the current with the shape of the rivers, Einsteinused the example of a tea cup stirred with a spoon. \"The rota-tion of the liquid causes a centrifugal force to act on it. But inthe neighborhood of the walls of the cup the liquid isrestrained by friction, so that the angular velocity with whichit rotates is less there than in other places nearer the center. In particular, the angular velocity of rotation,and therefore the centrifugal force, will besmaller near the bottom than higher up.\" 5 This is confirmed by the accumulation in thebottom of the cup . . . of tea leaves!

From Skeptic's Dictionary, Refuge Mass Media Bunk 12 (http://skepdic.com/refuge/bunk12.html) April 18, 2000. I received an e-mail today from Ivan Kelly, renowned expert and critic of astrology, regarding a wide- spread claim among astrologers that Albert Einstein oncewrote: \"Astrology is a science in itself and contains an illumi-nating body of knowledge. It taught me many things and Iam greatly indebted to it.\" Ivan contacted Geoffrey Dean, another renowned expert and critic of astrol- ogy, who wrote the following: Dear Ivan, Re that Einstein quote. This is a good example of astrologers quot- ing each other nth hand, but with nobody ever checking the original quote. In a letter in Correlation June 1991, 11(1):35-36, I chased it back to a book (in French) by the late Swiss-Canadian astrologer Werner Hirsig, Manuel d'as-trologie, where the quote appears in French in the preface, but with no sourcegiven. From there it was quoted by Solange de Mailly Nesle (1981), from whichit was quoted by Tad Mann (1987) and Percy Seymour (1988), and from thereever onwards seemingly without end. The Hirsig book ends with a postscript dated February 1950, so the quota- tion must date from before that time (Einstein died in 1955). Hirsig's widow didnot inherit his papers, so she was unable to check them to see if they gave thesource. Various people including Solange, Percy, and myself have checkedEinstein's writings and biographies but have been unable to verify it, so Solangeand Percy have deleted it from later editions of their books. His biographies con-tain nothing to suggest Einstein had any interest in astrology, and its style dif-fers from that of authentic Einstein sayings. My letter ended \"Accordingly, until the quote is authenticated, it should be ignored lest it add to the blight generated by Newton-Halley, Evangeline Adams,and other famous-but-wrong quotes.\" helps.Regards, at www.astrology.ca/library/jasmine/quotes.html. 4.

SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:35 PM Page 43Biodynamics in the Wine Bottle Is supernaturalism becoming the new worldwide fad in winemaking? Here is an examination of the biodynamic phenomenon, its origins, and its purported efficacy. DOUGLASS SMITH and JES\u00daS BARQU\u00cdN 44 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERSI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:35 PM Page 44SKEPTICAL INQUIRER November / December 2007 45Have you visited a wine store recently? Something strange is afoot. The newfad in the vineyards is a practice called \"biodynamic (BD) farming\": it's big andgetting noticed in the bottle. Newspaper adsnow extol biodynamically grown wine next toorganic wines for sale in stores. T rade andindustry groups organize tastings of exclusivelybiodynamic wines. And dozens of wineriesaround the world have been certified bio-dynamic by the umbrella \"Demeter\" certifica-tion bodies. These include suchas and Fetzer. Indeed,according to the most complete publishedaccount of the practice so far, \"Over 10 percentof France's certified organic vineyard area isnow Biodynamic\" (Waldin 2004, p. 111). In addition, two of the world's most influential wine writers, Robert Parker and Jancis Robinson, have weighed in in favor ofthese wines. 1Although both should be held in the highest regard for their integrity and knowledge of wine, without doubt, nei-ther of them is in any way an expert on the biodynamic move-ment. They have, at times, expressed the desire to remain neu-tral. But, at other times, they show themselves all too ready toaccept its pretensions. Parker, arguably the most powerful and influential wine critic alive today, is a man whose yearly reviews help set theprices of each Bordeaux vintage. In his most recent book, herefers with clear affection to wineries that utilize biodynamicpractices. For example, he extols Catherine and SophieArmenier, owners of a Rh\u00f4ne Domaine, as \"following the astro-logical/homeopathic writings of the famed German professorRudolf Steiner\" (Parker 2005, p. 380). In this context, it is per-haps no surprise that Parker has also publicly declared that he ishimself applying biodynamic methods to part of the Beaux-Fr\u00e8res vineyard in Oregon that he owns along with his brother-in-law. 2 England's Robinson is one of the leading wine essayist of her generation. She is one of the few Masters of Wine in the world,with an armful of publication credits including the Oxford Companion to Wine and the World Atlas of Wine, dozens of awards, and hundreds of articles. She also has published claims that BDworks (Robinson 2005). 3Confronted with a skeptical rejoinder, she responded, \"If producers are happy with, if mystified by, theresults\u2014why not let them continue? Perhaps you could explainwhat harm they do.\" 4 She asks a fair question. To start with, what exactly is biody- namics? It is a method of organic agriculture admixed with someodd extras. These additional methods include taking intoaccount cycles of the moon and relative positions of the zodia-cal constellations when farming, as well as applying differentsorts of homeopathic or esoteric \"preparations\" to the vineyardsoil. These and other similar pretensions are set against a com-plex background cosmogony that makes the whole process notunlike a quasi-religious movement. Steiner's Fancies Biodynamics began with a series of lectures in June of 1924 by the Austrian occult philosopher Rudolf Steiner. Steiner had avitalist vision of the universe in which \"ethereal\" qualities infuseraw matter in order to give it life; this distinguishes living thingsfrom mere amalgamations of chemicals, however complex. Thepotential conflict with modern biochemistry should be clear. Atany rate, he saw his program reintroducing \"spiritual\" elementsinto farming. Indeed, his ideas were to create an entire crank\"Spiritual Science\" that would illuminate the connectionsbetween such spiritual properties as the \"ethereal\" or the \"astral\"and chemical elements like oxygen, sulphur, carbon, and nitro-gen. 5For example, \"the ethereal help of Biodynamic winemaker Nicolas Joly holds a glass of \"Clos de la Coulee de Serrant\" January 17, 2006, as he stands beside a 16th-century wine press inSavennieres in the Anjou region of western France. Joly is seen as thepatron saint of biodynamic winemaking.

Needless to say, no experimentation was done to discover these \"facts.\"Throughout, Steiner used his favored methodology: armchairphilosophizing and guesswork, which in his case he consideredquite literally clairvoyant. His agricultural lectures included a number of concrete sug- gestions for so-called preparations to be added to the field or com-post, many done with one eye on the astrological star-charts.According to the present-day Demeter certification bodies, a farmcan be labeled biodynamic simply by virtue of being organic andadding the preparations in sufficient quantities (Waldin 2004, p.73). Hence, it would be good to return to the original treatise toinvestigate the preparations, and their accompanying justification,to see what they are and why they are prescribed. Steiner's agricultural lectures are, to put it mildly, not an easy read. They are marked by clear falsehoods, digressions, and oddfantasies. He recommends such techniques as combating para-sites \"by means of concentration, or the like\" (Steiner 2004, p.84). He says that certain insect pests are spontaneously createdby \"cosmic influences\" (p. 115) and that eating potatoes \"is oneof the factors that have made men and animals materialistic\" (p.149). He tells us, \"most of our illnesses arise\" when our \"astralbody\" is \"connected more intensely with the physical (or withany one of its organs) than it should normally be\" (pp. 116-17).In contrast, \"in the true sense of the word a plant cannot be dis-eased\"; plants only appear to be diseased when \"Moon-influ-ences in the soil . 117-18). that spanned\"epochs . . . on the earth when such things were known andapplied in the widest sense\" 6(p. 120). And on and on, ad nau- seam. It is good to keep this material in the back of our mindswhen considering his forays into agriculture. Steiner proposes his \"preparations\" in lectures four and five: various small constructions to be added to the field or compostat various times of the year, such as the burial of a cow's hornfilled with manure (now called Preparation 500) or filled withpowdered quartz (Preparation 501), burial of yarrow flowers ina stag's bladder (502), chamomile in a cow's intestine (503), oakbark in the skull of a domestic animal (505), or dandelions in a\"bovine mesentery\" (506) (Steiner 2004, pp. 72-99). Adding the preparations can be a labor-intensive process, especially since some preparations must be done in quantity,depending on the size of one's fields. Farmers may well wonder:why go to all the effort? What sort of justification does Steinerprovide? Let us take the case of Preparation to its influences to a greater distance and throughlarge masses.\" As for why we should put it in a stag's bladder,Steiner gets to the heart of his discussion here: The bladder of the stag is connected . . . with the forces of the Cosmos. Nay, it is almost the image of the Cosmos. We therebygive the yarrow the power quite essentially to enhance the forcesit already possesses, to combine the sulphur with the other sub-stances. (Steiner 2004, p.93) Why the concern about sulphur in particular? We are expected to remember that \"the ethereal moves with the help of sulphuralong paths of oxygen\" and the like. In other words, sulphur isa key ingredient for receipt of ethereal forces. Or so the storygoes. But, at any rate, we don't need to test the reader's patiencewith a complete exegesis to make clear that Steiner has given nojustification whatever for this practice. Indeed, Preparation 502is actually one of the better examples, since many of his othersare simply stated without the slightest attempt at explication orjustification. But it is all of a piece: in the preface to the book ofagricultural lectures, written by one of Steiner's pupils, we findthe surprising claim that \"In 1923 Rudolf Steiner described forthe first time how to make the bio-dynamic compost prepara-tions, simply giving the recipe without any sort of explana-tion\u2014just 'do this and then that'\" (p. 5). Apparently the expla-nations, such as they were, came later. If these \"preparations\" are intended to fertilize the soil, other suggested biodynamic rituals are meant to rid the fields of pestsand diseases. For weeds, insects, and rodent pests Steiner sug-gests the practice now referred to as \"ashing.\" Let us say we havea biodynamic farm and are plagued with field mice. Steinerdirects us to \"catch a fairly young mouse and skin it . . . at a timewhen Venus is in the sign of Scorpio\" (p. 113). Then we are toldto burn the skin and scatter the ash over our fields. Steinerassures us that \"Henceforth, your mice will avoid the field.\"Insects and weeds are treated in similar fashion, except that onedoes not need to skin (shell?) the insect: only \"where there isspinal marrow, you must first skin the animal,\" he sagely tells us(p. 121). Steiner doesn't ever clarify what the spinal marrow hasto do with anything. To rid biodynamic fields of plant diseases such as rot and mildew (or, since Steiner does not believe plants can be diseased,to rid them of his so-called Moon influence), Steiner suggests \"ahomeopathic dose\" of horse tail (equisetum arvense) infusedinto water, diluted, and sprayed over the fields (p. 118). With this list of practices, best described as rituals of a sort of agricultural voodoo, we are at the heart of biodynamics. For although they have been extended a bit by more modern believ-ers, the practices still retain much of the flavor that Steinerintended. We encounter the same esoteric rituals intermixedwith homeopathic dilutions and astrology when 2004, Joly 1999, andThun 2000). Indeed, if anything, biodynamic practices havegotten even more esoteric. Now we can also read about using\"standing stones\" to do \"geo-acupuncture\" in order to \"restorethe cosmo-telluric balance\" of a vineyard, directed by \"a special-ist with the aid of a pendulum\" (Chapoutier 2006). It is perhaps superfluous to go through the arguments con- tradicting the effectiveness of such practices as homeopathy, astrology, or manipulations of esoteric energy fields. They havebeen debunked many times long before now. However, it doesat least bear repeating that homeopathic doses are generallydiluted by water until not a single molecule of the original mate-rial persists in solution. In other words, a \"homeopathic dose\" ismost likely nothing but water. Although originally suggested asa cure for disease, extensive testing has shown that homeopathiccures perform no better than a placebo in humans (Ernst 2002and Shang et al. 2005). And, while water may be of some obviousSI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:36 PM Page 46SKEPTICAL INQUIRER November / December 2007 47benefit to plants, it is unlikely to provide much of a cure for rot and mildew, Moon influence or no. Research Findings In reviewing the founding documents of biodynamics, one is not particularly reassured as to its bona fides. Biodynamics wasnot developed from any sort of trial-and-error experimentationor expert guidance. Indeed, the theory is barely comprehensible,relying as it does on a variety of strange, clearly false, and anti-scientific claims. However, even so, the practice might work.The only way to know for sure is to do the actual research.Fortunately, such research has been carried out at a number ofuniversities and laboratories around the world. Unfortunately,much of it is sloppily done, and published in not particularlywell-regarded or even peer-reviewed journals. Also unfortunately, many of the studies contrast biodynamic agricultural practices with standard, nonorganic agriculture. Theygo on to show that biodynamic agriculture does better than stan-dard agriculture on some measures of soil fertility or biodiversity.These experiments prove nothing, since, as we have already seen,biodynamic agriculture must at least be organic. And it is uncon-troversial that organic agriculture (shunning powerful artificialfungicides, pesticides, and herbicides) yields higher soil fertilityand biodiversity than conventional agriculture. 7What we need is a clear comparison of biodynamic and organic agriculture. Such a test was carried out by a Swiss group, in one of the most famous biodynamic studies ever performed (M\u00e4der et al.2002). This was a twenty-one-year study in which biodynamicagriculture appeared to edge out even organic agriculture on asmall number of measures of soil fertility and biodiversity.However, the study was not without its problems: buried in thesupplementary material\u2014available online but not in the paperitself\u2014are a number of caveats. Certain chemical treatmentswere added to the organic farms that were not added to the bio-dynamic ones. And these were only the \"main differences.\" Wearen't told what the other differences might have been. So thetest appears to have been poorly designed. It does not provide uswith any principled answer as to whether the biodynamic treat-ments were truly effective, or, rather, whether the chemical addi-tives (or something else that wasn't deemed a \"main difference\")caused the organic plots to perform somewhat more poorly. Thearticle was also criticized by one University of California atDavis microbiologist because it \"looks at an 'incredibly narrow'range of ecological niches,\" raising the question of whether theywere cherry-picked to yield the desired result (Stokstad 2002). Lynne Carpenter-Boggs and her thesis advisor, John Reganold, both at Washington State University, have done whatis perhaps the most highly regarded scientific work on biody-namics. Reganold is a sometime biodynamic consultant to theCalifornia wine industry as well as a researcher on the subject.However, even he and his former student have been unable tounearth any real differences between organic and biodynamicpractices. Indeed, Carpenter-Boggs has researched precisely thequestion of whether composts with biodynamic preparationsimprove soils to which they are added. The results? \"No differ-ences were found between soils fertilized with biodynamic vs.nonbiodynamic compost\" (Carpenter-Boggs 2000). 8Reganold has said 2003 interview: research \"didn't distin-guish biodynamic from organic\" (Darlington 2003). It couldhardly be clearer. A six-year study from the Washington State lab in 2005 was the first published in a peer-reviewed journal comparing biody-namic and organic agriculture with respect to wine grapes in par-ticular. They found nothing. \"No consistent significant differ-ences were found between the biodynamically treated anduntreated plots for any of the physical, chemical, or biologicalparameters tested\" (Reeve et al. 2005, p. 371). Further, when theylooked at the grape vines, \"Analysis of leaves showed no differ-ences between treatments .... There were no differences in yield, cluster count, cluster weight, and berry weight\" (p. 373). 9So, careful research demonstrates that the labor-intensive biodynamic\"preparations\" are simply ineffective. Yet, according to the biody-namic certification body itself, they are the heart of the practice. One may well ask whether a properly controlled test has been done to compare biodynamic versus nonbiodynamic winesthemselves. However, it will not suffice to simply pull bottles offthe shelf of each sort and put them into a lineup. There are toomany variables between different finished wines. Even neigh-boring wineries may have quite different soil and subsoil, differ-ent microclimates, and use different farming techniques in thevineyards such as vine training, leaf pulling, and so on. Differentwinemakers will also tend to use different techniques to processtheir grapes into wine and store them in different manners, forexample in different kinds of barrels or stainless steel, and so on.As a result, any such test would have to be done very carefully,being sure that the soils, grapes, and wines tested were equiva-lent in all other controllable respects except for the additionalbiodynamic preparations and techniques. This would, out ofnecessity, consist of a test between wines produced from organ-ically farmed grapes. What Harm? To return to the question posed earlier\u2014what harm does it do if a farmer or winemaker follows such practices? The easy answeris that it is a waste of time, money, and effort. Indeed, one rea-son that biodynamics has caught on in the wine industry, andWhat harm does it do if a farmer or winemaker follows such practices? The easy answer is that it is a waste of time, money, and effort.SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:37 PM Page 4748 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERpractically nowhere else, is that wine is perhaps the agricultural product with the largest sales markup. Most agricultural prod-ucts are commodities that roughly sell at their price of produc-tion. However, if a winemaker can convince the public that thewine he or she makes is some of the best stuff out there, he orshe can charge upwards of $50 or $100 for a bottle of what is,in essence, fermented grape juice. Such a markup can pay for theonerous biodynamic overhead of labor, assuming that the mar-keting is done properly. But, still and all, it appears to be wastedeffort, and those who persist in it appear more and more as NewAge acolytes. That said, our critical attitude toward the esoteric aspects of biodynamics does not interfere with our appreciation of manyof its wines. Many biodynamic winemakers are indeed talented.The problem resides in the extension of disbelief in empiri-cal technique, and in substituting for it beliefs in unscientificpractices like astrology and homeopathy, as well as voodoo-stylerituals and even \"geo-acupuncture.\" We must confront thisproblem, not just as wine lovers and wine writers, but also as cit-izens who do not wish to live in, nor present to our children, asociety in which pseudoscience and esoteric fantasies are consid-ered reality. Irrational thinking, or reliance on mystical guruswith claims of clairvoyant intuition, does great harm to society.The best research studies to date have not found any distinctionbetween biodynamics and the organic agriculture of which it isa part. The esoterica, it seems, add nothing. And we, as sup-porters of clarity and rationalism, are dismayed by the discon-nect between belief and research. Our hope is that one day,under the clear light of understanding, better-grounded wine-makers will dispense with biodynamics for good. Let us raise aglass to reason, and to that day.

A similar rejoinder was made by Robert Carroll of the Skeptic's Dictionary when asked for help in con- fronting biodynamic practices, on May 2, 2000. See http://skepdic.com/com-ments/mooncom.html: \"Frankly, if they make good wine, I don't care if they useastrology or consult James Van Praagh for advice.\" 5. Steiner's attempts at creating a \"Spiritual Science\" should remind some of us of the excesses displayed in the recent intelligent design (ID) controversy. E.g., \"It is ID's project to change the ground rules of science to include thesupernatural\" (Kitzmiller 2005:30).6. Steiner actually constructed an entire historical fantasy of early humanity, including the so-called Atlantean and Lemurian races, and an account of thedivision into the sexes. (According to Steiner, humanity began as a sexlessspecies.) Material from this history was supposedly secret and channeled \"on thebasis of direct spiritual perception\" which he considered more reliable than \"his-torical documentation\" or \"external evidence\" (Steiner 1959). See, e.g.,http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA011/CM/GA011_c02.html. 7. There is also a side issue as to whether it is possible for a conventional farm to use artificial treatments judiciously enough that it could be indistin-guishable from organic on all the same measures. 8. Carpenter-Boggs also wrote: \"These data support earlier findings that organic fertilization rapidly benefits microbial biomass and activity, but providefew indications that the biodynamic compost and field sprays [that is, the'preparations'] further affect soil microbial mass, community structure, or activ-ity in the long term.\" 9. Their group actually went to some trouble to find variables in which the bio- dynamic grapes came out ahead. For example, they claimed to find evidence thatthe nonbiodynamic grapes were \"overcropped\" (producing too much fruit). Theirchoice of citation for this data is a highly questionable and nonpeer-reviewed Webpage; other peer-reviewed documents fail to support their contention that a yield topruning weight of 5:1 to 6:1 is appropriate. (See, e.g., Moulton et al. 2005, p. 11.)At any rate, they do in the final analysis conclude that \"The differences observedwere small and of doubtful practical significance\" (Reeve et al., 2005:374).

HARRIET HALLSI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:37 PM Page 4950 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERThe folks in my community have been arguing about fluoride again. A nutri-tionist wrote in the local newspaper that fluoride is a deadly poison and that itdoesn't reduce tooth decay. She recommendedavoiding it entirely, even to the extent of buy-ing nonfluoride toothpaste. I responded witha calmly reasoned guest column trying to sep-arate the scientific facts from policies andopinions. The scientific facts are not open todebate: fluoride in optimum amounts reducestooth decay; too much fluoride can be harm-ful. The public policy question is open toopinion and debate: should we add fluoride tothe water or protect our children from toothdecay by other means? I know that at least one person read my guest column, because there was a letter to the editor in the following issue ofthe paper. It was written by a very confused woman whosigned herself \"Reverend.\" She disregarded my argumentsabout the effectiveness of fluoride and the advisability of sep-arating facts from opinions, and she fixated on one thing: heropinion that adding anything to our water is wrong. She's cer-tainly welcome to her opinion, but she based that opinion onpseudoscientific nonsense that she confused with scientifictruth. She wrote: I am saddened that Harriet Hall is not aware of the latest sci- entific research by Dr. Masaru Emoto. In his two books, TheTrue Power of Water and The Hidden Power of Water he describes the healing capabilities of non-toxic water (chemicalfree). Our country is too toxic from pollution, food, thoughtsand water we drink.... I suggest people go to Dr. Emoto's lec-ture . . . and see the slides of microscope samples of the toxic,repulsive water crystals compared to those of pure untaintedwater. Or, see the movie What the Bleep Do We Know now on DVD, which shows slides of the difference in their molecularstructure. Which would you want to drink? I wrote back that she was wrong that I wasn't aware of Dr. Emoto's \"research.\" His newest book, Hidden Messages in Water holds a place of honor on my bookshelves as the worst book I have ever read. It is about as scientific as Alice in Wonderland. Emoto took pic- tures of snowflakes and \"observed\" that clean water made pret-tier crystals.A [real] scientist would have checked to see if he got the same results if he didn't know beforehand which water wasclean. Emoto never bothered with even this most elementarydouble-check. He didn't consult real scientists. Had he doneso, they could have told him that these snowflake crystals, justlike raindrops, form around a core of dust, so actually thecleaner water is less likely to form them. Their beauty varieswith the temperature and conditions of formation, not withthe purity of the water. The idea that snowflakes could showanything about differences in the \"molecular structure\" ofwater is incompatible with basic physics. Emoto's popularity is a sad commentary on the scientific illiteracy of our society. His work is a morass of factual errors,misconceptions, misinterpretations, metaphors, and meaning-less assertions. He writes in the language of magical thinkingand superstition, not of science. Most serious scientists find Emoto's delusions too silly to even acknowledge, but one retired chemistry professor has taken thetime to debunk water cluster pseudoscience and Emoto's\"research\" on his Web site: www.chem1.com/CQ/clusqk.html. I didn't mention that I saw the What the Bleep movie and didn't find it particularly convincing as a scientific document. Its credits list the 35,000-year-old warrior Ramtha \"as channeledby J.Z. Knight.\" Remember talking to plants? Emoto talks to water. He claims that if you say nice things, the water makes pretty crys-tals, and if you say mean things, it just makes amorphousglobs. You don't even have to talk out loud, because water canread. Humans have to be taught to read, but water issmarter\u2014it already knows how. If you place labels with\"Thank you\" or \"You idiot!\" on containers of water, the waterwill respond by making pretty or ugly snowflakes. Water can not only read, it can look at pictures: a picture of a tree resulted in \"a large crystal that seems to be teemingwith life,\" while a picture of autumn leaves created a \"crystalthat appears to be formed by leaves before they have fallenfrom the trees.\" The one I liked best was a crystal from waterexposed to the word \"war\" two months before September 11,2001. He says it looks \"almost as if a jet plane crashed into it.\" Emoto talks to plants too. The What the Bleep movie describes an experiment where cooked rice rotted faster if labeled with neg- ative words. Most experiments are published somewhere. Ilooked for this one in vain. I finally realized that he was onlyreporting what children had done informally in a private homeand reported to him by mail. He \"verified\" the findings by sug-gesting to other devotees that they try the same experiment, andsome of them reported that it worked for them, too. A real scientist would ask questions such as: How many people tried the experiment, failed, and didn't report to him? Were the rice samples kept under exactly the same conditions?Did the experimenters treat the samples with \"good\" wordsany differently, for instance by picking them up more often tocheck them, or breathing on them? Did anyone try it withdouble blinding so the observers wouldn't be aware of whichsamples had which labels? Was an endpoint predetermined, ordid the observers just subjectively decide which rotted faster?Was any statistical analysis done to rule out \"noise\" and theeffects of chance? Emoto doesn't ask such questions; he justmarvels about the reports. Harriet Hall, also known as the SkepDoc, is a retired physician who lives in Puyallup, Washington, and writes about alternativemedicine and pseudoscience. This is her sixth article for theS KEPTICAL INQUIRER . Her e-mail is harriet.hall@comcast.net.SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:37 PM Page 50SKEPTICAL INQUIRER November / December 2007 51In another example, he unquestioningly accepted the results of an experiment with a sample size of only two. A girl grew two sunflower plants, one labeled \"fool,\" whose growthwas stunted, and one not labeled. Emoto would like us tobelieve that obviously the stunted plant was reading the label,because otherwise there's no conceivable reason why one plantmight grow better than another. Water likes to listen to music, too: when one sample lis- tened to \"a mournful melody,\" it supposedly formed differentcrystals than water exposed to a song by the musician Enya.The Enya water produced a crystal that was \"pure, innocent,and white, just like her voice.\" Allsnowflakes are white, and voices aren't white\u2014unless you suffer from synesthesia. Andhow could you possibly determine the \"innocence\" of a crys-tal? He sees things in crystals like \"a brilliant healing effect\"and \"overflowing love.\" He has a great imagination, but anindependent observer would have a hard time matching thephotos to his descriptions. He has what he calls a \"hado\" machine. According to Emoto, everything emits hado. He tests patients with his hadomachine, and if they are too ill to leave their bed, he prints outthe person's name and tests the printed slip or their photo-graph. Then he infuses water with hado to counteract their ill-ness. He brilliantly rehashes the unfounded claims of \"energymedicine\" and employs a new version of the quack electrodi-agnostic machines that have been fooling patients for decades. He explains how everything in the universe vibrates, and his machine detects those vibrations. He knows a doctor who col-lected blood samples from patients, kept them for years, and wasable to diagnose the patients' current illnesses because the vibra-tions in the old blood samples changed as the condition of theirbodies changed. He knows of people who can sense from thevibrations of a photograph whether the person is alive or dead.He fails to explain, however, why these talented people have notapplied for (and won) James Randi's million dollar challenge. Apparently Emoto has been challenged for not being scien- tific, so in one of his latest books, The Secret Life of Water, he admits, \"Photographing crystals is a subjective science.\" Didyou know there was such a thing as a subjective science? Hesays, \"The methods employed to photograph water crystalsmight not pass everyone's definition of being scientific, andthere is a degree of uncertainty involved. In fact, there is muchabout the world of hado that is murky and that cannot beexplained by the black-and-white standards of statistical analy-sis. But when you think about it, all any scientist can do any-way is lift up one small corner of the veil that covers the truthof this world and then try to express it with words that thegeneral population can stretch their minds around.\" He com-pares the uncertainty of subjectively choosing when to snapthe pictures of snowflakes to that of Heisenberg's uncertaintyprinciple in quantum mechanics. He thinks that \"water changesits form completely depending on the person doing theobserving\" and whether the observer's heart is filled with ap-preciation or anger. He classifies the crystals into eight ill-defined categories that he apparently made up. In his analysis of crystals fromwater from the Honmyo River, he found In this case, he chose a beautiful crystal to represent the sam- ple, because although there were only two beautiful crystalsout of fifty, there were others that were in the process or hadthe potential to make beautiful crystals. Eminently rational,don't you think? By this kind of reasoning, if an antibiotic onlycured two cases of pneumonia out of fifty, we could give itcredit for being in the process or having the potential to cure other cases. The drug companies would love that. He says tap water with chlorine doesn't usually form crys- tals, but when Emoto had five hundred people pray for a jar oftap water on his desk, he claims it formed beautiful crystals.He would have us believe that prayer and feelings of love workinstantaneously at any distance, that water has ESP and cantell which feelings are directed to it, and that prayer changesthe appearance of the crystals. Of course, he admits that the crystals are constantly changing anyway, and he has toarbitrarily choose a point to photograph them.

It was analleged close encounter followed byamnesia, \"missing time,\" and frighten-ing dreams. the by a psychiatristusing hypnosis. Under hypnosis, bothHills told a harrowing tale of abductionand medical examination on board anextraterrestrial craft. Captured! is the second major book published about the Hill case this year,which itself is rather surprising. The firstvolume was Encounters at Indian Head,the proceedings of a once-secret sympo-sium held in 2000, in which I partici-pated (see my report, SI, September/October 2007). Kathy Marden is BettyHill's niece and now the executor of herestate. What is more surprising is thatStanton Friedman, known throughoutthe UFO community for his querulousbombast and immense ego is, despitebeing given top billing on the cover, infact the junior author. The book'sLibrary of Congress entry lists Marden asthe primary author. Friedman writes inthe preface, \"I was especially pleased thatKathy Marden invited me to help outsome on this book.\" That is no doubtthe reason the book is of relatively tem-perate tone (except for the chapter onskeptics, which carries Friedman's finger-prints). Marden at least attempts to dealwith the arguments of skeptics and othercritics, even if many of the answers shegives do not convince. She admits to theexistence of certain inconsistencies anddifficulties in the story, issues that neverseem to have troubled Friedman. The book's primary strength is the wealth of new details about Betty andBarney Hill from several sources: Betty'spreviously unpublished diary and corre-spondence, additional quotes from thetapes of the Hills under hypnosis by Dr.Benjamin Simon, plus interviews givingher friends' and family's memories ofwhat transpired, including Kathy's own.Because of this, we see a much richerpicture of the Hills than previouslyavailable. Our knowledge of Barneyespecially is fleshed out. We learn thatprior to undergoing hypnosis, whileBarney was recounting his alleged alienencounter, his face \"kept twitching spas-modically to one side.\" The picture ofBarney that emerges is that of a manunder enormous pressure: \"The longdaily commute to his job in Boston, thenecessity of sleeping during daylighthours, his physical separation from hissons,\" not to mention the social stigmaof a black man in an almost all-whitestate married to a white woman. All ofthis took a toll on his health. Is thisinformation relevant to an analysis ofBarney's claimed extraterrestrial experi-ences? Absolutely, but what exactly doesit enable us to conclude? If only the lawsgoverning human behavior were as pre-dictable as those of chemistry or physics! One major problem in telling the story of the Hills' adventure is that Mardenfreely mingles the Hills' original accountwith details later supposedly \"recovered\"by hypnosis. This makes the case soundfar stronger than it actually was. For amore careful recounting of the Hill storyin its proper sequence, see Dennis Stacy'spaper in the Encounters volume. One surprise disclosed in the book is \"The Dress Analysis.\" In a chapter thatbrings to mind the Bill Clinton investi-gations, Marden reveals that Betty, upon Over the Hill on UFO Abductions ROBERT SHEAFFER Captured!

Thelining and zipper are torn, supposedlyconfirming her account of the aliensforcibly removing it from her, although anumber of earthly explanations alsocome to mind. After a hypnosis sessionin 1964, she retrieved the dress from thecloset and found it covered with a pink,powdery substance. The substance blewaway, but \"the dress was badly stained.\"Samples from the dress were sent to var-ious labs for testing. Several tests unsuc-cessfully attempted were made to try toreplicate the stain using various chemi-cals, which is supposed to convince usthat the discoloration is extraterrestrial inorigin, although acid produced a similarstain of a different color. Also detectedwere \"substances with detergent-typeproperties (not soap).\" The most inter-esting analyses were conducted by thePinelandia Biophysics Laboratory ofMichigan, which specializes in the analy-sis of crop circles. They found that thestained portions of Betty's dress would\"induce a higher degree of energy in thewater\" than the unstained ones. Nomention is made of just what kind of\"energy\" is being talked about. Mardenconcludes that the results \"seem to pointto the presence of an anomalous biolog-ical substance that has permanentlyaltered the substance of Betty's dress.\" Iwould expect that an item of clothingleft undisturbed in a closet for forty yearswould pick up all manner of interestingbiological substances from insects, spi-ders, mites, mold, bacteria, etc. Once again, the \"star map\" Betty Hill allegedly saw on board the UFO is trot-ted out as \"proof\" of the story. Selectingsun-like stars from the latest catalog ofnearby stars, Marjorie Fish spent manylong hours looking for a pattern thatmatches the sketch Betty Hill drew byposthypnotic suggestion, supposedlyreplicating a map she had seen aboardthe saucer. After much effort, shebelieved she had found one. The contro-versy over the star map is so complexthat it is impossible to cover in detailhere. The detailed counter-argument isin my paper in the Encounters volume, arguments routinely ignored by Fried-man, Marden, and all other pro-star-map writers. In brief, it is necessary to\"fudge\" the data to make the Fish mapcome out the way it does. One \"favor-able\" star needs to be excluded, and two\"almost favorable\" stars selectively in-cluded, for Fish's purpose. My conclu-sion was, \"The apparent validity of theFish map is due to selective inclusion ofdata and by misdrawing the map tomake it appear to match Betty Hill'ssketch.\" Perhaps the simplest and mosttelling argument against the Fish mapwas made by astronomers Steven Soterand Carl Sagan back in 1975, whopointed out that the apparent resem-blance between the two patterns existsalmost entirely because of the way thelines are drawn connecting the dots.View the two patterns as unconnecteddots, and they appear as different as twopatterns can be. Another problem for the star map believers, for the most part ignored, isthat the supposed \"match\" of MarjorieFish is not unique. To date, there havebeen at least four other supposed identi-fications of the pattern. One is by BettyHill herself, depicting the constellationPegasus. A second is by Charles Atter-berg depicting nearby stars, but differ-ent ones than Fish uses. A third is bytwo German UFOlogists, who attemptto match it up with our solar system'smajor and minor planets. A fourth is byYari Danjo, who finds the aliens' homestar system to be Alpha Centauri.Marden dismisses Betty's Pegasus map as\"only a coincidence\" and dismissesAtterberg's as lacking \"the solidbasis found by Fish.\" Actually, Atter-berg's pattern is much closer to Betty'ssketch than the Fish pattern, andaccounts for a greater number of stars.The lesson of the star map? Given analmost unlimited number of degrees offreedom in selecting what you willinclude in your search, what scale youwill use, and what vantage point youwill take, it is to be expected that quite anumber of apparent matches to Betty'spattern can be found if one is willing toexpend enough effort to do so. The most contentious chapter of the book is titled \"Disbelievers and Disin-formants.\" UFOlogists are convincedthat anyone questioning their claims islikely paid to spread disinformation. Weare told that the late astronomer andskeptic Donald H. Menzel of Harvardwas \"probably a member of the Majestic12 Group controlling classified UFOresearch\" (a supposed group whose exis-tence is \"revealed\" in some documentsof unknown origin that are almost cer-tainly hoaxes). We are informed that\"the Hill case in general, and the starmap work in particular, have beenattacked, sometimes viciously and al-most always irrationally, by the smallgroup of nasty, noisy, negativists makingup the UFO debunker community.\"This sort of rhetoric is commonplacewithin the UFO community (in addi-tion to being Betty Hill's niece, Mardenis a longtime MUFON official)\u2014thosepromoting that the claims of extraterres-trial contact and abduction are \"scien-tific\" while those trying to refute themare \"irrational.\" She accuses skeptics ofresisting the UFO evidence for the samereason that the Church resisted Copern-icus: it would upset their rigid, precon-ceived worldview. Objections based onthe impossibility of faster-than-lighttravel are refuted by pointing out that ifyou are traveling at 99.99 percent of thespeed of light, you could reach ZetaReticuli in just six months of elapsedtime on a craft.

Barney Hill did not live long enough to become a widely known personality inthe UFO subculture. He died suddenlyof a stroke in 1969 at the age of onlyforty-six. Thus, it is difficult to make an SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:38 PM Page 5354 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERBOOK REVIEWS independent assessment of his credibil- ity. Betty Hill, however, lived to a ripeold age and became one of the best-known figures in the UFO community, aconstant fixture on TV shows, at UFOconferences, etc. Whatever credibility shemay have once had soon perished by herown hand. I was present at the NationalUFO Conference in New York City in1980, at which Betty presented some ofthe UFO photos she had taken. Sheshowed what must have been well overtwo hundred slides, mostly of blips,blurs, and blobs against a dark back-ground. These were supposed to beUFOs coming in close, chasing her car,landing, etc. Marden includes several ofthese photos in the book. After her talkhad exceeded about twice its allottedtime, Betty was literally jeered off thestage by what had been at first a verysympathetic audience. This incident,witnessed by many of UFOlogy's leadersand top activists, removed any lingeringdoubts about Betty's credibility\u2014shehad In the oft-repeated words ofone UFOlogist who accompanied Bettyon a UFO vigil in 1977, she was \"unableto distinguish between a landed UFOand a streetlight.\" In 1995, Betty Hillwrote a self-published book, A CommonSense Approach to UFOs. It is filled with obviously delusional stories, such as see-ing entire squadrons of UFOs in flightand a truck levitating above the freeway. Marden attempts to deal with the credibility problem in her final chapter,\"Betty Hill's Fall From Grace.\" Sheexplains, \"After Barney's death, from careful, objective eval-uation, and with subjective enthusiasmbegan to identify any lights in the sky asUFOs.\" However, the newly publishedmaterial in Captured! suffices to refute this excuse. Betty Hill wrote in a letterdated April 4, 1966: \"Barney and I goout frequently at night for one reason oranother. Since last October, we have seenour 'friends' on the average of eight ornine times out of every ten trips, outsideof Portsmouth.... Last Saturday Barney and I decided to retrace our trip in theWhite Mountains, as of September 1961,but this time my parents were with us. Aswe were returning through the FranconiaNotch in the general area of the tramwayand Cannon Mountain, one [UFO]moved around the mountain about fiftyfeet from the ground, in front of us. Itslights dimmed out and we could see therow of windows before it became invisi-ble.\" This latter sighting, which wouldhave been April 2, 1966, sounds verymuch like the reported pre-abductionclose encounter of 1961: a UFO withlights and a row of windows flying at lowaltitude in front of their car and goingbehind the White Mountains. Thebelievers in the Hills' account must some-how argue that Betty and Barney'sreported multiple UFO encounters in1965 and 1966 are delusional and shouldbe quietly dismissed, while the first onein 1961 must be taken with deadly seri-ousness. Occam's razor would have usconclude that all of Betty Hill's reportedUFO encounters, with or withoutBarney present, are equally delusional. One factor to keep in mind is that we know today far better than we did in the1960s, that supposed \"repressed memo-ries\" recovered via hypnosis are ex-tremely unreliable. In the absence of anyreal physical evidence, the case forbelieving the Hill abduction story ulti-mately rests on the credibility of the wit-nesses, and on the credibility of the hyp-nosis-recovered memories. Neither in-spires confidence. For those of us who have longbelieved that our voting and ourpolitical attitudes are primarily emotionally driven, Drew Westen, a pro-fessor of psychology and psychiatry andlead investigator of a team of neuroscien-tists, provides strong support in The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion inDeciding the Fate of the Nation. His cen-tral thesis is that the predominant viewof the mind since the eighteenth century,that it is dispassionate and \"makes deci-sions by weighing the evidence and reason-ing to the most valid conclusions\" (p. ix),is false. When facing political ques-tions, issues, and candidates, our emo-tions rule. Furthermore, these emotionalprocesses are the result of neurologicalprocesses of which we are unaware; theyare inaccessible to consciousness. Part 1 is devoted to a brief descrip- tion of the relevant structures and func- tions of the brain when engaged withpolitical matters. Part 2 describes waysin which our emotional brains deter-mine how we respond when dealingwith particular political issues. Throughout, Westen provides exam- ples of campaign practices that have been effective or ineffective because theywere or were not congruent with ouremotion-driven political behavior. Forthe last three decades, with the exceptionof the Clinton era, Democratic presi-dential candidates have been unsuccess-ful because they and their strategistshave believed in a view of the mind asbeing dispassionate and, therefore, that Governed By Emotion PETER LAMAL The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.

A com-parison between an effective 1992Clinton television ad versus a 2004Kerry ad is used to illustrate this. Current models of decision making, based on rational-decision theories thatfocus on individuals weighing costs andbenefits of options they face as theyattempt to maximize their expected util-ity, are not relevant to voters' behavior.But much of contemporary Democraticcampaign strategy is based on rational-decision theory. Republican strategists,in contrast, have been very successful intriggering voters' emotions that causethem to vote for Republicans. Our \"emotional agendas\" (p. 96) determine what evidence we find per-suasive, the data we readily accept orreject, and the sources of informationwe find credible, including newspapers,magazines, and television programs.Importantly, members of government atall levels, not just the general public,also have emotional agendas. Westen maintains, for example, that the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority in the dis-puted Bush/Gore 2000 presidentialelection indicated that those justiceslacked awareness of the self-deceptionand rationalization that is true of all ofus. We are not totally unable to beswayed by cognitive factors. But, whenwe make judgments about emotionallysignificant political matters, the effectsof cognitive factors are trivial. Our emo-tional reactions far outweigh them.Thus, these reactions often cause votersto vote against their self-interests. The overriding importance of emo- tions in determining voting patterns means, says Westen, that managing theelectorate's positive and negative feelingsshould be the primary goal of politicalcampaigns. He describes four principlesfor successfully managing voters' emo-tions. For example, messages should be\"framed\" so that they elicit the right con-notations and prevent acceptance of theother party's framing of an issue. Researchsuggests that success in eliciting positiveemotions among voters is the best predic-tor of a campaign's success. \"The datafrom political science are crystal clear:people vote for the candidate who elicitsthe right feelings, not the candidate whopresents the best arguments\" (p. 125). Other topics include discussion of five myths about negative campaigns,how to respond to campaigns designedto arouse hate and fear, and addressingmatters of values, morality, and faith. Some readers might discount what Westen has to say because he makes itclear that he is a strongly committedDemocrat. But one's political allegiancehas no necessary connection with one'sscientific endeavors, and Westen's descrip-tion of aspects of cognitive psychologyand neuroscience indicate no coloring ofhis consideration of those matters by hispolitical convictions. Westen providesexamples of campaign messages that hebelieves would be effective in stimulatingpositive and negative emotions and alsothose that would be effective in counter-ing political attacks. The types of mes-sages would be effective if used by eitherDemocrats or Republicans. Indeed, thisbook could serve as a handbook for thoseof any political persuasion who want toinfluence the electorate. On the negative side, Westen fre- quently uses the term mind, a term car- rying dualistic conceptual baggage.When will scientists have the courage todiscontinue using the term and explainwhy they dropped it? But there is a more fundamental issue concerning cognitive psychology andneuroscience. William R. Uttal has raisedserious questions about the assumptionsunderlying these disciplines, their con-ceptual foundations, their methods, andwhether psychology is, or can be, a sci-ence (e.g., Psychomythics , 2003; The Immeasurable Mind , 2007). Reading both Westen and Uttal may very wellelicit an emotional response. In many cases, the writings of H.L.Mencken are less examples of jour-nalism than they are master classes in the art of crafting an insult. Menckenwas one of the great scourges ofAmerican Christian fundamentalists,calling them \"Homo boobiens ,\" and wrote bluntly that a person was a \"fun-damentalist for the precise reason he isuneducable [sic] .... [And] no amount of proof of the falsity of their beliefs willhave the slightest influence on them.\"One of the centerpieces of H.L.Mencken's considerable body of work ishis series of dispatches from the Scopes\"Monkey T rial\" as published in theBaltimore Evening Sun in 1925. They areperfect examples of his slashing rhetoricand merciless assaults on ignorance andcant, and are still wickedly fun to readmore than eighty years after their origi-nal publication.

The book begins with a loose and often rambling journey through theevents that led to the trial in late 2005. Adecision by the Dover, Pennsylvania,Board of Education to purchase the cre-ationist/intelligent design book Of Pan-das and People to replace its aging biology textbook for use in ninth-grade scienceclasses was met with strong resistance bytwo of its members and a group of elevenparents who united to sue with the assis-tance of the American Civil LibertiesUnion. As the case progressed, moreinterested parties became attached to thecase, and it grew to become, like theScopes trial, a flashpoint for argument, acause c\u00e9l` ebre, a media event across the globe, and yet another referendum on theseparation of church and state. The three rings of this circus were filled with dozens of colorful performers,all of whom are profiled with an eye fortelling detail (although that detail is toooften a label as \"eccentric\") and a largedose of compassion. Indeed, Chapmanoften comments about how likable thepeople he encounters are, even thoughone would think he would dislike them.Leading this category is former boardmember Bill Buckingham, a retiredpolice and corrections officer who is themost pugnacious and belligerent of thebunch. He defiantly shouted during oneof the board discussions over the text-book controversy, \"T wo thousand yearsago, someone died on a cross. Can'tsomeone take a stand for him?\" That hiscurriculum decisions and commentswere made while addicted to OxyContinis not glossed over by Chapman. Butwhen he interviews Buckingham duringthe trial, almost two years after his out-rageous behavior that precipitated theconflict, he finds a broken-down manwho has experienced the deaths of manyfamily members, had two stints in detox,and contemplated suicide. Chapman does not have trouble find- ing compassion for Buckingham butcannot find it in himself to have it forthe other board members, and in a chap-ter titled \"Bonsell and His T rinity ofLoyal Women,\" he gets in touch with hisinner Mencken. He finds a particulardistaste for one of the female boardmembers whom he describes as a\"woman who seemed to think\u2014againstall evidence\u2014that everything she didand said was astoundingly adorable andfunny\" and who \"fell squarely into therepellent category without mitigation.\"Even the normally evenhanded JudgeJones became exasperated with herinability to answer questions clearly andstopped her from leaving the witnessstand after questioning by attorneys inan attempt to clarify her opaque answers. As the book progresses to the trial stage, its focus sharpens considerably, asdoes Chapman's observations of the pro-ceedings. His detailing of the slow andsteady demolition of Michael Behe'scredibility as a scientist at the hands ofthe plaintiff's lawyers, including theuncovering of documentation that indi-cates that his \"landmark\" theory of irre-ducible complexity was plagiarized froman article in the June 1994 issue of theCreation Research Society Quarterly writ- ten by Dr. Dick Bliss, is to be savored. In some ways, Chapman is the polar opposite of Mencken: he is empatheticwhere Mencken is condemning, inquis-itive where Mencken is barbed. His sen-sitivity, however, does not mean thatthe considerable dishonesty of thedefendants and the damage done bytheir actions are slighted. The conclud-ing chapter of the book effectivelybraids together the many threads ofobservation made by Chapman aboutthe grave dangers of fundamentalismand irrationality. While not as scholarly as Edward Humes's recent Monkey Girl: Evolution,Education, Religion, and the Battle forAmerica's Soul , Chapman's book focuses on the human story behind the trial andsucceeds at illuminating the emotionaland ideological underpinnings of thislegal and political event. Reading thesetwo books along with Judge Jones's mas-terfully written decision in the case pro-vides a wide-ranging and thorough viewof this generation's own Scopes trial.

In Death by Black Hole, Tysonexplores everything from Goldilocks toGod, highlighting the origin of stars andthe life that, now and again, arises fromtheir violent demise. Hundreds of light-years deep, an interstellar gas cloud circles an ordinary galaxy's heart, patiently awaiting itsopportunity to collapse and conceive astar. Ironically, the cloud must first coolto less than one hundred degrees aboveabsolute zero in order to craft a star withthe ten-million-degree core required forthermonuclear fusion. Only then canotherwise unruly atoms collide andadhere to fashion large, carbon-basedmolecules that, at some point, might seedthe universe with the building blocks ofplanets, people, and perhaps much more. That supernovas are primarily re- sponsible for the universe's varied collec-tion and relative mix of heavy elements isthe most under-appreciated discovery ofthe twentieth century, writes Tyson.Rare, high-mass stars, through tradi-tional thermonuclear fusion and neutroncapture, manufacture not only the ele-ments common to life as we know it\u2014hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and car-bon\u2014but much weightier things as well.Fusion demands higher and higher tem-peratures as the elements grow heavier.Energy is released at nearly every stage,until the star is ready to make iron.Calamity ensues, at least for the star andeverything near it. Energy is absorbed,the stellar mass collapses, and tempera-tures soar so rapidly that the star blowsitself to bits and beams a billion timesbrighter than ever. The cosmos as a whole, however, reaps magnificent rewards\u2014as Earth didwhen it materialized 4.6 billion yearsago. After condensing out of a proto-solar gas cloud, a very young andunsightly planet continued to accreteparticles until it grew big enough toabsorb impacts from mineral-studdedasteroids and water-laden comets. Theseearly beatings may have been frequentenough to create the oceans as we cur-rently know them. Volcanic out-gassingand the house-sized hunks of ice thatcontinue to bombard Earth's upperatmosphere help too. In any case, atninety-three million miles from the Sun,our planet appears to have located a veryspecial home for itself. Or has it? The space between Venus and Mars is often referred to as the\"Goldilocks habitable zone,\" and manyextrapolate from their solar-centricexperience to conclude that only planetswithin similar distances from their starscan nurture life. But hold on. First, theSun was a third less luminous backwhen Earthly life began to develop.Second, not all stars are created equal. Asmall, cool, low-luminosity star willtidally lock any planet within its com-fort zone\u2014which of course will bemuch nearer to a smaller star\u2014much asEarth tidally locks the Moon. Thus, allplanetary water would either evaporateor freeze, depending on its hemisphere.Conversely, although they provide rela-tively sprawling sweet spots for life,large, hot stars are rare and short-lived.The evolution of complex life, on theother hand, takes a very long time. Recent and exciting discoveries, how- ever, inform us that our old, stellar-dis-tance based definitions of \"habitablezone\" are just plain worn out. Accordingto Tyson, in fact, Earth's first life formsprobably never experienced the light ofday. \"Extremophiles,\" as they are nowcalled, thrive on various sources of energy,including the geothermal belches thatescape from ridges along the ocean floor.We now know as well that overwhelminggravitational forces heat icy Europa fromwithin. Jupiter, its giant, gaseous host, cre-ates the energy tidally\u2014simply by tug-ging much harder on Europa's proximateside than on its distal side. Indeed, sub-stantial evidence suggests a sea of slushywater sloshing about only one kilometerbeneath the satellite's surface. All this is not to imply that water is necessary for the creation of life. If onlysome sort of liquid is essential, as manybelieve it is, perhaps ammonia orethanol\u2014both plentiful in the universe,and both much more accommodatingthan water in ultra-frigid environ-ments\u2014will do. Although frozen waterhas been discovered on Titan, Saturn'slargest moon, temperature and air pres-sure have liquefied the satellite's moreconsiderable supply of methane. In2005, Europe's Huygens probe relayed images that seem to depict rivers andlakes full of the stuff. No wonder someastrobiologists now tout Titan as a ripeexperimental window into Earth's an-cient past. Given such potential, then,one might readily infer that the cosmosis teaming with life. After all, 90 percentof the universe's constituents are thehydrogen atoms from which all othersare eventually created. But intelligent life is another matter. Some estimate that, over the millennia,ten billion different species have evolvedon Earth. In isolation, of course, thatreality offers creatures like us a paltryone in ten billion chance of existence.Consider also that about half of all\"stars\" are actually binary or multiplesystems driving chaotic or elongatedplanetary orbits and, thus, extreme ter-restrial temperature swings.

During a stint at a local mon-astery, Balsamo learned ritualistic magiccons from a renegade priest which allowedhim to embark upon a career parting thecredulous from their gold. At the age oftwenty during a treasure hunt, he fool-ishly incurred the wrath of a prominentcitizen of Palermo by promising spiritualprotection against demons for a sizablemonetary sum. For his trust in the youngwizard, the townsman was rewarded withsome paltry special effects and a beating.After this incident, the young Balsamoquickly and wisely left the island of Sicilywith several traveling companions. Theparty made landfall in North Africa, fromwhere the future Count soon began hismany adventures. Joseph Balsamo crisscrossed Europe for three decades seeking wealth and celebrityas a worker of the magical arts. During hislong career, \"Count Cagliostro\" was ableto woo thousands into believing he hadmagical healing abilities\u2014in an age whenEurope embraced reason. Of special note,Balsamo was garnering his audiences at atime when other contemporary conmen\u2014such as hypnotist Franz AntonMesmer, the allegedly immortal Count ofSt. Germain, and Gian Casanova\u2014wereat their career peak. McCalman notes that the charismatic Balsamo was able to achieve notableprominence in Europe's royal courts byforging his way to stardom as a militaryman and royal prince, the \"Count Cagli-ostro.\" Even the great Casanova wasimpressed by Balsamo's talents in forgery.Seeking ever greater fame, Count Cagli-ostro astounded the continent's Masons(men who viewed themselves as promot-ers of reason and revolutionary ideals)with his purported knowledge of al-chemy and Eastern mysticism. Cagliostro was able to live comfort- ably for many years with his young wife Seraphina off of the generosity of \"purse-heavy\" believers in his brand of mysticalalchemy\u2014an impressive feat given thatthe alchemists' theory of transmutationhad already been destroyed by RobertBoyle with his use of the scientificmethod in chemical investigations. Alchemy wasn't the Count's only game. Balsamo often awed believers inspiritism with s\u00e9ances, in which heemployed specially coached young chil-dren. He invoked \"archangels\" and \"jinn\"at these staged events. Not surprisingly,Cagliostro's archangels were enlisted tolocate treasures for very affluent clients. As recounted by McCalman, Count Cagliostro traveled to Eastern Europe and attempted to import a brand of mysticalFreemasonry into the court of Catherinethe Great. Initiated as a Freemason inLondon, England, under the lodge rulesof the Strict Observance Rite in 1777, heplaced himself at odds with more conser-vative Grand Orient Masons who hopedfor his demise. Answering his enemies'prayers, Count Cagliostro failed to workhis magic upon the Freemasons of St.Petersburg or their rationalist queen,Catherine the Great.

While neither will rehabilitate him inthe eyes of his detractors, both are liter-ate, absorbing, and rewarding portraits,whether read separately or together. Browne's book is the shorter of the two and, at less than a tenth of the length of her magisterial two-volumebiography of Darwin, serves as a handydistillation of that text. Scholarly andsober, it is nonetheless an absorbingretelling of an involving, if familiar, tale.Darwin's life follows the familiar, classictrajectory of a lost youth who finds pur-pose relatively late in life in the face ofmuch disapproval from an overbearingwidowed father\u2014and a famous one atthat\u2014who was also the son of a famousman (Erasmus Darwin). It is a treasuredirony that the youth that Robert Darwindisdained as nothing more than a \"ratcatcher\" would eventually emerge as oneof the towering intellectual figures ofworld history. Given the pressures on Darwin to live up to his lineage, it is no wonder that he sought the opportunity to wan-der by joining the crew of the surveyingship the Beagle, a journey that lasted fiveyears. This voyage not only brought us amarvelous book and Darwin's firstrecognition as a naturalist, but it alsobrought forth a singularly great ideawhich only came to light after greatto aid St. Petersburg's poor. Facing thevery real threat of execution by Catherinethe Great, the Count and Seraphina fledto Warsaw, Poland. Besieged by Poland'sMasons to transmute base metals intogold, he was soon exposed as a fraudthere\u2014and then it was off again to saferlands like Germany and France for theCount's troupe. Reaching Paris, the Count resumed his healing practices and engaged infurther alchemical experiments.

Itinvolved one Countess de La Motte,who attempted to procure, allegedly forMarie Antoinette, but truthfully forherself and allied confederates, a dia-mond necklace worth over one millionlivres\u2014at the time, basically the cost ofa new warship. This affair earned thescorn of Marie Antoinette, the enmityof King Louis XVI, and earned theCount a stay in the Bastille. Miracu-lously exonerated in the courtroom,Count Cagliostro fled to London in1786, where he became a target of anEnglish satirist employed by theBourbons, and public opinion soonturned against him. Leaving England,\"The Copt,\" as followers now calledhim, journeyed to Rome, where he wasbetrayed to the Inquisition by his wifeof many years. He was tried and sentenced as a heretic in 1791.

It is this delay that is the center- piece of both books. There is a fourteen-year gap between the publication of The Voyage of theH.M.S.

Both books discuss this in depth,though Quammen's does so with greaterdrama and psychological insight, findingthat the motivations behind it are manyand complex. During this time, Darwinmarried and tried to raise a family butsuffered the deaths of some of his chil-dren, including his favorite daughterAnnie. He did have pigeons, barnacles,and other specimens to study, but he hadunexplained spells of nausea and vomit-ing to endure. All the while, he jotted innotebooks and pondered where hisobservations and voluminous data wouldlead. Darwin fretted about the implica-tions of his idea\u2014that this would be aneven bigger blow to anthropocentrismthan Galileo's\u2014but it certainly did notprevent him from publishing it.

InJune 1858, Darwin received a letterand a paper from a younger biologistnamed Alfred Russel Wallace propos-ing that evolution was driven by nat-ural selection. This coincidence finallyspurred Darwin on, and within a yearhis masterpiece was written and pub-lished. With more than two-thirds ofhis life passed, Darwin finally madehis mark. Quammen's book gives a rich and colorful account of the impact of Species. Darwin's England was a more enlight-ened, prosperous place than Galileo'sItaly, so while there was no governmen-tal or royal power brought down uponhim, there were many heated discus-sions of the implications of his work.The monumental arguments betweenBishop Wilberforce and T. H. Huxleywere repeated worldwide and echodown the ages, less so now in Europebut still strongly in the United States. In the last two decades of his life, Darwin no longer procrastinated. Withhis great and controversial idea out andin continual discussion, he added to itsrefinement through books and papers,eventually publishing an autobiography.It took him fifty years to reach this pin-nacle, and after the difficult birth of nat-ural selection, Darwin settled in to whathe really was: a gentleman naturalist ona quiet country estate, growing a mem-orable beard that matched his quietlymonumental contribution to scientificmaterialism. It was here that he was ableto closely observe the world he hadchanged so irrevocably. /hwyhrect Listing does not preclude future review. THE BODY HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN: How Body Maps in YourBrain Help You Do (Almost)Everything Better. Sandra Blakes-lee and Matthew Anoted third-generation sciencewriter, Sandra Blakeslee (a New York Times correspondent), and her son, Matthew, here report on new discoveries ofhow your brain maps your body, the space around yourbody, and the social world. The invisible volume ofspace around your body out to arm's length is part ofyou, they say. \"This is not a metaphor, but a recentlydiscovered physiological fact. Through a special map-ping procedure, your brain annexes this space to yourlimbs and body, clothing you in it like an extended,ghostly skin. The maps that encode your physical bodyare connected directly, immediately, personally to amap of every point in that space and also map out yourpotential to perform actions in that space. Your selfdoes not end where your flesh ends, but suffuses andblends with the world, including other beings.\" Thework represents another piece of the puzzle about howour sense of self is created.

How many times haveyou, when watching an actionscene in a movie or on televi-sion, wondered, Could thatreally happen? David Weiner, aphysics teacher in a college prepschool in La Jolla, California,here deconstructs, demystifies,and debunks our favorite actionmovie sequences. He calls onphysics and physical principles in all his analyses, and, unlike some similar books on thescience of action heroes and the like, he analyzes scenesquantitatively. The level of physics is fundamental; themath level is algebraic. The book is intended not justfor students taking a first-year physics course but alsofor anyone interested in movies and physics.

Perspectives from Anthropology LATHEL F. DUFFIELD The idea of \"common sense\" fuels the popular intelligent-design(ID) explanation for biological evolution. According to psychologistScott Lilienfeld, it is \"the public's erro-neous belief that common sense is a reli-able guide to evaluating the naturalworld\" that contributes to ID's popular-ity (Lilienfeld 2005, p. 46). Unfor-tunately, Lilienfeld, like others who usethe concept of common sense, oftenleave it to the reader to define. Perhapswe should examine this popular conceptand try to determine what is actuallycommon about common sense. John Horgan, a science journalist, in his article \"In Defense of CommonSense\" (Horgan 2005) opinions ofordinary men . . . .\" In the same dictio- nary, the word common has as one of its definitions \"belonging to or shared bytwo or more individuals or by all mem-bers of a group.\" Thus, common sense isa judgment or opinion shared by mem-bers of a group. This sharing makes com-mon sense a cultural pattern that is a partof the overall cultural configuration ofsociety. There is no evidence or sugges-tion that common sense is based in man'sbiological makeup. It is a shared patternof thinking that when engaged wouldinvariably reach a common conclusion.According to this definition, commonsense is then a learned way of thinking. Using \"common sense,\" many Ameri- cans conclude that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Ofcourse, those who draw this conclusionoften are not aware of the assumptionunderlying their answer. They do notrealize their answer assumes a \"flatworld\" (Euclidean geometry), whichwas the state of knowledge at the timethis postulate developed. Now, it iscommon knowledge that we do not liveon a flat earth. But \"common sense\" hasnot caught up with current knowledge.The answer to this question todayshould be, \"It depends!\" Since Earth ismore or less globular, the shortest dis-tance between two points can also be acurved line (non-Euclidian). For com-mon sense to have validity, the indi-vidual espousing such judgmentshould be sure that it is based on cur-rent knowledge. In America, common sense about mankind's status in the animal world is intimately related to long-standing reli-gious concepts and the belief in our\"uniqueness.\" Ask most Americans howmany souls a person possesses, and thelikely answer is one. But in other soci-eties (if the question would even makesense to them), the answers may wellrange from one to twelve! Americans'response to this question is not necessar-ily the only correct answer. Because thisfalls into the realm of belief, the answercannot be objectively validated. Butmany Americans think: \"I believe it,therefore must be true.\"The religious influence on man's clas- sification in the animal world is seen even in early scientific classifications ofhumans (i.e., Linneaus dubbed manHomo sapiens, \"thinking man,\" believingat the time that other animals lacked thisability, and this was something thatmade man unique). It was also assumedat the time that man was at the top of theanimal kingdom. That common-senseassumption ignores the vast number ofshared genetic and physical traits manhas with other animals. Also, even usingthe word man with its narrow definition implies that this animal is somethingseparate and distinct from other animals.In the Navajo language, the word for\"man\" is literally translated as the \"ani-mal with five fingers.\" Were we ZuniIndians, the word we would use wouldhave a very broad meaning, since theZuni make no distinction between manand the other parts of nature that theZuni consider to be alive. The \"cate-gories human, animal, nature, and man are alien to the Zuni classification of theuniverse . . .\" (Walker 1979, p. 150). Common sense, as found in various societies, explains the world and man's place in it. As I've noted, the common-sense explanation of humanity's place innature as expressed in American societyand culture is not one that is universallyshared. Most Americans see man as aunique being, and, while biologicallypart of the animal world, man is sepa-rated from the beasts by possessing aunique spirit and a complex set of emo-tions. It is this \"common-sense\" defini-tion of man that contributes to the Lathel F .

JORDAN As the author of two recent SKEPTICAL INQUIRER articles on global warming and climate change, I would like to offer some con-cluding thoughts on this topic, whichenjoys an emerging consensus among anoverwhelming majority of researchersworking in the field but remains contro-versial among some in the general pub-lic. Because the issue deals with futureactivities of important sectors of theAmerican economy, it is not surprisingthat the magazine has received anunusually large number of responses toit. My two articles (\"Global ClimateChange T riggered by Global Warming,\"Parts 1 and 2, May/June and July/August 2007) speak for themselves, as do the follow-up comments of the crit- ics and the supporters (September/October 2007). Since my response tothe critics appears in that issue as well, Iwill not review that dialogue again.However, the exchange did raise impor-tant questions about the role of science(and of scientists) in a democracy, and itis this topic I wish to address here. It is important that the public have a reasonable understanding of what science is and of what science can and cannot doin helping to settle issues that eventuallyreach the public square and thus take on apolitical dimension. Most people under-stand that science is a process for seekingthe truth about how the natural orderworks. It is the process itself, not the results of applying it, that lies at the heart of science. Fewer people may realize thatthis process virtually guarantees theintegrity of science in the long run even ifindividual scientists make mistakes, as alloccasionally do, or if a (very) rare individ-ual is actually dishonest and falsifies data.This guaranty results not from any intrin-sic moral superiority of scientists them-selves, but from the fact that researchexamined by scientific colleagues in themost prestigious medium, the refereedpublications, is quickly subjected to ruth-less examination for any errors. Those whodetect an error often gain as much creditfor their scrutiny as those whose work sur-vives it. Scientists who deliberately avoidthis scrutiny by publishing their work inpopularity of ID. In essence, God made us in his image. Americans who are not aware of the depth and power of the assumptionsguiding their thinking see the world inonly one way\u2014the American way. Untilthey accept the fact that the Americanworldview is not universal and that it isonly one way of seeing and understand-ing the world, they will not be willing toaccept that human beings are part andparcel of the animal world. How might we make them see this? Individuals need to be made aware ofthe fundamental assumptions in theirthinking. The world and the people in itare complex and can be viewed in manydifferent ways. However, if the person isblinded by faith, ideas and attitudes can-not be readily altered by reality. After all,there are people today who still believein a flat earth. What then is common about com- mon sense? Common sense is that shared\"knowledge\" with associated value sys-tems that is acquired by individuals orgroups in a society. For the general pub-lic, knowledge comes from a variety ofplaces\u2014parents, peers, friends, teachers,preachers, radio, television, books, maga-zines, etc. Common sense depends on aperson's acceptance of certain unstatedassumptions and premises. Sharing thisknowledge/value system with friends andfamily helps create a common bond.\"Critical thinking\" (evaluation of accepted\"facts\") may occur in common-sense sys-tems when the knowledge system is chal-lenged. The responses by those who pos-sess the common-sense system aredesigned generally to maintain theintegrity of the group's shared knowl-edge/value base. References Horgan, John. 2005.

History has demonstrated con-vincingly that the latter work is muchmore likely to contain serious errors. Science does not offer certainty. The results of modern science are typically presented in the language of statisticsand probabilities. This is especially trueof scientific studies of complex phenom-ena, of which climate science is an excel-lent example, even though these phe-nomena remain rooted in the basic lawsof nature. Nevertheless, the existence of\"uncertainty\" has led some individualsless familiar with science to interpret anyuncertainty as evidence for \"a major sci-entific controversy\" even when there isnone. Thus the general public is vulner-able to the claim that a major scientificdispute over climate science is underwaybetween two equally large and well-qual-ified groups of scientists, when this issimply not so. Often this false claim ismade by those who wish to discourageaction to address the problems associatedwith climate change. There are certainlya few scientists of integrity who remainskeptical of the current near consensus,but the interested reader might considerthe language of some of the critics andinvestigate their sources. The real issue at stake today is what to do in light of what science has uncovered.Here there is a real controversy. Onegroup favors action in response to thealarming evidence that global warming isdefinitely occurring, most likely dri-ven by anthropogenic greenhousegases, while the other sideopposes this view for reasonsranging from a few still-unresolved scientific questions to concernsof a more economic and political nature.Typically, the latter group is dominated bythose fearing change of the industrial sta-tus quo, and they tend to be more vehe-ment in advocating their position. This leads into two final issues need- ing comment. The first acknowledgesthe importance of addressing the eco-nomic dislocations and economic oppor-tunities that will result from actions to mitigate the effects of global warming.There is an understandable\u2014not alwaysunwise\u2014human tendency to want tocontinue with the familiar. This pro-duces a natural inclination to opposechange unless it becomes disastrous notto do so, which can lead to overlookingthe many\u2014in this case economic\u2014opportunities associated with pursuingmore climate-friendly and eco-friendlytechnologies. These include many tech-nologies already available, with othersundergoing current development thatcould be accelerated if proper economicincentives were provided. Interestedreaders can find examples, which I wasunable to include in my articles due to space constraints, at www.cfidc.org/opp/jordan.html. The final question I wish to address is what the responsibilities ofscientists are in a democracy that, defacto, provides much of the fundingfor their research. Many working sci-entists would prefer to have little todo with the political process, yet thereis no denying that most scientiststoday receive much of their supportfrom governments. Performing one's research with in- tegrity is obviously part of the answer,but is it the full answer? Some wouldsay yes and defend this position bynoting that distracting a competentresearcher from his or her research islikely to reduce scientific productiv-ity. As one who has both performedand managed research, I agree withthis position under most circum-stances. However, if major publicpolicies depend on science for theirproper formulation, as is true of cli-mate science today, a strong case canbe made that it becomes the duty ofthe scientist to inform the public andthe political establishment of the bestscience available on the issue, espe-cially when there are others exerting amajor effort to suppress considerationof it. A historical example was theeffort of the atomic scientists follow-ing World War II to inform the pub-lic of the unprecedented power andappalling destructiveness of nuclearweapons. A growing number of cli-mate scientists, and others in related fields, are engaging in a similar educational effort today. I believe this effort serves the public well, and that it should continue. /hwysquare SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:40 PM Page 64SKEPTICAL INQUIRER November / December 2007 65LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Cinema Fiction vs. Physics Reality The two articles on The Science Behind ScienceFiction in our July/August 2007 issue\u2014\"Cine-ma Fiction vs. Physics Vam-pires, and a of readers' representative sample, fol-lowed by Efthimiou's reply.\u2014E DITOR Thanks for another interesting issue and forcontinuing to broaden the scope of coverage.I particularly enjoyed the two articles onpopular entertainment and science. The ideaof using superheroes to introduce scientificconcepts is worth encouraging. I would like to call everyone's attention to another fine example of this approach. Thebook is The Physics of the Buffyverse by Jennifer Ouellette (Penguin 2006). The author usesexamples from the popular TV show Buffy theVampire Slayer to introduce a host of physical concepts and covers both classical and mod-ern theoretical physics. She includes a bonusof covering some intriguing ideas in biologyand chemistry as well. The book is easy reading, and if you enjoyed the TV show, truly grabs your inter-est and focuses your attention on a numberof complex scientific issues. The explana-tions are a good, solid, general introduction,and several have encouraged me to seek outadditional (more conventionally presented)information. I haven't had so much fun witha science read since way back in the dark ages(that would be the 1950s) when an uncle gaveme a copy of George Gamow's One-Two-Three Infinity. That book was responsible formy lifelong interest in science. This book,being far more contemporary in style andcontent, should do the same for today'syoung readers. Robert L. FolsteinGreenfield, Wisconsin I thoroughly enjoyed the article \"Cinema Fiction vs. Physics Reality,\" perhaps for the wrong reasons. As a longtime fan of vampirefilms, I had often wondered if the growth ofthe vampire population would not have led tothe extinction of humanity. Your article alsodemonstrates Coleridge's remark that fictionrequires the willing suspension of disbelief. Manuel J. MariCoral Gables, Florida I enjoyed very much the article comparing the physical reality to the horror movie world, butunfortunately Messers Efthimiou and Gandhiare sadly unaware of their vampire lore. Theauthors claim that vampires cannot existbecause as their population grows, the world'spopulation decreases and soon we will all bevampires, but they totally forget about therole of the fearless Vampire Slayer! Sure, so vampire #1 can claim his first victim, but there stands Buffy with herwooden stake ready to destroy the vampire,bringing the population back down to one.Even if Buffy is on vacation, Professor vanHelsing is always available to use his stakeas well or expose the vampire to sunlight,again reducing the vampire population. Even if the vampire population grows to four or eight, our vampire slayers have awhole month to reduce the population backdown to one (the ever immortal Draculaalways seeming to elude destruction!). So far from debunking the vampire legend, the authors have actually made a case for saint- hood for Buffy! After all, we would all be dead(or undead, as the case may be) without her! David Cramer Anaheim, California I was greatly entertained by the article byCostas Efthimiou and Sohang Gandhi on thereality behind movie monsters. In particular, Ienjoyed the section computing the gradualattrition of humans under the onslaught ofvampires. However, there is a significant con-founding factor that the authors didn'taddress\u2014call it the \"Buffy Factor.\" The authorsassumed that we would be sitting around pas-sively waiting for vampires to come and drainus of blood, something I personally thinkunlikely, particularly given the extensive litera-ture on how to kill the blood-sucking pests. Rather than the geometric progression of vampire creation, perhaps the limiting factorshould be the availability of trees for stakes,the intensity with which metallurgists couldproduce crucifixes, or the ability of farmersto ramp up the production of garlic. Susan JohnstonBowie, Maryland I have to give Costas Efthimiou and SohangGandhi credit for having their hearts in theright place for their cover article \"CinemaFiction vs. Physics Reality.\" But in their hasteto debunk the supernatural use of physics, Ithink they've overlooked some things. Take vampires, for instance. Sure, it's true that if a vampire created another vampire every time it fed, the world would very soonbe up to its neck in creatures of the night(Stephen King made use of this idea in Salem'sLot). But one very basic reality of biology isthat any parasite that destroys its host tooquickly also destroys itself. Surely vampireswould be smart enough to be aware of this.Way back in Dracula (the granddaddy of all such stories) Bram Stoker established thatbeing drained of blood by a vampire onlyturned you into a very dead corpse. Thebloodsucker must deliberately decide to createa new vampire with a specific ritual. (In therecent novel The Historian, a vampire mustbite the same person three times, for exam-ple.) So it's logical to assume that vampireswould voluntarily keep their own numbersdown for simple reasons of survival, renderingthe authors' reducto ad absurdum invalid. Besides, their analysis also totally failed to take into account one very obvious source of decline within the vampire populationitself\u2014namely vampire hunters! In themovie Blade: Trinity, the title character claimed to have personally killed 1,182\"familiars\" (humans who voluntarily servevampires in the hope of being \"turned\" someday), and anyone who watches the moviescan assume that he has accounted for at leastthat many true vampires as well. I'd say thatputs a pretty large dent in their numbers! Thomas BarefieldWaynesboro, Georgia Efthimiou and Gandhi miss the point about the proliferation of vampires for two reasons.First, they argue that vampires would quickly SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:40 PM Page 6566 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERLETTERS TO THE EDITOR eliminate the human species because a vam- pire's victim becomes a vampire. But fic-tional vampires need not adhere to that rule.In my vampire novels, I've added conditionsmaking the production of vampires a muchslower process. Second, in fiction the problem really doesn't matter. Joss Whedon simply ignoredit entirely in his Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series, and the result was brilliant television.Viewers were also willing to ignore the prob-lem because they were given the chance towatch one of the best television shows they'dever seen. Some Haitians may think zombies are the animated undead, but very few read-ers/viewers of vampire fiction think vampiresexist outside fiction. Because of my vampirenovels and an essay about vampires, my Website gets many hits from search engineswhere the search string includes the word\"vampire.\" I tabulated one month's worth ofsuch search strings. Some were apparently bypeople who think vampires are real (\"Howcan you tell if someone's a vampire?\") butmost were clearly interested in fictionalaspects of the subject. In fact, most seemedto be looking for fiction involving vampiresand sex. The results are recorded here:http://eyeblister.blogspot.com/2007/06/oh-vampires-oh-oh-oh.html. David DvorkinDenver, Colorado There is a major flaw in Efthimiou and Gandhi's argument against the existence ofvampires. To bolster their argument, theauthors present a Malthusian formula whichpredicts that, if these blood-suckers reallydid exist, unbridled geometric growth oftheir population would inevitably result inworld domination and the demise of thehuman race\u2014something which clearly hasnot happened. However, Efthimiou andGandhi have omitted a critical constant fromtheir formula, inclusion of which predicts atotally different outcome. Originally known as the van Helsing Variable (vHV), this constant is now com- monly called the Buffy Factor (BF), DarkAngel Force (DAF) or, Underworld Effect(UE). It's a population-control factor thatautomatically kicks in whenever the vampirepopulation reaches \"critical population den-sity,\" or CPD, whereupon muscledmacho men and spandex-clad hotties wield-ing wooden stakes, holy water, and machineguns. As a result, the vampire populationperiodically crashes to a size of approximatelyn = 1, and the population has to start grow-ing all over again. And again. And again. By including the vHV/BF/DAF/UE con- stant in Efthimiou and Gandhi's formula, we see that vampires can indeed exist. And quitefrankly, I hope they do. I have no problemwith Buffy Summers, Max Guevara, orSelene (aka Anna Valerious) hanging out atmy place, protecting me while I sleep. Rick EmmerBay Village, Ohio Your story on the science behind Holly-wood's depiction of zombies and vampireswas completely wrong on both subjects. On zombies, the authors concluded that the creation of zombies would happen so quickly that it would overwhelm thehuman population, and thus Hollywood'sdepiction was unrealistic. However, this isexactly how movies like Dawn of the Dead,28 Days Later and the Resident Evil films portray things\u2014the global human popula-tion is quickly overwhelmed as zombies arecreated. So Hollywood's depiction exactlymatched the supposedly flawed \"science\"discussed in the article. As for vampires, the authors apparently have not carefully watched the movies and TV shows depicting them. Their calculationsassume that each time a human is killed, avampire is created. However, in universes ofthe Anne Rice-based movies, the Blade films, the Buffy the Vampire Slayer /Angel TV shows, and so on, the creation of new vampires is arare event. For example, in the Buffyverse,the vast majority of humans killed by vam-pires are simply left for dead. They are onlychanged into vampires through an elaborateprocess when both the victim and the demonwish this to occur (see the characters Spike,Angel, and Drusilla.) Jason A.

Although the text says an MRIwas performed in Wilfred Doricent's case, aCAT scan is shown in the corresponding pic-ture. The caption says the lesion shown is inthe right frontal cone. Unfortunately, there is no such structure in the brain. In fact, thearea being pointed to is calcification in thepineal gland. This area is commonly calcifiedin the brains of individuals of age fifty orabove. Doricent, however, was younger.Although Doricent's brain scan did notresult in direct proof that this was indeed acase of zombiefication based on TTX, themedical team concluded that the case was atleast consistent with oxygen deprivation asstated in the second reference of the article. Our article was not about definite proofs. We challenge the reader to devise an absolute,mathematical/logical proof that a givensupernatural occurrence does not exist. Ourprediction is that the reader will fail. In par-ticular, there is no universally agreed uponmathematical/logical definition of the variousapparitions considered in our article or of themanner in which they operate/behave (e.g.,whether vampires deliberately control whichof their victims turns into a vampire, etc.,mentioned in the vast majority of the re-ceived comments). However, an inability topresent a definite proof does not imply aninability to discover inconsistencies or otherflaws in a claim that put it to the test. Our article was intended merely as an entertaining vehicle of education aimed at stir- ring critical thinking. Our goal was to remindreaders that (a) Pseudoscientific and paranor-mal ideas barely make sense when elementarylogic and science is applied; (b) When\u2014andif\u2014there is an element of truth, it is highly dis-torted and hidden behind elaborate myths; (c)It is important to make probabilistic assess-ments of various claims using reason. SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:41 PM Page 66SKEPTICAL INQUIRER November / December 2007 67LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Along these lines, we observe that Davis's link between zombiefication and TTX has been viewed with skepticism. (Incidentally,Davis presented his claim in the book The Serpent and the Rainbow, published by Simon & Schuster in 1985, reissued in1997. The book was not cited explicitly inthe article.) Unfortunately, there has been nodirect proof along this direction and, there-fore, Davis's claim remains an intriguinghypothesis. There are only a few scientificstudies on zombies (at least to the best of ourknowledge). One that should be of interestto the readers of this magazine is that of [1997] p. 1094-96) who looked atthree alleged zombie cases. In all cases theywere able to find medical explanations. Many messages contend that the authors have \"missed\" essential ideas in the \"vampi-rization\" of humans that invalidate the calcu-lation and, thus, the final conclusion. Weassure the readers that we are familiar with allthe variations of the myth. After all, howcould we miss them if Hollywood and novelwriters bombard us with them daily? Weknow about Buffy, Angel, Blade, and theother vampire hunters. We have read aboutmultiple bites, drained bodies, transfer ofblood, and other protocols necessary to createnew vampires. However, none of them canchange the final conclusion of the impossibil-ity of the existence of vampires\u2014albeit theline of reasoning might have to be modifiedslightly (or radically if the premises arechanged considerably). No matter whatassumptions are required, one can create a cor- responding mathematical model. We inten-tionally simplified the assumptions andavoided sophisticated mathematical modelsto keep the article accessible to most readers.By introducing dynamical systems, one canconstruct highly sophisticated models for thevampire population versus the human popu-lation. For example, in one of the simplestmodels, known as the prey vs. the predatormodel, the two populations fluctuate periodi-cally. (For a simple presentation see J.Stewart, Calculus, 6th edition, Thomson 2007.) If this model is used, the human pop-ulation never disappears, but it fluctuatesbetween a maximum and a minimum value.One can immediately see now an argumentagainst the existence of vampires: the humanpopulation has not fluctuated, and even moreit has kept (and keeps) increasing exponen-tially. One can start with this model and addadditional features (such as vampire slayers,vampire diseases, accidental exposure to sun-light, vampire babies, etc.), but the final out-come will not change: vampires cannot existsince the model would predict a human pop-ulation curve different from the actual one. Also, the reader should note that this dis- cussion is based in elementary physics andmathematics. We never discussed the socialimplications. Imagine what it would mean ifevery so often an exanguinated human corpsewas found (even if only one vampire existed).Wouldn't this be the headline in the news? Unless, of course, all governments have con-spired to keep these incidents secret .... Other messages to us pointed out similar omissions/holes in the arguments of ghostsand tried to affirm the existence of ghostsbased on faith or incorrect physics explana-tions. Unfortunately, quantum mechanicsand exotic matter cannot give more sub-stance to ghosts, and faith cannot be used asa substitute for proof. For reasons of limitedspace and time, we bypass a rebuttal of eachof the (incorrect) attempts to use physics tomake the concept of ghosts consistent. Many Hollywood movies have some ideas that are consistent with science ideas,but the majority of movies greatly offendmathematical and scientific laws. Our refer-ence to the movies was a motivational tool,mainly. The authors would enjoy a consis-tent script, although research on the issue(G. Sparks, Media Effects Research: A Basic Overview, 2nd edition, Wadsworth Publish-ing 2005) indicates that Hollywood has anegative impact on scientific literacy in thepublic. Ignoring misrepresentation of par-ticular situations as detailed by Mr.Roberts, and even ignoring series like SciFiInvestigates, Ghosthunters, etc., which in- volve people untrained in the scientificmethod of investigation, Hollywood's cur-rent trend is to promote the supernaturalover logic and scientific inquiry. In theirstories, science is irrelevant, it means trou-ble, is reflexively close-minded, and onlylaypersons will find the true solution.Fortunately, a few people have tried toreverse the unchallenged way Hollywoodpresents its ideas. As Mr. Folstein pointsout, there have been some excellent booksbased on Hollywood products that explainscience in an entertaining way. Among ourfavorites are the classic book by LawrenceKrauss, The Physics of Star Trek, and James Kakalio's The Physics of Superheroes. One of us (C.E.) is involved in a more extensiveproject nicknamed Physics in Films, 1which uses Hollywood movies as a vehicle of edu-cation to increase the scientific literacy andthe quantitative fluency of the public.Note 1.

Global Warming: Protest the Subscription Cancelers I'm writing to protest against the two gen- tlemen you mentioned in the second part ofyour two-part July/August editor's note,who canceled their subscriptions in protestof the S KEPTICAL INQUIRER 's publishing of the first part of Stuart Jordan's two-part arti-cle: \"Global Climate Change T riggered so offended by their subscription can- cellations, in fact, that I'm consideringprotesting their protest by signing up for asecond and third subscription just to stymietheir efforts! Did I miss something? Whether or not they pan out to be the ultimate truth on the matter, the arguments for global warmingseem reasonable and well thought out to me.At the very least, a person who calls himselfrational (but does not believe that there is aconnection between global climate changeand global warming) should not be so posi-tive in his position that the mere mention ofthe possibility of such a connection wouldinduce a tantrum resulting in the cancella-tion of a subscription, for the love of Pete! Where does their absoluteness stem from? Are these men in possession of ir-refutable evidence? A rational person, vexed as these men were, can still receive plenty of enjoyment and men- tal stimulation from the S KEPTICAL INQUIRER 's other, more palatable, articles and features. Butno! In their minds this break of ideologies hastainted the S KEPTICAL INQUIRER beyond re- demption. Ha ha! It's ironic that this type ofintolerant purism is identical to the emotionsthat cause religious schisms.SI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:41 PM Page 6768 Volume 31, Issue 6 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERLETTERS TO THE EDITOR I wouldn't mourn their loss too much. Minds that have become ridged from positiv- ity are one step away from irrationality. Arational mind, even one that disagrees withyou, would have waited to read the entire edi-tor's column, and in doing so, come acrossthese reassuring and reaffirming words: \"If inthe future, new and better evidence showsthat global warming is a myth and chimera,in marked contrast to the situation now, we'llbe right there, reporting on that.\" Michael Hinckle Oak Creek, Wisconsin The Moon-Landing Hoax The article in the July/August 2007 issue regarding the Moon landing hoax (\"TheEarth and Stars in the Lunar Sky\") promptsme to write. I am surprised that nobodyappears to have offered the single biggestargument in support of the Moon landingreality. The Apollo 11 crew left on the Moonan object that could not have been placedthere any other way, that could not be natural,and can be demonstrated to be on the surfaceof the Moon even from 240,000 miles away. I refer to the corner reflector array. This piece of technology was left on the Moon specifically so scientists on Earth could mea-sure much more accurately the Earth-Moondistance. By shining a laser to the generalvicinity of the reflector (there will be somespreading), the light is reflected back in thesame direction it was sent and can be pickedup by detectors very near the source of theoriginal laser beam. No natural phenomenonwould perform such reflection. It could nothave been simply dropped from an orbitingsatellite, because it would likely not havelanded in the proper orientation. The reflector has been there for three- plus decades, and it is possible that enoughdust has accumulated to prevent its contin-ued operation, but, for at least the first fewyears, it did its passive job quite well.Scientists were able to measure the distanceto the moon to within a small fraction of ameter, I seem to recall reading. Enough so,they could identify at just what (slow) ratethe Moon is drifting away from the Earth. Dan Karlandankarlan@earthlink.net Supernatural and Science Victor Stenger (\"Onward Science Soldiers,\" July/August 2007) correctly shows that theNational Academy of Sciences is wrong in itsassertion that the supernatural is not a properarea of scientific investigation. It is time thatthose who use the word supernatural tell us what they think it means. Webster's says itmeans \"not explainable by the known forces orlaws of nature.\" If the Academy posits the exis-tence of phenomena that are not fictional, yetdon't fit with the known laws of science, thenthose laws are necessarily incorrect and in needof modification. If that doesn't describe legiti-mate science, I don't know what does. Sincethe laws of science are attempts to explainwhat is, they cannot by definition have excep-tions. Any real phenomenon outside theselaws means that the laws are incorrect. Thus\"supernatural\" is always a scientific challenge. Jerome SheddRipton, Vermont Secrets and Lies I was happy to finally read some critical thought regarding Rhonda Byrne's The Secret (\"Secrets and Lies,\" May/June 2007). Yourreport examines the connections, or lackthereof, to the scientific theories that are sup-posedly the foundation of the secret, andfinds them wishful thinking at best. That fal-lacy seems obvious. Yet, you did not botherexamining in more detail the real sciencebehind the secret, which is the ever manipula-tive science of advertising and public relations. I would argue that all of these New Thought gurus and multi-level marketing magic health products (gou ji juice, man-natech etc.) have a very exact processbehind them that deserves more elucidation.Essentially there are three primary (and req-uisite) components to these fads. First,there needs to be a cult-of-personality pio-neer who has chosen to bring their geniusand generosity to the masses, usually a bril-liant doctor or scientist that realized he/shehad to share his/her discovery with theworld to make it a better place. Second, thisperson and his/her company always laysclaim to some sort of scientific knowledgethat has somehow been overlooked ormissed by the rest of the scientific commu-nity (e.g., the importance of mono-saccharide); this is always accompanied bylots of glossy pamphlets with graphs andpictures of technicians in laboratories. Last, there is always a \"just cause\" or missionary-type vision that is motivating this enterprise, such as inventing a super-food so we can feed the hungry children ofthe world. This \"mission\" is accomplishedby donating one percent of all sales to a char-itable organization that they have alignedthemselves to or created themselves. Theother sociological phenomenon that helpsfuel this marketing process is a \"born again\"new convert to religious zeal. Given thenumber of people in the U.S. who identifythemselves as born-again Christians, blindfaith to a new-found messiah can provide adevout demographic. Darren TellierEdmonton, AlbertaCanada Debating Creationists (or Not) I have to strongly disagree with Mr. Rulon's opinions about not debating creationists(\"Debating Creationists,\" May/June 2007).On the contrary, I feel it is very importantfor scientists and educators to confront thepseudoscience head on and not only debatethe creationists but invite the debate actively.My own personal \"evolution\" from funda-mentalist Christian to reluctant atheist isbecause of the availability of facts. Thestrongest way to kill superstition is to con-front it with the facts, and creationism canonly be destroyed by confronting it directlywith the evolutionary facts. Where are the\"missing links?\" Show them the extensive listof transitional forms. Why are there gaps inthe fossil record? Explain the vastness of thegeologic time scale and the rarity of eventsthat would cause fossilization. What aboutabiogenesis? Explain how this has nothing todo with evolution of the species and is a sep-arate debate of its own. I think you get mypoint. We must actively dispel ignorance with knowledge, not ignore the ignorance! Richard SmedleyBroken Arrow Paleo Society rsmed@cox.net God, Arguments, and Reason First, thanks to Massimo Pigliucci for hisexposition of the ontological argument forthe existence of God (\"Is Dawkins Deluded?\"July/August 2007). Ever since I was anundergraduate philosophy student in the1960s, I have felt somehow mentally deficientSI N-D 2007 pgs 9/26/07 12:41 PM Page 68SKEPTICAL INQUIRER November / December 2007 69LETTERS TO THE EDITOR because I could not comprehend it. It was good to finally learn from a highly respectedsource that the argument is incomprehensiblesimply because it is nonsensical. Regarding The God Delusion, I wasn't, as a philosopher, offended by what Pigliuccidetected as Dawkins's justifiably sarcastic argument afteranother. Perhaps Dawkins maligned philoso-phers because so many of them have arrivedat the wrong conclusion about the existenceof a supreme being. But it doesn't matter. Arrogant scientists set up a straw man for theists, who say that scientists falsely claim that science canexplain everything. Of course, scientistsdon't make that claim. But the false percep-tion that they do demeans both evolutionarybiology and, as it turns out, contemporaryphilosophy\u2014the overlapping domains ofboth Dawkins and Pigliucci\u2014as much asdoes the scientifically illiterate statement\"Evolution is only a theory.\" It would be better if we, as scientists, philosophers, freethinkers, and rationalists, abandoned these labels for ourselves, andjust used the term reason to explain our arrival at the inescapable conclusion thatthere is no god. Listening to theists \"rea-son\" that understanding God is \"beyondreason\" is a constant source of amuse-ment\u2014especially when they deploy theontological argument. Richard E. Wackrow Polebridge, Montana /hwyhrectprocess, the crystals form, change, and melt over a two-minute period. He explains that water is life, water is prayer, water is a mirror, and water isbeauty. We are mostly water, so we mustallow ourselves to flow. He believes inhomeopathy, flower essences, and \"effec-tive microorganism\" (EM) which (amongother things) can be \"used to treat thedioxin resulting from the burning ofrefuse.\" Best of all, he believes water isthe key to world peace. If we all pray forthe water in the Sea of Galilee, it willflow into the Jordan River whose wateris used by both the Israelis and thePalestinians, and they will instantly stopbombing and start hugging each other. Guess what? He has a Web site, and it sells things. Here are some of the itemsyou can buy: EM Antioxidant mouthwash and gargle to hydrate the oral cavity, $12 for16 oz. EM Antioxidant tooth powder, $12 for 2 oz. Stickers with pictures of water crys- tals to change the atmosphere of what-ever you place them on in a positive way,such as \"The God of Wealth\" for yourwallet, and \"Love and Thanks\" for yourcell phone. (I think I'd prefer to tell it\"Silence is Golden.\") A sheet of twenty-eight stickers sells for only $10! Indigo water\u20148 oz. of \"highly charged hexagonally structured water\" sells for only $35. Drinking this is sup-posed to provide superior hydration,enhanced nutrient absorption, moreeffective detoxification, increased meta-bolic efficiency, and improved cellularcommunication. Forty-eight Oracle Cards for $16.95. (I guess if you believe in the rest of thisnonsense, you might as well believe inoracles!) You can even learn to teach this stuff. You can sign up for a four-day hado instructor school for only $3,000. TheWeb site also has a \"water crystal of themonth\" picture which you can down-load, but only for your personal use. I suppose it's reassuring to think we could control the world with ourthoughts and get the God of Wealth tobless our wallets, but another conse-quence of these ideas is that water every-where is watching us and knows what weare thinking. Like Santa, it knows whenwe've been bad or good. The very coffeein the cup on my desk knows if I havedaydreamed about George Clooneysucking my toes or had the fleeting wishthat my boss would catch leprosy and bepecked to death by a rabid ostrich. The Reverend who urged me to look into Emoto's \"research\" was notalone. I've met a number of peoplewho were very impressed by What the Bleep Do We Know!? and even onewoman who wanted to repeat the riceexperiment and watch the rice rotfaster when she insulted it. When Itried to give her advice on how toproperly do the experiment with con-trols, she lost interest. It might havebeen fun to do a half-assed demonstra-tion to confirm her belief, but itwouldn't have been nearly as much funto do it right and look for the truth. Auniversity professor told me his stu-dents largely thought the Bleep movie represented the cutting edge of science.I'm beginning to wonder if there reallyis something in our water . . . but onsecond thought, I'm more inclined tobelieve our science teachers have failedthe American public. Rationalized irrationality is alive and well. This watery fantasy is all veryentertaining and imaginative, full ofNew Age feel-good platitudes, holisticoneness, consciousness-raising, andwarm fuzzies; but it's hard to see howanyone could mistake it for science. Ofcourse, our thoughts and words do havean effect on the world around us, butnot exactly in the way Emoto imagines.Fortunately, librarians are smarter thanthe reverend letter writer. lists Emoto's booksunder Religion-Special Topics. /hwyhrect MASARU EMOTO'S WONDERFUL WORLD OF WATER Continued from page 51 The letters column is a forum for views on matters raised in previ-ous issues.
