No. 62/469,219, filed Mar. 9, 2017, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.REFERENCE TO A SEQUENCE LISTING SUBMITTED AS A TEXT FILE VIA EFS-WEB The instant application contains a Sequence Listing which has been submitted in ASCII format via EFS-Web and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Said ASCII copy, created on Mar. 12, 2021, is named H082470241US01-SEQ-EPG and is 3737 kilobytes in size.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Tumor-specific immune responses may be elicited by peptides generated from proteins expressed in tumor cells or on tumor cell surface (e.g., tumor-specific antigens). Native peptides derived from tumor-specific antigens are tolerated as \"self\" by the immune system and do not elicit strong immune response against the tumor-specific antigen. Altered versions of the native peptides derived from tumor-specific antigens (e.g., heteroclitic peptides or cryptic peptides) may be engineered to elicit potent immune reactions through the MHC-I and MHC-II antigen presentation pathways, which also produce cross-reactive responses towards the native tumor-specific antigen sequences. It is well established that the immune system can function to kill tumor cells, including both primary and metastatic cancer cells. Indeed, evidence that the immune system recognizes the presence of neoplastic cancerous cells is supported by the existence of infiltrating lymphocytes in tumor tissues (Haskill et al., 1978, Contemp. Top. Moore, 1985, Semin. Hematol. 22: 27-40). Yet, for reasons that are not completely clear, despite the presence of immune cells, tumors often prevail and not only survive but metastasize to distant sites with unrestricted growth. Recent advances in the understanding of T cell activation and recognition of target cells have begun to permit some progress in development of T cell mediated cancer immunotherapy (Schwartz, 1992, Cell 71: 1065-1068; Pardoll, 1992, 4: 619-623).SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Described herein are systems, methods, compositions, and kits for producing immunogenic peptides derived from tumor specific antigens (e.g., heteroclitic epitopes or cryptic epitopes) that may be used as cancer vaccines in vivo or ex vivo. Targeted mutations are introduced into tumor-specific antigens using gene editing agents, e.g., a nucleobase editor comprising a programmable DNA binding domain (e.g., catalytically-inactive Cas9 or a Cas9 nickase) fused to a cytosine deaminase, to generate altered versions of peptides arising from the tumor-specific antigens (heteroclitic epitopes) or peptides arising from normally untranslated regions of the tumor-specific antigen genes (cryptic peptides). The heteroclitic peptides or cryptic peptides may be generated in vivo in a subject (e.g., a subject who has cancer) and presented to the adaptive immune system via the MHC class I or MHC class II pathway, which in turn induces a strong adaptive immune response, e.g., T cell response and B cell response. Such an adaptive immune response is antigen specific and is effective in reducing tumor growth and preventing metastasis.

The details of certain embodiments of the disclosure are set forth in the Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments, as described below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the Definitions, Examples, Figures, and Claims. The accompanying drawings, which constitute a part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments of the disclosure and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the disclosure. As used herein and in the claims, the singular forms \"a,\" \"an,\" and \"the\" include the singular and the plural reference unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to \"an agent\" includes a single agent and a plurality of such agents. An \"immunogenic peptide\" or \"antigenic peptide\" is a peptide or epitope that can be recognized by the immune system and elicit an immune response. Immunogenic peptides or antigenic peptide may comprise a motif such that the peptide will bind an MHC molecule and induce a T cell response, or can be recognized by the B cell receptor on the B cell to induce antibody production. These terms are used interchangeably herein. An \"immunogenic epitope\" or \"antigenic epitope\" refers to a part of an antigen is recognized by the immune system, e.g., by antibodies, B cells, or T cells. In some embodiments, the epitope is the specific piece of the antigen to which an antibody binds. Although epitopes are usually non-self proteins, sequences derived from the host can, in some instances, be recognized. \"Immune response\" is how your body recognizes and defends itself against bacteria, viruses, and substances that appear foreign and harmful to the body. In its general form, the immune response begins with the sensitization of helper (TH, CD4+) and cytotoxic (CD8+) T cell subsets through their interaction with antigen presenting cells (APC) that express major histocompatibility (MHC)-class I or class II molecules associated with antigenic fragments (i.e., specific amino acid sequences derived from the antigen which bind to MHC I and/or MHC II for presentation on the cell surface). The sensitized or primed CD4+ T cells produce lymphokines that participate in the activation of B cells as well as various T cell subsets. The sensitized CD8+ T cells increase in numbers in response to lymphokines and are capable of destroying any cells that express the specific antigenic fragments associated with matching MHC-encoded class I molecules. Thus, in the course of a cancerous tumor, CTL eradicate cells expressing cancer associated or cancer specific antigens, thereby limiting the progression of tumor spread and disease development. The \"adaptive immune system,\" also known as the acquired immune system, is a subsystem of the overall immune system that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate or prevent pathogen growth. The adaptive immune system is one of the two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being the innate immune system). Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components. Unlike the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system is highly specific to a particular pathogen or antigen. Adaptive immunity can also provide long-lasting protection. The adaptive system response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. In accordance with the present disclosure, the adaptive immune system response destroys tumor or cancer cells. Sometimes the adaptive system is unable to distinguish harmful from harmless foreign molecules. The cells that carry out the adaptive immune response are white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Two main broad classes\u2014antibody responses and cell mediated immune response\u2014are also carried by two different lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete antibodies, which are proteins also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies travel through the bloodstream and bind to the foreign antigen causing it to inactivate, which does not allow the antigen to bind to the host. In adaptive immunity, pathogen-specific receptors are \"acquired\" during the lifetime of the organism (whereas in innate immunity pathogen-specific receptors are already encoded in the germline). The acquired response is called \"adaptive\" because it prepares the body's immune system for future challenges (though it can actually also be maladaptive when it results in autoimmunity). The immune system is highly adaptable because of somatic hypermutation (a process of accelerated somatic mutations), and V(D)J recombination (an irreversible genetic recombination of antigen receptor gene segments). This mechanism allows a small number of genes to generate a vast number of different antigen receptors, which are then uniquely expressed on each individual lymphocyte. Since the gene rearrangement leads to an irreversible change in the DNA of each cell, all progeny (offspring) of that cell inherit genes that encode the same receptor specificity, including the memory B cells and memory T cells that are the keys to long-lived specific immunity. A \"T cell\" or \"T lymphocyte\" is a type of lymphocyte (a subtype of white blood cell) that plays a central role in cell-mediated immunity. T cells can be distinguished from other lymphocytes, such as B cells and natural killer cells, by the presence of a T-cell receptor on the cell surface. They are called T cells because they mature in the thymus from thymocytes. The several subsets of T cells each have a distinct function. The majority of human T cells rearrange their alpha and beta chains on the cell receptor and are termed alpha beta T cells ( T cells) and are part of the adaptive immune system. Specialized gamma delta T cells, (a small minority of T cells in the human body, more frequent in ruminants), have invariant T cell receptors with limited diversity, that can effectively present antigens to other T cells and are considered to be part of the innate immune system. Effector T cell broadly includes various T cell types that actively respond to a stimulus, such as co-stimulation. This includes helper, killer, regulatory, and potentially other T cell types. One skilled in the art is familiar with different types of T cells and their respective roles in adaptive immune response. A \"human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system\" is a gene complex encoding the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in humans. These cell-surface proteins are responsible for the regulation of the immune system in humans. The HLA gene complex resides on a 3 Mbp stretch within chromosome 6p21. HLA genes are highly polymorphic, which means that they have many different alleles, allowing them to fine-tune the adaptive immune system. The proteins encoded by certain genes are also known as antigens, as a result of their historic discovery as factors in organ transplants. Different classes have different functions: HLAs encoding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I MHC class I (A, B, and C) molecules, which present peptides from inside the cell. \"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I\" or \"MHC class I\" molecules are found on the cell surface of all nucleated cells in the body. Their function is to display peptide fragments of antigens from within the cell to cytotoxic T cells; this will trigger an immediate response from the immune system against a particular non-self antigen displayed with the help of an MHC class I protein. Because MHC class I molecules present peptides derived from cytosolic proteins, the pathway of MHC class I presentation is often called cytosolic or endogenous pathway. Class I MHC molecules bind peptides generated mainly from degradation of cytosolic proteins by the proteasome. The MHC I peptide complex is then inserted via endoplasmic reticulum into the external plasma membrane of the cell. The epitope peptide is bound on extracellular parts of the class I MHC molecule. Thus, the function of the class I MHC is to display intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). However, class I MHC can also present peptides generated from exogenous proteins, in a process known as cross-presentation. A normal cell will display peptides from normal cellular protein turnover on its class I MHC, and CTLs will not be activated in response to them due to central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. When a cell expresses foreign proteins, such as after viral infection, a fraction of the class I MHC will display these peptides on the cell surface. Consequently, CTLs specific for the MHC:peptide complex will recognize and kill presenting cells. Alternatively, class I MHC itself can serve as an inhibitory ligand for natural killer cells (NKs). Reduction in the normal levels of surface class I MHC, a mechanism employed by some viruses during immune evasion or in certain tumors, will activate NK cell killing. Antigens or antigenic epitopes presented by MHC class II molecules are recognized by cytotoxic T cells. HLAs encoding MHC class II (DP, DM, DOA, DOB, DQ, and DR) molecules, which present antigens from outside of the cell to T-lymphocytes. \"Major histocompatibility complex class II\" or \"MHC class II\" molecules are a family of molecules normally found only on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, mononuclear phagocytes, some endothelial cells, thymic epithelial cells, and B cells. The antigens presented by class II peptides are usually derived from extracellular proteins (not cytosolic as in class I); hence, the MHC class II-dependent pathway of antigen presentation is called the endocytic or exogenous pathway. Loading of a MHC class II molecule occurs by phagocytosis; extracellular proteins are endocytosed, digested in lysosomes, and the resulting epitopic peptide fragments are loaded onto MHC class II molecules prior to their migration to the cell surface. Antigens or antigenic epitopes presented by MHC class II molecules are recognized by T helper cells and stimulate the multiplication of T-helper cells, which in turn stimulate antibody-producing B-cells to produce antibodies to that specific antigen. Self-antigens are suppressed by regulatory T cells. An \"antigen-presenting cell (APC)\" is a cell that displays antigen complexed with major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on their surfaces; this process is known as antigen presentation. T cells may recognize these complexes using their T cell receptors (TCRs). These cells process antigens and present them to T-cells. Antigen-presenting cells fall into two categories: professional and non-professional. Those that express MHC class II molecules along with co-stimulatory molecules and pattern recognition receptors are often called professional antigen-presenting cells. The non-professional APCs express MHC class I molecules. Professional APCs specialize in presenting antigen to T cells. They are very efficient at internalizing antigens, either by phagocytosis (macrophages and dendritic cells) or by receptor-mediated endocytosis (B cells), processing the antigen into peptide fragments and then displaying those peptides, bound to a class II MHC molecule, on their membrane.[1] The T cell recognizes and interacts with the antigen-class II MHC molecule complex on the membrane of the antigen-presenting cell. An additional co-stimulatory signal is then produced by the antigen-presenting cell, leading to activation of the T cell. The expression of co-stimulatory molecules and MHC class II are defining features of professional APCs. Almost all cell types can serve as a non-professional APC. They are found in a variety of tissue types. Professional antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells, mononuclear phagocytes, thymic epithelial cells, and B cells, present foreign antigens to helper T cells, while other cell types can present antigens originating inside the cell to cytotoxic T cells. In addition to the MHC family of proteins, antigen presentation relies on other specialized signaling molecules on the surfaces of both APCs and T cells. A \"B lymphocyte\" or \"B cell\" is a type of white blood cell of the lymphocyte subtype. B cells function in the humoral immunity component of the adaptive immune system by secreting antibodies. Additionally, B cells present antigen (they are also classified as professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs)) and secrete cytokines. In mammals, B cells mature in the bone marrow, which is at the core of most bones. B cells express B cell receptors (BCRs) on their cell membrane. BCRs allow the B cell to bind a specific antigen, against which it will initiate an antibody response. \"Cancer immunotherapy\" refers to a type of cancer treatment designed to boost the body's natural defenses to fight the cancer. It uses substances either made by the body or in a laboratory to improve or restore immune system function. \"Tumor specific antigen (TSA)\" or \"tumor associated antigen (TAA)\" refers to a protein that is specifically expressed or upregulated in cells of the respective tumor, as compared to non-cancerous cells of the same origin. A tumor specific antigen, or epitopes derived therefrom, can be recognized by the immune system to induce a immune response. Herein, the terms \"tumor associated antigen\" and \"tumor specific antigen\" are used interchangeably. The tumor specific antigen may be from all protein classes, e.g., enzymes, receptors, transcription factors, etc. A \"heteroclitic epitope\" or \"heteroclitic analog\" refers to an altered version of an endogenous peptide sequence (i.e., an analog) engineered to elicit potent immune reactions. Heteroclitic epitopes have increased stimulatory capacity or potency for a specific T cell, as measured by increased responses to a given dose, or by a requirement of lesser amounts to achieve the same response and therefore provide benefit as vaccine components since these epitopes induce T cell responses stronger than those induced by the native epitope. A \"self-antigen\" refers to an antigen that originates from within the body. The immune system usually does not react to self-antigens under normal homeostatic conditions. Epitopes from self-antigens (i.e., self-epitopes) are found in high concentration on the surface of Antigen-presenting cells (APC's) in association with its major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are known as dominant epitopes. These are stimulants of negative selection mechanisms to remove potentially self-destructing autoreactive T cells. Their \"self\" antigens are displayed to a developing T-cell and signal those \"self-reactive\" T-cells to die via programmed cell death (apoptosis) and thereby deletion from the T cell repertoire, preventing autoimmunity. A \"cryptic epitope\" refers to an epitope derived from a self-antigen that does not necessarily undergo antigen processing/presentation and are 'hidden' from immune recognition. Cryptic epitopes usually appear in very low concentration on APC and do not delete auto-reactive T cells. Cryptic epitopes are not presented for recognition by T cells unless they are produced in unusually large concentrations or unless they are freed from the configuration of their native antigen. Cryptic epitopes derived from tumor-specific antigens may be used to break the tolerance of T cells to the tumor and induce potent immune response against the tumor. Such principles have been described in Pardoll, et al., PNAS, Vol. 96, pp. 5340-5342 (1999), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. A \"neoepitope\" refers to an antigenic epitope generated via random somatic mutations occurring in tumor cells. Neoepitopes are usually derived from individually specific tumor antigens or unique antigens and is thus specific to the lineage of tumor cells it is derived from. Neoepitopes are regarded in the art to be responsible for the immunogenicity of tumors ((Srivastava et al., 1993, Duan et al., 2009; van der Bruggen et al., 2013), and mathematic modeling has predicted the existence of tens to hundreds of neoepitopes in individual human tumors (Srivastava 2009). The recent revolution in high-throughput DNA sequencing and accompanying bioinformatics approaches has finally made it possible to actually identify the individually specific neoepitopes in individual cancers. \"Cancer vaccine,\" as used herein, refers to a composition that induces tumor-specific immunoresponse against a tumor or a tumor-specific antigen. Such immunoresponse is effective in inhibiting tumor growth and/or preventing reoccurrence of tumor. An \"intron\" refers to any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing during maturation of the final RNA product. The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. Sequences that are joined together in the final mature RNA after RNA splicing are exons. Introns are found in the genes of most organisms and many viruses, and can be located in a wide range of genes, including those that generate proteins, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA). When proteins are generated from intron-containing genes, RNA splicing takes place as part of the RNA processing pathway that follows transcription and precedes translation. An \"exon\" refers to any part of a gene that will become a part of the final mature RNA produced by that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing. The term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA. \"RNA splicing\" refers to the processing of a newly synthesized messenger RNA transcript (also referred to as a primary mRNA transcript). After splicing, introns are removed and exons are joined together (ligated) for form mature mRNA molecule containing a complete open reading frame that is decoded and translated into a protein. For nuclear-encoded genes, splicing takes place within the nucleus either co-transcriptionally or immediately after transcription. The molecular mechanism of RNA splicing has been extensively described, e.g., in Pagani et al., Nature Reviews Genetics 5, 389-396, 2004; Clancy et al., Nature Education 1 (1): 31, 2011; Cheng et al., Molecular Genetics and Genomics 286 (5-6): 395-410, 2014; Taggart et al., Nature Structural & Molecular Biology 19 (7): 719-2, 2012, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. One skilled in the art is familiar with the mechanism of RNA splicing. \"Alternative splicing\" refers to a regulated process during gene expression that results in a single gene coding for multiple proteins. In this process, particular exons of a gene may be included within or excluded from the final, processed messenger RNA (mRNA) produced from that gene. Consequently, the proteins translated from alternatively spliced mRNAs will contain differences in their amino acid sequence and, often, in their biological functions. Notably, alternative splicing allows the human genome to direct the synthesis of many more proteins than would be expected from its 20,000 protein-coding genes. Alternative splicing is sometimes also termed differential splicing. Alternative splicing occurs as a normal phenomenon in eukaryotes, where it greatly increases the biodiversity of proteins that can be encoded by the genome; in humans, 95% of multi-exonic genes are alternatively spliced. There are numerous modes of alternative splicing observed, of which the most common is exon skipping. In this mode, a particular exon may be included in mRNAs under some conditions or in particular tissues, and omitted from the mRNA in others. Abnormal variations in splicing are also implicated in disease; a large proportion of human genetic disorders result from splicing variants. Abnormal splicing variants are also thought to contribute to the development of cancer, and splicing factor genes are frequently mutated in different types of cancer. The regulation of alternative splicing is also described in the art, e.g., in Douglas et al., Annual Review of Biochemistry 72 (1): 291-336, 2003; Pan et al., Nature Genetics 40 (12): 1413-1415, 2008; Martin et al., Nature Reviews 6 (5): 386-398, 2005; Skotheim et al., The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology 39 (7-8): 1432-49, 2007, the entire contents of each of which is incorporated herein by reference. A \"coding frame\" or \"open reading frame\" refers to a stretch of codons that encodes a polypeptide. Since DNA is interpreted in groups of three nucleotides (codons), a DNA strand has three distinct reading frames. The double helix of a DNA molecule has two anti-parallel strands so, with the two strands having three reading frames each, there are six possible frame translations. A functional protein may be produced when translation proceeds in the correct coding frame. An insertion or a deletion of one or two bases in the open reading frame causes a shift in the coding frame that is also referred to as a \"frameshift mutation.\" A frameshift mutation typical results in premature translation termination and/or truncated or non-functional protein. The term \"proteome\" refers to the entire set of proteins expressed by a genome, cell, tissue, or organism at a certain time. More specifically, it is the set of expressed proteins in a given type of cell or organism, at a given time, under certain conditions. The term is a blend of proteins and genome. \"Proteome-wide\" refers to each and every protein in the proteome without any bias. The term \"genome\" refers to the genetic material of a cell or organism. It typically includes DNA (or RNA in the case of RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes, the coding regions, the noncoding DNA, and the genomes of the mitochondria and chloroplasts. A genome does not typically include genetic material that is artificially introduced into a cell or organism, e.g., a plasmid that is transformed into a bacteria is not a part of the bacterial genome. A \"programmable DNA-binding protein,\" as used herein, refers to DNA binding proteins that can be programmed to navigate to any desired target nucleotide sequence within the genome. To program the DNA-binding protein to bind a desired nucleotide sequence, the DNA binding protein may be modified to change its binding specificity, e.g., zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) or transcription activator-like effector proteins (TALE). ZFNs are artificial restriction enzymes generated by fusing a zinc finger DNA-binding domain to a DNA-cleavage domain. Zinc finger domains can be engineered to target specific desired DNA sequences and this enables zinc-finger nucleases to target complex genomes. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) are restriction enzymes that can be engineered to cut specific sequences of DNA. They are made by fusing a TAL effector DNA-binding domain to a DNA cleavage domain (a nuclease which cuts DNA strands). Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) can be engineered to bind practically any desired DNA sequence, so when combined with a nuclease, DNA can be cut at specific locations. The restriction enzymes can be introduced into cells, for use in gene editing or for genome editing in situ, Methods of programming ZFNs and TALEs are familiar to one skilled in the art. For example, such methods are described in Maeder, et al., Mol. Cell 31 (2): 294-301, 2008; Carroll et al., Genetics Society of America, 188 (4): 773-782, 2011; Miller et al., Nature Biotechnology 25 (7): 2007; Christian et al., Genetics 186 (2): 757-61, et al., Nucleic Acids Res 39 2010; and Moscou et al., Science 326 (5959): 1501, 2009, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. A \"guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein,\" as used herein, refers to a protein, a polypeptide, or a domain that is able to bind DNA, and the binding to its target DNA sequence is mediated by a guide nucleotide sequence. Thus, it is appreciated that the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein binds to a guide nucleotide sequence. The \"guide nucleotide\" may be a RNA molecule or a DNA molecule (e.g., a single-stranded DNA or ssDNA molecule) that is complementary to the target sequence and can guide the DNA binding protein to the target sequence. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence is an oligonucleotide sequence. As such, a guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein may be a RNA-programmable DNA-binding protein (e.g., a Cas9 protein), or an ssDNA-programmable DNA-binding protein (e.g., an Argonaute protein). \"Programmable\" means the DNA-binding protein may be programmed to bind any DNA sequence that the guide nucleotide targets. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence exists as a single nucleotide molecule and comprises comprise two domains: (1) a domain that shares homology to a target nucleic acid (e.g., and directs binding of a guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein to the target); and (2) a domain that binds a guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide is a guide RNA (gRNA). In some embodiments, domain (2) of the gRNA corresponds to a sequence known as a tracrRNA, and comprises a stem-loop structure. For example, in some embodiments, domain (2) is identical or homologous to a tracrRNA as provided in Jinek et al., Science 337:816-821(2012), the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. Other examples of gRNAs (e.g., those including domain 2) can be found in U.S. Provisional Patent Application, U.S. Ser. No. 61/874,682, filed Sep. 6, 2013, entitled \"Switchable Cas9 Nucleases And Uses Thereof,\" and U.S. Provisional Patent Application, U.S. Ser. No. 61/874,746, filed Sep. 6, 2013, entitled \"Delivery System For Functional Nucleases,\" the entire contents of each are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Because the guide nucleotide sequence hybridizes to target DNA sequence, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding proteins are able to be targeted, in principle, to any sequence specified by the guide nucleotide sequence. Methods of using guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein, such as Cas9, for site-specific cleavage (e.g., to modify a genome) are known in the art (see e.g., Cong, L. et al. Science 339, 819-823 (2013); Mali, P. et al. Science 339, 823-826 (2013); Hwang, W. Y. et al. Nature biotechnology 31, 227-229 (2013); Jinek, M. et al. eLife 2, e00471 J. E. et al. Nucleic acids research (2013); Jiang, W. et al. Nature biotechnology 31, 233-239 (2013); the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference). It is to be understood that any DNA binding domain that is programmable by a guide nucleotide sequence may be used in accordance with the present disclosure. For example, in some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein may be a Cas9 protein, or a variant thereof. One skilled in the art would understand that the present disclosure is not limited to the use of Cas9 as the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein, but that other DNA binding proteins that adopt similar mechanism of target sequence binding may also be used. As used herein, the term \"Cas9\" or \"Cas9 nuclease\" refers to an RNA-guided nuclease comprising a Cas9 protein, a fragment, or a variant thereof. A Cas9 nuclease is also referred to sometimes as a casn1 nuclease or a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-associated nuclease. CRISPR is an adaptive immune system that provides protection against mobile genetic elements (viruses, transposable elements and conjugative plasmids). CRISPR clusters contain spacers, sequences complementary to antecedent mobile elements, and target invading nucleic acids. CRISPR clusters are transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNA (crRNA). In type II CRISPR systems correct processing of pre-crRNA requires a trans-encoded small RNA (tracrRNA), endogenous ribonuclease 3 (rnc) and a Cas9 protein. The tracrRNA serves as a guide for ribonuclease 3-aided processing of pre-crRNA. Subsequently, Cas9/crRNA/tracrRNA endonucleolytically cleaves linear or circular dsDNA target complementary to the spacer. The target strand not complementary to crRNA is first cut endonucleolytically, then trimmed 3-5 exonucleolytically. In nature, DNA-binding and cleavage typically requires protein and both RNAs. However, single guide RNAs (\"sgRNA\", or simply \"gNRA\") can be engineered so as to incorporate aspects of both the crRNA and tracrRNA into a single RNA species. See, e.g., Jinek et al., Science 337:816-821(2012), the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. Cas9 nuclease sequences and structures are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Ferretti et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98:4658-4663(2001); Deltcheva E. al., Nature 471:602-607(2011); and Jinek et al., Science 337:816-821(2012), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference). Cas9 orthologs have been described in various species, including, but not limited to, S. pyogenes and S. thermophilus. Additional suitable Cas9 nucleases and sequences will be apparent to those of skill in the art based on this disclosure, and such Cas9 nucleases and sequences include Cas9 sequences from the organisms and loci disclosed in Chylinski et al., (2013) RNA Biology 10:5, 726-737; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, wild type Cas9 ID 1 (amino acid). In some embodiments, wild type Cas9 corresponds to Cas9 from Streptococcus aureus. S. aureus Cas9 wild type (SEQ ID NO: 6) In some embodiments, wild type Cas9 corresponds to Cas9 from Streptococcus thermophilus. In some embodiments, the Cas9 domain of any of the fusion proteins provided herein is a Cas9 from archaea (e.g. nanoarchaea), which constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled prokaryotic microbes. In some embodiments, the Cas9 domain is CasX or CasY, which have been described in, for example, Burstein et al., \"New CRISPR-Cas systems from uncultivated microbes.\" Cell 2017 Feb. 21. doi: 10.1038/cr.2017.21, which incorporated herein by reference. Using genome-resolved metagenomics, a number of CRISPR-Cas systems were identified, including the first reported Cas9 in the archaeal domain of life. This divergent Cas9 protein was found in nanoarchaea as part of an active CRISPR-Cas system. In bacteria, two previously unknown systems were discovered, CRISPR-CasX and CRISPR-CasY, which are among the most compact systems yet discovered. In some embodiments, Cas9 refers to CasX, or a variant of CasX. In some embodiments, Cas9 refers to a CasY, or a variant of CasY. It should be appreciated that other RNA-guided DNA binding proteins may be used as a nucleic acid programmable DNA binding protein (napDNAbp) and are within the scope of this disclosure. In some embodiments, the Cas9 domain comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5% identical to a naturally-occurring CasX or CasY protein. In some embodiments, the Cas9 domain is a naturally-occurring CasX or CasY protein. In some embodiments, the Cas9 domain comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5% identical to any one of SEQ ID NOs: 336-337 or 3000. In some embodiments, the Cas9 domain comprises an amino acid sequence of any one SEQ ID NOs: 336-337 or 3000. It should be appreciated that CasX and CasY from other bacterial species may also be used in accordance with the present disclosure. In some embodiments, wild-type Cas9 refers to refers from a Parcubacteria a Cas9 from any of the organisms listed in Example 1 (SEQ ID NOs: 11-260). To be used as in the fusion protein of the present disclosure as the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein domain, a Cas9 protein needs to be nuclease inactive. A nuclease-inactive Cas9 protein may interchangeably be referred to as a \"dCas9\" protein (for nuclease-\"dead\" Cas9). Methods for generating a Cas9 protein (or a fragment thereof) having an inactive DNA cleavage domain are known (See, e.g., Jinek et al., Science. 337:816-821(2012); Qi et al., (2013) Cell. 28; 152(5):1173-83, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference). For example, the DNA cleavage domain of Cas9 is known to include two subdomains, cleaves the non-complementary strand. Mutations these subdomains can silence the nuclease activity of Cas9. For example, the mutations D10A and H840A completely inactivate the nuclease activity of S. pyogenes Cas9 (Jinek et al., Science. 337:816-821(2012); Qi et al., Cell. 28; 152(5):1173-83 (2013)). The dCas9 of the present disclosure encompasses completely inactive Cas9 or partially inactive Cas9. For example, the dCas9 may have one of the two nuclease domain inactivated, while the other nuclease domain remains active. Such a partially active Cas9 may also be referred to as a Cas9 nickase, due to its ability to cleave one strand of the targeted DNA sequence. The Cas9 nickase suitable for use in accordance with the present disclosure has an active HNH domain and an inactive RuvC domain and is able to cleave only the strand of the target DNA that is bound by the sgRNA. The Cas9 nickase of the present disclosure may comprise mutations that inactivate the RuvC domain, e.g., a D10A mutation. It is to be understood that any mutation that inactivates the RuvC domain may be included in a Cas9 nickase, e.g., insertion, deletion, or single or multiple amino acid substitution in the RuvC domain. In a Cas9 nickase described herein, while the RuvC domain is inactivated, the HNH domain remains activate. Thus, while the Cas9 nickase may comprise mutations other than those that inactivate the RuvC domain (e.g., D10A), those mutations do not affect the activity of the HNH domain. In a non-limiting Cas9 nickase example, the histidine at position 840 remains unchanged. The sequence of an exemplary Cas9 nickase suitable for the present disclosure is provided below. It is appreciated that when the term \"dCas9\" or \"nuclease-inactive Cas9\" is used herein, it refers to variants that are inactive in both HNH and RuvC domains as well as Cas9 nickases. For example, the dCas9 used in the present disclosure may include the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3. In some embodiments, the dCas9 may comprise other mutations that inactivate RuvC or HNH domain. Additional suitable mutations that inactivate Cas9 will be apparent to those of skill in the art based on this disclosure and knowledge in the field, and are within the scope of this disclosure. Such additional exemplary suitable nuclease-inactive Cas9 domains include, but are not limited to, D839A and/or N863A (See, e.g., Prashant et al., Nature Biotechnology. 2013; 31(9): 833-838, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference), or K603R (See, e.g., Chavez et al., Nature Methods 12, 326-328, 2015, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference). The term Cas9, dCas9, or Cas9 variant also encompasses Cas9, dCas9, or Cas9 variant from any organism. Also appreciated is that dCas9, Cas9 nickase, or other appropriate Cas9 variants from any organisms may be used in accordance with the present disclosure. A \"deaminase\" refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the removal of an amine group from a molecule, or deamination. In some embodiments, deaminase to uracil (e.g., in RNA) or thymine (e.g., in DNA). In some embodiments, the deaminase is a naturally-occurring deaminase from an organism, such as a human, chimpanzee, gorilla, monkey, cow, dog, rat, or mouse. In some embodiments, the deaminase is a variant of a naturally-occurring deaminase from an organism, that does not occur in nature. For example, in some embodiments, the deaminase or deaminase domain is at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75% at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5% identical to a naturally-occurring deaminase from an organism. A \"cytosine deaminase\" refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction \"cytosine+H2Ouracil+NH3\" or \"5-methyl-cytosine+H2Othymine+NH3.\" As it may be apparent from the reaction formula, such chemical reactions result in a C to U/T nucleobase change. In the context of a gene, such nucleotide change, or mutation, may in turn lead to an amino acid residue change in the protein, which may affect the protein function, e.g., loss-of-function or gain-of-function. One exemplary suitable class of cytosine deaminases is the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing complex (APOBEC) family of cytosine deaminases encompassing eleven proteins that serve to initiate mutagenesis in a controlled and beneficial manner. The apolipoprotein B editing complex 3 (APOBEC3) enzyme provides protection to human cells against a certain HIV-1 strain via the deamination of cytosines in reverse-transcribed viral ssDNA. Zn2+-coordinating motif (His-X-Glu-X23-26-Pro-Cys-X2-4-Cys; SEQ ID NO: 820) and bound water molecule for catalytic activity. The Glu residue acts to activate the water molecule to a zinc hydroxide for nucleophilic attack in the deamination reaction. Each family member preferentially deaminates at its own particular \"hotspot\", ranging from WRC (W is A or T, R is A or G) for hAID, to TTC for hAPOBEC3F. A recent crystal structure of the catalytic domain of APOBEC3G revealed a secondary structure comprised of a five-stranded -sheet core flanked by six -helices, which is believed to be conserved across the entire family. The active center loops have been shown to be responsible for both ssDNA binding and in determining \"hotspot\" identity. Overexpression of these enzymes has been linked to genomic instability and cancer, thus highlighting the importance of sequence-specific targeting. Another suitable cytosine deaminase is the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which is responsible for the maturation of antibodies by converting cytosines in ssDNA to uracils in a transcription-dependent, strand-biased fashion. Herein, a \"nucleobase editor\" refers to to a protein that edits a nucleotide base. \"Edit\" refers to the conversion of one nucleotide base to another. For example, the nucleobase may target C bases in a nucleic acid sequence and convert the C to T base. In some embodiments, the C to T editing is carried out by a deaminase, e.g., a cytosine deaminase. Other types of base conversions are also contemplated. In some embodiments, the nucleobase editor comprises a DNA binding domain that directs it to a target sequence. As such, a base editor may be a cytosine deaminase-dCas9 fusion protein. In some embodiments, the base editor may be a deaminase-dCas9-UGI fusion protein. In some embodiments, the base editor may be a APOBEC1-dCas9-UGI fusion protein. In some embodiments, the base editor may be APOBEC1-Cas9 nickase-UGI fusion protein. In some embodiments, the base editor may be APOBEC1-dCpf1-UGI fusion protein. In some embodiments, the base editor may be APOBEC1-dNgAgo-UGI fusion protein. In some embodiments, the base editor may be a pmCDA1-Cas9 nickase-UGI fusion protein. In some embodiments, the base editor may be a human APOBEC3G-Cas9 nickase UGI fusion protein. In some embodiments, the base editor may comprise a second UGI domain. Non-limiting exemplary sequences of the nucleobase editors described herein are provided in Example 1, SEQ ID NOs: 293-302, 1071, and 1084.

Longer or shorter linkers are also contemplated. The term \"mutation,\" as used herein, refers to a substitution of a residue within a sequence, e.g., a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence, with another residue, or a deletion or insertion of one or more residues within a sequence. Mutations are typically described herein by identifying the original residue followed by the position of the residue within the sequence and by the identity of the newly substituted residue.

Despite the presence of immunosurveillance, cancers can develop in apparently immunocompetent animals and humans, due to the ability of cancer cells to evade immunosurveillance (e.g., as described in Hanahan et al., Cell 2000; 100: 57-70 Nat Rev 6: 715-727, each of which in incorporated herein by reference). The evasion of cancer cells from immunosurveillance occurs via various well-characterized mechanisms, including induction of T-cell tolerance by autochthonous tumors (e.g., as described in Willimsky et al., Nature 2005; 437: 141-146, incorporated herein by reference), cancer immunoediting (e.g., as described in Dunn et al., Nat Immunol 2002; 3: 991-998, incorporated herein by reference), and development of an immune suppressive cancer microenvironment (e.g., as described in Zou et al., Nat Rev Cancer 2005; 5: 263-274, incorporated herein by reference). Therapeutic cancer vaccines or adoptive immunotherapy are being developed and tested as potential approaches to strengthen the immune responses after tumor arise in order to slow their progression and prevent their recurrence. Immunotherapeutic approaches, e.g., cancer vaccines have been described but are only partially successful (e.g., as described in Finn et al., Nat Rev Immunol 2003; 3: 630-641, incorporated herein by reference). Described herein are systems, methods, compositions, and kits for producing immunogenic peptides derived from tumor specific antigens (e.g., heteroclitic epitopes or cryptic epitopes) that may be used as cancer vaccines in vivo or ex vivo. Targeted mutations are introduced into tumor-specific antigens using a gene editing agent, e.g., a nucleobase editor comprising a programmable DNA binding domain (e.g., a catalytically-inactive Cas9 or Cas9 nickase) fused to a cytosine deaminase, to generate altered versions of peptides arising from the tumor-specific antigens (heteroclitic epitopes) or peptides arising from normally untranslated regions of the tumor-specific antigen genes (cryptic peptides). The heteroclitic peptides or cryptic peptides may be generated in vivo in a subject (e.g., a subject who has cancer) and presented to the adaptive immune system via the MHC class I or MHC class II pathway, which in turn induces a strong adaptive immune response, e.g., T cell response and B cell response. Such an adaptive immune response is antigen specific and is effective in reducing tumor growth and preventing metastasis. The advantage of the cancer vaccines of the present disclosure is that the vaccine (e.g., antigenic peptides derived from tumor-specific antigens) is generated from the genome and the proteome of the malignant cells in vivo and is highly personalized. The cancer vaccines described herein are also highly cancer-specific and do not induce unwanted immune response against \"self,\" since the immunogenic epitopes are derived from tumor-specific antigens. Further, the adaptive immune response induced by the cancer vaccine described herein confer \"memory\" to the immune system, promoting the immune system to efficiently recognize \"neoepitopes\" generated due to the highly mutagenic nature of the cancer genome, thus preventing metastasis and facilitate remission. To enhance the efficacy of the cancer vaccines described herein, combination therapies using an immune checkpoint inhibitor in conjunction with the cancer vaccine is also contemplated, aiming to enhance the tumor antigen specific immune response. The methods of producing endogenous cancer vaccines in vivo are enabled by the targeted nucleobase editing technology described herein. Such base editing technology is described in the art, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 9,068,179, US Patent Application Publications US 2015/0166980, US 2015/0166981, US 2015/0166982, US20150166984, and US20150165054, and US Provisional Applications, U.S. Ser.

A large number of proteins that specifically express in tumor cells or are upregulated in tumor cells have been identified (Hassane et al., Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine. 6th edition). The known tumor specific antigens are classified into different classes. a) Cancer-testis antigens: The first TAAs ever identified that can be recognized by T cells belong to this class, which was originally called cancer-testis (CT) antigens because of the expression of its members in histologically different human tumors and, among normal tissues, only in spermatocytes/spermatogonia of testis and, occasionally, in placenta. Since the cells of testis do not express class I and II HLA molecules, these antigens cannot be recognized by T cells in normal tissues and can therefore be considered as immunologically tumor-specific. Well-known examples of CT antigens are the members or NY-ESO-1. b) Differentiation antigens: These TAAs are shared between tumors and normal tissue from which the tumor arose; most are found in melanomas and normal melanocytes. Many of these melanocyte lineage-related proteins are involved in the biosynthesis of melanin and are therefore not tumor specific but nevertheless are widely used for cancer immunotherapy. Examples include, but are not limited to, tyrosinase and Melan-A/MART-1 for melanoma, and PSA for prostate cancer. c) Overexpressed TAAs: Genes encoding widely expressed TSAs have been detected in histologically different types of tumors as well as in many normal tissues, generally with lower expression levels. It is possible that many of the epitopes processed and potentially presented by normal tissues are below the threshold level for T-cell recognition, while their overexpression in tumor cells can trigger an anticancer response by breaking previously established tolerance. Examples of this class of TAAs are Her-2/neu, Survivin, Telomerase and WT1. d) Tumor specific antigens: These unique TAAs arise from mutations of normal genes (such as -catenin, CDK4, etc.). Some of these molecular changes are associated with neoplastic transformation and/or progression. Tumor specific antigens are generally able to induce strong immune responses without bearing the risk for autoimmune reactions against normal tissues. On the other hand, these TAAs are in most cases only relevant to the exact tumor on which they were identified and are usually not shared between many individual tumors. e) TAAs arising from abnormal post-translational modifications: Such TSAs may arise from proteins which are neither specific nor overexpressed in tumors but nevertheless become tumor associated by posttranslational processes primarily active in tumors. Examples for this class arise from altered glycosylation patterns leading to novel epitopes in tumors (e.g., MUC1). f) Oncoviral proteins: These TSAs are viral proteins that may play a critical role in the oncogenic process, and because they are foreign (not of human origin), they can evoke a T-cell response. Examples of such proteins are the human papilloma type 16 virus proteins, E6 and E7, which are expressed in cervical carcinoma. TAAs are a starting point for the development of a tumor vaccine. The methods for identifying and characterizing the TAAs are based on the use of cytoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that can be isolated from patients or healthy subjects, or they are based on the generation of differential transcription profiles or differential peptide expression patterns between tumors and normal tissues. In some embodiments, the tumor-specific antigen is expressed in a broad range of different types of cancers. In some embodiments, the tumor-specific antigen is expressed only in one or a few types of cancers. The anti-cancer immune response described herein is antigen-specific. As such, an immune response induced by a tumor-specific antigen is specific to cancer types where the said antigen is expressed. Non-limiting, exemplary tumor-specific antigens that may be edited to generate immunogenic epitopes are provided in Tables 1-3. It is appreciated that the examples are for illustration purpose only, and the methods described herein may be applied to any tumor-specific antigen. In some embodiments, the immunogenic peptide or epitope is a portion of the tumor-specific antigen. For example, the immunogenic peptide or epitope may be a portion of the tumor-specific antigen that is 5-40 amino acids long. In some embodiments, the immunogenic peptide or epitope is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40 amino acids long. In some embodiments, the immunogenic peptide or epitope comprises modifications, e.g., amino acid substitutions (also termed \"heteroclitic epitopes\"), as compared to the native sequence in the tumor specific antigen. In some embodiments, the immunogenic peptide or epitope comprises more than one amino acid substitutions (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, or more) compared to the native sequence of the tumor-specific antigen it is derived from. In some embodiments, a heteroclitic peptide or epitope may be at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to the native sequence that it is derived from. In some embodiments, a to the native sequence that it is derived from. In some embodiments, a heteroclitic peptide or epitope is more immunogenic than a peptide of its native sequence. For example, a heteroclitic epitope may be at least 30% more immunogenic (i.e., induces a stronger immune response) than its corresponding native peptide. In some embodiments, a heteroclitic epitope may be at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 100%, at least 2-fold, at least 3-fold, at least 4-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 6-fold, at least 7-fold, at least 8-fold, at least 9-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 20-fold, at least 30-fold, at least 40-fold, at least 50-fold, at least 60-fold, at least 70-fold, at least 80-fold, at least 90-fold, at least 100-fold, or more immunogenic than its corresponding native peptide. In some embodiments, the peptide or epitope is a cryptic peptide or epitope, e.g., generated from translation of a non-coding region of the tumor specific antigen gene or translation of a different reading frame of a coding region of the tumor specific antigen. A cryptic peptide or epitope may be more immunogenic (i.e., induces a stronger immune response) than any native peptide derived from the tumor associated antigen. For example, a cryptic peptide or epitope may be at least 30% more immunogenic than any native peptide derived from the tumor associated antigen. In some embodiments, a cryptic peptide or epitope may be at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 100%, at least 2-fold, at least 3-fold, at least 4-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 6-fold, at least 7-fold, at least 8-fold, at least 9-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 20-fold, at least 30-fold, at least 40-fold, at least 50-fold, at least 60-fold, at least 70-fold, at least 80-fold, at least 90-fold, at least 100-fold, or more immunogenic than any native peptide derived from the tumor associated antigen. One skilled in the art is familiar with how to assess the immune response induced by an antigen, e.g., measuring antibody titers. Tumor specific antigens from which antigenic epitopes (e.g., heteroclitic epitopes and cryptic are provided in Tables 1-3. (HLA\u2014human leukocyte antigen type) The identification of heteroclitic peptides are described in the art. For example, in previous studies (Selby, et al., J.

Med. 183:527 (1996), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference), heteroclitic epitopes were fortuitously identified by eluting naturally occurring mutant peptides from melanoma cells, or by systematically screening a large number of epitopes consisting of substitutions at almost every position in the epitope (Zaremba, et al., Cancer Research, 57:4570 (1997), Loftus, et al., Cancer Research 58:2433 (1998), Blake, et al., J. Exp. Med. 18:121 (1996), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference). Alternatively, heteroclitic epitopes were identified by screening random combinatorial peptide libraries which also has required the arduous synthesis and screening of large numbers of peptides (Pinilla, et al., Current Opinion in Immunology 11:193-202 (1999), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference). Genetic approaches, such as screening of DNA expression libraries, have provided another method for generating CTL epitopes and analogs (Boon, et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:337-65 (1994), Gavin, et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 24(9):2124-33 (1994), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference).Generating Cancer Vaccine in Tumor Cells Some aspects of the present disclosure provide systems, compositions, and methods of editing genes encoding tumor specific antigens in vivo (e.g., in tumor cells in a subject) or ex vivo (e.g., in isolated tumor cells) to introduce mutations in the genes encoding tumor specific antigens. In some embodiments, such mutations lead to the production of heteroclitic peptides that are more immunogenic than native peptides of the tumor-specific antigen. In some embodiments, such mutations lead to the translation of a non-coding region of the tumor specific antigen, which results in cryptic peptides that are more immunogenic than any native peptides from the tumor specific antigen. The gene editing methods described herein, rely on nucleobase editors as described in, in U.S. Pat.

No. 15/311,852, filed Oct. 22, 2016; and in Komor et al., Nature, Programmable editing of a target base in genomic DNA without double-stranded DNA cleavage, 533, 420-424 (2016), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. The nucleobase editors are highly efficient at precisely editing a target base in any of the tumor associated antigen genes described herein, and a DNA double stand break is not necessary for the gene editing, thus reducing genome instability and preventing possible oncogenic modifications that may be caused by other genome editing methods. The nucleobase editors described herein may be programmed to target and modify a single base. In some embodiments, the target base is a cytosine (C) base and may be converted to a thymine (T) base via deamination by the nucleobase editor. To edit the polynucleotide encoding a tumor associated antigen, the polynucleotide is contacted with a nucleobase editor as described herein. In some embodiments, the tumor-associated antigen encoding polynucleotide is contacted with a nucleobase editor and a guide nucleotide sequence, wherein the guide nucleotide sequence targets the nucleobase editor the target base (e.g., a C base) in the tumor-associated antigen encoding polynucleotide. In some embodiments, the tumor-associated antigen encoding polynucleotide is the tumor-associated antigen gene locus in the genomic DNA of a cell (e.g., a tumor cell). In some embodiments, the tumor cell is a cultured cell. In some embodiments, the tumor cell is in vivo. In some embodiments, the tumor cell is ex vivo. In some embodiments, the tumor cell is from a mammal. In some embodiments, the mammal is a human. In some embodiments, the mammal is a rodent. In some embodiments, the rodent is a mouse. In some embodiments, the rodent is a rat. In some embodiments, the tumor-associated antigen encoding polynucleotide may be a DNA molecule comprising a coding strand and a complementary strand, e.g., the tumor-associated antigen gene locus in the genome of a tumor cell. In some embodiments, the tumor-associated antigen encoding polynucleotide may also include coding regions (e.g., exons) and non-coding regions (e.g., introns or splicing sites). In some embodiments, the target base (e.g., a C base) is located in the coding region (e.g., an exon) of the tumor-associated antigen encoding polynucleotide. As such, the conversion of a base in the coding region may result in an amino acid change in the tumor-associated antigen protein sequence, i.e., a mutation. Tumor associated antigens comprising the desired mutation(s), once degraded (e.g., via any of the protein degradation pathways, such as degradation by the proteasome) results in immunogenic heteroclitic epitopes. In some embodiments, the target base is located in a non-coding region of the tumor-associated antigen gene, e.g., in an intron or a splice site. In some embodiments, a target base is located in a splice site, and the editing of such target base causes alternative splicing of the tumor-associated antigen mRNA. In some embodiments, the alternative splicing leads to translation of a non-coding region of the tumor-associated antigen gene, generating epitopes or cryptic epitopes) may be presented by the tumor cell, or a professional antigen presenting cell, and be recognized by the immune system, thus eliciting a tumor-specific immune response (e.g., T-cell response or B-cell response). To edit a tumor-associated antigen gene, the tumor-associated antigen gene (a polynucleotide molecule) may be contacted with the nucleobase editor, wherein the nucleobase editor binds to its target sequence and edits the desired base. For example, the nucleobase editor may be expressed in a cell where editing is desired (e.g., a tumor), allowing editing of the tumor-associated antigen gene by the nucleobase editor. In some embodiments, the binding of the nucleobase editor to its target sequence in the tumor-associated antigen gene is mediated by a guide nucleotide sequence, e.g., a nucleotide molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to one of the strands of the target sequence in the tumor-associated antigen gene. Thus, by designing the guide nucleotide sequence, the nucleobase editor may be programmed to edit any target base in any tumor associated antigen gene. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence is co-expressed with the nucleobase editor in a tumor cell where editing is desired. In some embodiments, a nucleobase editor/gRNA complex is delivered to the cell where editing is desired (e.g., a tumor cell). Provided herein are non-limiting, exemplary heteroclitic epitopes and cryptic epitopes that may be produced via base editing and strategies for making them.Codon Change Using the nucleobase editors described herein, several amino acid codons may be converted to a different codon via deamination of a target base within the codon. For example, in some embodiments, a cytosine (C) base is converted to a thymine (T) base via deamination by a nucleobase editor comprising a cytosine deaminase domain (e.g., APOBEC1 or AID). It is worth noting that during a C to T change via deamination (e.g., by a cytosine deaminase such as APOBEC1 or AID), the cytosine is first converted to a uridine (U), leading to a G:U mismatch. The G:U mismatch is then converted by DNA repair and replication pathways to T:A pair, thus introducing the thymine at the position of the original cytosine. As such, deamination of a C base results in a C-G base pair being replaced by a T-A base pair. As is familiar to one skilled in the art, conversion of a base in an amino acid codon may lead to a change of the amino acid the codon encodes. Cytosine deaminases are capable of converting a cytosine (C) base to a thymine (T) base via deamination. Thus, it is envisioned that, for amino acid codons containing a C base, the C base may be directly converted to T. For example, codon for leucine (CTC) may be changed to a TTC (phenylalanine) codon via the deamination of the first C on the coding strand. For amino acid codons that contain a guanine (G) base, a C base is present on the complementary strand; and the G base may be converted to an adenosine (A) via the deamination of the C on the complementary strand. For example, an ATG (Met/M) codon may be converted to a ATA (Ile/I) codon via the deamination of the third C on the complementary strand. In some embodiments, two C to T changes are required to convert a codon to a different codon. Non-limiting examples of possible mutations that may be made in any tumor associated antigens by the nucleobase editors of the present disclosure are summarized in Table 4. Such amino acid substitutions introduced via base editing generate heteroclitic epitopes. Non-limiting examples of heteroclitic epitopes that may be generated from tumor associated antigens by nucleobase editors are summarized in Table 5. In some embodiments, to bind to its target sequence and edit the desired base, the nucleobase editor depends on its guide nucleotide sequence (e.g., a guide RNA). In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence is a gRNA sequence. A gRNA typically comprises a tracrRNA framework allowing for Cas9 binding, and a guide sequence, which confers sequence specificity to fusion proteins disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the guide RNA comprises the structure 5-[guide sequence]-guuuuagagcuagaaauagcaaguuaaaauaaaggcuaguccguuaucaacuugaaaaaguggcaccgagucggugcuu uuu-3 (SEQ ID NO: 336), wherein the guide sequence comprises a sequence that is complementary to the target sequence. Other suitable tracrRNA framework sequences are provided in Table 11. The guide sequence is typically about 20 nucleotides long. In certain embodiments, the guide sequence may be 15-25 nucleotides long. In some embodiments, the guide sequence is 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 nucleotides long. Such suitable guide RNA sequences typically comprise guide sequences that are complementary to a nucleic sequence within 50 (e.g., within 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 35, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, or 10) nucleotides upstream or downstream of the target nucleotide to be edited. Guide sequences that may be used to target the nucleobase editor to its target sequence to induce specific mutations in tumor associated antigen genes are provided in Table 5. It is to be understood that the mutations and guide sequences presented herein are for illustration purpose only and are not meant to be limiting. Some aspects of the present disclosure provide strategies for generating cryptic epitopes in tumor cells. In some embodiments, such strategies involve alterations of splicing sites in a tumor associated antigen gene. Altered splicing site may lead to altered splicing of an mRNA that encodes a tumor associated antigen. One outcome of altered splicing is the translation of an otherwise non-coding region of the gene, leading to otherwise \"hidden peptides,\" i.e., cryptic epitopes. The splicing site typically comprises an intron donor site, a Lariat branch point, and an intron acceptor site. The mechanism of splicing are familiar to those skilled in the art. The intron donor site has a consensus sequence of GGGTRAGT, and the C bases paired with the G bases in the intron donor site consensus sequence may be targeted by a nucleobase editor, thereby altering the intron donor site. The Lariat branch point also has a consensus sequence, e.g., YTRAC, wherein Y is a pyrimidine, and R is a purine. The C base in the Lariat branch point consensus sequence may be targeted by the nucleobase editors described herein, leading to skipping of the following exon. The intron acceptor site has a consensus sequence of YNCAGG, wherein Y is a pyrimidine, and N is any nucleotide. The C base of the consensus sequence of the intron acceptor site, and the C base paired with the G bases in the consensus sequence of the intron acceptor site may be targeted by the nucleobase editors described herein, thereby altering the intron acceptor site, in turn leading to skipping of an exon. General strategies of altering the splicing sites are described in Table 6. Non-limiting, exemplary cryptic epitopes that may be produced using the base editing methods described herein are provided in Table 7. In some embodiments, the nucleobase editor may be used to introduce a premature stop codon (a stop codon that occurs upstream of the normal stop codon) into a tumor specific antigen gene (e.g., TAA, TAG, and TGA). In some embodiments, introduction of a premature stop codon destabilizes the tumor specific antigen. In some embodiments, destabilization of the tumor specific antigen leads to enhanced presentation of immunogenic epitopes (e.g., heteroclitic epitopes or cryptic epitopes). Premature stop codons are introduced by changing one or more bases in a target codon that encodes a target residue. For example, nucleobase editors including a cytosine deaminase domain are capable of converting a cytosine (C) base to a thymine (T) base via deamination. Thus, it is envisioned that, for amino acid codons containing a C base, the C base may be converted to T. For example, a CAG (Gln/Q) codon may be changed to a TAG (amber) codon via the deamination of the first C on the coding strand. For sense codons that contain a guanine (G) base, a C base is present on the complementary strand; and the G base may be converted to an adenosine (A) via the deamination of the C on the complementary strand. For example, a TGG (Trp/W) codon may be converted to a TAG (amber) codon via the deamination of the second C on the complementary strand. In some embodiments, two C to T changes are required to convert a codon to a nonsense codon. For example, a CGG (R) codon is converted to a TAG (amber) codon via the deamination of the first C on the coding strand and the deamination of the second C on the complementary strand. In some embodiments, the target residue is located in a flexible loop region of the tumor specific antigen. In some embodiments, tandem premature stop codons are introduced. Non-limiting examples of codons that may be changed to stop codons via base editing are provided in Table 8. In some embodiments, cryptic epitopes are generated by shifting the coding frame of a tumor specific antigen gene. In some embodiments, the coding frame is shifted by changing a start codon (ATG) to a sense codon that cannot be used as a start codon. As such, translation will start at the next start codon in the coding region, and the coding frame may be shifted. In some embodiments, a normal sense codon may be edited to generate a start codon to allow translation to start at the newly generated start codon, which may also lead to shifting of the coding frame. Alterations of start codons and the resulting shift in the coding frame generate peptides that would not otherwise be generated from the tumor specific antigen gene (i.e., cryptic epitopes). Non-limiting, exemplary start codon alterations that may be achieved by the nucleobase editors described herein are provided in Table 9. The tumor associated antigens listed in Table 5 and Table 6 and their respective gene sequences and protein sequences are known in the art. The amino acid sequence of the listed tumor specific antigens are listed in Table 10. In some embodiments, cancer vaccines containing immunogenic peptides from tumor specific antigens (e.g., heteroclitic epitopes and cryptic epitopes) are generated in vivo (e.g., in tumor cells in a subject) or ex vivo (e.g., in tumor cells isolated from a subject). In some embodiments, the tumor cells are treated with the nucleobase editors to generate the immunogenic peptides and are irradiated and administered to the subject as whole-cell cancer vaccines. To edit the genes encoding the tumor associated antigens, the nucleobase editor and/or the guide nucleotide sequence is introduced into the cell (e.g., a tumor cell) where the editing occurs. In some embodiments, nucleic acid molecules (e.g., expression vectors) encoding the nucleobase editors and/or the guide nucleotide sequences are delivered into the cell, resulting in co-expression of nucleobase editors and/or the guide nucleotide sequences in the cell. The nucleic acid molecules encoding the nucleobase editors and/or the guide nucleotide sequences may be delivered into the cell using any known methods in the art, e.g., transfection (e.g., transfection mediated by cationic liposomes), transduction (e.g., via viral infection) and electroporation. In some embodiments, an isolated nucleobase editor/gRNA complex is delivered. Methods of delivering an isolated protein to a cell is familiar to those skilled in the art. For example, the isolated nucleobase editor in complex with a gRNA be associated with a supercharged, cell-penetrating protein or peptide, which facilitates its entry into a cell (e.g., as described in PCT Application Publication WO2010129023 and US Patent Application Publication US20150071906, incorporated herein by reference). In some embodiments, the isolated nucleobase editor in complex with a gRNA may be delivered by a the nucleobase editor and the gRNA may be delivered separately. Other suitable delivery methods may also be used, e.g., AAV mediated gene transfer. Strategies for delivery a Cas9-based genome editing agent (e.g., the nucleobase editor described herein) using AAV have been described, e.g., in Zetsche et al., Nature Biotechnology 33, 139-142 (2015), incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, once generated, the immunogenic peptide is displayed on the surface of the tumor cell via the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. In some embodiments, the immunogenic peptide is displayed on the surface of an antigen presenting cell (APC) via the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway. In some embodiments, the APC is selected from the group consisting of: tumor cells, dendritic cells, mononuclear phagocytes, thymic epithelial cells, B cells. In some embodiments, the immunogenic peptide elicits an adaptive immune response against the tumor-specific antigen where the peptide is derived from. In some embodiments, the immunogenic peptide elicits an adaptive immune response against the tumor. In some embodiments, the adaptive immune response comprises promoting the maturation of dendritic cells, activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes, (T helper cells) activation of CD8+ T lymphocytes (cytotoxic T cells), activation and maturation of B lymphocytes, and/or production of tumor antigen-specific antibodies. T helper cells (TH cells) assist other white blood cells in immunologic processes, including maturation of B cells into plasma cells and memory B cells, and activation of cytotoxic T cells and macrophages. These cells are also known as CD4+ T cells because they express the CD4 glycoprotein on their surfaces. Helper T cells become activated when they are presented with peptide antigens by MHC class II molecules, which are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Once activated, they divide rapidly and secrete small proteins called cytokines that regulate or assist in the active immune response. These cells can differentiate into one of several subtypes, including TH1, TH2, TH3, TH17, TH9, or TFH, which secrete different cytokines to facilitate different types of immune responses. Signaling from the APC directs T cells into particular subtypes. Cytotoxic T cells (e.g., TC cells, CTLs, T-killer cells, killer T cells) destroy virus-infected cells and tumor cells, and are also implicated in transplant rejection. These cells are also known as CD8+ T cells since they express the CD8 glycoprotein at their surfaces. These cells recognize their targets by binding to antigen associated with MHC class I molecules, which are present on the surface of all nucleated cells. Through IL-10, adenosine, and other molecules secreted by regulatory T cells, the CD8+ cells can be inactivated to an anergic state, which prevents autoimmune diseases. Most cytotoxic T cells express T-cell receptors (TCRs) that can recognize a specific antigen. Antigens inside a cell are bound to class I MHC molecules, and brought to the surface of the cell by the class I MHC molecule, where they can be recognized by the T cell. If the TCR is specific for that antigen, it binds to the complex of the class I MHC molecule and the antigen, and the T cell destroys the cell, e.g., via inducing apoptosis. In order for the TCR to bind to the class I MHC molecule, the former must be accompanied by a glycoprotein called CD8, which binds to the constant portion of the class I MHC molecule. Therefore, these T cells are called CD8+ T cells. Natural killer T cells (NKT cells\u2014not to be confused with natural killer cells of the innate immune system) bridge the adaptive immune system with the innate immune system. Unlike conventional T cells that recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, NKT cells recognize glycolipid antigen presented by a molecule called CD1d. Once activated, these cells can perform functions ascribed to both Th and Tc cells (i.e., cytokine production and release of cytolytic/cell killing molecules). They are also able to recognize and eliminate some tumor cells and cells infected with microorganisms, e.g., bacteria or virus. Memory T cells are a subset of antigen-specific T cells that persist long-term after an initial T cell response. They quickly expand to large numbers of effector T cells upon re-exposure to their cognate antigen, thus providing the immune system with \"memory\" against past antigens. The cancer vaccine described herein provides the immune system with \"memory\" against the tumor specific antigen, thereby eliciting strong immune response against newly emerged cancer cells or metastasized cancer cells. Regulatory T cells (suppressor T cells) are crucial for the maintenance of immunological tolerance. Their major role is to shut down T cell-mediated immunity toward the end of an immune reaction and to suppress autoreactive T cells that escaped the process of negative selection in the thymus. Suppressor T cells along with Helper T cells can collectively be called Regulatory T cells due to their regulatory functions. B cell activation occurs in the secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), such as the spleen and lymph nodes. After B cells mature in the bone marrow, they migrate through the blood to SLOs, which receive a constant supply of antigen through circulating lymph. At the SLO, B cell activation begins when the B cell binds to an antigen via its BCR. The antigen can either be free-floating or presented by APCs such as macrophages or dendritic cells (DCs), and include proteins, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, whole virus particles, and whole bacterial cells. Some subtypes of B cell preferentially undergo T cell-dependent activation while other subtypes of cells preferentially undergo T cell-independent activation. Antigens that activate B cells with the help of T-cell are known as T cell-dependent (TD) antigens and include foreign proteins. They are named as such because they are unable to induce a humoral response in organisms that lack T cells. B cell response to these antigens takes multiple days, though antibodies generated have a higher affinity and are more functionally versatile than those generated from T cell-independent activation. Once a BCR binds a TD antigen, the antigen is taken up into the B cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, degraded, and presented to T cells as peptide pieces in complex with MHC-II molecules on the cell membrane. T helper (TH) cells, typically follicular T helper (TFH) cells, that were activated with the same antigen recognize and bind these MHC-II-peptide complexes through their T cell receptor (TCR). Following TCR-MHC-II-peptide binding, T cells express the surface protein CD40L as well as cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-21. CD40L serves as a necessary co-stimulatory factor for B cell activation by binding the B cell surface receptor CD40, which promotes B cell proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, and somatic hypermutation as well as sustains T cell growth and differentiation. T cell-derived cytokines bound by B cell cytokine receptors also promote B cell proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, and somatic hypermutation as well as guide differentiation. After B cells receive these signals, they are considered activated. Activated B cells participate in a two-step differentiation process that yields both short-lived plasmablasts for immediate protection and long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells for persistent protection. The first step, known as the extrafollicular response, occurs outside of lymphoid follicles but still in the SLO. During this step activated B cells proliferate, may undergo immunoglobulin class switching, and differentiate into plasmablasts that produce early, weak antibodies mostly of class IgM. The second step consists of activated B cells entering a lymphoid follicle and forming a germinal center (GC), which is a specialized microenvironment where B cells undergo extensive proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, and affinity maturation directed by somatic hypermutation. These processes are facilitated by TFH cells within the GC and generate both high-affinity memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells. Resultant plasma cells secrete large amounts of antibody and either stay within the SLO or, more preferentially, migrate to bone marrow. Antigens that activate B cells without T cell help are known as T cell-independent (TI) antigens and include foreign polysaccharides and unmethylated CpG DNA. They are named as such because they are able to induce a humoral response in organisms that lack T cells. B cell response to these antigens is rapid, though antibodies generated tend to have lower affinity and are less functionally versatile than those generated from T cell-dependent activation. As with TD antigens, B cells activated by TI antigens need additional signals to complete activation, but instead of receiving them from T cells, they are provided either by recognition and binding of a common microbial constituent to toll-like receptors (TLRs) or by extensive crosslinking of BCRs to repeated epitopes on a bacterial cell. B cells activated by TI antigens go on to proliferate outside of lymphoid follicles but still in SLOs (GCs do not form), possibly undergo immunoglobulin class switching, and differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts that produce early, weak antibodies mostly of class IgM, but also some populations of long-lived plasma cells. Memory B cell activation begins with the detection and binding of their target antigen, which is shared by their parent B cell. Some memory B cells can be activated without T cell help, such as certain virus-specific memory B cells, but others need T cell help. Upon antigen binding, the memory B cell takes up the antigen through receptor-mediated endocytosis, degrades it, and presents it to T cells as peptide pieces in complex with MHC-II molecules on the cell membrane. Memory T helper (TH) cells, typically memory follicular T helper (TFH) cells, that were derived from T cells activated with the same antigen recognize and bind these MHC-II-peptide complexes through their TCR. Following TCR-MHC-II-peptide binding and the relay of other signals from the memory TFH cell, the memory B cell is activated and differentiates either into plasmablasts and plasma cells via an extrafollicular response or enter a germinal center reaction where they generate plasma cells and more memory B cells. In some embodiments, the adaptive immune response results in the killing tumor cells, reducing tumor burden, reducing tumor size, and/or preventing metastasis. In some embodiments, the adaptive immune response is active against neo-epitopes associated with spontaneous somatic mutations. In some embodiments, the neo-epitope is specific to the lineage of tumor cells. In some embodiments, the adaptive immune response elicited by the heteroclitic or cryptic epitopes is cross-reactive with the native tumor-specific antigen. In some embodiments, the adaptive immune response elicited by the heteroclitic or cryptic epitopes is cross-reactive with neoepitopes arising from spontaneous mutations occurring in the tumor specific antigen. There are advantages associated with using heteroclitic epitopes in clinical applications. For example, heteroclitic epitopes have the ability to break/overcome tolerance by reversing a state of T cell anergy, activating non-tolerized cross-reactive clones of T cells, or by mediating \"immune deviation,\" i.e., the type of CTL produced, such as Th1 or Th2. Recent studies indicate that heteroclitic epitopes (Zaremba, et al., Cancer et al., Cancer Research, 59:301 (1999); Selby, et al., The Journal of Immunology 162(2):669 (1999), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference) in that they are capable of inducing CTLs that recognize endogenously processed epitopes. This is confirmed by studies in different immunological systems (Zugel, et al., J. Immunol., 161:1705 (1998), Wang, et al., J. Exp. Med., 190:983 (1999), Men, et al., J. Immunol., 162:3566, (1999), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference). For example, studies by Zugel et al. have shown that T cell tolerance to an immunodominant T cell epitope in adult mice can be overcome by immunization with heteroclitic cross-reactive peptide analogs cryptic epitopes modulate cytokine production from T cells (Pfeiffer, et al., J. Exp. Med., 181:1569 (1995), Tao, et al., J. Immunol., 158:4237 (1997), Salazar, et al., Int. J. Cancer 85(6):829-38 (2000), Nicholson, et al., Int. Immunol. 12(2):205-13 (2000), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference). The immune deviation induced by such analogs has implications in several disease states, where generation of a specific subset of Th cell responses correlate with tumor regression (Zitvogel, et al., J. Exp. Med., 183:87 (1996), Celluzzi, et al., J. Exp. Med. 183:283 (1996), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference) or affected the clinical outcome of autoimmune or infectious disease (Romagnani, et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol., 12:227-57 (1994), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). Thus, immunization with heteroclitic epitopes offers the capacity to modulate cytokine production by induction of specific subsets of effector T cells, thereby altering the course of disease. In some embodiments, heteroclitic epitopes offer an advantage in drug development since significantly smaller amounts of peptide are needed for treatment doses, due to their strong biological potency. This feature overcomes certain manufacturing and toxicity concerns. In this regard, it has been shown that a heteroclitic analog of a MART-1 peptide (Rivoltini, et al., Cancer Research 59:301 (1999), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference), which generated antigen specific T cells in melanoma patients, was active at much lower concentrations than the native epitope. Similar results were reported by Schlom and colleagues (Zaremba, et al., Cancer Research 57:4570 (1997), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference) regarding heteroclitic analog of the CEA derived CAP1 epitope.Nucleobase Editors The methods of generating immunogenic peptides or epitopes from tumor associated antigens as cancer vaccines described herein, are enabled by the use of the nucleobase editors. As described herein, a nucleobase editor is a fusion protein comprising: (i) a programmable DNA binding protein domain; and (ii) a deaminase domain. It is to be understood that any programmable DNA binding domain may be used in the based editors. In some embodiments, the programmable DNA binding protein domain comprises the DNA binding domain of a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) or a transcription activator-like effector domain (TALE). In some embodiments, the programmable DNA binding protein domain may be programmed by a guide nucleotide sequence, and is thus referred as a \"guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding-protein domain.\" In some embodiments, is a inactive Cas9, dCas9. A dCas9, as used herein, a Cas9 that is completely inactive in its nuclease activity, or partially inactive in its nuclease activity (e.g., a Cas9 nickase). Thus, in some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein is a Cas9 nickase. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA protein is a inactive Cpf1. In some embodiments, the guide protein is a inactive Argonaute. In some embodiments, the guide protein is a nuclease inactive CasX or CasY, e.g., as described in Burstein et al., New CRISPR-Cas systems from uncultivated microbes, Nature 542, 237-241, 2017, incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein is a dCas9 domain.

Additional suitable nuclease-inactive dCas9 domains will be apparent to those of skill in the art based on this disclosure and knowledge in the field, and are within the scope of this disclosure. Such additional exemplary suitable nuclease-inactive Cas9 domains include, but are not limited to, D10A/H840A, D10A/D839A/H840A, D10A/D839A/H840A/N863A mutant domains (See, e.g., Prashant et al., Nature Biotechnology. 2013; 31(9): 833-838, which are incorporated herein by reference), or K603R (See, e.g., Chavez et al., Nature Methods 12, 326-328, 2015, which is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the nucleobase editors utilized in the present invention comprise a Cas9 domain with decreased electrostatic interactions between the Cas9 domain and a sugar-phosphate backbone of a DNA, as compared to a wild-type Cas9 domain. In some embodiments, a Cas9 domain comprises one or more mutations that decreases the association between the Cas9 domain and a sugar-phosphate backbone of a DNA. In some embodiments, the nucleobase editors described herein comprises a dCas9 (e.g., with D10A and H840A mutations) or a Cas9 nickase (e.g., with D10A mutation), wherein the dCas9 or the Cas9 nickase further comprises one or more of a N497X, R661X, Q695X, and/or Q926X mutation of the amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a corresponding mutation in any of the amino acid sequences provided in SEQ ID NOs: 11-260, wherein X is any amino acid. In some embodiments, the nucleobase editors described herein comprises a dCas9 (e.g., with D10A and H840A mutations) or a Cas9 nickase (e.g., with D10A mutation), wherein the dCas9 or the Cas9 nickase further comprises one or more of a N497A, R661A, Q695A, and/or Q926A mutation of the amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a corresponding mutation in any of the amino acid sequences provided in SEQ ID NOs: 11-260. In some embodiments, the dCas9 domain (e.g., of any of the nucleobase editors provided herein) comprises the amino acid sequence as set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 2-9. In some embodiments, the nucleobase editor comprises the amino acid sequence as set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 293-302 and 321. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein is a single effector of a microbial CRISPR-Cas system. Single effectors C2c3. Typically, microbial CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into Class 1 and Class 2 systems. Class 1 systems have multisubunit effector complexes, while Class 2 systems have a single protein effector. Cas9 and Cpf1 are Class 2 effectors. In addition to Cas9 and Cpf1, three distinct Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems (C2c1, C2c2, and C2c3) have been described by Shmakov et al., \"Discovery and Functional Characterization of Diverse Class 2 CRISPR Cas Systems\", Mol. Cell, 2015 Nov. 5; 60(3): 385-397, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. Effectors of two of the systems, C2c1 and C2c3, contain RuvC-like endonuclease domains related to Cpf1. A third system, C2c2 contains an effector with two predicted HEPN RNase domains. Production of mature CRISPR RNA is tracrRNA-independent, unlike production of CRISPR RNA by C2c1. C2c1 depends on both CRISPR RNA and tracrRNA for DNA cleavage. Bacterial C2c2 has been shown to possess a unique RNase activity for CRISPR RNA maturation distinct from its RNA-activated single-stranded RNA degradation activity. These RNase functions are different from each other and from the CRISPR RNA-processing behavior of Cpf1. See, e.g., East-Seletsky, et al., \"Two distinct RNase activities of CRISPR-C2c2 enable guide-RNA processing and RNA detection\", Nature, 2016 Oct. 13; 538(7624):270-273, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In vitro biochemical analysis of C2c2 in Leptotrichia shahii has shown that C2c2 is guided by a single CRISPR RNA and can be programmed to cleave ssRNA targets carrying complementary protospacers. Catalytic residues in the two conserved HEPN domains mediate cleavage. Mutations in the catalytic residues generate catalytically inactive RNA-binding proteins. See e.g., Abudayyeh effector,\" Science, 2016 Aug. 5; 353(6299), the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The crystal structure of Alicyclobaccillus acidoterrastris C2c1 (AacC2c1) has been reported in complex with a chimeric single-molecule guide RNA (sgRNA). See, e.g., Liu et al., \"C2c1-sgRNA Complex Structure Reveals DNA Jan. 19; 65(2):310-322, incorporated herein by reference. The crystal structure has also been reported for Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris C2c1 bound to target DNAs as ternary complexes. See, e.g., Yang et al., \"PAM-dependent Target DNA Recognition and Cleavage by C2C1 CRISPR-Cas endonuclease\", Cell, 2016 Dec. 15; 167(7):1814-1828, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Catalytically competent conformations of AacC2c1, both with target and non-target DNA strands, have been captured independently positioned within a single RuvC catalytic pocket, with C2c1-mediated cleavage resulting in a staggered seven-nucleotide break of target DNA. Structural comparisons between C2c1 ternary complexes and previously identified Cas9 and Cpf1 counterparts demonstrate the diversity of mechanisms used by CRISPR-Cas9 systems. In some embodiments, the nucleobase editors described herein comprise a C2c1, a C2c2, or a C2c3 protein. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein is a C2c1 protein. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein is a C2c2 protein. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein is a C2c3 protein. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5% identical to a naturally-occurring C2c1, C2c2, or C2c3 protein. In some embodiments, the sequence-programmable DNA binding protein is a naturally-occurring C2c1, C2c2, C2c3 protein. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5% identical to any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1057-1059. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein comprises an amino acid sequence of any one SEQ ID NOs: 1057-1059. It should be appreciated that C2c1, C2c2, or C2c3 from other bacterial species may also be used in accordance with the present disclosure. Cas9 recognizes a short motif (PAM motif) in the CRISPR repeat sequences in the target DNA sequence. A \"PAM motif,\" or \"protospacer adjacent motif,\" as used herein, refers a DNA sequence immediately following the DNA sequence targeted by the Cas9 nuclease in the CRISPR bacterial adaptive immune system. PAM is a component of the invading virus or plasmid, but is not a component of the bacterial CRISPR locus. Naturally, Cas9 will not successfully bind to or cleave the target DNA sequence if it is not followed by the PAM sequence. PAM is an essential targeting component (not found in the bacterial genome) which distinguishes bacterial self from non-self DNA, thereby preventing the CRISPR locus from being targeted and destroyed by nuclease. and Cas9 variants thereof have been described in the art to have different, or more relaxed PAM requirements. For example, in Kleinstiver et al., Nature 523, 481-485, 2015; Klenstiver et al., Nature 529, al., Cell 2015; Gao et al., Nature Biotechnology, doi:10.1038/nbt.3547, 2016; Want et al., Nature 461, 754-761, al., Nat Struct Mol Biol, 21(9):743-53, 2014, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Thus, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein of the present disclosure may recognize a variety of PAM sequences including, pyrimidine, and N is any nucleobase. In some embodiments, the PAM is located 5 of the target base. In some embodiments, the PAM is located 3 of the target base. One example of an RNA-programmable DNA-binding protein that has different PAM specificity is Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats from Prevotella and Francisella 1 (Cpf1). Similar to Cas9, Cpf1 is also a class 2 CRISPR effector. It has been shown that Cpf1 mediates robust DNA interference with features distinct from Cas9. Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease lacking TTTN, or YTN). Moreover, Cpf1 cleaves DNA via a staggered DNA double-stranded break. Out of 16 Cpf1-family proteins, two enzymes from Acidaminococcus and Lachnospiraceae are shown to have efficient genome-editing activity in human cells. Also useful in the present disclosure are nuclease-inactive Cpf1 (dCpf1) variants that may be used as a guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein domain. The Cpf1 protein has a RuvC-like endonuclease domain that is similar to the RuvC domain of Cas9 but does not have a HNH endonuclease domain, and the N-terminal of Cpf1 does not have the alfa-helical recognition lobe of Cas9. It was shown in Zetsche et al., Cell, 163, 759-771, 2015 (which is incorporated herein by reference) that, the RuvC-like domain of Cpf1 is responsible for cleaving both DNA strands and inactivation of the RuvC-like domain inactivates Cpf1 nuclease activity. For example, some embodiments, the dCpf1 of the present disclosure comprises mutations NO: 10. It is to be understood that any mutations, e.g., substitution mutations, deletions, or insertions that inactivates the RuvC domain of Cpf1 may be used in accordance with the present disclosure. Thus, in some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein is inactive Cpf1 (dCpf1). In some embodiments, the dCpf1 comprises the amino acid sequence of any one SEQ ID NOs: 261-267. In some embodiments, the dCpf1 comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or at ease 99.5% identical to SEQ ID NO: 10, and 10. Cpf1 from other bacterial species may also be used in accordance with the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA binding protein is a Cpf1 protein from a Acidaminococcus species (AsCpf1). Cpf1 proteins form Acidaminococcus species have been described previously and would be apparent to the skilled artisan. Exemplary Acidaminococcus Cpf1 proteins (AsCpf1) include, without limitation, any of the AsCpf1 proteins provided herein. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid programmable DNA binding protein is a Cpf1 protein from a Lachnospiraceae species (LbCpf1). Cpf1 proteins form Lachnospiraceae species have been described previously have been described previously and would be apparent to the skilled artisan. Exemplary Lachnospiraceae Cpf1 proteins (LbCpf1) include, without limitation, any of the LbCpf1 proteins provided herein. In some embodiments, the Cpf1 protein is a crippled Cpf1 protein. As used herein a \"crippled Cpf1\" protein is a Cpf1 protein having diminished nuclease activity as compared to a wild-type Cpf1 protein. In some embodiments, the crippled Cpf1 protein preferentially cuts the target strand more efficiently than the non-target strand. For example, the Cpf1 protein preferentially cuts the strand of a duplexed nucleic acid molecule in which a nucleotide to be edited resides. In some embodiments, the crippled Cpf1 protein preferentially cuts the non-target strand more efficiently than the target strand. For example, the Cpf1 protein preferentially cuts the strand of a duplexed nucleic acid molecule in which a nucleotide to be edited does not reside. In some embodiments, the crippled Cpf1 protein preferentially cuts the target strand at least 5% more efficiently than it cuts the non-target strand. In some embodiments, the crippled Cpf1 protein more efficiently than it cuts the non-target strand. In some embodiments, a crippled Cpf1 protein is a non-naturally occurring Cpf1 protein. In some embodiments, the crippled Cpf1 protein comprises one or more mutations relative to a wild-type Cpf1 protein. In some embodiments, the crippled Cpf1 protein comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 mutations relative to a wild-type Cpf1 protein. In some embodiments, the crippled Cpf1 protein comprises an R836A mutation mutation as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 763, or in a corresponding amino acid in another Cpf1 protein. It should be appreciated that a Cpf1 comprising a homologous residue (e.g., a corresponding amino acid) to R836A of SEQ ID NO: 763 could also be mutated to achieve similar results. In some embodiments, the crippled Cpf1 protein comprises a R1138A mutation as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 763, or in a corresponding amino acid in another Cpf1 protein. In some embodiments, the crippled Cpf1 protein comprises an R912A mutation mutation as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 762, or in a corresponding amino acid in another Cpf1 protein. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, residue R838 of SEQ ID NO: 763 SEQ ID NO: 762 (AsCpf1) are examples of corresponding (e.g., homologous) residues. For example, a portion of the alignment between SEQ ID NO: 762 and 763 shows that R912 and R838 are corresponding residues. In some embodiments, any of the Cpf1 proteins provided herein comprises one or more amino acid deletions. In some embodiments, any of the Cpf1 proteins provided herein comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 amino acid deletions. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, there is a helical region in Cpf1, which includes residues 661-667 of AsCpf1 (SEQ ID NO: 762), that may obstruct the function of a deaminase (e.g., APOBEC) that is fused to the Cpf1. This region comprises the amino acid sequence KKTGDQK. Accordingly, aspects of the disclosure provide Cpf1 proteins comprising mutations (e.g., deletions) that disrupt this helical region in Cpf1. In some embodiments, the Cpf1 protein comprises one or more deletions of the following residues in SEQ ID NO: 762, or one or more corresponding comprises a T663 and a D665 deletion in SEQ ID NO: 762, or corresponding deletions in another Cpf1 protein. In some embodiments, the Cpf1 protein comprises a T663, D665, and Q666 deletion in SEQ ID NO: 762, or corresponding deletions in another Cpf1 protein. In some embodiments, the Cpf1 deletion in NO: 762, or corresponding deletions in another Cpf1 protein. In some embodiments, the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein domain of the present disclosure has no requirements for a PAM sequence. One example of such guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein may be an of 24 nucleotides (gDNA) to guide it to its target site and will make DNA double-strand breaks at gDNA site. In contrast to Cas9, the NgAgo-gDNA system does not require a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Using a nuclease inactive NgAgo (dNgAgo) can greatly expand the codons that may be targeted. The characterization and use of NgAgo have been described in Gao et al., Nat Biotechnol. Epub 2016 May 2. PubMed PMID: 27136078; Swarts Nature. 507(7491) al., Nucleic Acids Res. 43(10) (2015):5120-9, each of which are incorporated herein by reference. The sequence of Natronobacterium gregoryi Argonaute is provided in SEQ ID NO: 270. Also provided herein are Cas9 have relaxed PAM requirements (PAMless Cas9). PAMless Cas9 exhibits an increased activity on a target sequence that does not include a canonical PAM (e.g., NGG) at its 3-end as compared to Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 as provided by SEQ ID NO: 1, e.g., increased activity by at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 50-fold, at least 100-fold, at least 500-fold, at least 1,000-fold, at least 5,000-fold, at least 10,000-fold, at least 50,000-fold, at least 100,000-fold, at least 500,000-fold, or at least 1,000,000-fold. Such Cas9 variants that have relaxed PAM requirements are described in U.S. Provisional Applications 62/245,828, 62/279,346, 62/311,763, 62/322,178, and 62/357,332, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the dCas9 or Cas9 nickase useful in the present disclosure may further comprise mutations that relax the PAM requirements, e.g., mutations that correspond to A262T, K294R, and Cas9 variants with alternative PAM requirements) suitable for use in the nucleobase editors described herein and their respective sequence are provided below. In some embodiments, the nucleobase editors useful in the present disclosure comprises: (i) a guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein domain; and (ii) a deaminase domain. In some embodiments, the deaminase domain of the fusion protein is a cytosine deaminase. In some embodiments, the deaminase is an APOBEC1 In some embodiments, the deaminase is a rat APOBEC1.

In some embodiments, the deaminase is a human APOBEC3G or a functional fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the deaminase is an APOBEC3G variant comprising mutations correspond to the D316R/D317R mutations in the human APOBEC3G. Exemplary, non-limiting cytosine deaminase sequences that may be used in accordance with the methods of the present disclosure are provided in Example 1 below. In some embodiments, the cytosine deaminase is a wild type deaminase or a deaminase as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 271-292, 303, and 1072-1083. In some embodiments, the cytosine deaminase domains of the fusion proteins provided herein include fragments of deaminases and proteins homologous to a deaminase. For example, in some embodiments, a deaminase domain may comprise a fragment of the amino acid sequence set forth in any of SEQ ID NOs: 271-292, 303, and 1072-1083. In some embodiments, a deaminase domain comprises an amino acid sequence homologous to the amino acid sequence set forth in any of SEQ ID NOs: 271-292, 303, and 1072-1083, or an amino acid sequence homologous to a fragment of the amino acid sequence set forth in any of SEQ ID NOs: 271-292, 303, and 1072-1083. In some embodiments, proteins comprising a deaminase, a fragments of a deaminase, or homologs of a deaminase or a deaminase are referred to as \"deaminase variants.\" A deaminase variant shares homology to a deaminase, or a fragment thereof. For example a deaminase variant is at least about 70% identical, at least about 80% identical, at least about 90% identical, at least about 95% identical, at least about 96% identical, at least about 97% identical, at least about 98% identical, at least about 99% identical, at least about 99.5% identical, or at least about 99.9% to a wild type deaminase or a deaminase as set forth in any of SEQ ID NOs: 271-292, 303, and 1072-1083.

In some embodiments, the cytosine deaminase domain is fused to the N-terminus of the guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein domain. For example, the fusion protein may have an architecture of NH2-[cytosine deaminase]-[guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein domain]-COOH. The \"]-[\" used in the general architecture above indicates the presence of an optional linker sequence. The term \"linker,\" as used herein, refers to a chemical group or a molecule linking two molecules or moieties, e.g., two domains of a fusion protein, such as, for example, a dCas9 domain and a cytosine deaminase domain. Typically, the linker is positioned between, or flanked by, two groups, molecules, or other moieties and connected to each one via a covalent bond, thus connecting the two. In some embodiments, the linker is an amino acid or a plurality of amino acids (e.g., a peptide or protein). In some embodiments, the linker is an organic molecule, group, polymer, or chemical moiety. In some embodiments, the linker is 5-100 amino acids in length, for example, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, in length. Longer or shorter linkers are also contemplated. In some embodiments, the cytosine deaminase domain and the Cas9 domain are fused to each other via a linker. Various linker lengths and flexibilities between the deaminase domain (e.g., APOBEC1) and the Cas9 domain can be employed (e.g., ranging from very flexible linkers of the form (GGGS)n (SEQ ID NO: 309), SGSETPGTSESATPES (SEQ ID al., Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32(6): 577-82; the entire ID NO: 1068), (XP)n (SEQ ID NO: 785), or a combination of any of these, wherein X is any amino acid and n is independently an integer between 1 and 30, in order to achieve the optimal length for deaminase activity for the specific application.

In some embodiments, the fusion protein useful in the present disclosure further comprises a uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) domain. A \"uracil glycosylase inhibitor\" refers to a protein that inhibits the activity of uracil-DNA glycosylase. The C to T base change induced by deamination results in a U:G heteroduplex, which triggers cellular DNA-repair response. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) catalyzes removal of U from DNA in cells and initiates base excision repair, with reversion of the U:G pair to a C:G pair as the most common outcome. Thus, such cellular DNA-repair response may be responsible for the decrease in nucleobase editing efficiency in cells. Uracil DNA Glycosylase Inhibitor (UGI) is known in the art to potently blocks human UDG activity. As described in Komor et al., Nature (2016), fusing a UGI domain to the cytidine deaminase-dCas9 fusion protein reduced the activity of UDG and significantly enhanced editing efficiency.

No. 61/874,746, filed Sep. 6, 2013, entitled \"Delivery System For Functional Nucleases,\" each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The gRNA comprises a nucleotide sequence that complements a target site, which mediates binding of the nuclease/RNA complex to said target site, providing the sequence specificity of the nuclease:RNA complex. These proteins are able to be targeted, in principle, to any sequence specified by the guide RNA. Methods of using RNA-programmable nucleases, such as Cas9, for site-specific cleavage (e.g., to modify a genome) are known in the art (see e.g., Cong, L. et al.

The specific structure of the guide nucleotide sequences (e.g., sgRNAs) depends on its target sequence and the relative distance of a PAM sequence downstream of the target sequence. One skilled in the art will understand, that no unifying structure of guide nucleotide sequence is given, for that he target sequences are different for each and every C targeted to be deaminated. However, the present disclosure provides guidance in how to design the guide nucleotide sequence, e.g., an sgRNA, so that one skilled in the art may use such teaching to a target sequence of interest.

Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the pharmaceutical is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the pharmaceutical is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration. A pharmaceutical composition for systemic administration may be a liquid, e.g., sterile saline, lactated Ringer's or Hank's solution. In addition, the pharmaceutical composition can be in solid forms and re-dissolved or suspended immediately prior to use. Lyophilized forms are also contemplated. The pharmaceutical composition can be contained within a lipid particle or vesicle, such as a liposome or microcrystal, which is also suitable for parenteral administration. The particles can be of any suitable structure, such as unilamellar or plurilamellar, so long as compositions are contained therein. Compounds can be entrapped in 'stabilized plasmid-lipid particles' (SPLP) levels (5-10 mol %) of cationic lipid, and stabilized by a polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating (Zhang Y. P. et al., Gene Ther. 1999, 6:1438-47). Positively charged lipids such as N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxi)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl-amoniummethylsulfate, or \"DOTAP,\" are particularly preferred for such particles and vesicles. The preparation of such lipid particles is well known. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,880,635; 4,906,477; 4,911,928; 4,917,951; 4,920,016; and 4,921,757. The pharmaceutical compositions of this disclosure may be administered or packaged as a unit dose, for example. The term \"unit dose\" when used in reference to a pharmaceutical composition of the present disclosure refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosage for the subject, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required diluent; i.e., carrier, or vehicle. In some embodiments, the nucleobase editors or the guide nucleotides described herein may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety, e.g., an anti-inflammatory agent.

The compositions and cancer vaccines described herein induce tumor-specific adaptive responses. It is known that cancer cells exploit immune checkpoints to evade immune surveillance. Thus, in some embodiments, in addition to the compositions or cancer vaccines described herein, agents that modulate the activities of immune checkpoints are also administered to boost the tumor-specific immune response elicited by the cancer vaccines. In some embodiments, the agents that modulate the activities of immune checkpoints are immune checkpoint inhibitors. \"Immune checkpoints\" are proteins in the immune system that either enhance an immune response signal (co-stimulatory molecules) or reduce an immune response signal. Many cancers protect themselves from the immune system by exploiting the inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins to inhibit the T cell signal. Such inhibitory checkpoint proteins include, without limitation, Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), Programmed Death 1 receptor (LAG3), and V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA). Some of these immune checkpoint proteins need their cognate binding partners, or ligands, for their immune inhibitory activity. For example, A2AR is the receptor of adenosine A2A and binding of A2A to A2AR activates a negative immune feedback loop. As another example, PD-1 associates with its two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to down regulate the immune system by preventing the activation of T-cells. PD-1 promotes the programmed cell death of antigen specific T-cells in lymph nodes and simultaneously reduces programmed cell death of suppressor T cells, thus achieving its immune inhibitory function. As yet another example, CTLA4 is present on the surface of T cells, and when bound to its binding partner CD80 or CD86 on the surface of antigen-present cells (APCs), it transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells, thereby reducing the immune response. Cancer cells are known to exploit the immune checkpoint proteins to escape being attacked by the immune system. Therefore, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors to enhance an immune response against cancer, and thus treating cancer, have been described. The immunotherapeutic agents in the compositions of the present disclosure may also be immune checkpoint inhibitors. In some embodiments, the immune checkpoint inhibits any one or more of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), Programmed Death 1 receptor (LAG3) and V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA). An \"immune checkpoint inhibitor\" is a molecule that prevents or weakens the activity of an immune checkpoint inhibitor, For example, an immune checkpoint inhibitor may inhibit the binding of the immune checkpoint protein to its cognate binding partner, e.g., PD-1, CTLA-4, or A2aR. In some embodiments, the immune checkpoint inhibitor is a small molecule. In some embodiments, the immune checkpoint inhibitors is a nucleic acid aptamer (e.g., a siRNA targeting any one of the immune checkpoint proteins). In some embodiments, the immune checkpoint inhibitor is a recombinant protein. In some embodiments, the immune checkpoint inhibitor is an antibody. In some embodiments, the combination of any two or more of the foregoing antibodies. In some embodiments, the immune checkpoint inhibitor is a monoclonal antibody. In some embodiments, the immune checkpoint inhibitor comprises anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4, or a combination of any two or more of the foregoing antibodies. For example, the anti-PD-1 antibody is pembrolizumab (Keytruda\u00ae) nivolumab (Opdivo\u00ae) and antibody is (Yervoy\u00ae). Thus, embodiments, the immune checkpoint inhibitor comprises pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab, or any combination of two or more of the foregoing antibodies. The examples described herein are not meant to be limiting and that any immune checkpoint inhibitors known in the art and any combinations thereof may be used in accordance with the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the immune checkpoint may be inhibited by disrupting any one of the immune checkpoint genes any of the gene editing methods known in the art (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9 mediated cleavage of any of the genes). In some embodiments, an adjuvant is futher administered to the subject. Adjuvants are substances which enhance the immune response when administered together with an immunogen or antigen. Adjuvants are thought to function in several ways, including by increasing the surface area of antigen, prolonging the retention of the antigen in the body thus allowing time for the lymphoid system to have access to the antigen, slowing the release of antigen, targeting antigen to macrophages, activating macrophages, or otherwise eliciting non-specific activation of the cells of the immune system see, e.g., H. S. Warren et al, Annu. Rev. immunol., 4:369 (1986). Currently, an essential role of adjuvants in vaccines is to direct CD4+ T cell subset differentiation, although how adjuvants perform this function is poorly understood. The ability of a adjuvant to induce and increase a specific type of immune response and the identification of that ability is thus a key factor in the selection of particular adjuvants for vaccine use against a particular pathogen. Typical adjuvants include water and oil emulsions, e.g., Freund's adjuvant, and chemical compounds such as aluminum hydroxide or alum. At present, alum is the only adjuvant approved in the United States for human vaccines; it has been determined that alum induces the production of TH 2 cells. Many of the most effective adjuvants include bacteria or their products, e.g., microorganisms such as the attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG); alum-precipitated diphtheria toxoid, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and endotoxins. However, the role that the bacteria play is ill-defined. Recently, it has been noted that many bacteria or their products, lipopolysaccharide, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and C. parvum, stimulate IL-12 production by macrophages A. D'Andrea et al, J. Exp. Med., 176:1387 (1992). Cancers or tumors include but are not limited to neoplasms, malignant tumors, metastases, or any disease or disorder characterized by uncontrolled cell growth such that it would be considered cancerous. The cancer may be a primary or metastatic cancer. Cancers include, but are not limited to, biliary tract cancer; bladder cancer; brain cancer including oral cancer including squamous cell carcinoma; ovarian cancer including those arising from epithelial cells, stromal cells, germ cells and mesenchymal choriocarcinomas; stromal tumors and germ cancer including thyroid adenocarcinoma and medullar carcinoma; and renal cancer including adenocarcinoma and Wilms' tumor. Commonly encountered cancers include breast, prostate, lung, ovarian, colorectal, and brain cancer. \"A therapeutically effective amount\" as used herein refers to the amount of each base-editing agent of the present disclosure required to confer therapeutic effect on the subject, either alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents. Effective amounts vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition, the individual subject parameters including age, physical condition, size, gender and weight, the duration of the treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any), the specific route of administration and like factors within the knowledge and expertise of the health practitioner. These factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more than routine experimentation. It is generally preferred that a maximum dose of the individual components or combinations thereof be used, that is, the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, however, that a subject may insist upon a lower dose or tolerable dose for medical reasons, psychological reasons or for virtually any other reasons. Empirical considerations, such as the half-life, generally will contribute to the determination of the dosage. For example, therapeutic agents that are compatible with the human immune system, such as polypeptides comprising regions from humanized antibodies or fully human antibodies, may be used to prolong the half-life of the polypeptide. Frequency of administration may be determined and adjusted over the course of therapy, and is generally, but not necessarily, based on treatment and/or suppression and/or amelioration and/or delay of a disease. Alternatively, sustained continuous release formulations of a polypeptide or a polynucleotide may be appropriate. Various formulations and devices for achieving sustained release are known in the art. In some embodiments, dosage is daily, every other day, every three days, every four days, every five days, or every six days. In some embodiments, dosing frequency is once every week, every 2 weeks, every 4 weeks, every 5 weeks, every 6 weeks, every 7 weeks, every 8 weeks, every 9 weeks, or every 10 weeks; or once every month, every 2 months, or every 3 months, or longer. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays. The dosing regimen (including the polypeptide used) can vary over time. In some embodiments, for an adult subject of normal weight, doses ranging from about 0.01 to 1000 mg/kg may be administered. In some embodiments, the dose is between 1 to 200 mg. The particular dosage regimen, i.e., dose, timing and repetition, will depend on the particular subject and that subject's medical history, as well as the properties of the polypeptide or the polynucleotide (such as the half-life of the polypeptide or the polynucleotide, and other considerations well known in the art). For the purpose of the present disclosure, the appropriate dosage of a therapeutic agent as described herein will depend on the specific agent (or compositions thereof) employed, the formulation and route of administration, the type and severity of the disease, whether the polypeptide or the polynucleotide is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the subject's clinical history and response to the antagonist, and the discretion of the attending physician. Typically the clinician will administer a polypeptide until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired result. Administration of one or more agents can be continuous or intermittent, depending, for example, upon the recipient's physiological condition, whether the purpose of the administration is therapeutic or prophylactic, and other factors known to skilled practitioners. The administration of an agent (e.g., cancer vaccine) may be essentially continuous over a preselected period of time or may be in a series of spaced dose, e.g., either before, during, or after developing a disease. \"Treat,\" as used herein, means to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve, or affect the disease, the symptom of the disease, or the predisposition toward the disease. \"Treating,\" as used herein refers to the application or administration of a composition or a cancer vaccine described herein to a subject in need thereof. \"A subject in need thereof\", refers to an individual who has a disease, a symptom of the disease, or a predisposition toward the disease. In some embodiments, the subject is a mammal. In some embodiments, the subject is a non-human primate. In some embodiments, the subject is human. Alleviating a disease includes delaying the development or progression of the disease, or reducing disease severity. Alleviating the disease does not necessarily require curative results. As used therein, \"delaying\" the development of a disease means to defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize, and/or postpone progression of the disease. This delay can be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individuals being treated. A method that \"delays\" or alleviates the development of a disease, or delays the onset of the disease, is a method that reduces probability of developing one or more symptoms of the disease in a given time frame and/or reduces extent of the symptoms in a given time frame, when compared to not using the method. Such comparisons are typically based on clinical studies, using a number of subjects sufficient to give a statistically significant result. \"Development\" or \"progression\" of a disease means initial manifestations and/or ensuing progression of the disease. Development of the disease can be detectable and assessed using standard clinical techniques as well known in the art. However, development also refers to progression that may be undetectable. For purpose of this disclosure, development or progression refers to the biological course of the symptoms. \"Development\" includes occurrence, recurrence, and onset. As used herein \"onset\" or \"occurrence\" of a disease includes initial onset and/or recurrence. Conventional methods, known to those of ordinary skill in the art of medicine, can be used to administer the isolated polypeptide or pharmaceutical composition to the subject, depending upon the type of disease to be treated or the site of the disease. This composition can also be administered via other conventional routes, e.g., administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or an or infusion techniques. In addition, it can be administered to the subject via injectable depot routes of administration such as using 1-, 3-, or 6-month depot injectable or biodegradable materials and methods. Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, based on the above description, utilize the present disclosure to its fullest extent. The following specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. All publications cited herein are incorporated by reference for the purposes or subject matter referenced herein.EXAMPLES In order that the disclosure described herein may be more fully understood, the following examples are set forth. The synthetic examples described in this application are offered to illustrate the compounds and methods provided herein and are not to be construed in any way as limiting their scope.Example 1: Guide Nucleotide Sequence Programmable DNA-Binding Protein Domains, Deaminases, and Base Editors Non-limiting examples of suitable guide nucleotide sequence-programmable DNA-binding protein domain s are provided. The disclosure provides Cas9 variants, for example, Cas9 proteins from one or more organisms, which may comprise one or more mutations (e.g., to generate dCas9 or Cas9 nickase). In some embodiments, one or more of the amino acid residues, identified below by an asterek, of a Cas9 protein may be mutated. In some embodiments, the D10 and/or H840 residues of the amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a corresponding mutation in any of the amino acid sequences provided in SEQ ID NOs: 11-260, are mutated. In some embodiments, the D10 residue of the amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a corresponding mutation in any of the amino acid sequences provided in SEQ ID NOs: 11-260, is mutated to any amino acid residue, except for D. In some embodiments, the D10 residue of the amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a corresponding mutation in any of the amino acid sequences provided in SEQ ID NOs: 11-260, is mutated to an A. In some embodiments, the H840 residue of the amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a corresponding residue in any of the amino acid sequences provided in SEQ ID NOs: 11-260, is an H. In some embodiments, the H840 residue of the amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a corresponding mutation in any of the amino acid sequences provided in SEQ ID NOs: 11-260, is mutated to any amino acid residue, except for H. In some embodiments, the H840 residue of the amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a corresponding mutation in any of the amino acid sequences provided in SEQ ID NOs: 11-260, is mutated to an A. In some embodiments, the D10 residue of the amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a corresponding residue in any of the amino acid sequences provided in SEQ ID NOs: 11-260, is a D. A number of Cas9 sequences from various species were aligned to determine whether corresponding homologous amino acid residues of D10 and H840 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 11 can be identified in other Cas9 proteins, allowing the generation of Cas9 variants with corresponding mutations of the homologous amino acid residues. The alignment was carried out using the NCBI Constraint-based Multiple Alignment Tool (COBALT (accessible at st-va.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/cobalt), with the following parameters. Alignment parameters: Gap penalties 11,1; End-Gap penalties columns and Recompute on. Clustering Parameters: Use query clusters on; Word Size 4; Max cluster distance 0.8; Alphabet Regular. An exemplary alignment of four Cas9 sequences is provided below. The Cas9 sequences in The HNH domain (bold and underlined) and the RuvC domain (boxed) are identified for each of the four sequences. Amino acid residues 10 and 840 in S1 and the homologous amino acids in the aligned sequences are identified with an asterisk following the respective amino acid residue. The alignment demonstrates that amino acid sequences and amino acid residues that are homologous to a reference Cas9 amino acid sequence or amino acid residue can be identified across Cas9 sequence variants, including, but not limited to Cas9 sequences from different species, by identifying the amino acid sequence or residue that aligns with the reference sequence or the reference residue using alignment programs and algorithms known in the art. This disclosure provides Cas9 variants in which one or more of the amino acid residues identified by an asterisk in SEQ ID NOs: 11-14 (e.g., S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively) are mutated as described herein. The residues D10 and H840 in Cas9 of SEQ ID NO: 1 that correspond to the residues identified in SEQ ID NOs: 11-14 by an asterisk are referred to herein as \"homologous\" or \"corresponding\" residues. Such homologous residues can be identified by sequence alignment, e.g., as described above, and by identifying the sequence or residue that aligns with the reference sequence or residue. Similarly, mutations in Cas9 sequences that correspond to mutations identified in SEQ ID NO: 1 herein, e.g., mutations of residues 10, and 840 in SEQ ID NO: 1, are referred to herein as \"homologous\" or \"corresponding\" mutations. For example, the mutations corresponding to the D10A mutation in SEQ ID NO: 1 or 51 (SEQ ID NO: 11) for the four aligned sequences above are D11A for S2, D10A for S3, and D13A for S4; the corresponding mutations for H840A in SEQ ID NO: 1 or 51 (SEQ ID NO: 11) are H850A for S2, H842A for S3, and for 250 Cas9 sequences (SEQ ID NOs: 11-260) from different species are provided. Amino acid residues homologous to residues 10, and 840 of SEQ ID NO: 1 may be identified in the same manner as outlined above. All of these Cas9 sequences may be used in accordance with the present disclosure. Non-limiting examples of suitable deaminase domains are provided. Non-limiting examples of fusion proteins/nucleobase editors are provided. His6-rAPOBEC1-XTEN-dCas9 for Escherichia coli expression (SEQ ID NO: 293) Described herein are new methods to stimulate the immune system to treat tumors and prevent metastatic lesions. By turning the genome and proteome of the malignant cells into a personalized endogenous anti-cancer vaccine in vivo. Provided herein is a new immuno-oncology methodology to raise robust T-cell and B-cell mediated immune responses against tumor-specific proteins, which are otherwise tolerated as \"self\" by the immune system of a cancer patient1-3 ( The heteroclitic and cryptic epitopes programmed by genome/base-editing may be personalized to match each patient's malignancy and immune system, or alternatively a guide-RNA cocktail can be developed to engage the most frequent HLA allele supertypes that broadly cover the human population ( Also provided herein are numerous specific examples of genomic target sites in tumor-associated genes (Tables 1-3), and the guide-RNAs designed to program the alteration of these translated sequences (Tables 5 and 7), in order to replicate or closely mimic known epitopes that have literature or pre-clinical precedent. The genome editing reactions were designed for one of the CRISPR/Cas9 tools: (i) \"base editors\" cytidine deaminase-Cas9 fusion4); or (ii) engineered WT Cas9,5-7 Cas9 nickases8 or Fok1-nuclease-dCas9 fusions9,10). Examples of other potentially useful genome-editing reactions to alter cancer-specific genes to produce heteroclitic/cryptic epitopes are shown in Tables 5 and 7. By extension, Cas9 tools and Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) pathways may also be exploited to introduce heteroclitic epitopes through DNA templates by lowering the rate of indels using several techniques.68-70 Finally, to expand the repertoire of heteroclitic and cryptic epitopes in an unbiased high-throughput manner, the aforementioned tools could be used to screen libraries of guide-RNAs targeting all PAM sites across a tumor-associated genes of interest, which can be replicated using the genome/base-editing reactions shown in Tables 5 and 7.71,72REFERENCES - 1.
