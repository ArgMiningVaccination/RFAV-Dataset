Or why some people seem to be in perpetual motion while others prefer to stay grounded? The answer may lie in Ayurveda doshas, a concept of three health types that determine how we should eat, sleep and exercise. So, let's understand the world of Ayurveda doshas to discover which one best describes you best! Balance is key in Ayurvedic treatment, and it is attained by [balancing the doshas](https://www.healthshots.com/beauty/skin-care/how-to-balance-ayurvedic-doshas-for-healthy-and-radiant-skin/). Health Shots reached out to Dr Mrunal Gole, an Ayurvedic expert, to understand about the concept. She explains that the Doshas are 'health types' used in Ayurvedic medicine to indicate how specific people should eat, sleep, exercise, and determine their emotional strengths and weaknesses. Dr Gole further explains that everyone carries some of each of the three doshas, although in varying degrees. Some people may lean more towards Vata-Kapha dominance, while others may have a health type that is more Pitta-dominant. Imagine each dosha as a two-way scale; when the scale is out of balance, it can lead to suffering on both a physical and emotional level. \"The aim is to restore all of your doshas to their baseline concentrations in your body,\" says the Ayurvedic expert. Let's understand all 3 Ayurveda Doshas and how to keep them in check as explained to us by Dr Gole: Vata is characterized by the energy of movement and is frequently connected to the wind. It is an energizing dosha associated with adaptability, innovation, and an open-minded attitude. It is connected to physiological processes including breathing, muscular contraction, and heartbeat. Dr Gole explains that if Vata is predominant, a person may be skinny, frequently feel chilly, have dry skin, or [have racing thoughts](https://www.healthshots.com/mind/mental-health/make-note-of-these-effective-5-minute-techniques-to-dispel-anxious-thoughts/). An imbalance in the Vata dosha can lead to constipation, fear, and other digestive problems like anxiety. Expert's advice to balance the Vata Dosha: Anything that fosters a sense of stability and grounding will be helpful when Vata energy takes hold. This could mean setting limits on how much technology you use, being more rigid with your morning and evening routines, or [doing a grounded meditation](https://www.healthshots.com/preventive-care/self-care/7-tips-to-increase-focus-while-meditating/) with your feet on the ground.

A variety of meats, warm, creamy liquids, and root vegetables may also be sustaining and grounding. Since this dosha tends to go towards dryness, it's crucial to stay hydrated. \"The Pitta dosha is associated with fire and is said to govern the endocrine, metabolic, and digestive systems,\" says Dr Gole. People who are mostly Pitta might have a medium build, frequently experience coldness, and have oily skin. They are frequently active, driven, and high achievers. Additionally, a Pitta imbalance can cause rashes and skin irritation, as well as rage, overwork, and fatigue. Expert's advice to balance the Pitta Dosha: Unsurprisingly, cooling exercises will be beneficial for persons who have a Pitta imbalance. Consider having a cold shower and going for a stroll near a body of water (but not while it's really hot outside). Pitta-prone folks should think about easing up on their strict schedules and making room for spontaneity. Diet to balance the Pitta Dosha: The Ayurveda experts suggest that people with a Pitta-dominant constitution should opt for lighter meals, especially during the summer, and stay away from anything hot, spicy, or fermented. Sweet fruits, coconut water, and a variety of grains are a few meals and drinks that might help to calm Pitta. Earth and water are connected to the Kapha Dosha. It is a calming energy that is said to [keep the immune system strong](https://www.healthshots.com/healthy-eating/superfoods/eat-these-9-superfoods-for-better-immunity-in-this-weather-change/) and provide the body with water. A Kapha-dominating person is composed, rooted, and forgiving. However, a Kapha imbalance can cause resentment, sluggishness, and weight gain. Expert's advice to balance the Kapha Dosha: A substantial dose of self-care is required if Kapha is out of whack. For people with a Kapha imbalance, mental stimulation, lots of exercise, and contemplative pursuits like meditation and breathwork are crucial. Diet to balance the Kapha Dosha: People with a Kapha-dominant constitution should avoid oily meals and dense, heavy carbohydrates like pasta and rice. Instead, they should choose a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables as well as bitter, astringent foods.
