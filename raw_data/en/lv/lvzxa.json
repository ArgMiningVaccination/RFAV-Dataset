It can be devastating and have an enormous impact on one's life and well-being. But while it can often seem like depression is something we just have to live with, there are ways to manage its symptoms from an energetic perspective. In this blog post, we will explore the energetic perspective of depression - how it manifests energetically in the body and how a person can use energy healing techniques to help cope with their mental disorder. We will also look at some practical tips for managing depressive episodes from an energetic point of view. Overview of Depression (Major Depressive Disorder) Depression is a mental health issue that affects millions of people around the world. Symptoms of depression can range from feeling low or down for a few days, to severe mental discomfort that impairs a person's ability to go about their daily activities. People suffering from depression may feel like they have no energy, experience feelings of worthlessness or sadness, become overly emotional and even have thoughts of suicide or self-harm. [Treatment for depression](https://www.paulramsden.com/how-energy-healing-works-to-help-manage-your-depression/) can include therapy, medication, lifestyle changes and support from friends and family. With the right resources and treatment plan, people living with depression can manage their mental health and lead happy lives. What is Persistent Depressive Disorder? Persistent Depressive Disorder is a serious, yet treatable mental disorder that affects millions of people around the world. This persistent disorder is characterised by persistent, intensely sad moods and loss of interest in activities for at least two years. While sadness is episodic for most individuals struggling with mental disorders, the persistent depressive disorder has lasting impacts on the person's day-to-day life as it can be severe and cause feelings of hopelessness and helplessness that inhibit success and relationships. For those with persistent depressive disorder, treatment is an important step to improving the condition. It typically includes both medication and psychotherapy to help them gain their freedom back. In addition, people suffering from this chronic condition often work with providers who specialize in understanding and addressing the underlying circumstances that can cause depression. By looking further into issues around energy, understanding the sources of depression and how they can heal are becoming more commonplace options in treating it. With professional support and a holistic approach, individuals on this journey have realistic hopes for a better future. Risk Factors for Depression Symptoms Depression is a condition that affects people from all walks of life and has severe symptoms such as feelings of sadness, irritability, hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, periods of anxiousness, and changes in appetite. It's important to take note of the various risk factors associated with depression symptoms so these can be addressed if necessary. Common risk factors associated with depression include ongoing stress due to financial issues, problems in interpersonal relationships, severe health issues or chronic pain, substance use, severe social isolation, difficult experiences during childhood and adolescence, genetic predisposed vulnerabilities to severe symptoms of depression and a family history of mental illness. Mental health professionals suggest that reducing depressive symptoms may involve self-care through diet modifications as well as exercise and relaxation. If the individual feels their depression is severe enough to interfere with daily living they should seek help from a mental health professional such as a counsellor or therapist to reduce the severity of their symptoms. How Depression Manifests Energetically Mental health is a hugely important part of life, yet sadly many people choose to ignore it. When mental health is neglected and we do not take care of our minds, depression can manifest in various forms. In its least severe form, depression may lead to feelings such as low moods, and loss of energy and motivation. On the other hand, severe depression can bring about intense feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness and anxiety which can make life very difficult on both a mental and physical level. That being said, the most important thing to remember is that mental illness is often treatable with the right kind of help. Even if it feels like things are completely out of your control, there are always options to help manage mental health issues. When experiencing feelings of depression it is always important for us to look at what is happening in our lives and our environment and then look at how we can make even the smallest of changes for the better. Energetically, depression can feel smothering or pulling down on us. It is important for us to recognise that this energy change is just a signal to us that we need to stop and look at what needs to change. Energy Healing Techniques to Help Cope with MDD 1.

Practical Tips for Managing Depressive Episodes from an Energetic Perspective 1. Get Plenty of Rest One of the most important things you can do when you are feeling depressed is to get plenty of rest. This means getting enough sleep every night and taking rests during the day if possible. When you are well-rested, your body and mind will be better able to cope with the stressors of life and you will be less likely to feel overwhelmed by them. 2. Eat a Healthy Diet Another important thing to do when managing depressive episodes is to eat a healthy diet. Eating nutritious foods will help your body to function at its best and will give you the energy you need to get through the day. Avoiding processed foods and sugary snacks will also help to keep your energy levels stable and prevent mood swings. 3. Exercise Regularly Exercise is another key component of managing depression from an energetic perspective. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. Exercise also helps to improve sleep quality, increase energy levels, and reduce stress levels. All of these factors can help to reduce the severity of depressive episodes. 4. Spend Time in Nature Spending time in nature can also be helpful when managing depression from an energetic perspective. Being in nature can help to ground you and provide a sense of calmness and peace. It can also help to boost your mood and increase your energy levels. 5. Understand your triggers Depressive episodes can be triggered by a variety of things, including stressful life events, changes in hormone levels, and certain medications. It's important to understand your own personal triggers so that you can be prepared to manage them. 6. Identify your early warning signs Everyone experiences different symptoms during a depressive episode. However, there are some common early warning signs that can signal that an episode is coming on, such as changes in sleep patterns, appetite, energy levels, and mood. If you can identify your early warning signs, you can take steps to prevent the episode from getting worse. 7. Create a support network Having a supportive network of family and friends is crucial for managing depressive episodes. These people can provide practical and emotional support when you need it most. Additionally, consider joining a support group for people with depression. This can be an invaluable resource for dealing with the challenges of depression. 8. Seek professional help If you are struggling to manage your depression on your own, it's important to seek professional help. A therapist can provide guidance and support as you work through the challenges of depression. Additionally, medication may be necessary in some cases to manage the symptoms of depression. When to Get Emergency Help From a Mental Health Professional Mental health and mental disorders should not be taken lightly. If you are experiencing signs of a mental disorder such as severe depression, there are times when it may be necessary to seek emergency help from a mental health professional. These professionals can provide the treatment needed for mental disorders and symptoms. Symptoms that may require emergency mental health care include intense suicidal thoughts, an inability to carry out daily activities due to overwhelming mental health issues, and high levels of agitation or impulsivity. If you think you may need emergency mental health services, contact your mental health professional or local mental health authority right away. Do Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) Cure Depression? Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, are a type of antidepressant that is commonly used to treat clinical depression and other severe mental health conditions. Although clinical studies have supported the positive effect of SSRIs on individuals with clinical depression, it is important to note that in many cases SSRIs may not completely 'cure' depression. It is well known that these medications can help improve symptoms, reduce intense feelings of sadness, and even reduce the frequency of suicidal thoughts for those with clinical depression; however complete remission is rarely achieved through the use of SSRIs alone. For this reason, many mental health professionals work with their clients to find ways to better manage depression in conjunction with medical treatments such as SSRI medications.
