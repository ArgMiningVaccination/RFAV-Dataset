Hippocrates advocated knowledge of the workings of the spine, \"for this is the requisite for many diseases.\" At the Center For Integrative & Traditional Medicine, we offer Chiropractic care that helps successfully eliminate the discomfort and suffering associated with back/neck pain and spinal disorders. Our Chiropractors bring experience, a wealth of knowledge, and a high level of expertise to the practice. Through hands-on spinal manipulation and other alternative treatments, we correct and improve the alignment of the body's musculoskeletal structure, particularly the spine, enabling the body to heal itself often avoiding medication and surgery. Over the years, our patients have greatly benefited from this safe, natural and effective approach. There is a strong and compelling consensus that Chiropractic care is not only safe but patient satisfaction with the results is high. [Dr. Katherine Gearity, DC](https://citm-drfinn.com/katherine-ann-gearity-d-c/) and [Dr. Giuseppe Romano, DC](https://citm-drfinn.com/giuseppe-romano/) use gentle Chiropractic manipulation and manual therapy to deliver pain relief to patients suffering with neck and back pain, sciatica, headaches, auto injuries, sports injuries, personal injuries, shoulder pain and much more. Since each person responds differently to treatment, they offer individualized care to help meet the patient's needs and goals. Education of how the spine functions and how it affects other systems of the body is a hallmark of the doctor's care at the Center For Integrative and Traditional Medicine. An introduction of selfcare is also offered. Their techniques restore mobility to joints restricted by tissue injury caused by a traumatic event, such as a sports injury or car accident, repetitive stress, and sitting for long periods of time without proper back support, overexertion during exercise, and just simple day-to-day living. Our Chiropractors are dedicated to supporting you in attaining and maintaining a healthy spine and "}
