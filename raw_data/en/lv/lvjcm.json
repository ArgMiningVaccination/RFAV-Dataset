Her book, \" [Plague of Corruption](https://www.amazon.com/Plague-Corruption-Restoring-Promise-Science/dp/1510752242),\" ended up being a No. 1 best seller on the lists of The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal in 2020. Her new book, \" [Ending Plague: A Scholar's Obligation in an Age of Corruption](https://www.amazon.com/Ending-Plague-Obligation-Corruption-Childrens/dp/1510764682#ace-g2342880709),\" will hopefully do just as well. It's available for preorder on Amazon. She may be one of the most censored researchers on the planet at this point, thanks in no small part to her participation in the documentary \" [Plandemic](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/05/20/plandemic-documentary.aspx),\" which went viral in a big way (plandemicseries.com). Case in point: YouTube suspended our account for one week as soon as we uploaded today's interview \u2014 even though the video was UNLISTED and not available for public viewing yet. Even worse, Mikovits' third and most recent book, \"The Case Against Masks: Ten Reasons Why Mask Use Should Be Limited,\" is so heavily censored, no one can buy it. \"I don't even have a copy,\" she says. \"I'm sitting here with two copies of the other books but I can't even buy it. What the book sellers did, like Amazon, is they bought them all up from Skyhorse, the publisher, and now they won't ship them out of the warehouse.\" Clearly, Mikovits is considered a serious threat to the technocratic status quo, and once you hear what she has to say about COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 which as you'll see is a complete misnomer \u2014 you may start to understand why. ______________________________________________ The COVID-19 vaccine really isn't a vaccine in the medical definition of a vaccine. It does not improve your immune response to the infection, nor does not limit you from getting the infection. It's really an experimental gene therapy that could prematurely kill large amounts of the population and disable exponentially more. \"I'm just beside myself with anger over this synthetic gene therapy, this chemical poison, and what they're doing worldwide,\" Mikovits says. \"We're already seeing deaths from this shot. It's illegal. It shouldn't be done. It should be stopped right now. It should have never been allowed to happen, yet we see it being forced on the most vulnerable populations.\" Indeed, news and social media reports suggest recipients are starting to drop like flies. Many die of unknown causes within days, sometimes hours of getting the first or second shot. Baseball legend Hank Aaron passed away two weeks after receiving the vaccine, yet this was not ever mentioned in his New York Times obituary. Surely, had he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, he would have been declared a COVID-19 fatality, whether the virus actually had anything to do with it or not. But when it comes to the vaccine, even eyebrow-raising timing is dismissed as coincidental and irrelevant. Now all of a sudden, old people dying shortly after vaccination are shrugged off with the excuse that they're old and could have died any day anyway. Old people dying with SARS-CoV-2, however, must be stopped at any cost. Funny how that works. The Problem With Synthetic RNA The messenger RNA (mRNA) used in many COVID-19 vaccines are not natural. They're synthetic. Since naturally produced mRNA rapidly degrades, it must be complexed with lipids or polymers to prevent this from happening. COVID-19 vaccines use PEGylated lipid nanoparticles, and PEG is known to cause anaphylaxis.2 Lipid nanoparticles may also cause other problems. In 2017, Stat News discussed Moderna's challenges in developing an mRNA-based drug for Crigler-Najjar, a condition that can lead to jaundice, muscle degeneration and brain damage:3 \"In order to protect mRNA molecules from the body's natural defenses, drug developers must wrap them in a protective casing. For Moderna, that meant putting its Crigler-Najjar therapy in nanoparticles made of lipids. And for its chemists, those nanoparticles created a daunting challenge: Dose too little, and you don't get enough enzyme to affect the disease; dose too much, and the drug is too toxic for patients. From the start, Moderna's scientists knew that using mRNA to spur protein production would be a tough task, so they scoured the medical literature for diseases that might be treated with just small amounts of additional protein. 'And that list of diseases is very, very short,' said the former employee ... Crigler-Najjar was the lowest-hanging fruit. Yet Moderna could not make its therapy work ... The safe dose was too weak, and repeat injections of a dose strong enough to be effective had troubling effects on the liver in animal studies.\" However, if they call their drugs vaccines, they can bypass the safety studies. All of a sudden, they expect us to believe that all of these safety issues have been resolved? Another problem is related to how long the mRNA remains stable in your system. It's encased in nanolipid to prevent it from degrading too rapidly, but what happens if the mRNA degrades too slowly, or not at all? The idea behind mRNA vaccines is that by tricking your body into creating the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, your immune system will produce antibodies in response. But what happens when you turn your body into a viral protein factory, thus keeping antibody production activated on a continual basis with no ability to shut down? In addition, your body sees these synthetic particles as non-self and much of the perpetual antibody response will be autoantibodies attacking your own tissues. Mikovits explains: \"Normally, messenger RNA is not free in your body because it's a danger signal. As a molecular biologist, the central dogma of molecular biology is that our genetic code, DNA, is transcribed, written, into the messenger RNA. That messenger RNA is translated into protein, or used in a regulatory capacity ... to regulate gene expression in cells. So, taking a synthetic messenger RNA and making it thermostable \u2014 making it not break down \u2014 [is problematic]. We have lots of enzymes (RNAses and DNAses) that degrade free RNA and DNA because, again, those are danger signals to your immune system. They literally drive inflammatory diseases. Now you've got PEG, PEGylated and polyethylene glycol, and a lipid nanoparticle that will allow it to enter every cell of the body and change the regulation of our own genes with this synthetic RNA, part of which actually is the message for the gene syncytin ... Syncytin is the endogenous gammaretrovirus envelope that's encoded in the human genome ... We know that if syncytin ... is expressed aberrantly in the body, for instance in the brain, which these lipid nanoparticles will go into, then you've got multiple sclerosis. The expression of that gene alone enrages microglia, literally inflames and dysregulates the communication between the brain microglia, which are critical for clearing toxins and pathogens in the brain and the communication with astrocytes. It dysregulates not only the immune system, but also the endocannabinoid system, which is the dimmer switch on inflammation. We've already seen multiple sclerosis as an adverse event in the clinical trials, and we're being lied to: 'Oh, those people had that [already].' No, they didn't. We also see myalgic encephalomyelitis. Inflammation of the brain and the spinal cord, which is [associated with] exogenous gammaretroviruses, the XMRVs.\" These High-Risk Groups Should Avoid COVID-19 Vaccine According to Mikovits, research shows 4% to 6% of Americans have already been infected with XMRV gammaretroviruses via contaminated vaccines and blood supply for more than three decades, which is driving a number of chronic health conditions. Now, these synthetic gene therapies (the so-called COVID-19 vaccines) will further add to the chronic disease burden by triggering myalgic encephalomyelitis. Making matters worse, the synthetic mRNA also has an HIV envelope expressed in it, which can cause immune dysregulation. \"This is a nightmare,\" Mikovits says. \"I'm angry, as this should never be allowed.\" As we discussed in previous interviews, SARS-CoV-2 has been engineered in the lab with gain-of-function research that included [introducing the HIV envelope into the spike protein](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/05/24/is-the-new-coronavirus-created-in-a-lab.aspx). Mikovits' hypothesis is that those who are most susceptible to severe neurological side effects and death from the COVID-19 vaccines are those who have previously been injected with XMRVs, borrelia, babesia, mycoplasma, through contaminated vaccines, resulting in chronic disease. (Her book, \"Plague of Corruption,\" details the science and history of XMRVs, which is a fascinating read.) \"Yes, absolutely,\" she says. \"That's one of our hypotheses. But also, anyone with an inflammatory disease like rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease, chronic Lyme disease, anybody with an acquired immune deficiency from any pathogens and environmental toxins. Those are the people who will be killed, murdered, by this vaccine, and Anthony Fauci knows it ... I can't even sleep [because of] how evil this is. This is so deadly, I can't scream it loud enough from the rooftops.\" The chart below lists 35 diseases associated with XMRV infection. If you have any of these, you may want to think long and hard before you line up for an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, as your chances of severe side effects or death are likely far higher than someone who does not have any of these diseases. This is not a complete list. There may be many other conditions that can put you into a high-risk category. One example is idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP), a deadly bleeding disorder. According to Mikovits, her work shows 30% of all ITP are associated with XMRVs. Interestingly, one example is the 58-year-old Florida doctor who recently got the COVID-19 vaccine and died from sudden onset of ITP two weeks later. Dr. Jerry L. Spivak, an expert on blood disorders at Johns Hopkins University, told The New York Times \"it is a medical certainty\" that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine caused the man's death.4,5 Pfizer, of course, denies any connection. Genetic Alterations May Last for Life So, just how long will the synthetic RNA in COVID-19 vaccines be maintained within your body, causing your cells to produce this aberrant protein? Mikovits believes it will escape degradation for months, years, maybe even for life in some cases. All of this is eerily reminiscent of previous attempts to create a coronavirus vaccine, all of which failed due to the vaccines causing paradoxical immune reactions, or antibody-dependent immune enhancement. While the animals appeared to have antibodies against the virus, and should theoretically have been protected when they were exposed to wild coronavirus, they got severely ill and most died. Such failures may be why so many vaccine makers decided to use mRNA rather than following conventional vaccine development strategies, but the end result is likely going to be the same or worse. \"I have a 41-year-old daughter-in-law with a very aggressive colon cancer. We're seeing an explosion of chronic disease and these patients are not being discouraged from getting the vaccine. In fact, they're being scared by physicians into getting it. How do we wake people up? Is it going to take millions of Americans and people worldwide dying? Will Hank Aaron dying help the Black community? ... We know the mechanisms. We know that Blacks and Hispanics can't degrade RNA viruses as rapidly as Caucasians. We know that from studies all the way back to MMR. The MMR vaccine is associated with ITP. It says it right there on the package insert. If you have a single nucleotide polymorphism in one of those RNases called RNase-L, you are more likely to get aggressive breast cancers, prostate cancers and other cancers from an XMRV infection (So why inject mRNA of syncytin, a gamma retrovirus envelope?).\" Breakthrough Genomics Could Save Millions of Lives According to Mikovits, one solution is to use functional genomics technologies like Breakthrough Genomics, a company which uses machine learning to look at full genome sequences to determine which single nucleotide polymorphisms in ACE2 receptors, antiviral pathways like RNASEL and Interferons can make a person most susceptible to harm from these gene therapy \"vaccines.\" \"We have the technology to see who's susceptible to severe effects. It will be a huge part of the population,\" Mikovits says. While one size clearly doesn't fit all in any vaccine strategy, forcing a gene therapy on an entire population when it can be predicted that millions will die and develop deadly diseases like ITP is simply unconscionable. Yet anyone who dares speak about this, as Mikovits knows, risks having their careers and lives destroyed. Symptoms of COVID-19 Vaccine Damage Many of the symptoms now being reported are suggestive of neurological damage. They have severe dyskinesia (impairment of voluntary movement), ataxia (lack of muscle control) and intermittent or chronic seizures. Many cases detailed in personal videos on social media are quite shocking. Equally shocking is that these videos are quickly removed by the social media platforms, ostensibly for violating some term of service. It's hard to fathom how a personal experience can be considered \"false information.\" \"What is causing this is the neuroinflammation,\" Mikovits says. \"It's the brain on fire. You're going to see tics, you're going to see Parkinsonian disease, you're going to see ALS, you're going to see things like this developing at extremely rapid rates, and it's inflammation of the brain.\" Side effects are also suggestive of a dysregulated innate immune response and a disrupted endocannabinoid system, which acts as a dimmer switch on your immune system. \"We see mast cell activation syndromes (MCAS). The clinical symptoms are going to be the inflammatory diseases. We hear everybody calling it 'long haul COVID' \u2014 the extreme, profound, crippling fatigue, the inability to produce energy from your mitochondria. It's not long haul COVID. It's exactly what it always was \u2014 myalgic encephalomyelitis, inflammation of the brain and the spinal cord. What they're intentionally doing is killing off [certain] populations, which they previously injured.\" Another common side effect from the vaccine we're seeing is allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock. A likely culprit in this is PEG, which an estimated 70% of Americans are allergic to. \"These instantaneous effects are almost certainly the PEG and that lipid nano particle, the toxic particle that's being injected,\" Mikovits says. In the longer term, she suspects we'll see a significant uptick in migraines, tics, Parkinson's disease, microvascular disorders, different cancers, including prostate cancer, severe pain syndromes like fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis, bladder problems, kidney disease, psychosis, neurodegenerative diseases such as Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS) and sleep disorders, including narcolepsy. In young children, autism-like symptoms are likely to develop as well, she thinks. We'll End Up Killing the Most Susceptible Aside from the chronic diseases listed earlier, others who are at high risk from these COVID-19 gene therapies include those who have gotten seasonal influenza vaccines, Blacks and Hispanics. Blacks and Hispanics are particularly at risk for antibody-dependent immune enhancement, in particular, due to genetics. Tragically, these vaccines are given to the most susceptible under the guise of racial and social justice. \"Johns Hopkins laid out that plan a few months ago to vaccinate ethnic minorities and the mentally challenged first. If your brain is already on fire, if you already have a neural inflammatory disease, why in the world would you inject this neural inflammatory toxin? You're killing the people who are the most susceptible.\" Women of childbearing age may also be at risk for infertility, as syncytin (the gammaretrovirus envelope encoded in the human genome the expression of which can be dysregulated by the synthetic syncytin RNA in the vaccine) is required for proper fusion of the placenta in the uterus and implantation of the egg. Indeed, the World Health Organization is now saying pregnant women should not get the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines due to reports of late-term miscarriages.6 What to Do if You Got the Vaccine and Are Having Problems The primary reason why I wanted to interview Mikovits was to find out her recommendations for those who chose to get the vaccine and now regret it. Interestingly, what I learned is you use the same strategies that you would use to treat the actual SARS-CoV-2 infection. I've written many articles over the past year detailing simple strategies to improve your immune system, and with a healthy immune system, you'll get through it without incident even if you end up getting sick. Below, I'll summarize some of the strategies you can use both to prevent COVID-19 and address any side effects you may encounter from the vaccine. First of all, you'll want to eat a \"clean,\" ideally organic diet. Avoid processed foods of all kinds, as they are loaded with damaging omega-6 linoleic acid that wrecks your mitochondrial function. Also consider nutritional ketosis and time-restricted eating, both of which will help you optimize your metabolic machinery and mitochondrial function. As noted by Mikovits: \"We have to think about detoxing metal, we have to think about glyphosate ... We have to prevent inflammation in all tissue sites and we have to keep our immune system healthy ... You're going to want to be burning ketones instead [of sugar] for the neuroinflammation, so you're going to want to get into ketosis and take the stress off the mTOR pathway.\" With regard to glyphosate, a simple way to block glyphosate uptake is to take glycine. Approximately 3 grams, about half a teaspoon, a few times a day should be sufficient, along with an organic diet, so that you're not adding more glyphosate with each meal. To improve detoxification, I recommend activating your natural glutathione production with molecular hydrogen tablets. All of these strategies should help improve your resilience against SARS-CoV-2, and may even help your body detoxify if you've made the mistake of getting this experimental gene therapy. Another helpful strategy is to maintain a neutral pH. You want your pH to be right around 7, which you can measure with an inexpensive urine strip. The lower your pH, the more acidic you are. A simple way to raise your pH if it's too acidic (and most people are) is to take one-fourth teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate in water a few times a day. Improving your pH will improve the resiliency of your immune system and reduce the mineral loss from your bones, thereby reducing your risk of osteoporosis. "}
