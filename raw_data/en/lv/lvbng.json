In this, though, we must be mindful not to become complacent, keeping ourselves so concerned with our own busy lives that we think, \"I don 't have time for that, \" or \"This really isn't my problem, \" or \"How can I really make a difference? \" We are all here together, and if you study quantum physics, you understand that what affects one affects the whole. I recently read a quote that says: \"Whatever you are not changing, you are choosing. \" - Laurie Buchanan What are you choosing in your life? Our world is changing, and if there are aspects where we feel it 's not changing for the better, we must take action. Education is empowerment, and once you know better, you must do better. What can you do better? Again, I ask, what are you choosing in your life? What are you choosing out of habit or convenience? Does this really reflect the person you want to be? Does it make the world you live in a place in which you really want to live? In case you missed the NHIFF, the speakers were phenomenal! (Make sure you clear your schedule for 2020!) I wanted to give you some highlights from Dr. Don Huber 's presentation on Roundup\u00ae, and in writing \"The Truth About Roundup\u00ae\" for this issue, I got so fired up and eager to share this information. The seriousness of how Roundup\u00ae is impacting our lives has me re -evaluating, even more, what I am choosing in my own life. I hope it inspires you like it has inspired me. This edition of the NITE Light also has some great testimonials that remind us we do have the power to make significant changes and that nature does provide us with tools for healing.

Naturopathic Community Center 3 The Hidden Health Crisis: Fungus, Mold, and Bacteria By Lori Becker, ND Fungus Fungi are any of a group of spore -producing organisms that live in air, in soil, on plants, and in water. Some live in the human body. Only about half of all types of fungi are harmful. Yeast is a type of fungus that reproduces vegetatively by budding or fission, including forms such as candida that can cause disease. Yeasts are a part of dozens of species of microflora that inhabit our intestines which are critical to health. It is normal to have some yeast growing in the intestines, as yeast is part of the natural balance of intestinal microflora. When the yeast is out of balance, health challenges occur. Friendly bacteria like Lactobacillus in the intestines help maintain the balance of yeast. When these bacteria become compromised, it will allow yeast or fungus to overgrow. As yeast overgrows, its secretion of bio -toxins weakens the intestines. This is one of the major causes of leaky gut, which is the root of many dis -eases. These toxins are absorbed into the blood stream which then, weaken the immune system which sets the stage for many disease and auto -immune disorders. \"Once Candida has penetrated your intestinal lining and caused your gut to become leaky, it opens the floodgates for undigested food particles, toxins, viruses and bacteria to pass through your intestinal wall and into your bloodstream. This triggers an inflammatory response from your immune system in an attempt to fight off these foreign \"invaders.\" As your gut remains leaky, your immune system continues sending out wave after wave of inflammation, and soon gets stressed, weakened, confused, and begins firing less accurately. When this happens, your own body's tissues can end up in the crosshairs of your immune system. Over time this can lead you to develop full -blown autoimmune disease.\" - Amy Myers, MD Symptoms of Fungal Infection: When candida and fungal infections are left untreated, it can spread and eventually reach the bloodstream. Once the fungus is circulating throughout the body, it can affect vital organs, like the brain and heart, and cause more serious complications. Common signs of fungal infections: SIBO, oral thrush, genital and urinary tract infections, digestive issues, sinus infections, skin and nail infections, bone infections, athlete's foot, ringworm, toenail fungus, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, bloating, constipation, lupus, psoriasis, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, difficulty concentrating, poor memory, lack of focus, ADD, ADHD, brain fog, skin issues, eczema, psoriasis, hives, rashes, irritability, mood swings, anxiety, depression, rectal itching, vaginal itching, severe seasonal allergies, itchy ears, strong sugar and refined carbohydrate cravings, and more. Wow, what a list! Mold A mold is a type of fungus that grows in filaments and reproduces by forming mold spores that cannot be seen by the naked human eye. Mold can grow and spread easily in any season, indoors or outdoors, in damp, warm, and humid environments. Mold flourishes in warm, moist environments, but mold spores can survive in harsh, dry environments. When the spores land on a moist surface after floating around in the air, they can then start to grow. Aspergillus niger is a fungus and one of the most common species of the genus Aspergillus. Aspergillus Niger is frequently pinpointed as the source of black mold and is the most common mold concern in homes. Showers, basements, and crawlspaces that may have leaks or some other sources of moisture are commonly susceptible to the growth of toxic black mold. Molds (like black mold) produce mycotoxins that are toxic or poisonous. Industrial food companies are now making citric acid from Aspergillus niger . They do this, because black mold can cheaply convert sugars into citric acid. By feeding sucrose or glucose from corn starch to the black mold, a citric acid solution is created. Through numerous chemical processes, this solution is filtered out from the mold and processed into a usable form. Foods that citric acid is most commonly added to: Ice cream, caramel, soda, cider, beer, wine, certain cheeses, canned and jarred foods, boxed foods and cake mixes, frozen fish, processed foods, pre -cut and packaged fruits and vegetables, and baby food. Other foods susceptible to 4 mold and fungal toxin contamination are: Alcoholic beverages, wheat and all wheat products, rye, peanuts, cottonseed and cottonseed oil, corn, barley, sorghum, sugar from sugar cane and sugar beets, and hard cheeses. Since the 1970s, the molds in our environment have become much more aggressive due to the widespread use of a fungicide called Benomyl through a process like the creation of superbugs by overuse of antibiotics. Mold Poisoning Symptoms: Headaches, chronic fatigue, fever, eye irritation, sneezing, rashes, irritation to the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and throat, chronic coughing, depression, nausea, vomiting, bleeding in the nose and lungs, blood vessel fragility, diarrhea, vomiting, hemorrhage, liver damage, fibrosis, necrosis, trouble breathing, sinus infection, tremors, neurological issues, loss of coordination, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, burning skin and sloughing, photosensitivity, kidney toxicity, infertility, changes in reproductive cycles, immunosuppression, and more. Bacteria The human body is colonized with many hundreds of bacterial species. Bacteria and other microorganisms in the body make up the human microbiota. Most of the bacteria is in the gastrointestinal tract, but all surfaces in contact with the environment are colonized, that is, the skin, upper respiratory tract, and genital tract. The microbiota has a symbiotic relationship with us, having many important functions. The bacteria in our bodies help degrade the food we eat, help make vitamins and nutrients available to us, and neutralize toxins. Bacteria is a cofactor in DNA synthesis and in both fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. Bacteria is particularly important in the normal functioning of the nervous system via its role in the synthesis of myelin. This is also related to bacteria's role in the production of Magnetite and Greigite which are found in brain tissue and cerebral spinal fluid. Bacteria provide defense against infections by protecting the colonized surfaces from invading pathogens. Several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases. When we compromise \"good bacteria,\" we become susceptible to infection and cause great disruption of the entire human mechanism. Growing right along with mold is 'gram negative' and 'gram positive' bacteria. A synergistic action between mold and bacteria further increases and worsens inflammatory health conditions. When gram negative bacteria dies (or is under threat), it releases endotoxins. These endotoxins can severely exacerbate asthma and other conditions, because they are highly inflammatory. Symptoms of Bacterial Overgrowth Infection: SIBO: Small intestine bacteria overgrowth (SIBO) causes similar dis -ease in the body as yeast overgrowth. Those with SIBO may also have larger populations of yeast in the colon. Usually, the main cause of the digestive imbalances is the bacterial overgrowth, not the fungal overgrowth. Other Symptoms: Immune system weakness, chronic viral infections, chronic fungal infections, parasites, chronic bacterial infections, candida, migraines, brain fog, cancer, auto immune disorders, arthritis, food allergies, allergies, depression, anxiety, respiratory weakness, any neurological disorders, ADHD, sugar cravings, acne rosacea, acne vulgaris, anemia, autism, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, diabetes, diverticulitis, fibromyalgia, thyroid IBD, IBS, interstitial Lyme's parasites, Parkinson's, prostatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and more. Causes of Mold, Bacterial & Fungal Imbalances: First and foremost, the use of antibiotics, prescription drugs, and birth control pills have caused a reduction of our own good bacteria. This leaves us very vulnerable! The bacteria that threatens us today were benign before the introduction of antibiotics. We are experiencing an epidemic of antibiotic resistance due to the overuse. Candida has become a common and popular yeast; it is antibiotic resistant. This is why, when many people are put on an antibiotic, they soon after develop a yeast infection. The antibiotic killed off the healthy bacteria needed to keep yeast under control. All this leads to a depletion of the entire healthy gut microbiome. Good bacteria must be replaced and in high amounts. Toxic Foods: Sugar, alcohol, processed foods, GMOS, chemical food additives, and chemical food preservatives. Pathogenic yeast and bacteria not only live off of sugar, they also thrive in processed dairy products such as milk and cheese. 5 Call (616) 724 -6368 to reserve a private appointment and make use of this incredible opportunity! All of these cause mineral and microbe depletion in the soil and body. A soil depleted in minerals and healthy microbes creates an environment for pathogenic organisms to thrive. If our soil is depleted, this means that our food is depleted. We need 56 trace minerals to replicate a cell perfectly. Right now, we are lucky if we are getting 4 in the standard food supply. Pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizers deplete the soil of minerals and necessary microbes, therefore it is being depleted in us. Glyphosate is an Antibiotic. Our repeated exposure to this toxin has depleted our healthy microbiome causing every body system, physiological and chemical process in the body to be compromised. Both pesticides and radiation can injure or break chromosomes which can lead to cancer. Is it any wonder that we are now having unexplained gene mutations like the MTHFR gene? Exposure to Environmental Toxins Just to name some of these toxins: Chlorine, Sodium Fluoride, Fluoride Based Compounds, PFAS, Nitrates, Sulfates, Atrazine, Benzene, Chemical Fertilizers, Arsenic, and Lead. It is imperative to filter not only your drinking water but also, the water you bathe in. When we are exposed to numerous chemicals in the environment and water supply, this not only compromises our healthy microbiome, it also allows chemicals to dock in cell receptor sites in the body setting the stage for disease. These toxins displace the minerals necessary for the body to function properly. Environmental toxins also destroy the flow and action of enzymes. Exposure to additional fungus, mold, and bacteria from food and water sources are added to the human body, and more toxins from these organisms are released. Pair this with the aggressive synergistic reaction they have to each other, and we are dealing with a huge problem for the gut! EMFs Mold cultures that are exposed to electromagnetic radiation cause the production of biotoxins to increase more than 600 times . Cell phones, Wi -Fi, smart meters, and 5G cause mold to put out significantly more mycotoxins. This increase in release is a protective mechanism for them, because the EMF's are perceived as a threat. Unfortunately, this results in a much more virulent and poisonous mycotoxin release. This raises the question: if there is an increase of mycotoxin release from mold due to EMF exposure, then is it also contributing to increased biotoxin release from bacteria as well? Mercury and Heavy Metals Mercury fillings feed and encourage pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic fungus. Mercury fillings decrease and even suppress HCl from being released in the stomach and inhibit digestive enzymes from being released into the small intestine. Mercury depletes healthy gut flora levels and contributes to symptoms of gastrointestinal conditions. Many people with systemic fungal and bacterial problems have mercury fillings. We have to keep in mind that vaccines containing mercury and other heavy metals will also play a role in the disruption of the healthy microbiome. How does this play a role from early childhood forward? How to Heal Reducing exposure to the causes of mold, fungus, and bacteria imbalance is key. Here is a list of necessary steps to take: \"Glyphosate Roundup\u00ae is an Antibiotic\" Breast Thermography Available at Herbs Etc October 1 & 2, 2019 A radiation free, non -invasive, FDA approved, and relatively inexpensive device that detects early, potentially reversible, physiologic changes associated with later development of breast cancer. Herbicides, Pesticides, Glyphosate, Roundup\u00ae 6 Diet It is imperative to eliminate exposure to the toxic foods. Diet should consist of plenty of clean water (Reverse Osmosis Purified Water). Both city and well water throughout our state contain high amounts of Round Up and numerous other chemicals. Clean water is needed for the proper nutrient delivery and waste removal from cells. Eat as clean as possible! To avoid pesticide exposure, eat organically. There are ways to find it more affordably, and the more people who buy it, the more the prices will go down and the availability will go up. If you cannot pronounce an ingredient in something, there is a good chance (like all processed and artificial foods) it will cause an inflammatory response in the body. Author Jack Wilson suggests foods such as Braggs' organic apple cider vinegar which contains microbes that can fully metabolize glyphosate (acetobacter). Fermented foods are also good at flushing out glyphosate/Round Up. Making your own ferments is cheap and very effective. Just drinking cabbage juice will help cleanse glyphosate from the body. Also, eating foods high in sulfur and manganese will help support the body in relation to environmental poisons. Look for a combination of humic and fulvic acid: these two power house cleansers can be added to water to flush these substances out. They work by binding to glyphosate and pushing it out through the feces.

Do this by rubbing 1 drop of any of these oils on the bottoms of your feet. These oils have anti -bacterial and antifungal properties that will aid in helping cleanse the body from toxins. We have a three step approach using oils to cleanse, repair, and reprogram the cells of the body. Make sure to ask a staff member at Herbs etc. Eliminate and Lessen EMF Exposure: Get rid of WI -FI and go to Ether Net. If this isn't possible, shut off Wifi at night and downgrade your cell phone. Turn your data off on your cell phone, or put it on airplane mode. Keep it off as much as possible, and do NOT wear it on your body. Refuse the installation of a smart meter. If it has already been installed, you can call and get it replaced with a digital analog meter. Use EMF protection items such as Orgonite Necklaces and Shungite Stones in your home and at work to counteract the effects of EMFs. Available at Herbs etc. Safe Mercury Dental Filling Removal Mercury leaks into the tissue and settles on the nerves, liver, bones, and thyroid. Mercury attracts and allows bacteria and viruses to live on and around it. Multiple metals in a liquid solution can create a battery sending electricity to the organs. Find a properly trained dentist through the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology. They will test the electrical flow coming off the teeth. They will also determine bio -compatible ingredients for your mouth. Getting the mercury out reduces bacteria, viruses, molds, etc. and improves the immune system's ability to function. Work with a qualified Naturopath We are here to help you evaluate how bacteria, viruses, yeast, fungus, and molds are affecting you already and create cleanses and life -style changes to create balance and maintain that balance for life. Let's build an environment together for our bodies to heal.

The Gift of Health, Is it on Your Holiday List? 7 The Truth about Roundup\u00ae by Amy Jo Howard, ND, CH Before we begin revealing the very ugly truth about Roundup\u00ae, we would like to give a very special thank you to Dr. Don Huber for his eye -opening presentation at the NHIFF and for sharing his education and resources on this topic. We are grateful! Roundup\u00ae is a glyphosate -based herbicide (GBH) that was brought to market for agricultural use in 1974. It is being sprayed on over 158 feed and food crops in America, as well as on lawns, parks, playgrounds, and along streets and waterways. All of this use is allowed by the EPA. In fact, the use of glyphosate is so prevalent that it has been found in about 93% of American's bodies. Glyphosate has been found to be in 70 -80% of the foods we eat. It has even been found in breakfast cereals, vaccines, mothers' breast milk, and 100% of California wines that were tested. Also, cows, chickens, and pigs eat grain that are likely to contain high levels of glyphosate, so it accumulates in their tissues and milk. When we eat their meat or products made from them, we are then consuming glyphosate, too. As you may have noticed, the health of Americans has been decreasing. And, health care costs have been increasing. A \"Fault Tree\" Analysis Process, which is used by NASA to determine the cause of complex problems, indicates that the glyphosate in our food is the origin of our health issues. At least 572 scientists have signed a petition requesting a ban of this poison in our food, and no action has been taken by our lawmakers. Let's look at some serious numbers: 54% of all American children now have a chronic illness or are overweight. This is ten times more children than it was 40 years ago. A 99.4% correlation exists between the yearly rise in autism and the yearly use of glyphosate. A 91.9% correlation exists between glyphosate use and increasing obesity in Americans. A 90.7% correlation exists between the yearly rise in suicides and glyphosate use. (All of those percentages are over 90%! The link is there!!) The notion that Roundup\u00ae and glyphosate are harmless is costing America $728 billion per year in health care expenses. And, if you have a health issue, wouldn't you say it is costing you more than just money? Actually, Roundup\u00ae contains other ingredients besides glyphosate that helps the glyphosate get into the plants. These other ingredients make the product 125 to 1000 times more toxic. What's more is that these other ingredients were not included in the government approved safety tests. In fact, America has a cancer rate that is 105 times higher than Switzerland, which presently has a moratorium on glyphosate use. Additionally, the allowable limit of glyphosate in American food is 300 times the amount allowed in Taiwan. And, based on recent testing, the amount of glyphosate eaten by a child is 186 times the \"safe\" amount. So, why is glyphosate so bad? What does it do? Glyphosate acts as a glycine equivalent in the body. Glycine is an amino acid that the body needs for the formation of DNA, collagen, and for the release of energy. This amino acid plays a role in the metabolism of protein, peptides, and bile salts. Glycine also helps with liver detoxification, the functioning of neurotransmitters, and the ability to detox heavy metals from the body. When glyphosate is substituted for glycine and is mistakenly incorporated into peptides during protein synthesis, it can easily create imbalances that are associated with: obesity, asthma, COPD, diabetes, hypothyroidism, ALS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and more conditions. Additionally, glyphosate disrupts gut bacteria. (How often have we heard about leaky gut and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) lately?) By disrupting gut bacteria, it creates intestinal inflammation and interferes with the body's ability to uptake and distribute minerals; this creates even more deficiencies and imbalances. A study reported in the journal Neurotoxicology and Teratology in 2018 looked at the link between GBH (glyphosate -based herbicide) and the gut microbiome. 8 It was noted that GBH significantly altered the gut microbiota in mice and that exposure to GBH induced an increase in anxiety and depression -like behaviors. The study concluded that there is an essential correlation between GBH toxicity and intestinal dysbiosis that would increase the prevalence of neurobehavioral alterations. One neurobehavioral alteration that takes place in the gut microbiome is that glyphosate interferes with the body's ability to make serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for feelings of well -being and happiness as well as regulating sleep, memory, intestinal function, wound healing, blood clotting, bone health, and sexual function. When levels of serotonin, the \"mood stabilizer\" neurotransmitter, are low, symptoms such as these can result: chronic fatigue and loss of energy, difficulty focusing and concentrating, low to no self - esteem, appetite and sleep disturbances, hopelessness, low libido, social withdrawal, and suicide and violence. And, if all of that wasn't enough.... Glyphosate disrupts a crucial class of enzymes in the liver, causing an inability to detoxify other toxic chemicals. So, you basically lose your filter for being able to get rid of toxic substances in the body. Plus, glyphosate bioaccumulates in organs, muscle tissue, and bone. That means, once you're exposed to it, it stays in your body for months, if not longer. Then, there's this: Research scientist Dr. Anthony Samsel found, according to his test results, that Roundup\u00ae is actually present in most vaccines. Have you put it all together? Is it any wonder that American people are suffering from obesity, autism, cancer, suicide, and violence in alarmingly increasing numbers? Is it any wonder that people now have food sensitivities and allergies that they never before had? Is it any wonder that you don't feel like you're gaining any results from the medications or supplements that you take? Is it any wonder that you try to eat healthy, exercise, and do everything that you're \"supposed\" to do, and you still can't lose weight, sleep well, or have energy to do anything? The truth of it is we're being poisoned by glyphosate, and it's magnifying the toxicity of every other poison to which we're exposed. The use of Roundup\u00ae has become prevalent in America, and unfortunately, we're all exposed. It is poisoning us on a daily basis. There is no way to avoid all contact with it, and there is no \"magic herb\" that will make us immune to it. In fact, most of the scientists researching its effects agree that, until glyphosate is banned, it will be necessary for people to spend more money to eat organic and to take supplements to try and counteract the poisoning of America's food. Therefore, we have to educate ourselves and take action if we want to live healthy lives, and there are some steps we can take. Here's what we can do STOP using Roundup\u00ae. If you are using it, STOP! Educate your neighbors and get them to STOP! Talk to your Senators and Representatives. Demand that they make Roundup\u00ae and any GBH illegal just like DDT and Agent Orange. Vote with your dollar. Buy foods that are labeled 100% organic. And, if you can't afford to buy all organic all the time, note that these are the top foods to avoid: any food containing soy, corn, or canola, including soy, corn, and canola oils; non -organic breakfast cereals; additives that include corn syrup, maltodextrin, fructose, baking powder, natural flavors, and cornstarch; most processed foods; and non - organic fruits and vegetables. Consume organic apple cider vinegar every day; it contains microbes that can metabolize glyphosate. Consume fermented foods and fulvic and humic acids; these bind glyphosate and push it out through the stool. Take organic turmeric daily. Consider taking 5HTP or consult with your naturopath on what to do to maintain healthy serotonin levels in your body. Other supplements that can help reduce the effects of glyphosate poisoning: Garlic, Vitamin C, Glutathione, and Probiotics. Having worked as a naturopath for twenty years and seeing clients on a daily basis, I tell you that this makes sense. Nutritional and herbal programs that \"worked\" twenty years ago, do not necessarily give the same results as easily now. Nearly every client reports experiencing at least one of the glyphosate -related or low serotonin health conditions (if not three or more of them simultaneously). So, please, take those steps to action so that we have a future. \"Improving Our Health and Reducing the Violence in America.\" Ebook at www.myfoodstuff.com 9 The \"Dirty Dozen \" 2019 (Foods containing the highest amounts of pesticide residue when grown conventionally) Posted by the Environmental Working Group 1.

We know it was the bite of this very dangerous spider, because by midnight, I was in the University of Michigan's ER talking with an ER doc who did his residency in Texas. He took one look at the three -inch wide, one -inch high domed blister -like swelling that was still growing and said: \"THIS is the bite of a brown recluse spider. They used to only live in Texas and farther south but are now also in the Midwest, traveling north in trucked produce... No, there is no antidote, though we can give you steroids and antibiotics if things get very bad...No, there is literally nothing medicine can do about it, even if it had happened right here in front of us in the ER. Yes, what you see on the Internet is a real risk.... This venom typically dissolves through muscle and sometimes, to the bone, leaving huge gaping open wounds, taking months to heal, if it ever does.... GOOD LUCK, AND TRY TO KEEP IT CLEAN.\" WHAT?! As you might imagine, this was a solemn moment. What I had seen on the Internet was frightening. People lost parts of their body to this little arachnid. Spoiler alert: Thanks to naturopaths, I did not lose anything! And, in fact, we had a chance to see natural remedies work brilliantly twice now with brown recluse spider bites and are no longer scared of them. These remedies are great for all kinds of bites; it's just that the brown recluse is one of only two deadly spiders to humans in the US. (The other is the black widow.) Let's catch you up on how to be prepared! Brown recluse spiders are notable for the characteristic violin pattern on the back of the cephalothorax, the central part of the body where the legs attach. They are yellowish -tan to dark brown, and their one -inch legs are darker in color. They have 6 eyes instead of spiders' usual 8, but you'd need a magnifying glass to tell. They usually bite only when threatened and when they're pressed up against the skin; their preferred environment is warm and dry, such as attics, woodpiles, and barns. And, they are reclusive ; they avoid people and are rarely seen. Most bites happen in the summer, and both of the two bites our family has had happened while we were clearing brush and vines in the woods. When I stopped that May day for a break near our bonfire, I found a painless small circle under the wide cuff of my work gloves. It looked like 12 a pencil eraser was dipped in the ash from the fire and pressed into my skin. It was not tender, but it did not wipe off. Every few hours, I'd take my gloves off again - the circle staying light gray and slowing growing in diameter. But, by the children's bedtime, it was darkening, was nearly the size of a silver dollar, and clearly turning into a sort of blister. By 11 pm, I was waiting in the ER, having drawn a circle around it with a pen so its expansion could be measured. It was starting to hurt, and the saga was clearly still developing. After the rather hopeless pronouncement of the ER doc, I left more than a little worried! My arm, by this time, was throbbing, and the swelling was growing shiny and tight. On the way home, between the pain and the worry, I stopped and woke up a naturopathic friend to get advice. She loaned me what she had and made me a shopping list; by early morning, the bite was nearly 4\" across. I could feel a deep, three -dimensional wound developing. AND YET - the following items stopped it in its tracks! Here's What Worked: -Homeopathic LEDUM - good for every manner of bite, especially spider bites. At first sign of a suspected bite, take a 9C potency, 3 -4 pellets under the tongue in a clean mouth. Repeat every 15 minutes for up to an hour, then repeat every hour if it's still growing. -Homeopathic APIS - indicated for all stings, and in any case of swelling; same directions as Ledum. -Immediately, dab PURIFICATION essential oil on it directly - this starts dissolving the venom. -BENTONITE CLAY - take a few Tbsp, and start by adding a little water to make a little paste...To which you add several drops of GERANIUM essential oil; mix gently, and apply in a thin -moderate paste over the entire blister and beyond its boundaries, however small or large. Do not apply it too thin; it cracks too quickly. And, don't apply it too thick; it takes too long to dry and draw out the venom. -Let dry. -Leave until either an hour passes or until it then gets wet from drawing the liquid out of the blister. -Gently clean, and repeat. -Consider taking NSP's Protease Plus to 'dissolve foreign proteins in the blood.' 13 I followed up with Hypericum homeopathic and St. John's Wort oil topically to help heal the nerve damage. I kept applying fresh clay poultices to my arm, letting them draw out the poison as they dried. The swelling visibly reduced over the course of the first day as I alternated Purification and Geranium in the clay. I could also feel the radiating bone pain begin to reduce. The clay was clearly being successful at drawing out the poison. Frankly, it felt like it was barely in the nick of time, as I could feel my tissues seeming to liquefy under the skin. After 24 hours, I was doing clay poultices with essential oils (usually both at once by this point) just a few times a day and did this for several more days. My bite never opened up into the gaping, deep necrotic wounds that are characteristic of brown recluse bites. It did take over 6 months for the wide swath of numbness to resolve and about a year for the scar to reduce to its original small, dusty, pale circle on my arm. TAKE TWO. The day before school started one September, our first -grader came in from the woods wearing his open sandals. When he removed them, there was an exact replica of the ash -colored circle under his shoe strap, across his ankle. Trying not to panic, I ran for the Ledum, Apis, and oils. I was very concerned, as in addition to being a small, young child, the bite was on an area that had very thin skin directly over tendon and bone, quite unlike the fleshy layers of my forearm. He never felt pain and tried to argue that it was just a mosquito bite that somehow just didn't itch! Its appearance was undeniable though, and I had to do serious negotiating to get a bouncing seven -year- old to let a clay layer dry undisturbed with his foot up that evening. I was amazed to see the next morning that it had not advanced at all! I continued the remedies and asked his teachers to give him one dose of the homeopathics during the school day, along with changing out the band aid once with fresh oils. Within 48 hours, we could not find the mark - it NEVER swelled, hurt, or visibly damaged the flesh. Early treatment definitely averted damage before it could set in. Most spiders are very benign and do great good in our eco -system. They eat insects and play a key Protease Plus from Nature's Sunshine Thank you Instructor, Beth Barbeau, for that great reminder of all the tools available to us. What an incredible community of knowledge we have and how great it is to be able to share it! We love that you mentioned the Protease Plus from Nature's Sunshine. This remedy started out in our minds as a great enzyme product for helping to digest food proteins, and indeed, it has been very successful for that very purpose. Yet, the incredible stories of this product expand outward into many amazing stories of health and wellbeing, often being launched from the first aid kit. It all started a number of years ago when our dear mentor and teacher Dr. Delores Spence was lecturing about protein poisons. She taught us that all venom bites, such as those of spiders, snakes, ants and beyond, all contained a protein that we can't break down. It requires an enzyme that can really handle a lot of foreign protein all at once. When we discussed it further, we realized viruses are particles of protein, as well as all things that cause allergies. We began using it for bites, stings, poison ivy, and every allergy or sinus problem no matter its source. We even use it for abnormal growths which contain non -communicating proteins. Well, you could say the rest is history as we carry a high number of these popular bottles that are in regular herbal programs, allergy protocols, and most especially, a spare bottle around for plant, animal, and insect protein poisons. It has helped every time, even with the most severe nut allergies that needed emergency care. All symptoms were clear even before arriving in the emergency room. Make sure you have a bottle of this on hand! role in the control of insect populations. There is no need to be afraid or hostile towards spiders, and it's good to teach our children to calmly return these im- portant little friends safely outside. With this decep- tively simple spider kit, you'll be prepared in the rare event of a bite from the rarely seen brown recluse spider. It's easy to gather - Ledum, Apis, Geranium, Purification, and Bentonite Clay. All of these basic naturopathic tools are available at Herbs Etc. and will stay 'good' for years. They are useful in many other first aid situations, and - you'll have on hand what you need should you ever see a 'painless little circle growing on your skin' after being in a dry, hidey spot during the summer months! 14 The First Annual NHIFF - Natural Health Freedom Festival had it all! The guest speakers were phenomenal. The knowledge they brought and the information they shared was truly priceless! The setting allowed for interaction and questions that could never have occurred in a large assembly. Don Huber and Robert Delaney brought fact-based research of the damage man made chemicals are doing to our environment and our bodies, along with scientific projections of how this WILL affect our future. Chris Wright enlightened us on the wonderful world of mushrooms, and Richard Olree connected key minerals to our genetic code. Workshops were filled with hands -on and educational opportunities that crossed a wide range of topics. From phrenology to knife forging, tracking to making salves, the workshops were a great success! Mix in some great shopping at the vendor tent and amazing entertainment from The Brother's Barbeau, Black Murray Band, and the band our Olympians named Nature's Jam, and there wasn't a second to spare. Warrior Challengers competed in blind taste testing, foot agility, balance, and memory competitions. With tolerant taste buds, they mastered \"The Drink\" challenge and smelled their way through the oils challenge. They all proved their warrior strength and ability! With a final power move and warrior yell, Beth Barbeau came in with a loud \"PUSH\" and took third place. Erin Huey, decorated with wildflowers to fit her warrior style, had the judges ready to run with her power stance and fierce war cry, landing her second place. But, for the first place win, Kirsten Eichenberg walked to the competitors circle with a sweet smile and gentle demeanor; then, unleashed a warrior yell while charging the judges with a power move that no one saw coming. Warrior Challenge: First Place: Kirsten Eichenberg Second Place: Erin Huey Third Place: Beth Barbeau 15 The Natural Health Team Olympics brought team spirit, creativity, and lots of laughs for the participants and the spectators. The Rumbler's proved they came \"ready to rumble\" by taking first place overall! But, with a Name that Band contest thrown in the mix with Sudden Death Dance, Tire Stick Relay, and a Big Foot Partner Race, all teams showed they have Olympic Spirit!
