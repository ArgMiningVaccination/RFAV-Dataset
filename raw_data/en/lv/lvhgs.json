The brand is based upon the Korean concept of \"jeong,\" which roughly translates to a deep, meaningful connection to a person, place, or thing. You'll definitely form a bond with this innovative gel-cream, which envelops skin in a peptide-rich formula to counteract the visible signs of aging. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory ingredients round out the ingredient list, soothing redness and protecting skin from future damage. First-generation Indian American Michelle Ranavat was inspired to start her namesake brand, a blend of what she calls \"modern alchemy and romance,\" on a trip to Jaipur in 2010. This product is a highlight. This supercharged hydrosol (a blend of plant extracts and water) face mist is one of the best. But there's more to it than just an incredible scent (and it is incredible): The antioxidant-rich jasmine within makes the formula great as a toner or mask activator too. A sheet mask for your feet? Yes\u2014and to try this product is to love it. Cofounder Lisa Ballstaedt and her friend Kayla Bertagna were convinced they could make sheet masks that were a step above the smelly, ill-fitting ones they brought along on a girlfriends trip to Puerto Vallarta\u2014and Soon (named after Ballstaedt's paternal grandmother) was born. These booties are filled with a serum containing peony, hyaluronic acid, allantoin, and green tea. After four weeks of use, those dry, cracked heels with be a thing of the past.

The result is a rich, nourishing mask that nurtures hair from roots to ends. Dry strands drink up plant oils for inside-out strengthening while vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids are delivered to the scalp to keep follicles healthy. Famed Korean nail expert Jin Soon Choi offers all manner of bright, bold, and beautiful nail polish in her eponymous brand (the confetti topcoats, in particular, are a thing to behold). But in this editor's opinion, one of the undoubted highlights of the line is this moisturizing cuticle oil, which hydrates nails with a blend of oils such as jojoba, almond, and avocado to prevent splitting and cracking. You could even smooth a few drops over your face (who doesn't love a good multitasker?). Remember that YouTube video of the woman applying red lipstick to conceal her under-eye circles? That was Deepica Mutyala\u2014and her viral moment was the catalyst for her inclusive brand, Live Tinted. That red lipstick inspired the brand's multi-use Huesticks, which can serve as a color corrector, eye shadow, or lipstick. They're great, but this functional highlighter should not be overlooked: It's serum-like ingredients (hyaluronic acid, squalane, and plant extracts) do very good things for your complexion. A chance encounter with a geisha during a trip to Kyoto inspired Vicky Tsai to bring the Japanese notion of simplicity and quality to the American beauty consumer, and this silky primer is one of the brand's best-loved products. At the heart of every formula is a proprietary blend of three Japanese superfoods: green tea, rice, and algae. But an even more important thread woven throughout the fabric of Tatcha is a commitment to philanthropy: The brand has partnered with Room to Read to help fund the education of young girls in Asia and Africa. Korean-born Alicia Yoon launched her website, Peach & Lily, to bring her beloved K -beauty brands to an American audience. On there, you'll find some of the best-known cult formulas of brands such as Son & Park and Shangpree, as well as her own products, like these acne patches from Peach Slices. The hydrocolloid-like stickers allow blemishes the time to properly heal (you can't pick what you can't touch, right?) and reduce the inflammation. Rosalina Tan, dubbed the Mother of Organic Farming in the Philippines, became fascinated by the resilience of the pili tree from the Bicol region of the country. Known as the \"stress-loving tree\" by Filipinos due to its abilities to withstand the area's numerous storms, Tan and her daughter Mary Jane Tan-Ong decided to harness the anti-aging powers of the oil from its seeds by launching their brand Pili Ani. The latest product, this detoxifying mask, pairs it with natural volcanic ash to deeply purify the pores. Priscilla Tsai knows what it's like to have really sensitive skin that seems to react to almost anything that's smeared on it, so she decided to launch a brand focused around gentle, clean ingredients. Since then, Cocokind has become about so much more. The brand is committed to new levels of transparency (each product has a \"formula facts\" panel on the box that describes how the final product came together) and sustainability (also on the box is a detailed description of each item's carbon footprint so you know exactly how your purchase is affecting the environment). This mineral-based sunscreen is a Cocokind must-have. Kulfi Beauty founder Priyanka Ganjoo didn't see a place for South Asian women in the beauty industry, so she created one\u2014and the brand's kajal eyeliners have become a huge hit. The brand, named after an Indian frozen dairy dessert, is known for its fantastic colors designed to complement all skin tones, but the idea behind the liners\u2014to encourage self-expression and and experimentation with makeup\u2014is even sweeter. Create a simple cat eye or have fun with a more intricate design; either way, the creamy, long-lasting formula will net you solid results. This advanced skincare line, founded by Los Angeles dermatologist Ronald L. Moy, MD, has the receipts to back up its claims: With a focus on sun protection, Cellular MD is the only brand that combines Nobel Prize-winning DNA repair enzyme technology with growth factors. Add a few drops of this product to your daily sunscreen to boost its protective powers: It contains the highest level of DNA repair enzymes of all the brand's offerings. Glow Recipe's Korean American cofounders, Sarah Lee and Christine Chang, have basically cornered the market on fun-and-fruity skincare, with products infused with everything from blueberry to bananas. To choose only one item to highlight is a fool's errand\u2014there are so many good ones\u2014but I'm particularly partial to this unique makeup/skincare hybrid. It's packed with all of the usual suspects\u2014niacinamide, hyaluronic acid\u2014but in serum-cum-highlighter formula that leaves a flattering glow behind. A good bronzer can be tough to find when you have dark skin\u2014the colors are never quite right. That's not the case with Tower 28's buttery option, infused with mango butter and calming green tea. Even better: It's free of potentially irritating ingredients, a hugely important aspect of the line to founder Amy Liu, who has sensitive skin herself and couldn't find any clean cosmetic brands that work on her own complexion.

The brains behind the brand\u2014Amy Ling Lin\u2014has transformed the experience of getting a manicure into a 360-degree moment of wellness, adding meditation and a relaxing minimalist studio design to the package. And her polishes are nontoxic, cruelty-free, and have fantastic color payoff\u2014including this fresh light pink. Fable & Mane is a love letter to the Indian tradition of hair oiling. Cofounder Nikita Mehta remembers her grandmother massaging her hair with a mixture of healing plant oils to increase its shine and strength. This product is a direct descendent of that ritual, with Ashwagandha, castor oil, and Dashmool, a combination of ten different plant extracts that nurture the scalp to increase the health of your strands. At the heart of this serum\u2014and all Yina products\u2014is the brand's Chinese medicinal plant complex, based on the centuries-old healing practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and developed by Angela Chau Gray and Dr. Irvina Wu, a registered TCM dermatologist. Ginseng, lotus, and antioxidants prevent breakouts and environmental damage. Television personality, blogger, and influencer Tina Craig couldn't figure out, for the life of her, why skincare had to be so complicated. She yearned for a more streamlined approach, so she developed this does-it-all product to smooth, tighten, and renew skin in just one step. Since then, Craig has developed other products for the line, including a cool arm sculpting compound, but this serum remains a cult favorite.

So it should come as no surprise that his namesake brand would have some top performers, including this unique blush duo, which brings together the color payoff of a powder and the luxurious texture of a cream in one compact. Use a fluffy brush to apply the powder first, then pat the cream on top with your fingertips. Taran and Bunny Ghatrora\u2014the sisters behind clean beauty and self-care brand Blume\u2014are on a mission to destigmatize menstruation and skin conditions associated with puberty, like acne. How are they doing it? By introducing products like the brand's Cloud 9 Cramp Oil, a blend of soothing essential oils to help minimize period pain and discomfort, and the Meltdown Acne Oil, which combines rosehip, blue tansy, and black seed oils to battle breakouts and nourish\u2014not dehydrate\u2014acne-prone skin.
