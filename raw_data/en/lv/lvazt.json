One of the most prevalent orthopedic disorders is fractures or shattered bones, so it is no wonder there is a need to find ways to heal bone fractures faster. Every year, over 6.3 million fractures occur in the United States alone. It doesn't stop there! One in every three women and one in every five men in the world will have osteoporosisi [X]A bone condition that causes weak bones due to a decrease in the body's ability to replace old bone tissues with new ones. at some point in their lives. Although fractures heal on their own, you may employ a few home cures and techniques to speed up the healing process and lessen the possibilities of future fractures. Scroll down to learn how to deal with this situation. In This Article What Is A Bone Fracture? A bone fracture is nothing but a crack in the bone. A great percentage of fractures are a result of stress or high force impact. In some individuals, a bone fracture can also be a result of medical conditions that weaken the bone like osteoporosis, cancer, and osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease). Your bone can be fractured in various ways. If a break in the bone does not affect the surrounding tissue or damage it in any way, it is called a closed fracture. A bone fracture that damages the surrounding skin is called an open fracture or a compound fracture. So, how many types of fractures are there? And how are they different from each other? Let's find out! Types Of Bone Fractures - Avulsion fracture - A fracture caused by a muscle or ligament pulling on your bone. - Comminuted fracture - This results in shattered bones. - Compression or crush fracture - This type usually occurs in the bones of your spine, like the front of your vertebra. - Fracture dislocation - Dislocation of a joint and fracture in one of the bones. - Greenstick fracture - A fracture on one side of the bone that does not cause it to break completely. - Hairline fracture - A partial fracture. - Impacted fracture - Occurs when one fragment of your bone enters the other as a result of a fracture. - Intraarticular fracture - When a fracture or break extends into the joint surface. - Longitudinal fracture - A longitudinal break along the bone. - Oblique fracture - A fracture diagonal to the bone's long axis. - Pathological fracture - A medical issue causes your bones to weaken, making them fracture easily. - Spiral fracture - A fracture accompanied by a twisted bone. - Stress fracture - When a bone breaks due to repeated stress and strain. - Torus or buckle fracture - Deforms your bone without cracking. - Transverse fracture - A straight break across your bone. Bone fractures also exhibit a few symptoms depending on the affected bone. The most affected bones are the orbital bone (eye socket), tailbone, pelvic bone, the clavicle or collarbone, the fibula or calf bone, heel bone, and the femur. Let us now look at the symptoms of bone fractures. Signs And Symptoms Of Fractures A few common symptoms associated with fractures are: - Swelling - Bruising - Pain - Skin discoloration - Angulation (bending of the affected area in an unusual angle) - Inability of the patient to put weight on the affected area - Immobility - A grating sensation in the affected area - Bleeding (in the case of an open fracture) Usually, an external force or stress causes a fracture. Let's take a quick look at the other causes. What Causes A Fracture? Fractures are caused due to a bad fall or an automobile accident. Most healthy bones are tough enough to withstand powerful impact. Aging and other health conditions can weaken your bones, making the probability of fractures higher. A few underlying medical conditions that can cause your bones to get fractured easily are: - Osteoporosis - Infection - Tumor or cancer You may also be at an increased risk of getting fractures due to the following factors: - Age: Older adults and young children are more prone to fractures because of weak bones. - Repeatedly injuring the affected area (common among sports professionals) - Menopause After an accident or injury, if you suspect you have fractured your bone, get yourself diagnosed by a medical professional. [X]Sex hormones responsible for the development of the reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. levels lead to a lower bone mineral densityi [X]The amount of minerals present in bone tissues that indicate the density and thickness of the bones. . How To Diagnose A Bone Fracture The doctor will first ask you to undergo a physical examination if they suspect a fracture. You may further be asked to undergo any of the following tests: - X-ray - MRI scan - CT scan If you have ended up fracturing your bone, it is best to initiate treatment immediately.
