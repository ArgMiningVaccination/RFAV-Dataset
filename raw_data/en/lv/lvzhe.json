I initially went to see Vaidya Jay at the request of my daughter. She had been to him and couldn't say enough good things about him. I was apprehensive at first. I'm a middle aged woman who was overweight, high cholesterol, and heading toward pre diabetes. Upon meeting Vaidya Jay, he puts you at ease right away. He listens very patiently, and has a way that I've never encountered with any other Vaidya of breaking everything down for you. He gets to the root of the problem which in return everything begins to make sense and falls into place. "}
