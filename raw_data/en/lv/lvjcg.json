A state Food Review Committee will convene whenever necessary to review the current authorized food list, resolve any food-related issues, and/or determine any change in foods. The authorized food list will be reviewed at least every 2 years. 2. The Food Review Committee recommends general and specific criteria for approving WIC foods: Nutritional Considerations and Education WIC foods shall meet the minimum federal requirements governing the WIC food package 7 CFR 246.10, Table 4, and state criteria for allowable foods, as outlined in 770. The food package shall offer a variety of types and brands of the allowed foods to ensu re that all participants' dietary needs shall be considered (high fiber cereals, variety of grains, wheat -free options, cereals which are good finger foods for toddlers, lactose -intolerant choices, etc.) WIC food products shall be consistent with the promo tion o f good nutrition and education, and provide opportunity to promote sound food buying practices. Foods and their packaging shall be evaluated based on the ease in educating participants on the purchase of particular food products. Packaging shall be distinguishable from that of similar products. Acceptability of Foods The WIC Program shall select foods that can be consumed by the majority of participants and shall give consideration to cultural food beliefs, preferences and practices or special food ne eds of participants. The relative acceptability of a food item by participants and staff shall be determined before that food item is added to or removed from the food package. Participant preference of foods will be gathered by the following: Participant preference surveys Local program staff surveys Participant requests Participant EBT purchase data Availability of Foods The selection of different food products for the WIC Food List shall be determined based on availability at the retail and wholesale le vel. The food product is be available from WIC Vendors throughout the state or from the majority of the largest wholesale distributors in the state. The food product is available for at least one year on store shelves (in the United States) before it is co nsidered for addition to the WIC Food List. An availability survey is conducted throughout the state as part of the food review process. Authorized Foods , Continued 770.32 Cost The cost of food items shall be considered prior to authorization. Higher priced items may be disallowed if products meeting all other criteria are available at a lower cost, for example organic foods or specialty products. The WIC Program will consider store brands to contain costs. The WIC Program shall have the option to further restrict the number of brands of any product in order to contain the cost of the food package through competitive procurement of rebate contracts or by other similar means. Price surveys of nutritionally adequate products shall be conducted throughout the state as part of the fo od review process. 3. When a request is made to add a product or clarify if a product meets the WIC criteria, the request should include a label or packaging material which clearly indicates the name of the manufacturer, address of manufacturer, type of fo od, ingredients, nutrient information, size of container and Universal Product Code (UPC). Send this information to the Oregon Health Authority WIC Program: Oregon Health Authority Nutrition and Health Screening (WIC) Program 800 NE Oregon Street, Suite 86 5 Portland, OR 97232 -3477 As needed, the state WIC Program staff will contact the manufacturer to verify the information on the label and obtain other relevant information such as, but not restricted to, documentation that certifies the actual content of n utrients/ingredients identified in WIC federal regulations, availability, alternative package sizes and cost. 4. The Food Review Committee will use the following tools to determine which foods to authorize: Surveys of WIC participants and local program sta ff; participant requests, participant EBT purchase data and input of authorized Vendors . Submissions from food companies requesting consideration of their products for the Food List; Nutrition content charts for submitted foods, reviewed by a state nutriti onist Price and availability information 5. Once the food review process is complete, the state WIC program will take the following actions: The Food List will be updated. The Food List will be translated into languages based on pre-determined threshold s Vendors and local WIC programs will be notified in writing of these changes and their effective date. Participants will be notified. Data system changes will be made as necessary. "}
