This work bridges culture, policy, research, law enforcement and community engagement - all necessary for transformative change. Challenging the structures that foment racism around and within us is a lifelong journey. The New York City Commission on Human Rights has curated a set of antiracism resources to foster critical engagement and dialogue regarding historical and contemporary manifestations of bias, racism, and discrimination. This set of resources is a start but is certainly not consummate. It includes books, articles, videos, documentaries, podcasts and links to organizations. For those resources that do not have links, many of them can be found by searching online. Antiracism work cannot be done passively; these resources provide a foundation to understand and engage with the role of race and identity in the United States, and to take action towards dismantling white supremacy. We hope these resources inspire you. (For our younger readers, please also visit [Stories For All: A Human Rights Reading List](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/cchr/downloads/pdf/Stories_for_All_Human_Rights_Reading_List.pdf)). Select resources that investigate structural and institutional racism, white supremacy culture, and personal bias. The focus is on resources that address the U.S. context, though these issues manifest globally.
