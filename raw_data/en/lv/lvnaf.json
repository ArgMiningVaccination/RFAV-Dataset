This has also prompted a re -examination of the indoor environment more widely , with a focus on how to improve and maintain healthy indoor air quality while mitigating against the risks of pathogens circulating in the commu nity. Future -proofing is needed to mitigate against the emergence of new variants of the SARS -CoV-2 virus, and the potential for endemic COVID -19, as well as future pathogens. An agreed scope of work was commissioned by Workplace Health and Safety of BC P ublic Service Agency to answer a set of key questions addressing the relationship between COVID -19 and indoor air: What is the risk of transmission of SARS -CoV-2 in indoor spaces via various transmission pathways ? How does the emergence of new variants influence the risk of transmission indoors ? What are the key factors that exacerbate the risk of transmission indoors? What strategies are most important for mitigating risk, and how can we estimate the impact of various measures? What is know n about the influence of ventilation in the mitigation of transmission indoors? The scope of work included a general literature search of academic and grey literature including an evaluation of quality and synthesis of key findings, consultation with key in formants and experts in the field, and external review of this document. KEY FINDINGS Area of interest Summary of key findings What is the risk of transmission of SARS -CoV- 2 in indoor spaces via various transmission pathways? Evidence to date suggests that most transmission occurs as a result of close contact interactions ( short -range exposure to respiratory emissions ). The virus may transmit opportunistically over a longer distance where there is a high source load of virus in the air and in poorly ventilated environments where there is poor clearance of accumulat ing particles . Other routes of transmission such as via contaminated surfaces (fomites ) and fecal -aerosol transmission may be occurring, although direct evidence of this is limited to date. How does the emergence of new variants influence the risk of transmission indoors? At the time of writing, four variants of concern (VOC) are known to be spreading in Canada, commonly referred to as Alpha , Beta , and Gamma and Delta . All four VOC are shown to be more transmissible, and VOC are now more prevalent among new cases of COVID -19 than previously circulating strains. COVID -19 and Indoor Air 3 Alpha is associated with a higher risk of mortality, and Beta and Gamma have been shown to evade natural and vaccin e-induced immunity. Initial investigation of Delta suggests it may result in more severe illness and may show a reduced response to a single dose of vaccine compared to other strains. Research is ongoing to identify how emerging variants differentially influence transmission , but current research suggests that mutation s that increase affinity for the ACE -2 receptor are making transmission more efficient. Initial study has also demonstrated that persons infected with Alpha may have a highe r load (shed more virus) and may be infectious for longer. Enhanced transmissibility means that a lower dose or shorter duration of exposure can result in transmission, so risks from all transmission routes are heightened. This means stricter adherence to public health measures to mitigate spread is needed. What are the key factors that exacerbate the risk of transmission indoors? Risks of becoming infected by SARS -CoV-2 vary depending on the prevalence of COVID -19 transmission in the community, host factors, personal behaviour, including mask -wearing, and the micro -environment including the physical characteristics of the space (size, layout, and environmental controls) and how users interact within the space (density of users, duratio n of interaction and nature of activities). For indoor spaces, measures for reducing transmission risk focus on reducing the 3 C's (closed spaces, crowding, close contact ) and the duration, intensity and frequency of contacts with others, and as such reduce the opportunity for exposure, and intensity of exposure , should it occur. What strategies are most important for mitigating risk, and how can we estimate the impact of various measures? Very few interventions have been investigated with respect to reducing SARS -CoV-2 transmission; however, we assume that these technologies are likely still beneficial based on research on other illnesses or other IAQ contaminants (e.g., removal of particulate matte r). Cumulatively, the evidence available regarding the effectiveness of various risk mitigation measures and technologies shows that layered interventions are essential to preventing the spread of disease. Once a risk mitigation strategy has been implement ed, it is critical to review and revise as pandemic conditions shift. What is known about the influence of ventilation in the mitigation of transmission indoors? Ventilation can reduce transmission risks associated with sharing indoor spaces, by reducing the concentration of bioaerosols that do not settle due to gravity and thus increasing the duration of the time that a person could be exposed without becoming infected. Ventilation does not reduce the risks of transmission arising from close contact with an infected person, or transmission via fomite transmission. COVID -19 and Indoor Air 4 It is possible to either under - or over -ventilate a space in a way that might affect transmission ; the optimal ventilation rate for a given space is highly context dependent. Future -proofing indoor spaces will require improved ventilation, integrating complementary technologies, a renewed focus on human -centred design, and may also require changes to cod es and standards.

COVID -19 and Indoor Air 9 LITERATURE REVIEW PREAMBLE Humans spend approximately 80-90% of their time indoors and it is no surprise that the quality of the indoor air environment in home and work environments can significantly impact the health and well-being of building occupants .1,2 In workplaces, indoor air quality (IAQ) can have substantial impacts on employee productivity, cognitive function, the number of sick days taken, with subsequent economic impacts for an employer.3 Indoor air pollutants are diverse and can include mould, radon, volatile organic compounds , odours and other gases, and infectious pathogens . Acute and chronic exposure to various pollutants can result in a variety of advers e outcomes, therefore removing or re ducing exposure is necessary to avoid these outcomes . There are various strategies that can be used to improve indoor air quality such as providing source control of indoor air pollutants, designing ventilation and air cleaning systems to minimize the accumulation of pollutants indoors, and to consider operational, maintenance and monitoring requirements to identify and address IAQ issues. In the current COVID -19 pandemic, improvements to indoor air q uality are also likely to have a positive impact on reducing spread of the SARS -CoV-2 virus among occupants, when used in conjunction with other mitigation measures. The following sections examine the literature on how SARS -CoV-2 transmits indoors, how evo lution of the virus may affect transmission indoors, the features of indoor spaces that can exacerbate transmission risks and strategies for reducing transmission risks, including an examination of how ventilation solutions in particular can curtail the spread of SARS -CoV-2 indoors. This literature review is based on the existing published evidence and guidance availab le at the time of writing . COVID -19 and Indoor Air 10 RESEARCH QUESTION 1: WHAT IS THE RISK OF TRANSMISSION OF SARS -COV -2 IN INDOOR SPACES VIA VARIOUS TRANSMISSIO N PATHWAYS ? The transmission of SARS -CoV-2 in indoor spaces is influenced by a combination of biological and physical mechanisms of viral transmission , with several pathways by which the virus can move from an infected person to a new susceptible host. T his section examines the evidence for the most dominant pathways for SARS -CoV-2 transmission in indoor spaces. WHAT IS COVID -19 AND HOW DOES IT SPREAD ? Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) is an illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2). The SARS -CoV-2 virus is a single -stranded RNA virus that is enveloped in a lipid layer covered in protein spikes or \"corona\". In simple terms, infection occurs when the SARS - CoV-2 virus binds to a host cell and inserts its viral RNA , resulting in replication of new virus, which can then be released to cause infection of a new host . SARS -CoV-2 is thought to infect a host cell by bind ing to ACE -2 receptors that are present in the epithelial cells of the upper and lower airways .4,5 The main route of entry is via the upper respiratory tract or mucous membranes of the face, and once infected, virus replicates pr edominantly in the tissues of the upper respiratory tract.5,6 Various physical and biological mechanisms influence how virus is emitted from an infected person. Replicated virus can accumulate in the mucous, saliva or other respiratory emissions of an infected person and subsequently be released during cough ing, sneez ing, singing, laughing, shouting, talking or breathing , or transferred to hands by touching of the face . Forceful respiratory actions (e.g., coughs and sneezes ) release bursts of resp iratory particle s intermittently, which range in size from large droplets (e.g., > 100 \u00b5m diameter) to smaller aerosols (e.g., < 5 \u00b5m diameter) . Breathing or speaking tend s to be l ess forceful but occur s more frequently, producing fewer particles per event , which tend to be smaller .7-13 Shouting or singing tend can produce more respiratory emissions than breathing or quiet speaking, and t he quantity of particles released can vary with loudness , phonation , e.g., \"super -emitters\") emitting a much larger quantity of particles than others .7,8,11,13 -16 Various physical forces and environmental conditions can influence the likelihood of particles falling to the grou nd or settling on surfaces or remaining suspended in ambient air .17-21 Multiple factors including the force with which the particle is emitted, the size and shape, ambient airflow, movement of people, room layout and ventilation can influence how long a particle will remain suspended. Although very large droplets will deposit quickly due to gravity, the fate of the remaining particles is influenc ed by how much of their mass is evaporated over the subsequent few seconds. As the diameter of the particles decreases due to evaporation, the amount of time required for particles to settle will increase.22 If enough of their liquid mass evaporates, some particles will remain aloft until they are removed by ventilation or they impact surfaces or people . Environmental factors such as relative humidity and temperature can a ffect the evaporation of liquid contained in droplets and aerosols, thus influencing the likelihood of particles remaining suspended or settling. Exposure to just one or a few viral particles is unlikely to result in infection , but the precise dose needed to cause infection may vary . Evidence from animal studies suggest s that the infectious dose is likely a few hundred particles but likelihood of infection can depend on the viral load of the COVID -19 and Indoor Air 11 source, the route of infection and the immune response of the exposed person .23-27 An infectious dose may result from a short but intense exposure to a high concentration of virus or following prolonged or repeated exposure to a smaller dose over time . The more frequent close encounters and the longer a susceptible person spends in contact with an infectious person, the greater the likelihoo d of transmission. Infected persons are more likely to transmit to others on or slightly before the onset of symptoms and c an continue to be infectious for several days after symptom onset .28,29 One study estimated that just under half of transmission events occur before the infectious person displays symptoms (pre -symptomatic spread) .30 About one -third of people may remain asymptomatic for the duration of their infection, although the estimated proportion of asymptomatic persons var ies widely in the literature , as does their relative contribution to transmission .30-32 Pre- and asymptomatic spreaders present a challenge in controlling transmission in communal settings where infected persons may be unaware they are transmitting the virus , and the transmission routes may be different due to the absence of symptoms such as coughin g and sneezing .33-36 TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS There has been extensive debate over the main transmission pathways for SARS -CoV-2 since the beginning of the pandemic and the relative importance of each. Much of this debate has been driven by traditional language around respiratory viruses in clinical settings where transmission is de fined as either via droplet and conta ct exposure , or via airborne exposure. These terms are used to inform the type of precautions adopted to limit exposure in a healthcare setting but have b een ineffective in communicating with the public about how transmission occurs. The US CDC now defines transmission according to how the virus enters the body (e.g., inhalation of virus, deposition of virus on exposed mucous membranes, and touching mucous me mbranes with soiled hands ).37 Alternatively, transmission can be defined more broadly as transmission over short - or long -range or via contact with contaminated surfaces (fomites) , as is supported by evidence from various epidemiological, observational and modelling studies.32,38 -46 This terminology will be used in the following sections to describe SARS -CoV-2 transmission pathways, which are defined as follows: Short -range transmission : Short -range transmission refers to transmission resulting from close contact with an infected individual (within 2 m). Virus expelled from an infectious person in their respiratory emission s (e.g., cough, sneeze, talking, breathing) can be propelled directly onto the mucosa (eyes, nose, mouth) of a susceptible person. Close contact also allows for exposure to high er concentration s of aerosols near er to the source , which can be inhaled by the exposed person. Long -range transmission : Long -range transmission refers to transmission beyond 2 m from the source. Modelling has shown that most large droplets do not travel beyond 2 m, and hence transmission over longer distances is more likely to be associated with dispersed respiratory emissions that may not settle (e.g., aerosols) , but can be inhaled at lower concentrations by a susceptible person. These smaller particles can accumulate over time if they are not removed by ventilation , and a longer duration of exposure can increase the likelihood of inhaling enough viable virus to cause infection. Contact with contaminated surfaces, or fomites : An infectious person can contaminate surface s when their infectious droplets are deposited via coughing, sneezing , or touching COVID -19 and Indoor Air 12 their nose or mouth and then touching a surface (creating fomites) . A susceptible person can be infected if they touch the contaminated surface and su bsequently touch their e yes, nose , or mouth , provided enough viable virus is transferred to cause infection . For some viruses , other transmission pathways may be possible if there is exposure to bodily fluids such as feces , blood , or urine that contain infectious virus . While the se pathways are likely to be less important in the transmission of respiratory pathogens , such as SARS -CoV-2, they may play a role in some circumstances . IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS FOR SARS -COV -2 It is now accepted that most transmission of SARS -CoV-2 occurs indoors and likely results from close interactions with an infected person and exposure to virus -laden particles in their respiratory emissions, but other transmission pathways are possible in some circumstances .40,42,47 -49 Reporting of transmission events in the media and published epidemiological investigations often focuses on rare or unusual events. This type of reporting can be useful in identifying new risk factors but may give unequal weight to accounts of transmission events that are rare compared to routine events and well established pathways of transmission. Caution should therefore be exercised in maki ng an overall assessment of the relative importance of transmission pathways based on media reports, or rare case examples. For the SARS -CoV-2 virus, the relative importance of various transmission pathways is informed by triangulation of evidence from al l sources including observation of transmission events and data on secondary attack rates by settings, populations and scenarios, epidemiological investigations, as well as environmental sampling , animal studies , and model ling studies. SHORT -RANGE TRANSMISSION The vast majority of COVID -19 outbreaks have been linked to close contact interactions indoors and are most often associated with interaction s in the home environment , including shared accommodation or other indoor spaces where there is a hig h density of people and a period of prolonged contact.41,50 -53 This includes workplaces with close proximity of work stations where there is prolonged contact between workers throughout the duration of a shift, such as in manufacturing and food processing plants .54,55 The Public Health Agency of Cana da defines close contact as interactions between individuals within 2 m, and prolonged contact as interactions of more than 15 minutes over a 24 hour period.56 Evidence from animal studies has shown that short -range transmission due to close contact is likely to be more efficient than transmission over longer distances.23-25 This may be due to large droplets only travelling a short distance before falling to the ground and the concentration of aerosols released due to coughs, sneezes, or other respiratory action being higher in close proximity to the emitter.57,58 Studies of ferrets have demonstrated that short -range transmission between ferrets in the same cage is very efficient but transmission can also occur between nearby cages.59,60 Elsewhere, studies of hamsters have provided evidence that transmission may occur via infectious aerosols over relatively short distances or via fomites in a shared cage .61,6 2 Some animal studies are limited in the ir ability to distinguish the exact pathway of infection (e.g., ballistic droplets, short -range aerosols, or contaminated surfaces near the source) , and may not report on the symptoms and behaviours of COVID -19 and Indoor Air 13 animals studied or experimental conditions . They provide some evidence of more efficient transmission associated with proximity to the source , but caution should be used in comparing animal studies to transmission in humans . Evidence from contact tracing studies have show n that most transmission occurs among persons who are high -risk close contacts of someone infected with COVID -19.63-67 Secondary attack rates (SAR) , or the proportion of exposed susceptible persons tha t develop infection , are higher among people who spend time in close contact with each other such as members of the same household ,68 or persons sharing congregate living settings.69,70 This effect is more pronounced the more time people spend in contact, with higher SAR observed for people who share a living room or a vehicl e or engage in verbal interactions .64,71,72 Crowded spaces, where it is difficult for people to maintain their distance, or settings where close contact interactions are unavoidable , or where mask -wearing is variable (e .g., during shared meals), also feature in transmission events.66,73 Systematic review s have estimated SAR in house holds to be in the region of 17 -21%.74,75 Thomson et al.75 identified that the SAR was much higher among household members (pooled average of 21.1% ) compared to close contacts in non -household settings , such as social events with family and friends (5.9%) and low -risk casual contacts with strangers (1.2%) . People who spend time in close proximity to each other have a greater likelihood of encountering virus -laden particles, either vi a deposition on mucous membranes or inhalation of concentrated aerosols .58 A study of train passengers in China found that the attack rate for passengers sharing a train with a person infected with COVID -19 was higher for persons sitting adjacent to the infected person compared to those sharing a r ow, or seated a few rows away.73 The attack rate also increased with the duration of co -travel time. This points to the importance of close contact interactions and duration of exposure in transmission events . Current evidence has also shown that public health measures designed to protect against close contact transmission, namely physical distancing and mask -wearing, have led to a reduction in cases.76,77 LONG -RANGE TRANSMISSION Some r espiratory activities , such a s heavy breathing, speaking, singing, shouting, or laughing , can produce respiratory emissions that are mostly aerosols < 5 \u00b5m in diameter . These a erosols c an remain suspended in air and be transported by ambient air currents and may take several minutes t o settle .33,78 -81 Some smaller aerosols may remain suspended and accumulate in the air over time and could contain some infectious virus, yet the quantity of virus transported over longer distances in this manner and the importance to transmission is still an area of some debate. Some experts propose that SARS -CoV-2 fits the necessary criteria to indicate that airborne transmission is possible , however understanding the relative importance of long -range airborne transmission in the pandemic requires a more nuanced assessment of the evidence .18,20,82 -84 Unde r experimental conditions, SARS -CoV-2 has been found to remain viable when airborne over short distances for several hours and has been isolated from air samples greater than 2 m from a COVID -19 patient.85-87 Although virus -laden aerosols can be transported beyond 2 m, there is limited data to suggest that infectious virus can be transported and remain viable in significant quantities over longer distances. Environmental sampling has detected viral RNA in healthcare settings in the air of hospital wards, isolation rooms, near the toilets of COVID -19 patients, at nurses stations, COVID -19 and Indoor Air 14 hospital entrances, and on air handling grates.87-93 However, detection of SARS -CoV-2 in the air is variable and usually in low concentration, even in locations such as COVID wards where concentr ations would be expected to be highest. A systematic review of air sampling for SARS -CoV-2 RNA by Borges et al.94 found that while many studies detected SARS -CoV-2 in air in high risk areas, including in isolation rooms of SARS -CoV-2 patients, many others did not. This may be due to variation in sampling techniques, but also hints that virus does not usually remain aloft long enough or in sufficient quantity to be detected.95-99 Studies by Wei et al.100 and Kim et al .100, 101 detected viral RNA on a many environmental surfaces (44 of 112 surfaces, and 89 of 320 surfaces respectively) in COVID patient rooms but all room air samples were negative , suggesting that suspended aerosols did not remain aloft for very long . The study by Wei et al. however did detect viral RNA in exhaust air of some rooms, indicating that ventilation may have assisted in clearing the room of suspended aerosols. In non -healthcare settings, SARS -CoV-2 RNA has been detected in ambient air at the entrance to a department store in China, and in public spaces including banks, shopping areas, government buildings and transportation hubs in Iran and a shopping mall and concert hall in Germany .89,102,103 However, i n a study measuring SARS -CoV-2 in the air and on surfaces of busses in Italy in the last week of lockdown and in the first week of reopening, no air or surface samples tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 RNA.104 The quantity of virus detected in the air is likely influenced by the source load of viral emissions, the duration over which an infected person is emitting, w hen the emission occurred relative to the timing of sampling, the nature of space into which aerosols are emitted (enclosed or open), the number of infected individuals in a space, and the presence of mitigating measures such as ventilation. Evidence for the occurrence of long -range transmission (beyond 2 m) comes from examples of clusters and outbreaks where the infected person ( index case ) and infectees ( secondary case(s) ) shared a common space but did not report having close contact (within 2 m) . Examples include fitness centres and classes,105-110 restaurants,111,112 public transport ,113 choirs and music rehearsals ,114-116 nightclubs,117-120 offices,121 and religious venues .122,123 In many of these examples multiple factors may have contribut ed to transmission such as a poor clearance of aerosols (e.g., enclosed and poorly ventil ated spaces), not wearing a mask, participating in activities that generate a higher proportion of aerosol (e.g., vigorous exercise, loud speech or singing), and spending a long duration in that space (e.g., > 15 min) . Previous study of infection risks of influenza and tuberculosis during physical exercise in gyms found that infection risks increased with higher occupancy and poor ventilation.124 In the example of restaurant s in China125 and Korea,112 secondary cases did not have any direct cont act with the index case , with the likely route of exposure via downwind transmission on air currents in the restaurant . In both of these cases, there were no windows or ventilation systems , but air conditioning was present, causing directional air flow from the infected person towards the secondary cases , who were present in the restaurant at the same time . Masks were also not worn by the index nor the secondary cases during eating , and in conversation with others. In the case of the Korean restaurant, two persons were infected, one at 6.5 m distance from the source and one at 4.8 m distance from the source, and genome sequencing confirmed that all cases were infected with an identical strain , confirming that exposure from a different source in the community was unlikely. For some of the outbreaks referred to earlier, full details of the ventilation conditions COVID -19 and Indoor Air 15 and the degree of interaction between affected persons is unknown, due to lack of reporting or recall bias. There are very few examples of clusters or outbreaks that have occurred over a much longer -range between different spaces in the same buildin g or via an unknown source in the community, emphasizing that aerosol transmission over longer distances or through HVAC systems is unlikely to be occurri ng. Long -range a erosol transmission may have been the cause or a contributing factor for infection in s ome cases where the index and the secondary cases were never in contact , but shared a common space at different times .110,126 There have also been some documented cases of transmission between persons who have not occupi ed the same space at any time, which have been linked to possible vertical natural ventilation shafts ,127 or plumbing stacks128 in high rise building s, and one case where it is difficult to determine how infection passed between occupants in adjacent rooms of a quarantine hotel .129 Some studies have reported the presence of SARS -CoV-2 RNA on ventilation grates, ducts or filters in health care settings and in a nursing home ou tbreak , however, there does not appear to be evidence of transmission via HVAC ducts recirculating air to other parts of building s.130,131 TRANSMISSION VIA CONTAMINATED SURFACES (FOMITES) Fomites can become contaminated by deposition of droplets, aerosols, sputum, or feces, either direc tly, or by cross -contamination by touching an object with contaminated hands. Surfaces that are frequently touched by many people (high -touch surfaces), such as door handles, or faucets may be more important in fomite transmission compared to objects or su rfaces that are only touched incidentally and less frequently. The risk of transmission through contact with fomites is not well understood and could depend on the initial concentration of viable virus deposited , its viability on a specific surface over ti me, and the quantity of virus transferred through touching of the eyes, mouth, or nose. Several studies have measured the persistence of SARS -CoV-2 on common surfaces under experimental conditions .86,132 -134 Variation in e nvironmental conditions such as temperature, ultraviolet radiation, and humidity can all affect viability.132,135 -137 The virus has been observed to remain viable for lo nger periods (one to seven days or more) on smooth hard surfaces such as stainless steel, hard plastic, glass, and ceramics , and for shorter periods (several hours to two days) on porous materials such as paper, cardboard, and textiles, although viability may be dependent on other factors such as temperature.86,132 -134,138 -142 Survival time on some metals such as copper, aluminum, and zinc is much lower (a few hours) , and copper coated surfac es have been investigated for use in infection control on high touch surfaces .86,134 Observational studies have detected viral RNA on a wide range of surfaces in settings where persons with COVID -19 have been present, such as hospitals or quarantine rooms.143 These studies indicate that high touch surfaces such as door handles, garbage cans, bed rails, taps and toilet seats can be contaminated with SARS -CoV-2 RNA .88,90,91,93,96,100,144,145 Viral RNA has also been detected on many untouched surfaces such as floors, walls, door frames, shelves, ceiling exhaust and window sills.91,146 - 148 These studies imply that virus -laden particles can be transported on air currents, in many cases more than 2 m from the source. There is also some evidence that there is less surface contamination in better ventilated spaces. Most of the studies reporting on detection of viral RNA on surfaces did COVID -19 and Indoor Air 16 not attempt to culture virus, so it is not known whether detection of RNA represent ed an infection risk in these studies . To date there have been few examples of COVID -19 infections where transmission via fomites has been implicated. These have included studies where the secondary cases did not have dir ect contact or occupy a common space with the index case but may have shared common spaces at a different time such as washrooms or elevators.126,149,150 In one study, the index patient blew his nose with his hand before touching an elevator button. After exiting the elevator, a secondary case entered and touched the same button, and subsequently flossed his teeth, suggesting the possibil ity of snot -oral transmission via the common surface of the elevator button.126 Another case involved users of a squash court in Sloven ia. Despite never having direct contact with the index cases, several players using the same change room and squash court as the index case subsequently became infected, suggesting persistence of infective aerosols, although fomite transmission from shared surfaces cannot be ruled out as another possible route of transmission.110 Another study identified several cases who became infected in a neighbourhood where sewage from a cracked pipe contaminated the streets following rainfall. Environmental testing detected SARS -CoV-2 in street sewage puddles, which local residents walked in , potentially contaminating their shoes. Touching of contaminated shoes, followed by contact with the nose or mouth was proposed as one possible transmission route.151 In each of the examples above, fomite transmission cannot be definitely ide ntified as the route of transmission, but it can also not be ruled out as a primary or contributory factor. Tracing fomite transmission, particularly in public spaces, where people who are unknown to each other and share many common surfaces is extremely d ifficult , but it does not appear that fomite transmission is a major route of transmission based on current evidence.152 It should also be noted that the application of mitigation measures can influence the dominant transmission pathways, and measure s to address potential fomite transmission have been widespread throughout the pandemic. The emph asis on handwashing, hand sanitizing and surface cleaning and disinfection throughout the pandemic may have reduced the potential for fomite transmission more widely. OTHER TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS Viable SARS -CoV-2 virus has been detected in bodily fluids other than respiratory particles, such as blood, feces, and urine of infected persons, but current evidence does not indicate that these contribute to major routes of transmission.32,43,153 For example, c onjunctival transmission through the eyes or tears and vertical transmission (f rom a mother to a fetus) may occur but are likely to be uncommon.27,32,154,155 Food -borne transmission and transmission via other bodily fluids including blood and urine are unlikely to be occurring based on current evidence .32,40,156 Transmi ssion via feces may be possible in some circumstances, but research is still limited on the relative contribution of fecal -oral (e.g., transmission of virus in fecal particles from one person to the mouth of another, or fecal contamination of food, usually by contaminate d hands) or fecal -aerosol transmission (e.g., transmission via inhalation of aerosolized fecal particles containing infectious virus) . SARS -CoV-2 is shed via feces and p atients with more severe COVID -19 have higher concentrations of SARS -CoV-2 in their sto ol.157,158 While s everal studies have reported on the presence of SARS -CoV-2 RNA in feces and in the toilets of SARS -CoV-2 patients , only a few have COVID -19 and Indoor Air 17 identified infectious virus.90,158 -162 Fecal aerosol transmission is implicated i n a COVID -19 cluster in a high -rise in Guangzhou, China and exposure to sewage is implicated in an outbreak in an urban community with poor sanitation services, also in Guangzhou, China, but neither investigation could be definitive that fecal -oral transmi ssion had occurred.128,151 Transmission through bathroom vents was also implied in a cluster of 10 cases in an apartment building in Seoul, South Korea, alt hough it is not possible to conclude whether transmission was associated with fecal aerosols or respiratory aerosols , or some other source unrelated to the vents .127 SUMMARY As of June 2021, with over one hundred and seventy million cases of COVID -19 now recorded around the world, there have been several patterns that have emerged to indicate how SARS -CoV-2 is transmitting. Evidence to date suggests that most transmission likely occurs as a result of close contact interactions (exposure respiratory emissions at short -range). The virus may be transmitted over a longer -range (> 2 m) opportunistically where there is a high source load of virus in the air.22 This can occur in settings where there is a high density of people or activities that lead to a greater generation of aerosols (e.g., exercise or vocalization) , over a long duration, and in poorly ventilated environments where there is poor clea rance of accumulated emissions , and absence of other mitigatin g measures such as mask -wearing .51,57,119 Transmission via fomites may be occurring, but there is limited evidence of this to date, with hygiene measures potentially contributing to keeping fomite transmission low. Other routes of transmission such as fecal -aerosol transmission may be occurring, although direct evidence of this is limited to date. Many experts have postulated on the signifi cance of airborne transmission, with out a discussion of the relative importance of short -range and long -range transmission pathways, whether via aerosols or droplets . For short -range transmission, exposure to both droplets and a higher concentration of aerosols increase the likelihood of an exposed person receiving an infectious dose of the virus. Long - range transmission (> 2 m) within the same room or space is has been shown to occur but is usually accompanied by other exacerbating factors such as a longer duration of exposure or absence of mitigating measures . Long -range aerosol transmission between spaces is very unlikely with only a few examples of where this may have played a role. Although such instances are highly visible in the media, we cannot use these rare instances to infer the role or predominance of these types of transmission in the pandemic overall. Ultimately, an individual's risk of becoming infected by SARS -CoV-2 depends on various factors operating at multiple scales: personal behavi ours and individual susceptibility , the favourability of local environments , and the overall prevalence of COVID -19 transmission in the community . Public indoor environments may be conducive to viral transmission due to both the nature of the space and how users interact within it (density of users, duration of interaction and nature of activities). Measures to protect against short -range transmission , namely physical distancing and mask - wearing, have led to a reduction in cases ; however , these mitigation measures may also contribute to reduced transmission via other routes as well .76,77,163 It is difficult to exclude contributions of more than one route for some trans mission events. For this reason , the public health approach to reduc ing COVID -19 transmission relies upon comprehensive, layered mitigation strategies that target COVID -19 and Indoor Air 18 multiple transmission routes . In BC, t his approach has been broadly successful at limiting transmission to levels within the capability of our healthcare system to manage . COVID -19 and Indoor Air 19 RESEARCH QUESTION 2: HOW DOES THE EMERGENCE OF NEW VARIANTS INFLUENCE THE RISK OF TRANSMISSION INDOORS? OVERVIEW OF VARIANTS OF CONCERN Thousands of mutations in the SARS -CoV-2 genome have emerged over the course of the pandemic, with the dominant variants shift ing over time. Not all mutations have proliferated, and many lineages will die out, but t he increasing frequency of some variants across the po pulation infers there is a selective advantage such as increased transmissibility or virulence.164-167 Transmissibility refers to the ease with which the virus can infect new host, whereas virulence refers to the severity of the infection. Some variants may emerge as \"variant s of concern \" (VOC) due to rapid spread within a population , an increase in the sev erity of illness, hospitalizations or deaths , or evidence that the variant is evading detection, treatment or natural or vaccine -induced immunity . At the time of writing, four variants are classified as VOC in Canada , which all emerged in the latter half o f 2020 , and are being closely monitored by public health officials around the world .168 A new naming convention for VOC was established by the World Health Organization in May 2021.169 The VOC currently circulating in Canada are : Alpha (also known as the B.1.1.7, UK, Kent or English var iant or 501Y.V1) : First detected in England in September 2020. At the time of writing, Alpha had been detected in 137 countries.170 As of May 30, 2021, a total of 192,469 cases had been detected in Canada and 8,015 in BC, with Alpha the dominant VOC in BC .171,172 Beta (also known as the B.1.351, South African variant or 501Y.V2) : First detected in South Africa in September 2020. At the time of writing, Beta had been detected in 92 countries.173 As of May 30 , 2021, 1,670 cases had been detected in Canada and about 130 in BC, where there is currently a very low prevalence of this variant .171,172 Gamma (also known as the P.1, Brazilian variant, or 501Y.V3) : First detec ted in Brazil in December 2020. At the time of writing, Gamma had been detected in 51 countries.174 As of May 30 , 2021, 11,799 cases had been detected in Canada and about 5761 cases in BC where it is the second most prevalent variant after Alpha .171,172 Delta (also known as the B.1.617.2, or Indian variant): First detected in India in December 2020 , and early 2021 among international cases with recent travel to India. This variant was declared a V OC by the WHO on May 12, 2021. At the time of writing, Delta had been detected in 50 countries , and 541 cases have been detected in BC, making it the third most prevalent VOC , but based on tra nsmission patterns observed elsewhere Delta is likely to become more prevalent .172,175 VOC no w make up a greater proportion of new COVID -19 cases in BC (e.g., >80%) compared to non - VOC strains.172 Research is ongoing to understand the impact of these VOC on efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. Much of this emerging research is still awaiting peer review, but initial results are providing insights in to possible differences in transmissibility, severity of disease, immune response, and whether new or amended public health measures may be required. More is currently known about the Alpha variant than other VOC due to more cases now detected by genomic sequencing compared to the other variants . Current evidence does not indicate that the routes of COVID -19 and Indoor Air 20 transmission have changed, however, increased transmissibility implies that risks from all routes of transm ission may be heightened for VOC . EFFECT OF THE VARIANTS ON TRANSMISSIBILITY The rapid spread of the Alpha variant in the United Kingdom was first observed in the autumn of 2020 leading to widespread global concern about travel -related introductions and su bsequent implementation of increased lockdown measures and travel restrictions including increased testing and quarantine mea sures .176 It was soon identified in other European countries and evidence of increased transmissibility began to emerge in the form of increasing case numbers, and an increased prevalence of the VOC among new cases .177-179 Early data from England estimated Alpha to be about 70-75% more transmissible .179,180 Analysis by Zhao e t al.181 to the end of December 2020 estimat ed Alpha was 52% more transmissible. A nationwide survey in France between December 2020 and January 2021 calculated that the Alpha variant as approximately 59% more transmissible based on increased prevalence compared to previously circulating variants .182 Later studies estimated th at this may be higher , with estimates of a replicative advantage of Alpha over the previous dominant variant in England to be 83-118% and in Wales, Scotland, Denmark and the USA to be 65 -72%.183 Fewer published studies have reported on the increased transmissibility of Beta, Gamma and Delta , but all appea r to be more transmissible compared to previously circulating lineages . One study estimated Beta to be 50% more transmissible than other variants circulating in South Africa .184 Faria et al.185 estimated Gamma to be between 1.7- to 2.4 -times more transmissible compared to previously circulating variants in Brazil . Observation of the rapid spread of the Delta variant in countries where it is most prevalent at the time of writing (e.g., India and the UK) suggest that it is at least as transmissible as the Alpha variant , but possibly more transmissible .186,187 The reasons for increased transmissibility are currently being studied to determine which, if any control measures can be adapted to reduce the spread . Possible reasons for increased transmissi bility of a variant could include mechanisms that allow for more efficient infection of cells (thereby decreasing the dose ne eded to cause infection) , an increase in the viral load of the infected person resulting in larger exposure doses released during t he infectious period, or a longer duration of infectiousness meaning increased opportunity to cause infection . For some variants , increased transmissibility is likely related to a mutation (e.g., N501Y) that allow s the virus to bind more easily to the ACE -2 receptors of a target cell.180,188,189 Studies have fou nd that the Alpha variant has between three and ten times greater affinity for the ACE -2 receptor compared to previous lineages.190,191 Other mutations in the spike protein (e.g. , K417T, E484K) that are associated with increased binding to the ACE -2 receptor are also present in the Beta and Gamma variants.185,188 Vogel et al.192 found that Gamma displayed about twice as high affinity compared to previously circulating lineages. The Delta variant has been found to have other mutations that are associated with increased transmissibility (e.g., L453R, D614G).186 Evidence is beginning to emerge on the effect of the variants on the viral load of infected persons, which could influence the concentratio n of virus emitted during the symptomatic phase. The cycle threshold value (Ct) recorded during COVID -19 testing can be an indicator of how much virus is present, with a low Ct value associated with a higher viral load. In a comparison of nasopharyngeal swabs taken from COVID -19 patients with and without infection with Alpha , statistically significantly COVID -19 and Indoor Air 21 lower Ct values were found with the Alpha lineage compared to non -VOC cases.193 Virus was also found to persist for longer in Alpha cases compared to non-VOC cases . Other studies have also reported lower Ct counts in Alpha cases compared to non-VOC cases, indicating higher viral loads for those infected with the VOC.194,195 In another study (pre -print), a small but significant association between infection with the Gamm a variant and lower Ct values was reported.185 There is also some indication that the VOC may lead to a longer duration of disease. Kissler et al.196 reported a longer mean duration of infection of 13.3 days for Alpha cases compared to 8.2 days for non -Alpha cases. EFFECT OF THE VARIANTS ON VIRULENCE There is some evidence that VOC may be more virulen t, resulting in more sever e disease or an incre ased risk of dying .177 A pre -print by Grint et al.197 reports an approximate 67% increased hazard of death by 28 days following a COVID -19 positive test associated with the Alpha variant, which was consistent across all demographic subgroups. A large match ed cohort study from the UK with 109,812 participants identified that the risk of dying from Alpha infection was about 64% higher compared with previous lineages.198 A pre -print by Davies et al.195 has also reported an increased risk of death for the Alpha variant compared with previous lineages in the UK between November 1st 2020 and February 14th 2021 , but did not identify the mechanisms o f increased mortality. There is some suggestion that higher viral loads, as indicated by high Ct values, may contribute to changes in disease severity, including increased mortality , but further research is needed. An animal study (pre - print) found evidenc e of very efficient infection in the lower respiratory tract for hamsters exposed to Alpha and Beta . These hamsters also displayed increased levels of cytokines , which could promote inflammation, although differences in pathogenicity compared to previous l ineages were not observed.199 A pre -print from Brazil comparing risk of death from COVID -19 infection in Nov -Dec 2020 to Feb 2021 found an increase in the case fatality rate across all age groups, with a higher proportional increase of death among younger people (20 -59 years old ) and those without pre - existing conditions than in the earlier wave.200 Apart from those under 20 years old , there was also an increase in the proportion of severe cases. The implications are that infections with Gamma have an increased risk of severe disease and death compared to previous strains. Early indications suggest that Delta may result in more severe disease, with an increased risk of hospitalization reported for cases infected with the Delta variant in the UK.187,201 More research is needed for all VOC to understa nd how the y impact virulence, particularly for Beta , Gamma and Delta variants .187,201 EFFECTS OF THE VARIANTS ON IMMUNITY One of the main concerns with any new variant is potential for evasion of natura l or vaccine induced immunity. More community spread of the virus provides opportunities for further evolutionary adaptations for evading immunity, underscoring the importance of reducing community spread as much as possible. Research is ongoing to identi fy if, and how, variants may be evading immunity by studying the immune response in cells infected with the new strains , and the response in blood sera from persons with previous COVID -19 infection or persons who have been vaccinated using the currently av ailable COVID -19 vaccines. For the Alpha variant, the immune response does not appear to be significantly impaired as demonstrated in tests with blood sera from patients with previous COVID -19 infection .202 Laboratory studies by Brown et al.203 did not find an escape from immunity for Alpha or signs of increased risk of reinfection. Sera from persons vaccinated with the Pfizer -COVID -19 and Indoor Air 22 BioNTech vaccine was observed to effectively block the binding of the virus to the ACE-2 receptor, with only slightly decreased effectiveness for Alpha compared to the previous lineages.191 In comparison, tests of blood sera from persons with prior COVID -19 infection showed a reduced neutralization of Beta compared to earlier strains, with one study report ing about a 13 -fold decrease in neutralization , and inferring a potential risk of reinfection .188,202 Wibmer et al.204 also found an increased resistance to neutralizing antibodies for the Beta lineage compar ed to previous strains , suggesting potential for reinfection. One reason for th e difference between Alpha and Beta may be the E484 K mutation that affects binding and neutralization. This mutation is present in the Beta and Gamma lineages, but not in the Alpha lineage , and could be responsible for significantly decreased neutralizing activity.202,205 Evidence of significant levels of reinfection in Manaus, Brazil where a high proportion of the population (76%) showed signs of prior infection, is thought to be associated with the Gamma variant evading the natural immunity that might have been conferred from prior infection. Initial study of the effectiveness of vaccines against symptomatic disease found a reduced effectiveness for dose 1 for the Delta (33.5%) compared to the Alpha variant (51.1%) for both the Oxford AstraZeneca and Pfizer -BioNTech vaccines , but similar levels of protection against both VOC were achieved after the second dose .187,206 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NON -PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS (NPI) IN INDOOR SPACES Research is ongoing to understand how the evolution of the SARS -CoV-2 virus affects the spread of the virus and implications for the current measures to mitigate spread. For those involved in designing or implementing public health measures, changes in how the virus transmits and changes to its virulence could influence th e measures adopted or adapted. Evidence to date indicates that the VOC are more transmissible, can lead to more severe outcomes and Beta and Gamma may evade immunity. Transmissibility is likely affected by more efficient binding to ACE -2 receptors and pote ntially by increased viral loads, and longer persistence of viral shedding. This means that an exposure to a lower initial dose or exposure over a shorter duration compared to previously circulating variants could result in infection. While the variants ap pear more transmissible, to date there does not appear to be a change in the mechanisms of viral shedding or behaviour of infectious bioaerosols or the way they transmit. This suggests that current measures to reduce transmission should continue to be appl ied, but with greater consistency, closing gaps in mitigation measures where there is low adherence or slack implementation. To date, new measures related to reducing the spread of variants have been associated with reducing community spread and travel -related introductions of the virus, focuss ing on testing, quarantine, isolation , and contact tracing. Additional public health recommendations and revised orders have been focused on limiting direct person -to-person contacts as much as possible. This has resulted in a reintroduction or strengthening of lockdown measures in affected regions or countries by re-closure of schools, entertainment venues, recreational facilities, and limits on attendees or occupancy for certain activities or venues, public curfews to restrict population mobility, and encouraging work ing from home. Additional travel restrictions and quaranti ne requirements for returning travellers have sought to limit the new introductions from outside of regions or countries.207 COVID -19 and Indoor Air 23 There have been few additional changes in recommended non -pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce community spread of variants, beyond a re -emphasis of p ersonal protective b ehaviour s such as physical distancing and mask -wearing. There has been no published evidence of how a change in existing mitigation measures (e.g., such as an increase in physical distancing) would reduce spread of VOC compared to the previous lineages . Most agenc ies emphasize maintaining current approaches and working to strengthen adherence among the public. On an organization al level, encoura ging a l ayered approach to reduce transmission continues to be recommended . Individual \"layers\" include use of masks, reinforcing distancing, keeping group sizes small, continuing to encourage hand hygiene, enhancing ventilation indoors, reduc ing unnecessary travel, inc reas ing vaccination, and manag ing public expectations of reopening.177,207 -209 A review of jurisdictional guidance for masking in 14 regions reported that most had not changed their guidan ce in response to variants. Austria, Germany and France were the only regions to change recommendations for wearing of public face coverings , upgrading their recommendation from a non -medical face covering to a medical mask or equivalen t based on improved filter efficiency and fit.210 Recent literature is reporting on the benefits of double masking or mask modifications to improve mask fit.211 Recommendations for physical distancing have remained unchanged to date , as ha ve the use of partitions in retail spaces and recommendations for improved ventilation. For a deeper discussion on implementing a layered approach, whether through the h ierarchy of controls or another model, please see Section 4 of this document. Despite the lack of recommended changes to existing, or implementation of new measures to reduce the spread of variants, organizations may consider a re -evaluation of transmissio n potential in high -risk and high -capacity settings. Refreshing risk assessments based on the characteristics of the space (e.g., size, level of ventilation), the type of occupants (e.g., number and risk level of occupants) and the types of activities that take place in the space (e.g., level of emissions generated, duration of occupancy throughout the day) is warranted . This process can be used to identify weaknesses in existing mitigation plans, and opportunities for enhancing measures, as well as providing an opportunity to revisit messaging that reemphasizes the importance of various measures in the context of the VOC. Further VOC are likely to emerge in the future , but reducing community spread and ensuring good adherence to current publ ic health recommendations will reduce the chance of these taking hold .212 Well designed and fully implemented mitigation plans will help reduce spread of the virus i n the community and reduce the opportunities for viral replication and evolution of new mutations that lead to VOC. These measures will be required in combination with vaccine roll -out, improved surveillance and genomic testing.212 COVID -19 and Indoor Air 24 RESEARCH QUESTION 3: WHAT ARE THE KEY FACTORS THAT EXACERBATE THE RISK OF TRANSMISSION INDOORS? A review of reports of outbreaks, clusters and epidemiological investigations provides additional evidence of the characteristics of indoor spaces and activities most often associated with viral transmission (Appendix 2 ). In this section, we combine a review of previous outbreaks with additional evidence from public health and exposure science to understand what factors most influence the risk of transmission in shared indoor spaces. Early in the pandemic, factors that were found to be common among many large COVID -19 outbreaks, prior to significant uptake of population wide mitigation measures, were commonly referred to as the 3 Cs - crowded places, close contacts, and confined/enclosed spaces).50,119 Additional factors were later identified t o be important in transmission including continuous exposure , absence of control measures such as masking , activities such as singing or exercise , communi ty-specific factors such as level of community spread and individual factors such as contagiousness (super -spreaders) , or susceptibility to infection .213 OCCUPA NCY AND CROWDING Crowding reduces the ability for individuals to maintain distance from each other. Crowding increase s exposure to concentrated burst s of respiratory emissions due to close proximity contact, as well as exposure to smaller respiratory particles that remain suspended and move around on air currents and can accumulate in an enclosed space over time.8,82,214,215 Defining what is \"crowded\" can be difficult without also understanding how respiratory particles move within a room. Each occupant in a room is the source of a 'thermal plume' that affects airflow around their bodies, as well as the movement of their own respiratory particles.216 This means that although respiratory particles are most dense around the source, air warmed by the occupant's own body heat can entrain those particles, lift them, and \"cast\" them upward into the room, even after they have been directed downward (e.g., coughing toward the ground). As the air cools and sinks, respiratory particles likewise sink and may contact other occupants. Similarly, particles from seated occupants can been lifted up into the breathing zone of those standing nearby. Crowding increases the likelihood that one o r more people will be within this \"hot zone\" of an infected individual , increasing the risk that they will inhale enough virus -laden particles to establish an infectious dose . Having more people in the space also increases the probability that one or more infectious people will be present, especially where there is a high level o f community spread. All of these factors underscore the importance of minimizing occupancy whe never possible. Physical distancing is key to establishing occupancy limits. Globally, nations have established physical distancing requirements of roughly 1 or 2 m, based on assumptions regarding the ballistic range of larger droplets. Distancing also reduces the risk of transmission due to smaller particles, which are diluted as one moves farther from the source. Although the underpinnings of the 2 m rule have been sharply criticised,217 physical distan cing should not be viewed as a way to eliminate risk, but rather to limit the greatest part of that risk, being exposure to the hot zone. Physical distancing is also practiced in combination with other interventions like masking and the use of physical bar riers. A previous systematic review and meta -analysis found that combined use of physical distancing and COVID -19 and Indoor Air 25 masking reduced the risk of transmission by 80%, based on data from SARS, MERS, and SARS -CoV-2, and 2 m was better than 1 m.76 Very recently, the US CDC reduced its physical distancing requirement from 6 feet to 3 feet for young school children, based partly on data that found no significant difference in transmission rates among school districts using dif ferent minimum distances ; however, it should be noted that this may not be appropriate for settings involving adults , and in all the school districts studied, mask requirements were in place but observance of these requirements was not confirmed on the gro und.218 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPACE Small and enclosed spaces where there is no clearance of accumulated air or where there are directional air flows within a space can increase the risk of exposure when an infectious person is present. In addition to occupancy or crowding, certain characteristics of the indoor space could affect the likelihood of high -risk exposures. Some of these include: Presence or absence of ventilation and operation at appropriate rates ( discussed in the next section). The use of stand -alon e \"comfort\" devices that do not bring in additional air but may create strongly directional air flows (e.g., fans and air conditioners). Presence or absence of open able windows for supplementary dilution ventilation. Presence of large structures, barriers, or furniture that may affect air flow or mixing in unexpected ways , or cause occupants to be concentrated in certain areas . CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OCCUPANTS In addition to occupant behaviour and overall compliance with public health recommendations, the intrinsic characteristics of those occupying the room also affects the likelihood of transmission : Intrinsic characteristics of those infected. The stage of the illness and the severity of infection can influence the nature of the respiratory emissions rele ased and the concentration (or viral load) of infectious virus in these emission s. Cases with a lower Ct (<28) were associated with a signific antly higher transmission risk , implying that a low Ct value equates to a higher viral load .219 A high -risk activity (e.g., singing) , which releases a high concentration of droplets and aerosols, carried out by an individual with high viral loads further am plifies the risk to people sharing the space . Some people may also be naturally more likely to shed virus compared to others (so called super -emitters).7 Intrinsic characteristics of the po tential hosts . High risk groups may be more susceptible to infection, with age being one of the most important determinants of risk. Immunocompromised persons and those with underlying health conditions are also at greater risk of developing severe illness from SARS -CoV-2 infection. Immunocompromised persons may have a prolonged course of infection, which may also favour mutation of the virus.220 COVID -19 and Indoor Air 26 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INTERACT ION AND ACTIVITIES THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE SPACE The most important factors in transmission are proximity to and duration spent in contact with an infected person. Research has shown consistently that the duration of contact is a primary factor in whether transmission occurs.221 Wu et al.72 found that physical contact, shared living space, or shared vehicle with an index case were significant risk factors for secondary infection. Duration is an important factor in both short - and long -range transmission. The longer people spend in a crowded environment, the greater the accumulation of emitted air where it is not cleared with ventilation, resulting in an increased source load of emissions released over time. For example one minute of loud speaking by an infected individual could produce up to 1000 virion containing particles.81 Person -to-person interactions su ch as greetings and social interactions, sharing of food, drinks or equipment, and shared transport can increase opportunities for all main tran smission routes due to increased shared air and surfaces. The outbreaks reviewed in Appendix 2 highlight a number of higher risk activities, including loud talking/shouting, singing, and high -intensity exercise. These activities result in the emission of l arge quantities of respiratory emissions , which exacerbates transmission risk by increasing the concentration of virus -laden particles present and decreasing the time required to acquire an infectious dose. Intense vocalization and vigorous activity also i ncreases the volume of air inhaled by a susceptible host sharing the same airspace.124 ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS Research is ongoing to understand how environmental conditions affect the persistence of SARS - CoV-2. Research has focused on the effects of temperature , humidity, ultraviolet light, and combinations of different conditions. Temperature . There is now ample evidence to indicate that high temperatures are more effective for deactivating the SARS -CoV-2 vir us, and the virus is more persistent at colder temperatures . Studies have found that virus can remain viable for several days to weeks at 4\u00b0C, but stability decreases with increasing temperature, with survival being as little as 30 minutes at 56 \u00b0C.132,139,222 -224 Humidity . The effects on humidity are more complex, as humidity may influence how droplets move and their rate of decay and can influence susceptibility of individuals to infection.225 Humid conditions can reduce evaporation of liquid contained in respiratory droplets, reducing aeros olization and allowing droplets to fall to the ground or settle on surfa ces more readily. In contrast, warm dry environments could enhance evaporation of droplets, resulting in a greater number of aerosols being dispersed.226 The potential to remain infectious for longer under cool, dry conditions has been demonstrated to other coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 in aerosols and on surfaces.222,225,227,228 Humidity can also affect the susceptibility of respiratory systems to viral infection, with dry conditions reducing the effectiveness of the mucosal lining of the respiratory tract to prevent infection.225 COVID -19 and Indoor Air 27 Light. Ultraviolet (UV) light has been shown to reduce viral loads for respiratory viruses, including SARS -CoV-1 in clinica l and other controlled settings .229,230 Germicidal effects can occur between 200 -320 nm, which covers the range of UV produced by natural sunlight (UV-B, 280 -320 nm) and UV produced by lamps for specific applications (UV -C, below 280 nm).231-235 Various configurations of UV lamps (e.g., wall mounted, ceiling mounted, portable units) are currently used in different commercial and clinical settings for disinfection in indoor spaces. UV disinfection is not instantaneous and can vary by intensity and duration of exposure to UV. SUMMARY Spaces characterized by crowding , proximity of interactions (e.g., within 2 m including verbal interactions, sharing meals), enclosed spaces with limited ventilation , long duration of contact (e.g., > 15 minutes) , activities that require hea vy breathing (e.g., exercise, singing, cheering) and locations with absent or poorly implemented controls have featured in COVID -19 clusters and outbreaks .56,80,124,236 These exacerbating factors increase the potential for short -range exposure to droplets, concentrated bursts of aerosols , and potential fomite transmission via shared surfaces. Several of these factors may collec tively increase the opportunity for infectious aerosols to accumulate in sufficient quantity, over a sufficient duration, and increase the risk of exposure of a susceptible host to an infectious dose of virus. Thus, these exacerbating factors increase the risk of transmission via multiple routes simultaneously, and measures to prevent transmission must likewise be multi -layered and consistently applied. The next section presents some of the approaches to mitigating transmission risks indoors. COVID -19 and Indoor Air 28 RESEARCH Q UESTION 4: WHAT STRATEGIES ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR MITIGATING RISK, AND HOW CAN WE ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF VARIOUS MEASURES? The objective of risk mitigation measures recommended by public health is to reduce community level impacts by slowing infection rate s, reducing overall case numbers, and reducing pressure on public services such as hospitals, to allow time for vaccines to be distributed. Risk mitigation must also be equitable, ensuring that health outcomes are not the result of an inability to engage i n risk mitigation. Risk mitigation measure should also be applied in a layered approach. HIERARCHY OF CONTROLS The field of o ccupational health and hygiene has long relied on the Hierarchy of Controls (Figure 1) to guide the selection of control measures. The principle is that measures higher up on the hierarchy are more effective in reducing the risk for a greater number of peo ple, and that measures further down the hierarchy (some at the individual level) should be implemented as needed to mitigate any remaining risk. Figure 1 Applying the hierarchy of controls for reducing risks of transmission of COVID -19 in indoor spaces . Applying the hierarchy during a pandemic has been somewhat challenging because, in an emergency, it may be necessary to activ ate multiple levels at once (or in reverse order) rather than proceeding in a stepwise fashion. For example, although PPE is at the \"bottom\" of the hierarchy, implementing a mask mandate is much faster and less costly than some engineering controls, like reconfiguring a workspace or installing new air cleaning technology . The hierarchy of controls may also have health equity implications, as not all facilities or organizations will have the same capabilities or financial resources to implement health -protecting measures. Thus, it may be Elimination and Substitution Closures or halting activities to eliminate or reduce person -to-person interactions. Physical distancing measures, including reducing maximum occupancy. Moving activities to larger spaces or outside. Limiting or replacing activities that require contact with others (e.g., online or contactless options). Engineering Controls Changes to structure/layout to facilitate physical distancing (e.g., use of barriers). Use of passive or mechanical ventilation (e.g., opening windows or increasing quantity of outdoor air in HVAC). Reduce/remove high -touch surfaces (e .g., automatic doors, lighting). Provisio n of facilities for hand washing and/or hand hygiene stations. Administrative Controls Require persons with COVID -19 symptoms or known exposures to stay home. Recording contact details of visitors for future contact tracing. Use of signage and physical or visual cues to encourage distancing, hand hygiene etc. Ensuring adequate cleaning and disinfection practices and availability of supplies. New working practices, staggering start/end times, removal of communal items. PPE The use of masks when distancing cannot be maintained, or in higher risk settings at all when community spread is high. Can be protective of self and others. Encouraging good mask hygiene (e.g., appropriate donning or dof fing and disposal). COVID -19 and Indoor Air 29 necessary to target funding or policy action to specific occupants, types of work, buildings, or zones of buildings to ensure that some people are not experiencing increased risk due to the inability to apply the fastest or most effective measures. However, as we shift from a medium -term emergency to a long -term reality in which respiratory disease plays a greater role in plannin g indoor spaces, the hierarchy remains a useful conceptual tool to guide new investments and policy development . Acknowledging health equity objectives - ensuring that disease transmission does not disproportionately impact specific occupants or parts of the workforce - will remain a key feature of long -term planning. ELIMINATION Elimination refers to actions that will fully remove the potential for SARS -CoV-2 exposure. In the context of the COVID -19 pandemic , this means isolat ing those infected from others , whether that be within the home itself or by preventing those infected from attending work or school until the illness resolves. Persons known to have been exposed or those recently returning from travel have also been asked to quarantine for a fixed per iod of time (e.g., 14 days). This approach has been very effective in preventing community spread in some countries. There are many reasons why isolation of the sick and quarantine of those at risk of infection has not been completely effective in reducing spread elsewhere . Compliance with public health advice is not always universal for many reasons , which may be financial (e.g., no access to sick pay) , lack of ability to work from home, lack of awareness or requirements , lack of enforcement , or lack of pe rceived risk from non-compliance . Another significant challenge in elimination of risks is the potential for persons to be infectious prior to experiencing symptoms, and some people remaining asymptomatic throughout their infection.30,31,36 Due to the potential for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmissio n, the only way to completely eliminate the risk of infection, where there is community spread of the virus, is to eliminate meeting in the office (move to 100% remote work ). At present, vaccination of all occupants may not completely eliminate the risk but can reduce the likelihood of transmission and severity of disease for currently circulating strains of the virus . Some variants of concern (VOC) have shown ability to evade vaccine -induced immunity to some degree, although receiving both doses as recomme nded improves vaccine effectiveness (see Section 2 ). Continued surveillance is needed to monitor the emergence of new VOC and the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent infection or symptomatic disease (further discussion of vaccination is beyond the scope o f this document) .237 ENGINEERING CONTROLS Engineering controls refer to efforts to re -design or modify the physical environment to reduce transmission risk. Re-design ing the occupied space may include removing workstations to accommodate distancing requirements or re-configuri ng workstations such that occupants no longer face each other. Other means may be to designate unidirect ional flow of traffic in halls and stairways. All of these activities allow occupants to move about with an expanded personal bubble , allowing them to m inimize the proximity and duration of contacts. Physical barriers and ventilation have been the focus of most engineering controls throughout the COVID -19 pandemic. COVID -19 and Indoor Air 30 PHYSICAL BARRIERS Physical barriers prevent larger respiratory particles from immediately invading another person's breathing zone , which is defined by a radius roughly 30 cm around a person's nose.238 However, barriers are believe d to be less effective against smaller droplets, which can loft over the barrier. Abuhegazy et al.19 model led air flows in a typical classroom and found that glass barriers reduced the total amount of small particles (1 \u00b5m) deposited on students by about 63%, although the presence of barriers slowed clearance of the remaining airborne particles via ventilation. These results highlight the need to use physical barriers judiciously. They can be used beneficially to isolate a worker who would otherwise be exposed to many different people in a single day (e.g., a triage nurse in enclosed kiosk), but in other contexts the interruption of air flow may cause more harm than good. For example, positioning plexiglass barriers in an open -air patio hinders the otherwise almost immediate dilution of particles. VENTILATION There is no evidence to show definitively that ventilation decreases the number of SARS -CoV-2 infections . However, there are a number of documented instances in which aerosol transmission appears to have occurred in under -ventilated spaces or in the presence of strongly directional air flow (e.g., an A C unit blow ing from one person to another) (Appendix 2 ). It is reasonable to assume that increas ing the exchange of stale indoor air for fresh outdoor air will decrease the concentration of respiratory particles that have not already settled to the floor, and ventilation has generally been shown to reduce respiratory infections for other opportuni stic airborne diseases like influenza (next sub-section). For these reasons, the following low -cost ventilation improvements have been widely recommended (for deta iled resources see ASHRAE239 and WHO ,240 as well as the compendium of IAQ resources in Append ix 3). Facilities should endeavour to address as many of these as practical : Running HVAC systems on 100% outdoor air (or as near to as possible) . Disabling demand -controlled ventilation , so that a high ventilation rate is maintained despite changes in occupancy . Running HVAC fans constantly , including at low levels during periods of low occupancy . Installing MERV 13 filters whenever possible, accounting for the resulting pressure drop and potential underventilation. It should be noted that although the SARS -CoV-2 RNA has been found in ductwork and HVAC filters,130,241 there has been no tran smission associated with these findings. There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 can transmit through ductwork to affect other areas of the building. Therefore, installing higher MERV filters (and potentially causing underventilation of specific rooms due to the pressure drop) is questionable in terms of public health benefit, and the need to verify ventilation adequacy locally (throughout the building) should be emphasized . Opening windows is a simple solution to immediately improve air quality and has been a key public health recommendations since the beginning of the pandemic.242 Bluyssen et al.243 found that establishing cross ventilation by opening doors and windows in an office environment (2 5 m2) out -performed the existing mixing ventilation system; however, opening only windows or only the door (natural ventilation) appeared to redistribute the COVID -19 and Indoor Air 31 particles in the room and did not provide better air quality than the existing ventilation system.19,243 Ensure that exhaust fan s (especially in bathrooms) are running constantly , due to the potential for toilet flushing to create aerosols from human waste that may contain the SARS - CoV-2 virus. Although SARS -CoV-2 has often been found in hospital toilets used by patients,90 and transmission due to aerosolization of feces may have occurred in rare instances,127,128 public washrooms have not revealed themselves to be major source s of outbreaks during the pandemic. In addition to the above widely recommended measures, CO 2 monitoring has been proposed as rapid means for building managers to continually assess and address ventilation adequacy in shared spaces. This technique relies on low -cost sen sors to monitor the time -weighted average of CO 2 levels within a space. As the length of occupancy and the number of occupants increases, CO 2 levels within the space will increase relative to outdoor ambient levels (e.g., 400 -450 ppm) if fresh air exchange is insufficient for that use. CO 2 monitor ing allow s occupants to take action, such as opening a window or reducing occupancy, when CO 2 level surpass some agreed upon action limit. However, there are a number of concerns with using CO 2 monitors as a COVID -19 risk mitigation tool, which are discussed more thoroughly in a recent NCCEH document.244 AIR CLEANERS AND PURIFIERS Air cleaners (e.g., HEPA filters) and air purifiers (e.g., UVGI systems) have also been proposed as an alternati ve to ventilation in spaces that have no existing ventilation, or ventilation upgrades are difficult. These devices may provide some benefits but also have limitations.245 One common consideration that is often overlooked is the sizing of the device for the space it is intended to treat, based on the clean air delivery rate (CADR) stated on the device. End -users may underestimate the number or size of devices required to provide the level of treatment equivalent to conventional ventilation systems. HEPA -equipped portable air cleaners are widely recommended as a supplement for enclosed spaces due to their abilit y to remove airborne particles from the air flowing through them . Although it is logical that actively filtering the air is better than occup ying a space with no ventilation and no filtering, the use of portable air cleaners is not fool proof either. Bluys sen et al.243 found that a portable air cleaner operating at a flow rate of 1200 m3/h performed better than the existing mixing ventilation system for a 25 m2 office space with 6 workstations. However, it s effectiveness varied depending on it s position in the room, it caused drafts in some locations (causing discomfort and also potentially increase transmission risk) and most of the occupants expressed dissatisfaction with the noise produced. These results highlight the difficulty of relying on portable air cleaners without substantial verification of the set-up, although such devices are almost certainly better than occupying an unventilated space . Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) devices based on wavelengths in the UV -C range have been used in hospitals and clinical environments for many years. There are various configurations depending on the placement of the devices (e.g., in duct, upper room, portable units etc.).246 The literature on the effect of UV -C on coronaviruses finds that it can COVID -19 and Indoor Air 32 be effective against envelo ped, single -stranded RNA viruses (e.g., SARS, MERS),231,233,234,247 and m ore recent study indicates that UV -C can inactivate SARS -CoV-2.235,248 -250 The germicidal effects however depend on the duration and intensity of exposure and f actors such as shadowing, obstructions, dust on the lamps, and dirt on surfaces , which can shield microorganisms from UV -C.231,247,251 UVGI devices can only inactivate pathogens that pass in proximity to the lamps, so configuration and placement of any device is key as to whether or not it can contribute to reducing transmission indoors. Ther e are also significant risks of damage to human skin and eyes from direct and prolonged exposure to UV -C irradiation, so devices must be contained or shielded to prevent harm . Some devices may produce ozone, so users should be aware of these added hazards. Although these devices show promise, at present, we are unaware of any UVGI -based air disinfection device that has been approved for use by Health Canada for reduction of COVID -19 transmission. New technologies that incorporate less harmful wavelengths su ch as far -UVC, may have fewer limitations for shielding, and may show future potential for use in public spaces if the absence of harms can be proven. Other air cleaning technologies on the market claim to be effective against COVID -19 by physically remov ing particles from the air (e.g., electrostatic precipitators, ion generators) or inactivating airborne pathogens (e.g., plasma generators, and ozone generators). Like HEPA filters, portable devices are limited by the quantity of air they can treat, and t heir effectiveness depends on their placement in a room (e.g., free from obstruction, near the source of emissions , etc.). Caution is also required to ensure no additional hazards are introduced into a space. Some devices can generate ozone, a respiratory irritant, and should not be used indoors.245 Ozone generators in particular are not recommended for occupi ed spaces due to the respiratory hazards posed. Although some of these devices may be effective in reducing some air pollutants, we are unaware of any published evidence to demonstrate a reduction in COVID -19 transmission. In general , consumers should be w ary of new technologies making claims regarding disinfection and/or reducing COVID -19 transmission ; some of the products making false or misleading claims have been posted on Health Canada's website .252 ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS - HOW TO SHARE SPACES SAFELY Administrative controls include changes to how people interact in a space to minimize opportunities for close contact and to reduce interactions with shared spaces, items, or surfaces. Having a COVID - 19 safety plan is part of the package of administrative controls workplaces have had to adopt. Administrative controls include reducing occupancy by shifting to remote work or stagger ing workdays or hours and reducing contact among employees by establishing cohort s, closing unventilated spaces , and having unavo idable group activities outdoors or in larger spaces .253 This includes an emphasis on observing COVID -19 protocols in break rooms and when socializin g or commuting with other co -workers. In instances where occupants ha ve to share an unventilated space or perform aerosol -generating activities (e.g., a dental office), procedures such as airing -out or fallow times have been used. These have been generally successful in avoiding workplace outbreaks. Other administrative controls can include the use of signage and visual cues to encourage and provide reminders to wear a mask, observe one -way traffic markers, or follow good hand hygiene, COVID -19 and Indoor Air 33 ensuring workplaces have adequate supplies and access to hand washing and hand -hygiene stations, and recording worker and visitor details for contact tracing purposes should it be required. Perhaps one of the least utilized strategies during emergency con ditions is en gagement with occupants, not only to explain the nature of the risks to ensure compliance, but also to train those occupants to understand the risks such that they are equipped to make good risk -based decisions. One means to educate individual s about risk is web and app-based risk calculators .254-256 These have become an important means to interface with individuals and provide them with a framework to understand how various factors work together to increase or decrease risk of transmission. These calculators consider factors such as user location, size of the gathering, the nature of the activity, and mask use, but also individual factors such as health status and pre -existing conditions. Although most COVID -19 risk assessment apps are targeted at individuals, there are several risk assessment tools that have been developed for use by s ite managers seeking to understand transmission risks based on site -specific data (e.g., this tool for aerosol transmission risk257), which can then be used to assess transmission risk in various scenarios. Another uncommon approach is to train occupants on indoor air quality ( IAQ) awareness. This involves educating occupants about IAQ concepts and equipping them with tools that allow them to monitor IAQ and take a ction where necessary. One example of this is the use of CO 2 sensing, as described above, as a tool to train occupants to learn when to take ventilatory action . In Germany, classrooms have been equipped CO 2 sensors , which are being used to train teachers a nd students to be mindful of shared air and to periodically open windows; the intent of this is to entrench the habit and later remove the CO 2 sensor.258 There are several caveats to this approach : 1) commercially available CO 2 sensors vary greatly in sensitivity and accuracy; 2) fixation on the digital readout can be counterproductive as the readout is not as important as whether CO 2 levels are trending upward or downward ; and 3) IAQ awareness requires allowing occupants to have some control over ventilation, specifically the abi lity to open windows, which may not be advisable in spaces in which maintaining pressure differentials is required (e.g., a lab environment must be positively pressurized vs. the fume hoods) . PERSONAL AND GROUP P ROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Personal protective equ ipment ( PPE) has traditionally been considered an additional control measure w hen other measures have already been implemented and is not intended to be a substitute for other control measures. The use of masks as PPE in common spaces however has been increasingly mandated where there is a high level of community spread in the local population. Mask -wearing has been found to reduce the number of cases and g rowth rate of COVID -19 infections where there is widespread adh erence, and where used in combination with other NPI such as hand hygiene and physical distancing.211 Masks vary in their ability to block exposure to respiratory particles due to mask construction and fit , but can contribute to source control for the protection of others (group protection) and personal protection of the wearer. The most effective masks are those that provide a good fit around the nose, sides, and chin, and are made of materials that provide a high level of particle filtration, while maintaining breathability. Special consideration should be given to persons with cognitive difficulties or physical disabilities when co nsidering appropriate mask use , including workers with difficulty breathing due to existing medical conditions. COVID -19 and Indoor Air 34 Additional precautions may be needed for workers who are not able to wear a mask during work, and \"mask breaks\" outside the workplace may be nee ded for persons who find it difficult to wear a mask continuously. A detailed presentation of the literature on the effectiveness of masks, and considerations for safe use of masks is available from the NCCEH.211 DESIGNING AN EFFECTIVE RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY Given the range of options available, and the limited data regarding the individual effectiveness of these options, how do we choose amongst the range of technological and non -technological options to create a suite of preventive measures? The following key recommendations were drawn from various workplace risk assessment tools , which ca n be found in the references:259,260 1. Gather information regarding the occupancy, activities, and physical characteristics of each occupied space in the building. In some cases, HVAC consultation or audits may be necessary to understand ventilation cha racteristics. 2. Identify and rank risk of occupied spaces based on information in Section 3 or from risk matrices. 3. Prioritize actions for the highest risk occupants first. If it is possible to move occupants to a lower risk space, consider the feasibility o f this before implementing interventions. 4. Apply a hazard control strategy, like the hierarchy of controls, remaining aware that in an emergency it may be necessary to activate multiple levels at once or in reverse order. 5. Layer measures as necessary ; higher risk areas and occupants need higher leve l protections . 6. Evaluate the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures through periodic review (next section). 7. Plan for long -term IAQ improvements for future proofing (Section 5 ). EVALUATING THE IMPACT OR EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES Although considerable effort has been put into designing risk assessment tools, workplace safety plans, and supporting resources, evaluation or monitoring the effectiveness of this plan is not usually elaborated upon.261-263 The following are some approaches to assessing the success of a COVID -19 risk mitigation strategy. Assess compliance: Are employees able to carry out the plan in the way it's described? Stakeholder satisfaction: Do occupants feel safe in the space? Learning from transmission events: Are there any activities, processes, or spaces in which exposures are occurring more often? Do the exposures that hap pen in the workplace exceed that which is to be expected in the community? Typically, this level of information is not accessible until after a public health response has been initiated due to workplace exposure. Periodic review: Is there a plan in place t o review and update the workplace safety plan to account for changing information or a shift in the level of risk in the community, and to communicate that change with other occupants? Exit strategy: Is there a plan in place for returning to normal operati ons? Which mitigation measures can be relaxed, and which should become common practice? Follow up with COVID -19 and Indoor Air 35 occupants is required to understand how common perceptions of risk may have changed, and what measures (or hybrid measures) would help them to continue f eeling safe in the future. COVID -19 and Indoor Air 36 RESEARCH QUESTION 5: WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF VENTILATION IN THE MITIGATION OF TRANSMISSION INDOORS? As the focus on aerosol transmission of SARS -CoV-2 has sharpened, increasing emphasis has been placed on the importance of ventilation and air cleaning devices as a risk mitigation measure. This is because, as particles decrease in diameter due to evaporat ion, the time required for them to settle due to gravity increases exponentially. At a given point (which shifts depend on conditions, noted above), the particle will no longer settle due to gravity. Instead, other mechanisms (electrostatic attraction, imp action, etc) are the main modes through which the smallest particles are cleared from the air and this occurs over an extended time frame.264 If these particles are not physically removed from the space (ventilation) and/or removed from the air itself (air cleaning), there is potential for them to accumu late to the point that another occupant would acquire an infectious dose in the time spent in the room , depending on how long the virus remains viable . Ventilation and air cleaning aim to reduce aerosol transmission risk. Critically, however, when two people are standing close together and talking (close contact), especially if they are unmasked, they are producing and exchanging thousands of respiratory particles per second,81 and increasing ventilation would have minimal impact on this rapid exchange. In addition, ventilation or air exchange only acts upon particles that are aloft for long enough to be entraine d in an air flow and drawn out of the room. Larger particles that follow a \"ballistic\" trajectory wind up on surfaces, where they may contribute to fomite transmission , although the risk of fomite transmission is believed to be low .152 This is not to say that ventilation is futile. If close contact interactions are eliminated (e.g., through distancing or plexiglass barriers), ventilation will reduce the risk of longer -range transmission, effectively buying more time for occupants of a shared space. This section will focus on the uses of, evidence for and caveats regarding ventilation and air cle aning as a means to mitigate SARS -CoV-2 transmission risk indoors. IMPORTANT TERMIN OLOGY Part of the challenge with communicating the benefits and limits of ventilation as a risk mitigation measure is the confusion around the meaning of specific terms. For clarity, ventilation refers to the exchange of stale room air for \" fresh \" air, whether that be outdoor air , or some portion of recirculated/filtered air drawn from within the building itself. Ventilation can be achieved passively, by taking advantage of natural forces like wind and buoyancy to create air flows ( natural ventilation ), or actively through the use of blowers or fans and ductwork to force air through to the spaces that need it (mechanical ventilation ). Because this forced air is also usually heated, treated, or cooled, it is often referred to generally as a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Ventilation (air exchange) is distinct from air cleaning or purification (filtration, UVGI, etc .), which focus on removing gaseous or particulate contaminants from the air, or for other devices like fans and portable air conditioning units, which move air around but do not bring in fresh air. Ventilation rates can be expressed as air changes per hour (ACH, the number of room volumes of air that are replaced each) or volumetric flow (litres per second) per person/occupant or per ar ea. COVID -19 and Indoor Air 37 EFFECTI VENESS OF VENTILATION ON RESPIRATORY DISEASE TRANSMISSION Previous studies have found that ventilation has a positive effect on reducing the occurrence of respiratory infections in hospitals and other settings . These studies have been reviewed extensively by several previous authors .265-267 However, the majority of thes e studies examined the effect of the presence or absence of intentional ventilation (mechanical or natural) compared to no ventilation at all. More recent studies have provided a more quantitative assessment of the relationship between ventilation rates an d respiratory infections. Zhu et al.268 showed that students living in a dormitory with mechanical v entilation and 100% outdoor air experienced fewer laboratory -confirmed acute respiratory infections than students living in a building reliant on infiltration only (no mechanical or intentional natural ventilation). Yang et al.269 collected temperature, relative humidity and CO 2 data from dormitories over several seasons and found that night -time ventilation rates were associated with the occurrence of common colds and infl uenza in both summer and winter. Interestingly, the data showed a closer association with ventilation rate expressed per occupant (L per second per person) than when expressed as air changes per hour. Finally, Du et al.270 found that modulating ventilation rates to ma intain CO 2 levels < 1000 pm was associated with a 97% decrease in tuberculosis ( TB) incidence among contacts of 27 TB cases initially housed in a student residence, who were then followed over 5 years. These studies provide some useful insight into the min imal ventilation rates necessary to prevent disease but have limited value in informing optimal ventilation (next section) . CONSIDERATIONS FOR OPTIMIZING VENTILATION IN A SPACE Creating healthy indoor air is not as simple as increasing the air changes in a space. There are many engineering and environmental factors that must be considered when attempting to minimize exposure to infectious respiratory particles in a space: Ventilation rate : Although it is generally accepted in professional practice that 2 ACH is too low to prevent potentially harmful exposure to bioaerosols, including respiratory virus es, over -ventilating a space can also lead to increased exposure if other occupants are in the wrong place at the wrong time . For example, Pantelic an d Th am271 found that with a mixing ventilation system, increasin g from 6 to 12 ACH result ed in greater upward or rebounding air flow as the air left the overhead diffuser and then hit the flo or. This likewise appeared to loft cough droplets and increase exposure to a thermal breathing mannikin seated in front of the cough simulator. Similarly, devices like air conditioners , fans , or even an open window on a moving bus ca n facilitate the transfer of respiratory particles , as was observed in transmission events in restaurants in Korea and Guangzhou .112,113,125 System and configuration : The type of ventilation system and its configuration will affect how air is mixed in a room and t he path that particles will follow as they are through and drawn out of the room. As reviewed by Lipin ski et al .,22 the different types of ventilation systems commonly in use will affect how a cloud of emitted respiratory particles will move throughout a room, and whether that flow i s laminar (displacement ventilation) or turbulent (mixing ventilation, use of fans/air conditioners, open windows). For a mixing ventilation system, the placement of supply and exhaust grills, and the type of diffuser used greatly affect the degree of mix ing; when mixing was poor, increasing the ACH actually increased COVID -19 and Indoor Air 38 the exposure of other room occupants (thermal mannikins) to the tracer gas used to simulate respiratory particles from a prone patient.272 However, t here is no clear superiority of displacement ventilatio n over mixing ventilation either . Shajahan et al.273 reviewed data on these two systems for hospitals setting s and found that although displacement ventilation tended to lessen exposure for occupants when farther away from the source (compared to mixing ventilation ), it increased exposure risk for occupants if they were close to the source or close to the exhaust vent. Fraction of outdoor air. Buildings that recirculate air need to distinguish between the volume that is drawn from within the building vs that drawn from outdoors. A room that is receiving the recommended ACH may still have poor air quality if too many of those air volumes are being drawn from within the building. During the pandemic, facilities managers have been asked to ensure that the largest possible fraction of outdoor air is used . Maintaining pressure differentials is a critical consideratio n for high -risk environments like laboratories, where opening windows or exhaust ventilation might serve to reduce positive pressure in the room and induce leakage from the fume hood. Controlling humidity and temperature within recommended limits : Envi ronmental conditions like relative humidity and temperature affect both the rate of evaporation of a droplet and subsequently the survival of airborne viruses. For SARS -CoV-2, there has been considerable interest in tempe rature and humidity effects and their e ffects on transmission.274 However, the optimum relative humidity for controlling most bioaerosols (fungi, viruses, and bacteria) is 40-60% for temperatures within the range of human thermal comfort. Current recommendations are to maintain relative humidity within this range . HVAC maintenance unlikely to enhance the risk transmission : As expected for any particle that does not immediately settle, some particles bearing SARS -CoV-2 will be drawn into and deposited on HVAC components, such as grilles, ductwork, and filters.130,241 Some organizations have even recommended daily disinfection of HVAC grilles.275 However, there is no evidence of COVID -19 transmission due to touching of grilles, soiled filters, etc., and the risk of transmission via fomites is believed to be low.152 Nevertheless, HVAC filters in particular may harbour a number of potentially pathogenic organisms (under non -pandemic conditions) and so standard precautions wh en changing filters and cleaning ductwork are warranted.276 Human movement creates random eff ects: Perhaps the greatest difficulty in optimizing ventilation for a space is the random effects caused by occupant themselves. In addition to the effect of thermal plumes emanating from occupants ' bodies,216 occupants also create a turbulent \"wake flow\" when moving about, and similarly opening doors creates turbulent vortices.267 Generation of turbulence helps to further mix air, which could be considered beneficial in a mixing ventilation system; however, wake flows and door opening can also draw contaminated air along with it. This may be of greater concern when an occupant i s moving from a \"dirty zone\" (e.g., a sick room or other contaminated space) into a clean room. This can be minimized if occupants limit their movements in the space. In Germany, one school opted to install individualized exhaust ventilation above each sea ted student .277 Similarly, Pantelic et al.278 explored the use of a personalized desktop ve ntilation system and found that although it was momentarily overwhelmed by cough droplets directed at the COVID -19 and Indoor Air 39 recipient's face, use of the system resulted in an overall reduction in the intake fraction compared to a standard mixing ventilation system. FORWARD THINKING: STRATEGIES AND RESOURCES FOR \"FUTURE -PROOFING\" INDOOR AIR The COVID -19 pandemic has prompted widespread support for IAQ improvements. Although how this approach is broadly depen dent on the setting ( e.g., public buildings, private residences, congregat e living facilit ies, etc .), substantial challenges exist. IAQ must satisfy multiple goals of pandemic resilience, climate resilience, energy efficiency, and occupant satisfaction. IAQ improvements must also fit into the overall scheme of indoor envir onmental quality (IEQ) , which also encompasses thermal comfort, acoustic comfort (noise), and visual comfort (lighting). Although a full discussion of strategies for future proofing is beyond the scope of this document, the following strategies may provide the basis for further useful discussion: Taking stock: conduct detailed audits of existing indoor spaces and their deficiencies . The pandemic has increased awareness of how many public and private spaces are substantially under -ventilated. The first step is to conduct a thorough assessment of HVAC system performance and ensure that ventilation requirements are met in all occupied spaces . Audits should also take note of both ventilation assets (e.g., openable windows, outdoor spaces) and liabilities (dead zones, etc) in the building (or the org anization 's building stock) as a whole. Technological innovation . There are many technical innovations that can help create better ventilated, healthier buildings. Tools such as building infor mation modelling and computational fluid dynamics help architec ts and engineers 1) understand air flows; 2) collaborate on design improvements; and 3) model specific challenges, such as the occur rence of an airborne outbreak .2 Shifting from large -scale, centralized building systems to distri buted systems designed for that specific zone of the building may also help to provide better control over air flow.279 Recently, the growth in low -cost, wireless IAQ sensors has made it possible to continuously monitor indoor environments for a variety of contaminants, including CO 2 as an indicator of ventilation inadequacy . This technology allows IAQ deficits to be quickly identified and remedied , with or without engagement of the occupants .280,281 Similar ly, wearable technology like proximity sensors can increase occupant awareness of time spent in close contact with other occupants , and also assist in contact tracing should an outbreak occur .282 Although proximity sensors were deployed in a time of crisis, some aspects or functi ons of these devices may be useful in understanding occupancy and crowding in buildings going forward. New building materials with lower emissions, as well as new plant - or microorganism -based biotechnologies for air cleaning (biofilters, bioscrubbers, mem brane bioreactors) may help to eliminate types or levels of contaminants that cannot be addressed through conventional technologies.1 In short, there are numerous fronts on which technological advancement will create new opportunities for IAQ improvements, although these technologies range widely in terms of cost and eas e of implementation. Human -centred design . Human -centred design seeks to understand the needs of the end user and how he or she might experience the design of a space or a building , while at the COVID -19 and Indoor Air 40 same time integrating technology in manner that is intuitive and enhances the experience .283 One of the major complaints with IAQ is hav ing little or no control over interior conditions. However, m any of the IAQ monitoring systems available in the marketplace can be made visible and shared with oc cupants . This creates accountability for bu ilding managers, but also enables managers to engage occupants in moderating IAQ and may help IAQ issues to be more rapidly identified and resolved. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, making building function v isible and manipulable to users can help educate users about IAQ and engage their participation in creating healthy air. However, one criticism of this approach is that it can make occupants hyper -aware of air quality, particularly if occupants have not been adequately capacitated to interpret shifts in monitor readings.244 Creation of new health -based standards . Current IAQ standards such as those promulgated by ASHRAE have the benefit of decades of practice and refinement , and these standards have been broadly adopted into Canada's national and provincial building codes . However, it is important to note that ASHRAE standards are fundamentally comfort -based, and although health impacts and health evidence have been an increasingly important aspect of ASHRAE's practice, occupant health is not at the centre of these standards. Competing initiatives , suc h as the WELL Building Standard focus specifically on promoting the physical and mental health of occupants through building design. As we move into a period of significant investment and re -design of indoor spaces, it may be useful to consider how building standards may need to be adap ted (whether voluntarily or through building code changes) to achieve IEQ goals. SUMMARY The literature provides some insight into ventilation and respiratory disease transmission, including that of SARS -CoV-2. However, there are several important caveats : Ventilation addresses only a portion of the risk posed by virus -laden respiratory partic les. It prevents the accumulation of very small particles that would not otherwise settle due to gravity, preventing longer -range transmission risk. However, ventilation has little to no impact on the exchange of respiratory particles at short -range, which is happening over the course of seconds to minutes. The number of cases that occur solely due to long -range transmission (that are affected by ventilation) is unclear, but likely small . This is not to say that aerosols do not play a role in the type of close encounter s that result in transmission, but ventilation likely would not have been effective in preventing short -range transmission regardless. Regardless of the role of aerosol transmission in the pandemic, public health measures are layered so as to provide protection against multiple routes of transmission. Measures to mitigate aerosols transmission (opening windows, ventilation, air filtration) are almost universally included in public health recommendations. COVID -19 and Indoor Air 41 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Indoo r air quality is a key determinant of individual and population health. Although the COVID -19 pandemic has sharpened the urgency around improving indoor air quality, IAQ improvements are also necessary to address public health issues related to contaminate d urban environment s, sick building syndrome, climat e resilience (wildfire smoke responses), and improving productivity and occupant satisfaction generally. The relative magnitude of IAQ benefits on COVID -19 transmission are partly dependent on the role of aerosol transmission in the pandemic, which despite amplification in the media remain s unclear . Nevertheless, public health measures aim to address all potential modes of transmission. For that reason, IAQ improvements like ventilation, air filtration, air cleaning, etc ., have been key components of the multi-layered public health response since the beginning of the pandemic. Maintaining this holistic view of transmission, which is not solely dependent on environmental factors, but also contact patterns/interactions, socioeconomic factors, and host or indiv idual factors, is critical to eliminating the conditions in which transmission may occur.221 This review has provided a holistic introduction to SARS -CoV-2, with a focus on environmental factors and the role of ventilation in particular. Although we h ave discussed the importance of ventilation in mitigating the risk of transmission due to very small virus -laden particles , ventilation and air cleaning must be used in conjunction with other measures . In addition, t he marginal benefits of any ventilation of air -cleaning strategy will depend on a wide range of variables in specific spaces with specific population . Substantial improvements in IAQ can be made through relatively simple strategies , which have been widely promulgated throughout the pandemic (Appendix 3 ); however, optimizing ventilation for infection control requires a much greater level of expertise and technical assessment . In addition, making such technological investments will also require planning and investment to evaluate the impact of thos e improvements . As we move forward from the pandemic, organizations will need to transition from the emergency measures necessary for business continuity toward a new steady state that addresses vulnerabilit ies contributing to the COVID -19 pandemic . This transition will require organizations to establish new objectives for indoor environmental quality, to invest in IAQ assessment and HVAC audits to understand the root problems , and to explore new technological innovations that will promote occupant he alth without de -centring the human experience.

SELECTED EXAMPLES OF COVID -19 OUTBREAKS THAT HIGHLIGHT INDOOR RISK FACTORS. Sources Setting Description Attack Rates Potential Contributing Factors Shen et al. 2020 Bus trip 68 individuals rode together on a bus to an event, and then back again on the same bus and in the same seats. The index case was seated roughly in the middle of the bus, and an open window at the front of the bus may have helped to mix respiratory particles ( large and small) throughout the bus. 35.3% of people riding the bus with the infected individual on a return journey. Close contact/crowding; drafts or turbulent air. Park et al. 2020 Call centre, in which transmission occurred among workers on one side o f the office floor plan. Workers in a call centre on the 11th floor of a building; the company occupied 4 floors but there was little interaction between floors. Ventilation evaluated but not identified as an issue by the authors, although relatively even spread throughout the space may suggest an aerosol component. 43.5% among those on the 11th floor where the majority of cases occurred; most of these cases restricted to one side of the workspace. Loud speech, close interaction between workers throughout t he day. Lu et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020 Restaurant An almost total lack of fresh air flow, sealed exhaust grates and zonal air conditioning created a pocket of air at one end of the room, in which the index case was seated with 20 other people 48% among those within the pocket of air were infected. However, no server or patron outside of the pocket was infected, emphasizing the need for both proximity and duration of contact. Crowding and prolonged interaction. Very little or no air exchange to clea r aerosols. Drafts from the air conditioner may have assisted the spread of droplets and aerosols within the pocket. COVID -19 and Indoor Air 45 Jang et al. 2020; Bae et al. 2020 Fitness Center Virus spread amongst instructors at a workshop was carried back and transmitted to students at 12 fitness centres. 26% overall among students exposed to instructors in fitness class. No cases observed in small classes or in low - intensity classes. High -intensity exercise generating large numbers of virus -laden respiratory particles in a small space; movement of participants back and forth through each other's plumes. Miller et al. 2020; Hamner et al. 2020 Auditorium 62 people attended a 2.5 -h choir practice. Participants were seated next to each other in chairs and also shared food. 87% among those attending the choir practice were infected. Loud singing; poor ventilation; close and prolonged personal interaction; shared objects and high -touch surfaces (fomites). Brlek et al. 2020 Squash court The sole incident in which same time -same place exposure did NOT occur between the index case and subsequent cases. Index case played squash with a partner who contracted the virus, as did two subsequent pairs using the same court over the next 2 hours. Insufficient informatio n Ventilation was not evaluated, but lack of ventilation may have allowed virus -laden particles to accumulate in the court. The door handle was a common touch surface. Kang et al. Lin et al. Outbreak in multi -unit residential building Three households connected on the same vertical plumbing stack tested positive for the same strain of SARS -SoV-2, the first on the 15th floor followed by two others on the 25th and 27th floor; no other cases in the building were found. Potential transmission route investigated through tracer gas studies and CFD modelling. Insufficient information Negative pressure in the upper floor bathrooms due to wind effects could have caused fecal aerosols to be drawn upward from the 15th floor suite and into the two upper -floor suites. The top of the plumbing stack was had been illegally modified in a way that would have facilitated this flow. COVID -19 and Indoor Air 46 APPENDIX 3.
