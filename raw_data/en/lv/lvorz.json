Examples of program names are A.S. in Nursing or B.S. in Business Administration. The term \"program\" refers to an approved set of courses or a curriculum, completion of which leads to the award of an undergraduate or graduate certif icate or an associate or a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Some institutions use the term \"major\" interchangeably with \"degree program,\" in which case the Commission will also regard the major as a degree program. Programs approved by the Commiss ion are listed in its Academic Program Inventory (API), a comprehensive listing of all active and inactive certificate and degree programs at all levels offered by Indiana colleges and universities. The term \"program\" does not typically refer to a curricu lar subdivision, such as a major, concentration, specialization, track, or option. However, under some circumstances, such as those relating to workforce needs, economic development, accreditation requirements, licensure/certification, the Commission may regard curricular subdivisions as programs needing to be approved by the Commission and listed in the API. 2 The \"Degree Award Level\" refers to the following categories (see Degree Award Level Definitions for additional detail. 1. Award of Less than One Academic Year 2. Award of at Least One but Less than Two Academic Years 3. Associate's Degree 4. Postsecondary Award, Certificate, or Diploma of at Least Two but Less than Four Academic Years 5. Bachelor's Degree 6. Post -Baccalaureate Certificate 7. Master's Degree 8. Post -Master's Certificate 9. Doctor's Degree -Research/Scholarship 10. Doctor's Degree -Professional Practice 11. Doctor's Degree -Other 3 For Commission purposes, \"online\" includes two categories: 100% online and blended programs, i.e. 80-99% is online, with the remaining portion in -person. 4 Career Relevant/Out -of-Classroom Experiences include, but are not limited to, co -ops, internships, clinicals, practica, capstone projects, employer critiques, and study abroad programs. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Career Readiness Competencies and Statewide Career Relevance Definition provide additional information about student engagement experiences with career relevance. 5 CIP Code refers to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), a six -digit code in the form of xx.xxxx that identifies instructional program specialties offered by educational institutions. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) developed these codes as a taxonomy for reporting student enrollme nt and degree completion data by area of study to the federal government. The State of Indiana uses these codes for similar purposes. The CIP taxonomy is organized on three levels (2 -digit, 4 -digit, 6 -digit). The 2 -digit series (sometimes called a CIP fami ly), represents the most general groupings of related programs while the 6 -digit codes represent specific instructional programs. NCES initially published CIP codes in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020. 2 1.

Rationale for the Program a. Institutional Rationale (Alignment with Institutional Mission and Strengths) Why is the institution proposing this program and how does it build upon institutional strengths? How is it consistent with the mission of the institution and how does this program fit into the institution's strategic plan (please provide a link to the strategic plan)? The Natural Medicine program at the John Patrick University of Health and Applied Sciences is designed to train individuals to become skilled in natural, complementary and alternative medical modalities and assume roles as health and wellness professionals in private business and industry, community organizations, and public health and alternative care settings. The curriculum covers various topics such as anatomy and physiology, naturopathic principles , practices, laws, & e thics , nutritional biochemistry, functional medicine blood lab and h erbal, vitamin & mineral therapies . The program emphasizes the importance of client care and a cquire the professional tools and experience for entry -level integrative wellness and public health positions . This program does not require an externship . This does require an on -campus practical experience during the first semester of studies and provides students with valuable hands -on training and the opportunity to apply their foundational knowledge of natural medicine and skill s with their professors and classmates. There is a shortage of healthcare workers in the United States and this includes allied healthcare workers that typically need specialized, technical training. JPU has the means to reduce the workface short ages by offering new programs such as natural medicine . Overall employment of healthcare practitioners and technical workers is at a growth rate of 6% (as fast as the national average) , et al Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupatio nal Outlook Handbook , October 2022. Additional employment in the fields of health education specialists and community health workers is projected to grow 12 percent from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations. About 16,000 openings for health education specialists and community health workers are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor 9 force, such as to retire et al Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook , October 2022. JPU has already proven successful in offering programs through distance learning formats. The Natural Medicine program will use o nline classroom instruction, industry -relevant technologies and tools, and a n on-campus practical experience to present a distinctive and comprehensive learning experience. JPU's dedication to sound educational infrastructure and teaching practices ensures the quality of education and maximizes students' learning outcomes. The Natural Medicine program clearly aligns with the mission statement as it will help students evaluate, analyze, and synthesize information to become more skillful at creating solutions in an integrative wellness and public health career environment by the end of the program. The Natural Medicine program aligns with industry standards in curriculum to ensure student success in this occupational field. Strategically, a s a school with a strong focus on becoming a comprehensive institution in the field of allied health science s, the addition of dedicated natural medicine program is of utmost importance. This program will not only support our strategic goal of program gro wth but also bring about positive changes in terms of community recognition and vendor relationships. By adhering to industry standards and providing students with a clear understanding of the pathways to credentials, JPU aims to establish itself as a lead ing institution in the natural medicine, complementary and alternative medicine education field. JPU's Strategic Plan is a vailable here . b. State Rationale: General How does this program address state priorities as reflected in the Commission's most recent strategic plan Reaching Higher In a State of Change? JPU's online Natural Medicine program is well equipped to meet the CHE's priorities of completion, equity, and talent. Completion: An online natural medicine program can help students complete their education by providing a flexible and convenient way to earn the necessary qualifications for a career in natural medicine, complementary and alternative medicine . Online programs can offer asynchronous learning, allowing students to study on their own time and at their own pace. This can be particularly helpful for students who are working or have other commitments that make traditional classroom learning difficult . JPU offers classes year -round, allowing students more flexibility in their pathway to completion, be it at an accelerated pace or as a part -time student. Equity: JPU's Online natural medicine program can also help promote equity in higher education by reducing barriers to entry. For example, students who may not have access to a physical natural medicine program in their area can still pursue their education and career goals through an online program. Additionally, online programs can often b e more affordable than traditional programs, which can help make education more accessible to a wider range of students. JPU is dedicated to creating an environment that is learner -centric, including personalization of education and tools students need to succeed. 10 Talent: JPU's online natural medicine program can help Indiana and other states develop and retain talented individuals in the healthcare industry by providing high -quality education and training. By attracting and retaining skilled healthcare p rofessionals, Indiana can strengthen its healthcare system and improve patient outcomes. The program aims to bring high -quality natural medicine, complementary and alternative medicine education that exceeds accreditation standards. c. State Rationale: Equity -Related How does this program address the Equity section of Reaching Higher In a State of Change (see pages 15 -17), especially with respect to considerations of race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, and geography? When consideri ng equity in higher education JPU's online Natural Medicine program removes or reduces barriers in many ways. Accessibility: Anyone with access to a device and the internet can attend classes at JPU. This reduces barriers to education for those who live i n rural areas and have mobility, or transportation struggles. Diversity: As an online program, students will have the opportunity to learn in an environment that allows students to connect with others from different backgrounds, geographical locations, abilities, and cultures. JPU will create an inclusive environment, encouraging students to connect their learning with their own experiences and share those experiences so others can gain insight and understanding. Socioeconomic: JPU offers many tuition, loan and scholarship options for students. Care has been taken to find affordable learning material and class design to optimize credit hours. The online component improves affordability by not requiring on -campus living or relocation to attend. d. Evidence of Labor Market Need National, State, or Regional Need o Is the program serving a national, state, or regional labor market need? Please describe. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projected growth in overall employment of healthcare practitioners and technical workers is at a growth rate of 6% (as fast as the national average), et al Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupation al Outlook Handbook, October 2022. Additional employment in the fields of health education specialists and community health workers is projected to grow 12 percent from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations. About 16,000 openings for health education specialists and community health workers are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to 11 result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force , such as to retire et al Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, October 2022. In-person programs and online programs cap their enrollment, thus limiting the current number of students able to enter the field e ach year. To meet the growing needs, programs need to increase their enrollment, or new programs need to be developed. Additionally, many schools are in or near high -population areas to maximize enrollment, which creates barriers for rural and low -popul ation areas. An online program can bring natural medicine education to places that need it. e. Placement of Graduates Please describe the principal occupations and industries, in which the majority of graduates are expected to find employment. If the pr ogram is primarily a feeder for graduate programs, please describe the principal kinds of graduate programs, in which the majority of graduates are expected to be admitted. Natural Medicine graduates may seek employment in multiple healthcare settings such as public health departments, community wellness centers, integrative wellness clinics, traditional medical clinics incorporating complementary and alternative medicine gui dance, fitness and wellness centers, natural and pharmaceutical research facilities, data science collection and research, health research and writing, and independent consultants (both in -person and virtual.) The Natural Medicine program also provides a continued pathway to continue their education at JPU to earn their upper -division degrees in BS in Integrative Health & Lifestyle Medicine and MS in Integrative and Functional Medicine. f.
