What to know The [imminent rollout of a new COVID-19 vaccine booster](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/09/01/cdc-panel-recommends-new-covid-booster-allowed-anyone-above-12/7952916001/) that targets omicron variants could face an uphill battle in New York after millions of people declined to get prior booster doses. Now that federal regulators this week approved the \"bivalent\" vaccine that targets both the original virus and the BA.4 and BA.5 variants, officials in New York are expected to soon reveal detailed plans to start distributing the shots as soon as next week. The new booster will be available to ages 12 and above at least two months after any previous COVID-19 shot. But the fact only 53% of New Yorkers eligible for a prior booster dose received the shot suggested this latest campaign needs to convince more people of the benefits of staying up-to-date on COVID-19 vaccination. State and federal officials, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, this week touted trial data that show the new bivalent vaccine offered better protection against omicron-related infections than prior vaccines. The new booster also added another layer of protection against severe illness, which prior vaccines have sustained throughout despite waning effectiveness against infection or re-infection, federal records show. Hochul described the upcoming arrival of a new booster as \"great news,\" referring to the state's strategy of leaning heavily on vaccination to reduce the virus' disruption to society. \"Vaccines and boosters are a key component in our efforts to curb the pandemic,\" Hochul [wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1565014876204011521), \"and with updated boosters, we'll be able to protect New Yorkers from the latest variants.\" The new [Pfizer-BioNTech](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/22/pfizer-covid-booster-omicron-submitted-fda-emergency-authorization/7844312001/) booster was granted emergency authorization for anyone ages 12 and up, while [Moderna's](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/06/08/covid-vaccine-moderna-omicron-booster-safe-and-effective-study-says/7551498001/) vaccine is authorized for adults only. Both were authorized for use at least two months after any previous COVID-19 shots. When will new COVID vaccine booster arrive in NY? Federal officials have asserted the new booster could be available as soon as Labor Day, with Pfizer projecting it could provide up to 15 million doses nationally by Sept. 9. While New York's state-run mass vaccination sites have closed, COVID-19 vaccines are still widely available through medical offices, pharmacies and local health departments. Once the new booster becomes available, New Yorkers will be able to find local sites offering the shot via the [vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/) website, or by calling 1-800-232-0233. FDA ACTS: Agency [authorizes reformulated COVID-19 booster shot for the fall](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/31/fda-authorizes-ba-4-ba-5-reformulated-covid-booster-shot/7933943001/) Why is the new COVID vaccine booster important? COVID-19, which still accounts for about 80,000 cases and 400 deaths a day in the U.S., is expected to surge again this fall and winter, as it has in both previous years of the pandemic. Yet with New York relaxing most pandemic-related restrictions including the end of masking and testing mandates in most settings outside health care and group homes improving the 53% booster rate becomes more crucial to limiting another wave. \"Vaccines are, in fact, the very cornerstone of public health,\" Dr. Parag Mehta, president of the state Medical Society said Wednesday. \"We must preserve community immunity to protect society especially our most vulnerable newborns, pregnant women, the immune-compromised, and those with cancer,\" Mehta said, referring to the continued COVID-19 threat, as well as more recent outbreaks of monkeypox and polio. \"Vaccination can mean the difference between life and death,\" he added. Meanwhile, about 79% of New York's total population has completed the initial COVID-19 vaccination series, meaning two doses for most ages. But gaps remain in some counties, with the largest disparities in mostly rural upstate counties where that rate drops below 50%, state data show. Past struggles to boost COVID-19 vaccination and booster rates in New York have involved a mix of issues, spanning from vaccine skepticism linked to misinformation spreading online to pandemic fatigue and low urgency during lulls in cases between waves. As fall approached, however, New York health officials recently launched a variety of new public outreach statements and advertisements promoting the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. It included a [\"vax to school\"](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/coronavirus/2022/06/09/ny-ends-covid-testing-mandate-unvaccinated-state-workers/7570089001/) campaign urging parents to get children vaccinated as the youngest New Yorkers [continued to lag older children and adults](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/coronavirus/2022/06/30/where-is-covid-vaccine-for-kids-under-5-in-ny-new-details-emerge/65364835007/), with just 6% of kids under 5 receiving an initial dose so far. Still, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert M. Califf said Wednesday COVID-19 vaccines and boosters have saved \"countless lives\" across the country while preventing many hospitalizations that strain the health system. \"As we head into fall and begin to spend more time indoors, we strongly encourage anyone who is eligible to consider receiving a booster dose of the new bivalent vaccine,\" Califf added. The new booster is not likely to provide a huge benefit over the original vaccine, [according to scientists](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/31/fda-authorizes-ba-4-ba-5-reformulated-covid-booster-shot/7933943001/). But any boost in protection is worthwhile, potentially preventing death, hospitalization and long COVID-19, government officials said. Will New York mandate COVID booster dose? Meanwhile, the Hochul administration's previous push to mandate medical workers receive a COVID-19 booster dose has been all but abandoned, in favor of encouraging they voluntarily get the added shot. In February, Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett [abruptly changed course on the booster mandate](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/coronavirus/2022/06/09/ny-ends-covid-testing-mandate-unvaccinated-state-workers/7570089001/), citing concerns it would trigger a staffing crisis at some health care facilities. At the time, she noted about 25% of the workforce would have missed the deadline to receive the booster shot to avoid losing their jobs. Currently, the percentage of hospital workers who received a COVID-19 booster shot stands at about 70%, according to the latest state data. Despite the backtracking on boosters, the original state mandate requiring health care workers in New York receive the first two COVID-19 vaccine doses remains in place. That measure led to about [3% of the health care workforce in New York leaving jobs](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/coronavirus/2021/10/14/how-many-health-workers-lost-jobs-due-ny-vaccine-mandate/8449413002/) to avoid vaccination last fall. Many Republican lawmakers, however, have renewed their calls recently to urge Hochul to lift that mandate, too, citing an ongoing worker shortages plaguing the health care industry. Last week, state Republican lawmakers also sent [a letter urging federal lawmakers](https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/press-release/attachment/cdc_letter.docx_2.pdf) to fight to repeal the similar federal measures mandating COVID-19 vaccinations for health care workers to sustain a provider's access to Medicaid and Medicare funding. \"We must not allow ineffective decisions made at the height of the pandemic to continue to negatively affect our healthcare sector,\" the state lawmakers wrote.
