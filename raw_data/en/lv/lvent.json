PCP Your PCP will act as your health manager. He or she will do the following: Advis e you on personal health issues Diag nose and treat medical prob lems Coordinate and monitor any care you may require from appropriate specialists Keep your medical records up-to -date We only cover medical Services, benefits , or supplies that are provided, prescribed or directed by a Physician, unless specified otherwise in th e Services and Benefits section of this chapter .

Please check with your PCP for specific information about the requi rements for receiving Services. Your KP Hawaii Care Team Choosing Your KP Hawaii Ca re Team Your KP Hawaii Care Team is made up of you and both of the following: Your designated PCP Your designated Medical Office To address individual health care needs, you and each of your Family Dependent s may choose his or her own PCP and Medical Offi ce. SAMPLE2022 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - GP 4 Chapter 1: Important Information When choosing a PCP and Medical Office, you should consider the following information: Do you already have a provider that you want to remain with? Read through the Caring for You: Physicians and Locations Directory to determine whether your current provider is available as a PCP. Decide what type of provider fits your needs (family practice, general practice, OB/GYN, internal medicine or pediatrics). For example, you may designate a pediatrician as the PCP for your child. Select a Medical Office tha t fits your needs ( Medical Offices are in different locations and may offer different providers and specialties). Consider your personal preferences (a male or female provider, cultural issues and languages spoken). Call the Medical Office for more information (what are the office hours, what is their experience with certain diseases). The Caring for You: Physicians and Locations Directory This directory lists the names of each Medical Office and the PCPs and other providers located in that Medical Office. Copies of the directory are available by contacting Member Services at the phone number listed in the back of this Guide. Please note: To provide you with the best care possible, the total number of patients a PCP can care for is limited. If the PCP you select cannot accept new patients without adversely affecting the availability or quality of S ervices provided, you will need to select someone else. Changing Your KP Hawaii Care Team or PCP Your PCP is responsible for providing and arranging all your medical care. Having a continuous relationship with your PCP allows you the best possible care. If you need to change your P CP, please call our Member Services department at the phone number listed in the back of this Guide, visit our website at www.kp.org, or write to Member Services at: Member Services Kaiser Foundation Health Plan 711 Kapiolani Boulevard Honolulu, HI 96813 Referrals and Prior Authorization In general, benefits are available only for care you receive from or arranged by your PCP, and at a KP facility.

SAMPLE2022 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - GP 5 Chapter 1: Important Information Is the Service or Supply Subject to Prior authorization or Referral? We provide or arrange for Services or supplies dir ectly to you and your Family Dependents through an integrated medical care system. You must receive your health care from KP providers and in KP facilities within our Service Area except for these s ervices: Written and authorized referrals (by a KP provider and/or our Authorizations and Referrals department) Emergency care Out-of-state Urgent C are when traveling Dependent child benefits (as described in this EOC) while out -of-state Other coverage which may have been purchased by your employer Needing a Referral When Seeing a Specialist Our PCPs offer primary medical, pediatric, and OB/GYN care. KP Specialists provide specialty care in areas such as surgery, orthopedics, cardiology, urology, oncology, and dermatology. You r PCP will refer you to a KP Specialist when appropriate. In most cases, you will need a referral to see a KP Specialist for the first time. You r PCP will coordinate and monitor any care you may require from an appropriate KP Specialist. The Referral Process First, your PCP will look for a Physician or facility within Kaiser Permanente to treat you. If a special ty Physician or facility is not available within Kaiser Permanente , your PCP will refer you to a P hysician or facility within the Kaiser Permanente contracted network of providers. When you go to a specialty Physician's office or a facility, you should do both of the following; Present your Kaiser Permanente member ID card. Inform the P hysician or nurse that you have been referred by your Kaiser Permanente PCP. If, in the professional judgment of Medical Group, you require medical or hospital s ervices covered by this EOC which require skills not available within Medical Group or facilities not available in Kaiser Permanente, and Medical Group determines that it w ould be in the best interest for you to obtain care from another source, then, upon written referral by Medical Group to the facility/practitioner designated by Medical Group, and upon you receiving prior written authorization by Kaiser Permanent e, payment , in lieu of medical s ervice benefits hereunder, is made for prescribed medical services within the coverage of this EOC. This may include referral to sources outsi de the Service Area, if deemed Medically N ecessary by a Medical Group P hysician and approved by Medical Group. Your PCP will work with Health Plan and submit an administra tive review request prior to services being rendered by a non -KP or out -of-state physician or facility. As an HMO, referrals are required before accessing service to avoid being responsible for the full cost of the medical s ervices. Deductibles (if applicable) and Cost Shares for referred care are the same as those required for medical s ervices provided by a KP provider. You will only be covered for the medical s ervices listed a s covered under this SAMPLE2022 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - GP 6 Chapter 1: Important Information EOC. If your PCP does not provide or arrange for your services where a referral is required, you are responsib le for the cost of the medical s ervices. Referral Limitations Benefits for referred car e are limited to those cover ed services described in this G uide. Should your provider recommend or perform services that are not covered by this G uide or do not meet payment determination criteria , or should a referral be suspended for quality of care or patient safety reasons, you are responsible for all charges related to the service.

Language assistance is available in languages mandated by the federal Affordable Care Act: - GP 83 Chapter 8: Dispute Resolution Expedited Appeal You may ask that we make an expedited decision on your appeal. The expedited procedure applies to denied requests for services or supplies that you have not yet received, or are currently receiving that are being reduced or terminated. It does not apply to denied requests for payment for services or supplies that you have already received. We'll make an expedited decision in less than 72 hours if we find, or if your P hysician states, that reviewing your appeal under the 30 -day process would seriously jeopar dize your life or health, seriously affect your ability to regain maximum function, or subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment you are requesting. Our decision may take longer if we have to wait for inform ation from you or medical records about your case, but we must make a decision within 72 hours of our receipt of such additional information. You or your P hysician may request an expedited appeal anytime by calling toll free 1-866-233 -2851, or by faxing, writing, or delivering your request to the same address and phone numbers listed for standard appeals. If we determine that your request does not meet the criteria for an expedited appeal, we'll automatically review your written a ppeal under the 30 -day proc ess. Different procedures apply to the following plans: Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage, Kaiser Permanente Medicare Cost, Kaiser Permanente QUEST Integration, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and Kaiser Permanente Individuals and Families. Members on these plans should consult their respective Evidence of Coverage, handbook, or brochure for a description of the claims and appeals procedures that apply to them. External Appeal with an Independent Review Organization Once you've exhausted your internal appeal rights and we've continued to deny coverage or payment as stated in any final adverse benefit determination (ABD) notice that you receive from us, you can request an external appeal with an independent review organization (IRO). The process is available for decisions about medical judgment including one based on our requirements for medical necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of effectiveness of care for a covered service, or our determination that the requested care or service is experimental or investigational. If our appeal decision to deny your request for coverage or payment does not involve medical judgment or medical information, then your request is not eligible for external review . An IRO is independent from Kaiser Permanente and has the authority to overturn our denial of coverage or payment. The IRO that is responsible for conducting your external appeal is based on your KP plan. Our appeal notice will contain information about the IRO that applies to you and instructions on filing an external appeal with the IRO. You may also be able to simultaneously request external review as permitted under federal law in connection wit h an expedited internal appeal. You, your appointed representative, or treating provider (in the case of an expedited review) may file the request for external review by the Hawaii Insurance Commissioner. Requests for external review mus t be submitted to the commissioner within 130 days of receipt of Kaiser Permanente's final adverse decision. Requests for external review may be filed at the address below or by facsimile to 808-587- SAMPLE2022 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - GP 84 Chapter 8: Dispute Resolution 5379. You can reach the Health Insurance Branch of the Ha waii Insurance Division by calling 808-586- 2804. State of Hawaii DCCA Insurance Division - External Appeals 335 Merchant St., 2nd Fl. Honolulu, HI 96813 If the request is determined eligible for external review, the commissioner will assign the case to an IRO approved by the Insurance Division within three business days. Once assigned, the IRO will notify you and Kaiser Permanente within five business days that the external appeal has been opened for review. We must submit to the IRO within five business days of our receipt of the notice from the IRO all the documents and information that we considered during our internal review of your request. You or your authorized representative may submit additional written information to the IRO within five business days of your rece ipt of the notice from the IRO. The IRO will perform the external review by considering the information noted above and the terms of your Kaiser Permanente plan as well as your medical records, any recommendations from your attending health care professional, additional consulting reports from appropriate health care professionals, the medical necessity statute defined under Hawaii law (Hawaii Revised Statutes C hapter 432E -1), the most appropriate practice guidelines, any applicable clinical review criteria developed and used by Kaiser Permanente, and the opinion of the IRO's clinical reviewer. The IRO will not be bound by our initial and appeal adverse decisions in deciding your external appeal. The IRO will send you its decision in writing within 45 days of receiving your external review request. In the event the IRO reverses our adverse decision, we must immediately cover or pay for the service o r item that you are requesting. Expedited External Appeal Expedited review may be requested from the commissioner by you, your authorized representative, or health care provider if processing under the standard timeframe would result in serious jeopardy to your life or health, seriously affect your ability to regain maximum function, or subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment you are requesting. Expedited review may also be requested from the commissioner if your appeal involves admission to a facility for health care services, the availability of car e or a continued stay at a facility for health care services, or a health care service that you are receiving during an Emergency visit before you are discharged from the facility where the Emergency services are being obtained. If your request qualifies for expedited processing at the time you receive our initial ABD or file your internal appeal, you have the right to simultaneously request expedited review with the commissioner. The expedited process does not apply to services or items that you ha ve already received. If the request is determined eligible for expedited external review, the commissioner will immediately assign the case to an IRO approved by the Insurance Division and provide Kaiser Permanente with the SAMPLE2022 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - GP 85 Chapter 8: Dispute Resolution name of the IRO. We must transmit to the IRO in an expeditious manner all the documents and information that we considered during our i nternal review of your request. The IRO will perform the external review by considering the same types of information as noted earlier under the standard process. The IRO will not be bound by our initial and appeal adverse decisions in deciding your external expedited appeal. The IRO will notify you of its decision as expeditiously as your medical condition or the circumstances require, but in no event more than 7 2 hours of its receipt of your eligible expedited request. If its decision was provided verbally at first, then the IRO must send written confirmation within 48 hours of its verbal notice. In the event the IRO reverses our adverse decision, we must immedia tely cover or pay for the service o r item that you are requesting. External Review Requests for Experimental or Investigational Services or Treatments Additional procedures apply to a request involving an experimental or investigational service or treatmen t. You or your authorized representative may make an oral request for expedited review if your treating physician certifies in writing that the service or treatment you are requesting would be significantly less effective if it was not initiated promptly. This certification must be filed promptly with the commissioner following your oral request for review. If you or your authorized representative request expedited review in writing rather than orally, you must include your treating P hysician's written certification with the written request. If your request is determined eligible for expedited review, the commissioner must immediately assign the case to an IRO approved by the Insurance Division and provide Kaiser Permanente with the name of the IRO. We must transmit to the IRO in an expeditious manner all the documents and information that we considered during our i nternal review of your request. Within three business days after being assigned to perform the external review, the IRO will select one or more cl inical reviewers who are experts in the treatment of the condition and knowledgeable about the service or treatment that is the subject of the request. Each clinical reviewer must provide an opinion regarding whether the service or treatment should be covered. This opinion must be provided to the IRO orally or in writing as expeditiously as your condition requires but in no event more than five calendar days after the reviewer was selected. If the opinion was provided orally, then the reviewer must provide a written report to the IRO within 48 hours following the date the oral opinion was provided. The IRO must provide you, your authorized representative, and Kaiser Permanente with its decision either orally or in writing within 48 hours after it receives the opinion. If its decision was provided orally, then the IRO must send its decision in writing within 48 hours of the oral notice. If a majority of the clinical reviewers recommend that the service or treatment should be covered, then the IRO must reverse Kaiser Permanente's adverse decision. If a majority of the reviewers recommend that the service or treatment should not be covered, then the IRO will make a decision to uphold Kaiser Permanente's adverse decision. If the reviewers are evenly split as to whether the service or treatment should be covered, then the IRO must obtain the opinion of another clinical reviewer. The processing timeframes are not extended if the IRO needs to obtain the opi nion of an additional reviewer. For non -expedited requests involving an experimental or investigational service or treatment that are determined eligible for external review, the commissioner has three business days after the eligibility SAMPLE2022 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - GP 86 Chapter 8: Dispute Resolution decision was made to assign the case to an IRO approved by the Insur ance Division and provide Kaiser Permanente with the name of the IRO. We must submit to the IRO within five business days of our receipt of the name of the IRO all the documents and information that we considered during our internal review of your request. You or your authorized representative may submit additional written information to the IRO within five business days of your receipt of the Insurance Division's notice that your case was assigned to an IRO. The IRO must select one or more clinical reviewers within three business days after it was assigned to perform the external review. Each reviewer must provide its opinion to the IRO in writing within 20 days of the date the IRO was assigned to perform the review. The IRO must then provide its written de cision to you, your authorized representative, and Kaiser Permanente within 20 days after the opinions were received. The IRO must decide to reverse or uphold Kaiser Permanente's adverse decision in the same manner discussed earlier based on a majority of the clinical reviewers' recommendations. Procedures Applicable to All Requests for External Review The IRO's decision is binding on you and Kaiser Permanente except for any additional remedies that may be available to you or Kaiser Permanente under applica ble federal or state law. You or your authorized representative may not file a subsequent request for external review involving the same adverse decision for which you already received an external decision. When filing any request for external review, you must include a copy of Kaiser Permanente's final ABD with your request, unless you are seeking simultaneous expedited external review , or we have substantially failed to comply with our internal appeals procedures. You or your authorized representative will also be required to authorize the release of your medical records that need to be reviewed for the external appeal, as well as provide written disclosure that permits the commissioner to perform a conflict of interest evaluation as part of the selection process for an appropriate IRO. You can find forms that meet each requirement on our website at kp.org or by calling Member Services at the phone number listed in the back of this guide. Lastly, a $15 filing fee must be included with the external appeal request. The filing fee will be refunded if Kaiser Permanente's adverse determination is reversed through the external review or the commissioner waives the fee because it poses an undue hardship on you. Your request will be considered incomplete an d the external review delayed if you do not submit all the required information with the request. When you submit a request for external review, the commissioner will inform Kaiser Permanente about your request. We will be responsible for notifying the commissioner and you or your authorized representative in writing whether the request is complete and eligible for external review. If we believe your request is not eligible for external review, you may file an appeal with the commissioner. Our notice of ine ligibility will include information on requesting this appeal. You must exhaust Kaiser Permanente's internal claims and appeals process before you may request external review, except) when external review is permitted to occur simultaneously for requests t hat qualify for expedited review, or we have failed to comply with applicable claims and appeals requirements under federal or state law. You may have certain additional rights if you remain dissatisfied after you have exhausted our internal claims and appeals procedures and external review.

Different procedures apply to the following plans: Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage, Kaiser Permanente QUEST Integration, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Members on these plans should consult their respective Evidence of Coverage, handbook, or brochure for a description of the independent external review procedures that apply to them.

The Services covered in this EOC are subject to coordination of benefits (COB) rules. If you have dental or medical coverage with another health plan or insurance company, we will coordinate benefits with the other coverage in accordance with the current National Association of Insurance commissioners (NAIC) Model Regulation Rules for Coordination of Benefits. Those rules are incorporated into this EOC. If You Are Hospitalized When Coverage Begins If you are hospitalized when your coverage begins, you will be covered under this EOC in accord with your hospital benefit on that same coverage effective date. See the Effective Date of Coverage section in Chapter 6 : Membership Informat ion of this Guide. Medicare If You are Eligible for Medicare as primary coverage If you are eligible for Medicare as primary coverage, your Basic Premiums are based on the assumption that we, or our designee will receive Medicare payments for Medicare- cove red services provided to you eligible for benefits under Medicare Part A or Part B (or both). If you are or become eligible for Medicare as primary coverage, you must comply with all of the following requirements: Enroll in all parts of Medicare for which the Member is eligible and continue that enrollment while a Member. Be enrolled through Member's Group in Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage. Complete and submit all documents necessary for us, or any provider from whom you receive medical services covered by us, to obtain Medicare payments for Medicare- covered services provided to you. If you do not comply with all of these requirements for any reason, even if you are unable to enroll in Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage because you do not meet our eligibility requirements, our insurance plan is not available through your Group, or Senior Advantage is closed to enrollment, we will increase your Group's Basic Premiums to compensate for the lack of Medicare payment and transfer your membership to our SAMPLE2022 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - GP 93 Chapter 9: Coordination of Benefits non- Medicare plan if you are not already so enrolled. However, if your Group does not pay us for the entire Monthly Premiums required for your Family Unit, we will terminate the memberships of everyone in your Family Unit in accord with the Termination of Membership section of this EOC. Member with Medicare and Retirees This plan is not intended for most Medicare beneficiaries and some Groups do not offer coverage to retirees. If, during the term of this EOC, you are or become eligible for Medicare or you retire, you should ask your Group's benefits administrator about your membership options as follows: If a Subscriber retires who is entitled to Medicare Parts A and B, and the Subscriber's Group has a Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage plan for retirees, the Subscriber could enroll in the Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage plan if eligible. If the Subscriber retires and your Group does not offer coverage to retirees, you may be eligible to continue membership as a non- Group Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage Member (all eligibility criteria must be met for the non- Group Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage plan).

However, Members who meet the eligibility requirements for the Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage plan may enroll in Senior Advantage if the plan is available to them.
