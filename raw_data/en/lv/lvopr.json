What Vaccines Should Be Given To Newborns In India There are two main immunization schedules that are followed for child immunization in India: the [National Immunization Schedule (NIS) and the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP)](https://immunifyme.com/blog/learn-the-differences-between-nis-and-iap-immunization-schedules/) immunization schedule. In simple terms, NIS includes the bare minimum vaccines that are necessary for every child in the country to take, whereas the [IAP immunization schedule](https://immunifyme.com/blog/vaccination-schedule-for-2020-21-iap-recommended/) also includes a few additional vaccines that are available in the country but are not yet mandated for all. Know that the government gives all the vaccines recommended in the NIS to all children free of cost. No matter the schedule you choose to follow, Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), Hepatitis B (HB 1), and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV 0) are the 3 main vaccines given to every newborn right after birth. Different doses and vaccines will then follow when your child is 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks old. Some states may also require your child to take additional vaccines based on the prevalent conditions in that area. In other cases, your child may also require other vaccines based on their individual health conditions. It is advisable to clearly consult with your doctor about all the vaccines your child will need so that you can ensure the good health and wellbeing of your child. When Should You Get Your Baby Vaccinated Your baby will get their first shots right after birth.

You can find the ideal timeline of your child's vaccinations in both these immunization schedules. It starts from birth and goes right up till early adolescence. Irrespective of the schedule you choose to follow, just make sure you stick to the timeline as diligently as possible and don't skip out on any of your child's vaccinations.

Why Are Vaccinations Important For A Newborn Baby Getting your newborn vaccinated early on is important because infants and young children are easily susceptible to diseases at a young age.

As your child develops, they will come across many risks and infections that threaten their health and lives. And the best possible solution to protect your child against dangerous diseases is to get them vaccinated and complete their immunization process. The benefit of vaccinating your child also extends to the community as a whole. When enough people are immunized against an infection, the risk of spreading that infection any further also reduces. In the end, investing money in vaccinations is a much better decision than spending money on treatments later.
