We recommend using these detox packs in conjunction with my [10 Day Real Food Detox Program](https://naturallynourished.myshopify.com/products/10-day-detox) which contains my detox protocol, recipes, grocery list and more! Why Naturally Nourished - Potency - Clinical Results - Synergistic Formulas - Third Party Tested - Purity Benefits How detoxification works We can think of the liver like a factory with two shifts. The first shift (Phase I) receives raw materials, processes them, and sends them on to the second shift (Phase II). However, some of the products that pass through the first shift are more harmful than the raw materials they started out as. So the second shift, or Phase II, needs to be functioning optimally in order to quickly get rid of these new, more damaging substances. If the liver's detoxification pathways become overwhelmed, this can lead to an unwanted build-up of toxins in the body. The unique blend of nutrients in the Reset, Restore, Renew Detox packs is specifically designed to support Phase II actions at dominance with 3 capsules of Ultimate Detox, along with one Phase 1 liver-gallbladder supportive blend, and 1 antioxidant blend ensuring Phase II is primed to function efficiently without excessive ramping up Phase I. Highlights Taurine, methionine, MSM, & N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC): sulfur-containing amino acids and compounds, which support the sulfation pathway of detoxification. Think of sulfur as an 'escort' the liver uses to tag certain toxins for removal from the body. This pathway requires sufficient sulfur to function optimally. Glutathione: the body's master antioxidant and free-radical scavenger, aided by glutamine & NAC Calcium-D-Glucarate: supports the glucuronidation pathway and inhibits an enzyme that can undo Phase II detoxification in the colon. Glucuronic acid, which is part of this pathway, is another of the liver's escort molecules that binds to toxins and aids in their excretion. Vitamins C and E are two chief antioxidant vitamins that function synergistically to protect cell membranes and DNA from the damaging effects of toxins and heavy metals. Alpha Lipoic Acid regenerates vitamins C and E to prolong their activity. It also supplies sulfur molecules, which support both phases of liver detoxification. N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) is a foundational precursor to glutathione and helps to boost the detoxification and elimination of mercury. Selenium, L-leucine & NAC help to protect the central nervous system from potential mercury build-up by preventing its absorption and aiding in its excretion. Chelated minerals bound to methionine support the removal of heavy metals and provide important cofactors for phase 2 liver detoxification, where the liver cells add another substance to a toxin to render it less harmful. Grape seed extract and green tea extract are potent antioxidants also known for their ability to protect against heavy metal build-up. Curcumin is not only a powerful antioxidant, but it also enhances the absorption and antioxidant activity of green tea extract. Liver support Methionine, vitamins B12 and B6 support methylation reactions critical for effective detoxification while methionine, vitamin B6 and artichoke help maintain healthy glutathione status.1 Additionally, as vitamin A precursors, the mixed carotenoids in this product, along with artichoke leaf extract, may induce sulfotransferase enzymes needed for detoxification and contains the sulfur-containing amino acid taurine, which is crucial for phase II conjugation. Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) is one of the most well-researched protective herbs for hepatocytes and has even demonstrated the ability to promote the regeneration of liver cells in subjects with hepatitis and other liver disorders, possibly owing to increased hepatocyte protein synthesis.(2,3) Milk thistle has also been shown to protect against liver cell injury from ethanol, acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride or iron overload, and it inhibits the lipoxygenase enzyme, giving it antioxidant and anti-lipid peroxidation effects.(3,4) Additional effects include aiding in bile flow, protecting against fibrosis, reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines, and potentially increasing insulin sensitivity.(5) Inositol is another beneficial compound for the liver. Rodent models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced via a high-fructose diet show that inositol supplementation helps reduce the buildup of liver fat and expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis.6 Rodent models of type 2 diabetes indicate that inositol supplementation (along with inositol hexaphosphate) increases liver reduced glutathione and reduces liver triglyceride accumulation and serum alkaline phosphatase activity while significantly increasing hepatic superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, resulting in the preservation of liver cell integrity and improved antioxidant status.(7) Artichoke (Cynara scolymus) has been found to enhance glutathione peroxidase activity and decrease production of reactive oxygen species. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) treated with artichoke extract showed significant reductions in serum AST and ALT liver enzymes, total cholesterol, LDL-C, systolic blood pressure and blood glucose levels.8 Like milk thistle, artichoke has been shown to have antioxidant, choleretic and hepatoprotective properties and to potentially aid in the regeneration of liver cells.9 Beetroot (Beta vulgaris) is a valuable source of betaine (trimethylglycine), which can act to reduce fatty infiltration and degeneration of the liver, as well as help to thin the bile for improved gallbladder function.10,11 Rodent models of chemically-induced liver injury show that extract attenuates oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in hepatocytes, increases levels of glutathione and other antioxidant enzymes, and attenuates the increase in lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide synthesis and pro-inflammatory cytokines seen in rodents not treated with beetroot.12,13 Research in human liver cell lines in vitro suggests that betanin, a major component of beetroot, is responsible for some of the hepatoprotective effects by activating the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway. How to Use Detox packs can be used within the [10-day Detox protocol](https://naturallynourished.myshopify.com/products/10-day-detox) which is 1 at rise, 1 at rest daily with an add of a third pack on days 5-8. Some people like to extend to a 21 day detox taking a pack at rise and at bed, adding a third pack for 10 days in the middle. Detox packs can be used daily 1 at bed to aid with estrogen dominance, detoxification post gut cleanse, lifestyle toxin factors and support of antioxidant status. You may use the Detox packs to aid in making your body more resilient to lifestyle choices such as alcohol, eating off plan, or getting hair colored, nails done, flying or exposure to other industrialized toxins. In these cases take 1 pack at rise and 1 pack at bed. Remember the Detox pack is an insurance policy not a permission slip to release all control! Note: Occasional use of detox packs when breastfeeding to offset lifestyle toxins such as alcohol, hair coloring, travel, etc. would be appropriate but daily use or doing a 10-day detox would not be recommended for breastfeeding moms. A true detox liberates toxins that would pass through breastmilk and stress baby but if already stressing baby with lifestyle, pulsing in a pack here and there would likely be appropriate, but as always, consult with your healthcare practitioner or midwife.
