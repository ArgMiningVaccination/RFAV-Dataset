Convalescence from mild-to-moderate (MtoM) COVID-19 disease may be supported by integrative medicine strategies. Integrative Medicine (IM) is defined as healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the whole person, including all aspects of lifestyle. Integrative medicine strategies that may support recovery from MtoM COVID-19 are proposed given their clinically studied effects in related conditions. Adoption of an anti-inflammatory diet, supplementation with vitamin D, glutathione, melatonin, Cordyceps, Astragalus and garlic have potential utility. Osteopathic manipulation, Qigong, breathing exercises and aerobic exercise may support pulmonary recovery. Stress reduction, environmental optimization, creative expression and aromatherapy can provide healing support and minimize enduring trauma. These modalities would benefit from clinical trials in people recovering from COVID-19 infection. |Original language||English (US)| |Pages (from-to)||140-148| |Number of pages||9| |Journal| Keywords - Aromatherapy - COVID-19 - Creative expression - Diet - Exercise - Immune - Integrative medicine - Osteopathic manipulation - Qigong - Stress reduction - Supplements ASJC Scopus subject areas - Analysis - Nursing(all) - Chiropractics - Complementary and alternative medicine "}
