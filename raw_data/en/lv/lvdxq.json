For a long time, the ability of immune cells to attack invading disease organisms was considered purely physical, even though the mechanism was not completely understood. Then, in the '80s it was discovered that the immune system is highly intelligent; it became known as \"a floating brain\" because of the ability of immune cells to participate in the chemical messages sent by the brain throughout the body. This means that your thoughts, moods, sensations, and expectations are transmitted to your immune cells. When you meditate, these messages change in important ways. Consider these research findings that offer very good news for anyone who mediates. These findings bring into focus a clear message: Your response to potential illness, as managed by the immune system, improves with meditation. This is in keeping with another strong message. Being susceptible to chronic disorders like type-2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and high blood pressure, conditions that are not the result of invading microbes, is also reduced through meditation. The entire mind-body system is brought into a natural state of balance, the key to what I've called the higher health. Medical science proceeds through findings that provide reliable data, and we actively support such research at the Chopra Center. But your lifestyle isn't a scientific experiment, of course, so what kind of program can you adopt that focuses specifically on preventing illness, especially in winter? Enhance these basic steps by following seasonal [Ayurvedic recommendations](http://www.chopra.com/ccl/sections/wellness), too. The ancient wisdom of Ayurveda is especially appropriate when looking at how foods, herbs, massage, and other applications lead to perfect balance. Yet, at the very core is meditation\u2014the most important and powerful way to strengthen every aspect of the mind-body connection. Are you ready to experience the healthiest version of yourself?
