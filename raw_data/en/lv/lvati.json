Romero, MD, Secretary of Health If You Choose Not to R eceive the MMR Vaccine, Understand the Risks and Responsibilities. If you choose to reject the MMR vaccine, there can be risks. Be aware: Measles, mumps, and rubella are vaccine-preventable diseases th at can strike at any time in the U.S., because all of these di seases still circulate either in the U.S. or elsewhere in the world. Illnesses that result from these diseases, as well as the other vaccine-preventable diseases, can range from mild to severe and life-threatening. In most cases, there is no way to know beforehand if a person will get a mild or serious case. When there is a vaccine-preventable disease in your community: It may not be too late to ge t protection by getting vaccinated. If there are cases (or, in some circumstances, a single case) of measles, mumps, or rubella in your community, the student may be excluded from the college or university or from organized activities, such as spor ts, until the outbreak is over. Your college or university will tell you when it is safe for an unvaccinated student to return. Unvaccinated students must be prepared to st ay home for several da ys and up to several weeks. Why vaccinate? Vaccines save lives and protect against the spread of disease. Choosing not to immunize puts you/your child at risk. You/Your child could catch a disease that is dangerous or deadly. Getting vaccinated is much better than getting the disease. Vaccines work. They have kept people hea lthy and have saved millions of lives for more than 50 years. Most childhood vaccines are 90 to 99 percen t effective in preventing disease. And if a vaccinated person does get the disease, the sympto ms are usually less serious than in a person who hasn't been vaccinated. Vaccines are safe. All vaccines used in the U.S. mu st be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA will not let a vacc ine be given unless it has been proven to be safe and to work well in people. The results ar e reviewed again by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Amer ican Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians before a vaccine is officially recommended to be given to children. Also, the FDA monitors where and how vaccines are made. Th e places where vaccines are made must be licensed. They are regularly inspected and each vaccin e lot is safety-tested. Page 2 of 6 What if you don't vaccinate your child/yourself? You/Your child will be left at risk of catch ing the disease. Vaccines were developed to protect people from dangerous and often fatal diseases. Vaccines are safe and effective, and the vaccine-preventable dis eases are still a threat. You/Your child will be an infectious disease threat to others. Persons who are not vaccinated can readily transmit vaccine-preventable di seases to others in their community. oUnvaccinated persons can pass diseases on to babies who are too young to be fully vaccinated. oUnvaccinated persons pose a threat to childr en and adults who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. This includes people with leukemia and other cancers, immune system problems, and people receiving treatment or medications that suppress their immune system. oUnvaccinated persons can infect the small pe rcentage of persons who get vaccinated but do not reach full protection from a vaccine due to medical reasons. You/Your child may have to be excluded from college or university. During disease outbreaks, unvaccinated students may be excluded from college or university until theoutbreak is over. Excluding unvaccinated students from college or university is for their ownprotection and the protection of others. Outbreaks may last for several da ys to several weeks. Therefore, exclusion can be a hardship for the student. Your vaccination decision affects not only your health or the health of your child, but also all of your family, friends and their families, and your community.
