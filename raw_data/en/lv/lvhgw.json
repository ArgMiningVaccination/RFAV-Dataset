{"title": "Reduction of Pre-Harvest Salmonella Enterica Subspecies Enterica Serovar Enteritidis in Poultry", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis I) is perceived as an expanding pandemic and a significant threat to the food safety and human health worldwide. In the majority of the human foodborne cases of S. Enteritidis, the consumption of contaminated eggs or egg products is implicated as the source of infection . Invasive strains of S. Enteritidis silently infect adult chickens and contaminate eggs before shells are formed, causing egg products to be considered a major source of infection to humans. Our long-term goal is to develop an effective control of S. Enteritidis in poultry in order to reduce the S. Enteritidis foodborne infections associated with contaminated eggs and to improve pre-harvest food safety and the United States agriculture sustainability.", "sitename": null, "date": "2004-12-15", "cleaned_text": "Progress 12/15/04 to 12/14/08 Outputs OUTPUTS: sefA gene of S. Enteritidis was cloned into temperature-inducible expression vector and transformed into E. coli. Analysed sefA gene expression by SDS-PAGE and western blot with anti-sefA polyclonal antibodies.Three different experiments were conducted:.A SE challenge model was examined to determine optimum dose of S. Enteritidis to be given to birds at 15 and 35 days of age to induce colonization. 2.Examined the survival E.coli clone expressing sefA gene in the intestinal tract of chickens and Immune response to it 3.Protection against S. Enteritidis challenge in chickens post administration of E.coli clone expressing sefA gene was examined. The results of the methods used were disseminated in various professional scientific meetings. The usefulness of this clone in protection of chickens against SE infection was presented to the poultry industry. PARTICIPANTS: Dr. K. V. Nagaraja Principal investigator Vanessa C.

TARGET AUDIENCES: Delivered science-based knowledge particulary methods developed and uses of them to Professional communities through formal or informal presentations in conferences PROJECT MODIFICATIONS: Not relevant to this project. Impacts Recombinant strain containing sefA gene of S. Enteritidis was antigenically and immunologically active in vitro and in vivo. SefA-specific Ig A was detected in bile and intestinal secretions of chickens exposed to this clone. Reduction in the recovery of S. Enteritidis was noticed in birds treated twice with recombinant strain. Improvements in the dose management is suggested. asd E. coli + mpLEX asd/nirB/sefABCD construct was successful at Gene expression and antigen presentation,Colonization of intestinal tract of chickens and Eliciting SEF14-specific Ig G and Ig A immune response.

Progress 12/15/05 to 12/15/06 Outputs The overall goal of this research was to improve control of S. Enteritidis in poultry by focusing on the molecular characterization of S. Enteritidis PT 4 strains and the development of a vaccine strain based on the SEF14 fimbria to elicit protection against S. Enteritidis in chickens. Two recombinant strains based on the sefA and sefABCD fimbrial genes, respectively were successfully constructed and their abilities to colonize intestinal tract and to induce specific immune response were demonstrated. Results of the evaluation of sefA strain suggested a partial protection of internal organs in treated birds against a challenge with S. Enteritidis. Results showed that sefABCD strain elicited specific immune response and a 100-fold reduction in the recovery of S. Enteritidis challenge from chicken ceca. Impacts urrently available live attenuated and killed vaccines against S. Enteritidis have shown limited reduction in the colonization of S. Enteritidis in internal organs, intestines and cecum, providing incomplete protection to birds. As a result, there is an urgent need for a successful vaccine to protect ensure S. Enteritidis-free food products and, thus, reduce foodborne illnesses associated with the consumption of contaminated eggs and poultry products. Two live recombinant vaccine strains based on the sefA and sefABCD fimbrial genes, respectively, were developed and the protection elicited by the strains was evaluated in chickens against S. Enteritidis infection.Both the constructs have a great potential for their use in the poultry industry Publications - Vanessa C.Lopes.,B.T.Velayudhan,D.A.Halvorson and K.V. Nagaraja.

Progress 12/15/04 to 12/14/05 Outputs The objective of this project is to develop a recombinant vaccine based on the SEF14 fimbrial protein of S. Enteritidis in order to protect chickens against S. Enteritidis colonization. The sefA gene, which encodes the major protein of the SEF14 fimbriae, was cloned into a temperature-sensitive expression vector and transformed into a non-pathogenic avian strain of Escherichia coli. In a preliminary study, the recombinant strain was administered to 1-day old chickens to assess its ability to colonize intestines and to elicit antibodies in chickens against SEF14 fimbrial protein. Preliminary evaluation of the use of sefA fimbrial gene for eliciting immune response against Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis in chickens was done. A challenge model in chickens was developed to determine the minimum dose of S. Enteritidis (SE436 strain) to be administered to colonize chickens of 15 and 35 days of age. In a later animal experiment, the sefA recombinant strain was orally administered to 1-day old chickens to evaluate protection elicited against colonization with a pathogenic strain of S. Enteritidis. Results showed that sefA-based recombinant strain was capable of eliciting local IgA immune response in bile and intestines. Further work is in progress. Impacts The recombinant vaccine against Salmonella enteritidis infection in poultry can have significant impact on the reduction of foodborne infection in humans. Publications - Vanessa C.
