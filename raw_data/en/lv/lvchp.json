I love being involved in clinical and translational research as I believe that improved understanding the biology of cancers is essential to developing new and better therapies for patients and will result in more children and young adults being cured. The privilege of caring for patients and families during challenging medical diagnoses is one of the aspects that drew me to the field of pediatric hematology/oncology and continues to be one of the best parts of my job.\" - Dr. Tarlock is a clinician at Seattle Children's Hospital, an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine and holds a Research Affiliate at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Dr. Tarlock is an active member of Myeloid Disease Committee of the Children's Oncology Group (COG). She is also an active member of the New Agents Committee. She was the chair of one COG trial for children with relapsed/refractory AML and has another trial in development. Dr. Tarlock is active in research efforts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with a focus on development of novel therapies. She is also active in efforts for pediatric global oncology including serving on the Plenum Committee of the Children's International Consortium on Acute Leukemia, Vice-Chair for Health Volunteers Overseas, and serves as an associate faculty member at the Uganda Cancer Institute in Kampala, Uganda. - - Dr. Tarlock is an incredible doctor and I credit her for saving my son's life. He arrived at Seattle Children's in critical condition at three weeks old after doctors in Alaska told us they could not do anything for him. He is now 13 months old and 4.5 months post bone marrow transplant. Dr. Tarlock was the first doctor we met on our son's long journey to treat his leukemia and she gave us the first plan for his treatment but equally as important, she gave us hope. Thank you, Dr. Tarlock! - Dr. Tarlock is the best doctor I have met so far in the 18 years I have lived in Seattle. She is highly knowledgeable, very smart, very responsible, trustworthy and also a very caring person. She gave the best treatment to my son suffering from Leukemia at every stage of his treatment. I will be ever grateful to her for saving his life and giving our family a new beginning. - A wonderful provider! She took care of our 4 year old son when he was very ill on the Hem/Onc floor. We really loved her approach to treating kids. We greatly appreciated her knowledge, care, and compassion. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date Young Investigator, Myeloid Disease Committee Children's Oncology Group 2015 Alberta Corkery Fellowship Travel Award American Society of Hematology Abstract Achievement Award Outstanding Pediatric Resident Award Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Outstanding Presentation Award Seattle Children's Hospital Fellow Research Day Alpha Omega Alpha Medical Honor Society Pediatric Clerkship Award Chicago Medical School - Other Publications - Pikman Y, Tasian SK, Sulis ML, Stevenson K, Blonquist TM, Apsel Winger B, Cooper TM, Pauly M, Maloney Gennarini L, Adhav AA, Clinton CM, Ocasio-Martinez N, Gotti G, Li Y, Lin S, Imamovic WA, Garrido Ruiz Jacobson MP, Dharia NV, Su A, Robichaud AL, Saur Conway A, Tarlock K, Stieglitz E, Place AE, Puissant A, Hunger SP, Kim AS, Lindeman NI, Gore L, Janeway KA, Silverman LB, Tyner JW, Harris MH, Loh ML, Stegmaier KMatched Targeted Therapy for Pediatric Patients with Relapsed, Refractory or High-risk Leukemias: A Report from the LEAP Consortium. 33563661 Cancer discovery, 2021 Feb 9 - Tarlock K, Alonzo T, Wang YC, Gerbing RB, JL, Maxson JE, Meshinchi SPrognostic impact of CSF3R mutations in favorable risk childhood acute myeloid leukemia. 32187354 Blood, 2020 Apr 30 : 135(18)1603-1606 PMCID:PMC7193184 - Gardner RA, Ceppi F, Rivers J, Annesley C, Summers C, Taraseviciute A, Gust J, Leger KJ, Tarlock K, Cooper TM, Finney OC, Brakke H, Li DH, Park JR, Jensen MCPreemptive mitigation of CD19 CAR T-cell cytokine release syndrome without attenuation of antileukemic efficacy. 31697826 Blood, 2019 Dec 12 : PMCID:PMC6908832 - Tarlock K, Alonzo TA, Wang Ries R, Loken MR, L, Hylkema T, Joaquin J, Sarukkai L, Raimondi SC, Hirsch B, Sung L, Aplenc R, Bernstein I, Gamis AS, Meshinchi S, Pollard JAFunctional Properties of KIT Mutations Are Associated with Differential Clinical Outcomes and Response to Targeted Therapeutics in CBF Acute Myeloid Leukemia. 31182436 Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, 2019 Aug 15 : 25(16)5038-5048 PMCID:PMC6754181 - McNeil MJ, Parisi MT, T, Tarlock KClinical and Radiographic Response of Extramedullary Leukemia in Patients Treated With Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin. 29734213 Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology, 2019 April : 41(3)e174-e176 - Gillette TB, Cabrera MT, Tarlock K, Murphy KM, Stacey Case Report.

Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA - Clinical Interests - Pediatric leukemias and lymphomas, high risk leukemias, targeted therapies, global health in Pediatric hematology/oncology - Research Description - My research is focused on the identification of genomic lesions in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that affects how they respond to current therapies. In addition, I am focused on the identification novel therapeutic targets and novel therapies, including immunotherapies, for children for whom current therapies are inadequate. I am actively engaged in the development of early phase clinical trials to evaluate targeted therapies in children with AML. I also believe that children all over the world should have equal opportunity to the best care. I am actively engaged in several research efforts in improving care for children with leukemia in resource limited settings. This research includes the development of a protocol for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for use in low- and middle-income countries as well as research to understand the biology of children and adults with ALL and AML in sub Saharan Africa.
