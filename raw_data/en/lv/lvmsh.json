From bodybuilders and homeopaths to male health experts and porn stars, one might get the idea that there's nothing this little phytoandrogen can't do. In this article, we'll take a closer look at pine pollen while having a detailed discussion about a strategy called \"megadosing.\" What is Pine Pollen? We've actually discussed Pine Pollen several times in the past. Still, it's worth going over the basics again so that you can properly frame the upcoming conversation. To put it simply, pine pollen is the male component of pine tree reproduction. This is a process that involves two types of pine cones: the hard and brittle \"female\" cone and the softer, smaller \"male cones.\" The latter are constructed this way because they contain millions of powdery particles. During the tree's reproductive season, these particles, which we call pollen, are released in hopes they will encounter a female pine cone, germinate, and start growing a new tree. It's a familiar - if haphazard - process. But, as you'll see, pine pollen takes on a whole new meaning when you consider it from a food perspective. Beat ED Without Drugs Get Rock Hard Steel On Demand, Naturally! Inside you will learn: (Free Instant Download) Pine Pollen is Extremely Potent People have been \"extracting\" pine pollen for centuries, and the process has changed very little in that time. One only needs to remove the mature male cones and shake or grind them to get piles of yellow pollen. Why would you want it? Well, because this substance is actually teeming with minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, and - of course - hormones. Remember, these tiny pollen particles carry everything needed to make a 100+ foot pine tree grow. It would make sense that they are very, very potent. And so they are! With over 200 various bioactive nutrients, pine pollen is among the most [highly-concentrated foodstuffs](https://morningsteel.com/pine-pollen-nutrition/) on the planet. Best of all, humans can benefit from this chemical cocktail in a variety of ways. Pine Pollen Megadose Benefits In terms of nutritional makeup, pine pollen can easily compete with the most well-known superfoods- right up there with acai berry, ginger, and turmeric. So why isn't the Whole Foods crowd devouring this supplement by the spoonful? The truth is: some of them are. But before we get into discussions about dosing, cycling, and megadosing, let's spend some time on the overwhelming benefits of pine pollen and how they relate to male sexual health. Pine Pollen Provides Vital Hormonal Support Throughout this article, you need to remain focused on what pine pollen is. Like sperm for animals, this is the plant equivalent of a \"reproductive delivery system.\" And just what does it deliver? Hormones. Lots of them. And since it's the \"male\" side of the reproductive equation, these hormones are [predominantly testosterone](https://morningsteel.com/pine-pollen-testosterone/), DHEA, and androsterone. Though our bodies can tell the difference between plant and human hormones, they are still highly beneficial to us. From supporting our testosterone production and regulating estrogen levels to ensuring overall hormonal balance, pine pollen can pretty much do it all. Obviously, proper hormone balance is key to a healthy sex life (especially for men over 40). That's just one reason why the demand for pine pollen has gone through the roof in the past decade or so. Pine Pollen Megadose Helps the Immune System Pine pollen is loaded with vitamins, especially Vitamin C. In fact, on average, high-quality pine pollen has more Vitamin C than an orange. You'll also find ample amounts of Vitamins B1, E, and B3. This is a big reason why Pine Pollen is so beneficial to our immune system and our natural detoxification process. It's no big secret that poor immune system function puts serious strain on your body. Essentially, it means that your system is either dealing with illness or actively working to prevent one. This not only puts sexual function lower on the to-do list, but it also increases the chance of inflammation and other sex-hindering problems. Pine Pollen Improves Cognitive Function and Reduces Depression Pine pollen is rich in a wide variety of amino acids, including a protein \"building block\" called phenylalanine. This particular element sees a lot of work in the brain, where it stimulates dopamine levels, builds and rebuilds neurotransmitters, and more. It's even been shown in some cases to help alleviate [depression symptoms. ](https://morningsteel.com/depression-and-erectile-dysfunction/) As you should know by now, depression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges can drastically hinder sexual health. To make matters worse, many of the pharmaceutical cures for these conditions have similar sexual side effects, drastically reducing desire and contributing to the onset of penile and [testicular atrophy. ](https://morningsteel.com/is-testicular-atrophy-from-alcohol-reversible/) Pine Pollen Protects the Cardiovascular System Of the many effects pine pollen has, one of the most important is its [ability to lower blood pressure.](https://morningsteel.com/does-pine-pollen-lower-blood-pressure/) As most men over 30 already know, elevated blood pressure puts significant strain on your cardiovascular system, including your arteries and veins. As these vessels scar and harden, it gets more and more difficult for your heart to pump blood through the narrowing passageways. When this happens, guess what doesn't get harder? After all, your penis needs a [healthy supply of blood](https://morningsteel.com/how-to-boost-nitric-oxide-naturally/) to get and maintain an erection. However, even if you ignore the sexual component, a lack of blood flow to your penis and testicles can cause the tissues to dry up, atrophy, and lose much of their function. Reduces Cholesterol and Boost Your Metabolism When your arteries aren't shrinking from high blood pressure, they're becoming clogged with gunk that ends up having essentially the same effect. This is one of the many reasons why so many older, overweight men struggle with ED. In fact, the more you let that LDL (also known as bad cholesterol) build up, the worse it can be for your health Fortunately, pine pollen's many nutritional benefits include a startling ability to cut LDL cholesterol by as much as 45%. This is coupled with a significant boost in metabolism, which can help you burn calories faster than you would otherwise. So if you're at all concerned about inner (or outer) fat, pine pollen megadose can help. Pine Pollen Megadose Increases Energy and Vitality As we age, our energy levels tend to decrease significantly. This isn't helped much by our [plummeting testosterone levels](https://morningsteel.com/foods-decrease-testosterone/) and the various environmental factors our bodies are forced to contend with. As vitality diminishes, we start to lose muscle mass, strength, and flexibility. Worst of all, your sex life can quickly become a veritable desert. The good news is that pine pollen is so packed with plant hormones, vitamins, and other goodies, that it can significantly [boost your physical and mental wellness.](https://morningsteel.com/pine-pollen-benefits-for-men/) Indeed, multiple [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8318335/) indicate that pine pollen has anti-fatigue properties, which can go a long way towards putting some pep back in your step. Supports a Healthy Inflammation Response Inflammation is your body's natural response to something being \"not quite right.\" And while it's perfectly noticeable when your eye swells shut or your wrist blows up like a balloon, it can be darn near impossible to recognize internal inflammations. To make matters worse, chronic, long-term inflammation (regardless of the cause) has been linked to - you guessed it - ED. If you're starting to recognize the pattern here, you can probably guess that reducing inflammation is one of pine pollen's many benefits. In fact, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6017409/) of cultured cells in rodents noticed some powerful antioxidant reactions. This brings us to one of the biggest benefits on our list... Super Rich in Antioxidants Aside from being one of the biggest marketing buzzwords in history, antioxidants are compounds that can either slow or completely stop free radicals from damaging your cells. You can find them in a lot of superfoods, especially veggies and fruits. However, when it comes to dropping an antioxidant bomb on your system, there's nothing quite like a megadose of pine pollen. Among the biggest antioxidants present in pine pollen are glutathione and superoxide dismutase. These have been shown in study after [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ptr.2525) to help protect against heart disease (see above), metabolic disorders, and age-related problems. So, if you're worried that free radicals might put the kibosh on your health, you have a strong ally in pine pollen. Pine Pollen Megadose Decreases DNA Mutation You've probably heard stories of how many modern products contain chemicals that can alter our DNA. While some might dismiss these as tall tales, there is plenty of science to back these claims up. And these aren't just air pollutants and carcinogens, mind you. Overexposure to cadmium, arsenic, methylmercury, and some plastics can have very toxic effects on your body. In keeping with its antioxidant properties, pine pollen megadose can help prevent the growth of cancerous tumors. In men, it can also help [lower estradiol levels](https://morningsteel.com/does-pine-pollen-increase-estrogen/) (which can contribute to prostate cancer). On a broader level, regular doses of pine pollen help your body fight off the chemical invaders that can lead to problems down the line. Pine Pollen's Insane Nutritional Makeup As you'll see in a moment, looking at pine pollen's nutritional information is like looking over an order form for your local GNC. This potent little powder has much of what you need to maintain optimum health, regardless of your age. To show you just how serious we are, we've included a small sampling of what you might find in a 3-gram serving (about a tablespoon) of high-quality pine pollen. Enough Amino Acids to Choke a Camel Amino acids are necessary to power our bodies with energy, regulate digestion, and keep our immune systems operating at full bore. However, not all of these helpful little molecules can be made \"in-house,\" so to speak. That means we need to get them from our diets. With pine pollen, you can get some of the hardest-to-come-by amino acids in the world. Some of the most notable examples include Alanine, A of Vitamins and Minerals than Your Average Multivitamin Multivitamins are one of the most hotly-contested medical supplements in the world. Depending on who you're asking, they're either necessary to keep you alive or they do absolutely nothing. But here's what people agree on: the best way to get vitamins is to get them through your diet. So, if you're eating a tablespoon of pine pollen every day, you're giving your body tons of vitamins and minerals in the most easily-digestible way possible. Which vitamins, you ask? Well, pine pollen contains ample amounts of Vitamin A, Bs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9, Vitamin E, [Vitamin D](https://morningsteel.com/vitamin-d-erections/), Potassium, Calcium, Phosphorus, Iron, Zinc, Selenium, and Manganese. But you also get valuable nutrients like oleic acid, which prevents heart disease, polyphenols, which are essentially concentrated antioxidants, and resveratrol, which has strong anti-inflammatory effects. To put it quite simply: pine pollen has what you need and makes it easy for you to get. Contains Phytoandrogens: We scratched the surface on this back in our \"benefits\" section but now is the time to really get into the ways pine pollen megadose can benefit you hormonally. Like we said, pine pollen contains very high levels of phytoandrogens. If you're not up on your Latin, the term \"phyto\" means \"deriving from plants,\" whereas the word \"androgen\" refers to male sex hormones. And while the plant hormone version of testosterone, DHEA, and androsterone aren't exactly the same as our human hormones, our bodies can use them just the same. Think of it like putting Stevia into your coffee instead of sugar. By taking phytoestrogens, you can support your T levels without signaling to your testicles that your testosterone is going up. For instance, if you're dealing with higher-than-usual estrogen levels, you can regain hormonal balance much faster than you might with traditional supplementation. Since your testosterone-producing glands won't be aware of this covert operation, it won't lower output in response to your supplements. Pine Pollen Megadose is NOT a \"Steroid\" The primary goal of taking phytoandrogens is to combat the many forms of estrogen ( [called xeno-estrogens](https://morningsteel.com/xenoestrogens-destroy-erections/)) that we encounter throughout our daily lives. From water to plastics to pesticides and medications, these pesky little foreign hormones bind to our estrogen receptors and wreak all sorts of havoc on our bodies. And while some men unwisely attempt to resist this with steroids, pine pollen megadose is a much safer, side-effect-free method of doing the same thing. So when we talk about plant steroids, keep in mind that we're not referring to those ball-shrinking synthetics you get from the shady guy at the gym. Instead, we're talking about: Brassinosteroids - If you haven't heard of these fairly-unpronounceable plant hormones yet, just give it a bit of time. In recent years, brassinosteroids have been recognized for having strong anti-cancer potential and powerful xenobiotic properties. Pine pollen contains some 30 different kinds, and they have proven extremely helpful in removing xenoestrogens through the liver. Gibberellins - These are plant hormones designed to regulate the various developmental processes of the plant. So, after the initial fertilization, these kick in to handle germination, dormancy, flowering, etc., for the rest of the plant life cycle. Of course, we're more concerned about the way they bind with male hormone receptors to [stimulate androgen production. ](https://morningsteel.com/how-to-increase-androgen-receptor-sensitivity-density/) Glutathione - This is considered the main antioxidant present in the human body. Of the many roles it plays, one of its most important jobs is to detox hormones that are harmful or simply aren't behaving as they should. Glutathione also plays a role in the synthesis of progesterone and testosterone, with the former aiding in libido and mood regulation. The \"What\" and \"Why\" of Pine Pollen Megadosing OK, so you're convinced that pine pollen has what it takes to benefit you. Do you just open the container and start chugging it? Will taking it intravenously speed up the effects? No and no. In fact, how much pine pollen you should take (and how often you should take it) will vary based on a lot of factors. Still, you can basically break this down into two specific categories: Dosing and \"Megadosing.\" Dosing Pine Pollen Every legitimate manufacturer of pine pollen will have a recommended dosage on their packaging. Also, pine pollen can come in either powdered or capsule form, adding an extra layer of variation. Typically, with capsules of .43 grams, you'll want to take three capsules. For powder, the average recommended dose is \u00bd to 1 teaspoon. That said, it's important to monitor yourself as you take pine pollen to ensure you aren't experiencing any side effects. Most importantly, you want to look for itchy eyes, a runny nose, sneezing, or coughing, as this may indicate an allergic reaction. Also, keep an eye out for testosterone-related reactions like trouble sleeping, increased acne, and aggressive behavior. Megadosing Pine Pollen Based on the nutrient levels we've discussed so far, it's no surprise that many men prefer to take a \"more is more\" approach to dosing pine pollen. This is known as \"pine pollen megadosing,\" and it's the supplement equivalent of strapping a jetpack to your back. Of course, with great power comes great responsibility. That's why you need to make sure you're megadose doesn't become a mega problem. If you're megadosing pine pollen capsules, you'll want to aim for somewhere between 5g and 10g of the herb a day. That means that if you're using the same .43 gram capsules, this would involve taking between 11 and 22 pills per dose. Of course, it seems like a lot less when you use the powder, as you'll only need to choke down about 1.5 to 3 tablespoons per day to see the same effects. Tips for Pine Pollen Megadosing If you're taking your pine pollen in powdered form, mix with liquid, then let some of the product dissolve in your mouth before swallowing. This will introduce the nutrients into your bloodstream much faster, resulting in a more noticeable effect. You should make sure you're evaluating how you feel after each dose. You can always try taking your pine pollen with food, blending it in a smoothie and altering the amount of liquid as needed. Consuming a bit of fat along with the herb will help increase absorption of the fat soluble alkaloids and nutrients in the supplement. What works for me is blending the pine pollen megadose into my morning smoothie, which contains fat from [the milk.](https://morningsteel.com/milk-and-testosterone/) My preference is to dose first thing in the morning to take advantage of the energy, motivation and drive the herb brings on. Why You Should Cycle Megadose Pine Pollen Natural or not, you never want your body to get used to a supplement. So, in order to keep your system guessing, you should alternate how often you're taking it - especially if you're megadosing. The main reason for this is tolerance. As anyone who's ever had a coffee addiction will tell you, eventually, your body gets used to your regular dosage. After that, it needs more and more to get the \" [beneficial\" effects of pine pollen.](https://morningsteel.com/pine-pollen-benefits-for-men/) If you're already megadosing pine pollen, you don't want to get to the point where you need even more just to see results. How to Cycle Pine Pollen I personally megadose pine pollen once a week, on days [when sex](https://morningsteel.com/testosterone-and-sex/) is most likely to happen. I'm a very aggressive cycler and rarely take any one particular supplement more often than once a week in order to avoid tolerance issues. [You can read about my cycling protocol here.](https://morningsteel.com/erection-supplements/) That said, most pine pollen suppliers recommend the 5-2 method where you dose for five days, and then take two days off. Then, after five weeks of supplementation you take two weeks off. Some men swear by this 5-2 method, but the only protocol that has worked for me long term has been the once a week megadose. If you decide to try 5-2 dosing and then notice that the supplement stops delivering the goods after several consecutive doses, cycle off for a while. Then when you cycle back on, stick with the one megadose per week to avoid building up tolerance. Pine Pollen Megadose Conclusion If you take any one thing away from this article, it should be that Pine Pollen is more than just another potent testosterone booster. Its special plant hormones and nutrients make it uniquely suited to coaxing the very best out of your body without letting your testicles get wind of what you're doing. Provided you take precautions, cycle with care, and - most importantly - find a reliable and natural source, you'll begin noticing the difference in no time. If you're ready to give megadosing a try you can see the product I've been using myself since "}
