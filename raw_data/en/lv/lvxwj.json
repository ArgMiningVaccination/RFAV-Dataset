You can clean dishwasher-safe glasses in a [glass washer](/13265/glass-washer-machines.html), which is designed to wash glasses in the most efficient manner possible. They can usually wash up to 2,000 glasses per hour and one cycle takes about 90 seconds to complete. Use the following steps as a guide for washing your glassware in a glass washer: Using a [glass washing machine](/45605/glass-washing-polishing-machines.html) is ideal for cleaning glasses that aren't dishwasher safe.

Whether you choose an [electric glass washing machine](/45605/glass-washing-polishing-machines.html?filter=power-type:electric) or a [manual option](/45605/glass-washing-polishing-machines.html?filter=power-type:manual), these machines offer increased efficiency over cleaning glassware by hand.

Use the following steps as a guide for washing your drinking glasses by hand: For high-end establishments, knowing how to clean [crystal glassware](/3749/wine-glasses.html?filter=material:crystal) can prevent significant recurring costs. Crystal glasses are far more delicate than their counterparts, so all crystal glasses should be hand-washed unless otherwise noted. This technique helps to cut down on the damage done by dishwashers and tough detergents. Follow these steps when washing crystal: Line a sink with a dish towel or soft cloth and fill it with warm water. The soft lining helps to prevent cracks or breaks. Use a mild detergent to wash out the glasses one at a time. Rinse with a vinegar-water solution and sanitize. The vinegar-water solution can help remove existing water spots and prevent future blotches. Unlike other glassware, crystal frequently requires an extra step before customers use it. Many people [choose crystal for the sparkle and clarity of the glass](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/3476/crystal-vs-glass.html), so finding spots or a cloudy film on crystal is off-putting. Therefore, polishing crystal glassware guarantees that the best qualities of your crystal remain prevalent. Here are a few ways to shine crystal to perfection and cut down on the spots. First, restore shine by making a paste that includes \u00bd teaspoon of both salt and white vinegar. Carefully apply the paste and let sit for 10 minutes. Rinse and polish with a fine polishing microfiber cloth or an [electric glass polisher](/45605/glass-washing-polishing-machines.html?filter=type:glass-polishers). A second way to reduce smudges on crystal is by eliminating the effects of hard water. Sometimes when glasses are not dried correctly, water can leave behind spots. This effect also happens when the water you're using to wash is \"hard,\" and letting water sit in a crystal glass allows mineral deposits and hard water to build up. This also happens when glassware is air-dried. To combat this effect, use a [fine-polishing microfiber cloth](/3351/microfiber-cloths-mitts.html) to wipe away any excess smudges. Properly drying glasses is a vital part of glassware upkeep. It is best to dry glasses with a linen towel or a microfiber cloth immediately after cleaning them. During this process, note the thickness of the glass to avoid applying too much pressure and damaging the glass. Avoid touching the inside of the glass bowl while drying it to ensure your fingers do not smudge it or leave prints. Use the following steps when drying glassware: Make sure you hold the glass by the bowl. Holding the glass by the stem or base could result in breakage, so it is best to avoid grabbing the glass at either of these points. Use the cloth to gently dry the glass. Do not use excessive pressure. Run the cloth along the outside of the glass as the final step to clean away fingerprints. There is nothing worse than the sound of glass shattering in a restaurant, especially during the lunch or dinner rush. Broken or chipped glasses can compromise the safety of workers and guests, and replacing damaged glasses can prove expensive over time. Employees also must take the time to clean up the glass, which pulls them out of service. Knowing how to handle glassware reduces the possibility of broken glasses and saves time and money. Below are a few specific areas where you can help lower the chance of breaking glasses. Employees regularly transport glasses in a restaurant, traveling from the dish area to tables and back again. There are several dollies, racks, and trays that help to move glassware quickly and safely. Using glassware racks and non-skid trays allows servers to transport multiple glasses at once.
