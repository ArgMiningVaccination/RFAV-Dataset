This includes Chinese herbal medicine. What is chinese herbal medicine? Chinese herbal medicine is one of the main treatment methods within traditional Chinese medicine. Its written history stretches back more than 2,500 years and its practice is far older than that. Although [Acupuncture](https://activemedhealth.com/acupuncture-encinitas/) was the first Chinese modality to gain wide acceptance in the West, Chinese herbal medicine is quickly establishing itself as one of the most popular and effective alternative therapies. Now, this branch of traditional Eastern medicine is also popular in Poway, Escondido, Encinitas, and the surrounding areas. How are chinese herbs prescribed? Taking a Chinese herbal prescription isn't being given a certain herb to treat a certain symptom, such as a headache. Chinese herbal medicine formulas are specially designed by our skilled practitioners at [ActiveMed Integrative Health Center](https://activemedhealth.com/) in San Diego County, CA. Herbal medicine, when properly practiced, takes into account the whole patient, looking not just at their symptoms and disease, but also at their individual constitution, emotional temperament, and dietary habits. A properly crafted regiment of herbs is therefore unique to each patient and targeted to treat them specifically. A formula consists of as few as 2 herbs and up to 18 or more, each picked to address the main symptoms as well as their base pattern. If the individual's pattern or manifestation of disease is not taken into account when prescribing herbs, the disease process will either not improve or it may get worse. The effects of herbs are extremely powerful and should not be underestimated. These are safe and side effect free substances, when used and prescribed appropriately. Are all the \"Herbs\" Vegetable in Origin? While the majority of the herbs used in the Chinese herbal medicine are the leaves, stems, flowers, roots, bark, and [rhizomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome) of plants, the materia medica uses ingredients from all three kingdoms: vegetable, animal, and mineral. How Are the herbs taken? The traditional way was to brew a decoction by boiling the raw herbs for about 30 minutes to an hour, straining them, and drinking them 2-3 times a day. At ActiveMed Integrative Health Center, we mainly use highly concentrated powdered extracts of herbs, manufactured under strict GMP standards. With these extracts, we can fully customize a patient's formula to deliver a concentrated, precise, easily digestible dose of herbal medicine. Just mix the prescribed dose of powder into warm water, mix, and drink. We also use combinations of \"patent\" medicines, herbal pills and tinctures of concentrated medicine. Raw herbs are also used in the form of external liniments to treat dermatological, orthopedic and neuromuscular disease, such as bruising, [varicose veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicose_veins), broken bones, and eczema.
