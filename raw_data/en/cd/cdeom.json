One of the requirements set forth in Section 501 (r) of the Code is for each hospital organization to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) at least one every three tax years. The requiremen t to conduct a CHNA applies to Scripps Health, which is a health system that operates five hospital facilities. Background/Required Components of the Implementation Strategy Provisions in the Affordable Care Act require a tax -exempt hospital to: Adopt an i mplementation strategy to meet community health needs identified in the CHNA. Describe how it is addressing needs identified in the CHNA. Describe any needs in the CHNA that are not being addressed and the reasons for not addressing them. The written implementation strategy describes either: How the hospital plans to meet the significant health need. Describe actions the hospital facility intends to take to address each significant health need identified in the CHNA, and the anticipated impact of those actions, or identify the health need as one it does not intend to address and explain why. The anticipated impact of these actions. The programs and resources the hospital plan to commit to address the health need. Describe any planned collaborati on between hospital facilities and other facilities or organizations in addressing the health need. Or The significant health need of the hospital does not intend to meet, explaining why the hospital does not intend to meet the health need.

PET Team Joanna Safarik, Education Manager, Scripps Health Kevin Wilson, Coordinator, A -Visions Program Mark Zangrando, Senior Director, Mission Integration Current as of: September 8, 2021 Page 9 of 56 Scripps Health Implementation Plan FY20 Scripps Health Community Health Needs Assessment Findings Scripps Health has a long history of responding to the health needs of the communities it serves, extending beyond traditional hospital care to provide community benefit programs that address the health care needs of the region's most vulnerable populations. Scripps strives to improve community health through collaboration. Working with other health systems, community groups, government agencies, and businesses, Scripps is better able to build upon existing assets to achieve broad community health goals. The 2019 CHNA identified ten community health conditions and social determinants of health (SDOH) as the most critical health and social needs within San Diego County (list ed in alphabetical order by SDOH and health condition). 1. Access to Health Care 2. Aging Concerns 3. Behavioral Health 4. Cancer 5. Chronic Conditions 6. Community and Social Support 7. Economic Security 8. Education 9. Homelessness and Housing Instability 10. Unintentional Injury an d Violence Current as of: September 8, 2021 Page 10 of 56 Scripps Health Implementation Plan FY20 Figure 2 - 2019 Top 10 Community Health Needs Figure 2 above illustrates the interactive nature of SDOH and health conditions -each impacting the other. In addition, an underlying theme of stigma and the barriers it creates arose across community engagement. In terms of SDOH, stigma impacts the way in which people access needed services, and can impact the community's ability to maintain and manage their health and health conditions. Due to the complexity of this underlying theme, the CHNA Committee plans to explore and understand ways in which hospitals and health systems could better address stigma in patient care during phase 2 of the CHNA process. For the purpose of this implementation plan the following are definitions used to describe the findings. Access to health care. Access to health care emerged as a high priority health need in both the secondary data analyses and the community engagement events. Overcoming barriers to health care, such as lack of health insurance and insurance issues, economic insecurity, transportation, the shortage of culturally co mpetent care, fears about immigration status, and the shortage of health care providers emerged as a high priority community need. In addition, specific services were identified as challenging to obtain, including behavioral health care, dental care, prima ry care, and specialty care. Aging concerns. Conditions that predominantly affect people who are 65 and older \u2014such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, dementia, falls, and limited mobility - were identified as a high priority health need. Conditions that disproportionately affect older adults were identified as a high priority health need through both the community engagement events and the secondary Current as of: September 8, 2021 Page 11 of 56 Scripps Health Implementation Plan FY20 data analyses. Community engagement participants most often described aging concerns in relation to the so cial determinants of health, including transportation, access to fresh food, social isolation and inadequate family support, and economic insecurity. Behavioral health. Greater access to behavioral health was identified as a high priority health need by the CHNA both in secondary data analyses and in the community engagement events. Three types of behavioral health care were identified as challenging to access: urgent care services for crisis situations; inpatient psychiatric beds and substance abuse faci lities; and transitional programs and services for post -acute care. In addition, several barriers to behavioral health care were named as priorities to address, including a lack of availability of needed services and appointments, insurance issues, logisti cal issues, such as transportation and time off work, and the inability to pay co -pays and deductibles. Cancer. Cancer was identified as a priority health need in the secondary data analyses and in the community engagement process. Health needs related to cancer were described in relation to the effects on well -being beyond physical health. These include financial, practical, and emotional impacts on individuals and families; these effects are exacerbated by barriers to cancer care. Chronic conditions. Three chronic conditions were identified as priorities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity . The CDC defines chronic health conditions as those that last at least one year and require ongoing medical care and/or limit activities of daily living. Res earch and data show that risk factors for these specific chronic health conditions often co -occur. Key factors that individuals struggle with to prevent chronic diseases include access to fresh, healthy foods and safe places to exercise and play. In additi on, economic issues, transportation to medical care, fears about immigration status, and a lack of knowledge about chronic conditions were named as particular challenges related to the management chronic conditions. Community and social support. A high pr iority for the well -being of San Diego residents is ensuring that individuals have adequate resources within their neighborhoods and substantial support from individuals within the neighborhood. Valuable neighborhood resources include federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and those that are culturally and linguistically competent. Without adequate support, community engagement and community spirit are affected. Community and social support were identified as a priority health need in the community en gagement process. For health care, community -clinical linkages that provide social support are critical. Per the CDC, community -clinical linkages are defined as connections between community and clinical sectors to improve population health. Economic secu rity. Economic security was identified as a priority health need in the secondary data analyses and in the community engagement process. For the purposes of this report, chief areas of economic security include poverty, wages and food insecurity . Economic security was named as vitally important to the well -being of San Diego residents and was described as impacting every aspect of residents' daily lives; the health of those who are economically insecure is negatively affected by food insecurity, chronic str ess and anxiety, and the lack of Current as of: September 8, 2021 Page 12 of 56 Scripps Health Implementation Plan FY20 time and money to take care of health needs . In San Diego County, 13.3% of residents have incomes below the federal poverty level and 15% experience food insecurity. Those who are economically insecure are at greater risk o f poor mental health days, visits to the emergency department for heart attacks, asthma, obesity, diabetes, stroke, cancer, smoking, and pedestrian injury. Factors identified as contributing to economic insecurity include housing and childcare costs as wel l as low wages. Economic insecurity is associated with1: Poor mental health days Visits to the ED for heart attacks Asthma Obesity Diabetes Stroke Cancer Smoking Pedestrian Injury Economic insecurity may also lead to food insecurity, which is linked to2: Fair or poor health, anemia, and asthma in children Mental health problems, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and oral health problems in adults Fair or poor health, depression, and limitations in activities of daily living in seniors Education. Receiving a high school diploma, having the opportunity to pursue higher or vocational education, being health literate, and having opportunities for non -academic continuing education were identified as important priorities for the health and well -being of San Diego residents. Family stress and a lack of school and community resources were identified as factors underlying low levels of educational attainment. Education was identified as a priority health need in the community engagement process. In this imp lementation plan report, Education covers multiple areas: 1. Health promotion through the provision of culturally competent health education to community members. 2. Provision of educational pipeline programs that support individual and community upward mobilit y and economic success; in addition to supporting gaps in the health care workforce; particularly in underserved communities. 1 Kaiser Permanente of Southern California Community Health Department, Secondary Data Analysis. Data Source 2018 2 Gundersen C, Ziliak JP (2015). Food insecurity and health outcomes. Health Affairs. 2015. 34(11): 1830 -1839 Current as of: September 8, 2021 Page 13 of 56 Scripps Health Implementation Plan FY20 3. Ongoing education and support for health care professionals to minimize burnout, improve cultural competency, increase retention a nd continue the provision of needed health care services. Homelessness and housing instability. Per the American Hospital Association, housing instability is an umbrella term for the continuum between homelessness and a completely stable, secure housing si tuation. Housing instability takes many forms: physical conditions like poor sanitation, heating and cooling; compromised structural integrity; exposure to allergens or pests; homelessness; and unstable access to housing or severe rent burden. Homelessness and housing instability are important factors affecting the of San Diego County residents. It was identified in the secondary data analyses and in the community engagement process. They were described as having serious health impacts, such as increasing e xposure to infectious disease, creating substantial challenges in the management of chronic diseases and wound care, and increasing stress and anxiety. Poor housing conditions were also cited as impactful of physical and mental health; crowded housing lead s to the spread of illness and environmental hazards can exacerbate conditions like asthma. The cost of housing affects health because it is the primary driver of economic insecurity in San Diego. Unintentional injury and violence. Per the Healthy People 2 020, \"unintentional injuries and violence -related injuries can be caused by a number of events, such as motor vehicle crashes and physical assault, and can occur virtually anywhere.\" Unintentional injuries include motor vehicle accidents, falls, firearms, fire/flame, drowning, poisoning, machinery, suffocation, etc. Unintentional injury and violence were identified as a priority health need in the community engagement process. Exposure to violence and neighborhood safety were cited as priority health needs for San Diegans. Neighborhood safety was discussed as influencing residents' ability to maintain good health, while exposure to violence was described as traumatic and impactful on mental health. Evaluation of Impact With the 2019 CHNA complete and heal th priority areas identified, Scripps Health has developed a corresponding Implementation Strategy, a multi -faceted, multi -stakeholder plan that addresses the community health needs identified in the CHNA. The Implementation Plan translates the research an d analysis presented in the Assessment in actual, measurable strategies and objectives that can be carried out to improve community health outcomes. Scripps uses a community benefit inventory for social accountability (CBISA) to track our community benefi t activities as well as outcome measures. This software/database helps collect, track and report community benefit efforts and is aligned to the Schedule H 990 categories and reporting criteria. The database is used to record information for each activity (service or program) which provides community benefit. This database is used to record actual expenses and funding/offsetting revenue for single or multiple occurrences of an \"activity\". Current as of: September 8, 2021 Page 14 of 56 Scripps Health Implementation Plan FY20 Scripps Health anticipates the implementation strategies may evolve due to the fast pace at which the community and health care industry change. Therefore, a flexible approach is best suited for the development of its response to the Scripps Health Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). On an annual basis Scripps Health evaluates the implementation strategy and its resources and interventions; and adjusts as needed to achieve its stated goals and outcome measures as well as to adapt to the changes and resources available. Scripps describes any challenges encountered to a chieve the outcomes described and makes modification as needed. Health and Social Needs Scripps Is Address ing The health focus areas identified above were determined through data collection, analysis and a prioritization process that incorporated communi ty input. Scripps is addressing aging concerns, behavioral health, cancer, and chronic diseases which includes cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity in this Implementation Plan. Scripps addresses many of the social determinants of health within the health conditions identified in this report such as access to care, community and social support, economic security, education, unintentional injury and violence and homelessness and housing instability. In addition, Scripps identifies specific programs in its implementation plan that address community and social support, economic security, education and unintentional injury and violence. Health and Social Needs Scripps Is Not Directly Address ing Homelessness and Housing instability are identified as import ant factors within a few of our programs but are not addressed in detail in the Scripps Implementation Plan, with Scripps focusing our resources on more direct health issues and conditions, in accordance with our expertise and mission. Although Scripps is not a provider of housing, our social work and case management departments partner with social service organizations and housing providers to address this unmet need by connecting patients to more permanent sources of income, housing and other self -relianc e measures. Scripps Health remains committed to the care and improvement of health for all San Diegans and will look to continue the explorations of new opportunities and new partnerships to address these needs and future needs identified. Current as of: September 8, 2021 Page 15 of 56 Scripps Health Implementation Plan FY 20 Identified Community Health Need - Aging Concerns Objectives: Improve health and well -being for older adults by increasing health care access, education, and preventative services in San Diego County. Provide care and community resources for seniors/older adults with multiple morbidities and inadequate social support. Educate seniors/older adults & partner with local organizations to address fall prevention through exercise and safety measur es in the home. Provide an interchange between the community members and Scripps Family Practice Medical Residents and other health care professional s to foster healthy lifestyles and health prevention. Hospital Facility Programs and Strategies Partnerships & Collaborations Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets and Other Comments Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Senior Health & Well -Being Programs Senior programs are held monthly in partnership with local senior centers, churches, and senior housing. The p rograms are conducted as part of Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista San Diego Border Area Health Education Center and Scripps Family Medicine Residency Program. A program referred to as Senior Health Chats include a variety of topics focused on aging concerns and are designed to provide health education to the older adult community. The health chats provide an interchange between the community members and Scripps medical residents and other health care professionals to foster healthy lifestyles and hea lth prevention. Presentations are facilitated by various health care professionals and residents. Topics are all chosen by the seniors themselves to meet their local needs. The program is conducted in collaboration with Norman Park Center, Congregational T owers Senior Living and St. Charles Nutrition Center. Family Medicine Residents rotate through these programs to learn more about geriatric medicine, health and wellness and overall public health and community training. Norman Park Center, Congregational Towers Senior Living and St Charles Nutrition Center, San Diego Border Area Health Education Center, Scripps Family Medicine Residency Program. Senior Health Chat presentations include a variety of health and age -related topics such as: Heart Health, Understanding Osteoporosis, Parkinson's, Cold vs. Flu and a variety of prevention and healthy lifestyle topics. As of F iscal Year, 2020 , a total of 104 seniors participated in four sessions and were given a pre/post -test to measure their knowle dge. All participants increased their knowledge on the post-test. No classes were held after March due to COVID -19. Current as of: September 8, 2021 Page 16 of 56 Scripps Health Implementation Plan FY 20 Hospital Facility Programs and Strategies Partnerships & Collaborations Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets and Other Comments Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego Scripps Advanced Care Clinic Older adults are at higher risk for chronic health problems like diabetes, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Older adults are also more likely to go to the hospital for some infectious diseases , including pneumonia, which is a leading cause of death for this age group. Making sure older adults get preventive care, including vaccines to protect against the flu and pneumonia, can help them stay healthy. The program provides int ensive, proactive, medical and social services to adults living with multiple chronic diseases. Understanding that diseases can impact all aspects of a person's life, the program treats not just medical issues, but also the psychosocial, economic, and spir itual aspects of care. The Advanced Care Clinic interdisciplinary, patient centered team helps optimize patient health through an evidence -based extensivist clinic model that assist with care coordination and patient advocacy across health care and home se ttings. Primary Care, Palliative Care, Community -Based Organizations As of F iscal Year, 2020 , 149 patients have been served, 45% reduction in hospitalizations, 72% reduction in 30 -day readmissions and 49% reduction in ED visit rate. In addition, the program coordinates non -clinical issues and referrals. The information below displays various type s of psychosocial services referrals given.

The goal of patients participating in this service post-discharge is to reduce hospital and emergency department 30 -day and 90 -day readmissions. Services and assistance are provided for 30 days post discharge and up to one year for any social work or nurse case manager referral and/or patients with the following conditi ons: Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Pneumonia, Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), Total Knee or Hip Replacement, and COVID -19. The Well Being Center staff and Scripps Mer cy Hospital Chula Vista social workers collaborate to provide ongoing follow -up services to identified social work patients for the two Mercy campuses . These patients require more support and resources (housing/homelessness, senior issues, drug/alcohol and mental health, and cancer) as these are high risk and require more assistance. Primary Care, Palliative Care, Community -Based Organizations Community patient post discharge services include home visits, assistance with follow up physician visits, phone calls, providing community and social service resources, and application assistance (medical insurance, SDI, housing, SNAP, Mama's Kitchen). In addition , referrals and/or appointment are made to local community clinics or to the Scripps Advan ced Care Clinic. These services are currently available at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista and San Diego. Fiscal Year 2020 Metrics: 907 patient referrals were received (30 Day and Social Work) 686 patients were contacted/reached (this includes 30 -day follow up and Social Work referral patients) 154 patients - unable to reach, deceased, declined follow -up services, language barrier 66 patients were readmitted (source: caregiver, EPIC) Current as of: September 8, 2021 Page 18 of 56 Scripps Health Implementation Plan FY 20 Hospital Facility Programs and Strategies Partnerships & Collaborations Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets and Other Comments Scripps System Wide Fall Prevention & Home Safety Workshops According to the National Council on Aging, falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries for older Americans. One in four Americans aged 65+ falls each year, and every 11 seconds, an older adult is treated in the emergency room for a fall. Strategies to help older adults living on their own or in care facilities prevent falls , like interventions to increase physical activity, can reduce deaths in this age group. Scripps Social Workers, and nurses educate on ways to reduce fall risk, improve safety awareness, and utilize available resources to promote independence and overall safety. Balance classes are designed to help building balance, posture and coordination through strengthening and balance exercises. This important aspect to healthy living for seniors provides education on preventing falls through exercise and being proact ive through safety measures in the home. County Aging & Independent Services, San Diego Fall Prevention Task Force Scripps held free interactive events on fall prevention in September 2019 and January 2020; participants learned about improving balance, flexibility and strength, and received balance and fall risk screening assessments from Scripps physical therapy specialists. Th e program served 466 participants and had a high overall satisfaction with the workshops provided. Virtual Fall Preven tion Events To kick off National Fall Prevention Awareness week, September 21 -25, Scripps hosted a two -hour fall prevention education webinar. \"Standing Strong\" featured a panel of Scripps experts who provided safety tips, exercises and education, as well as a question -and-answer session. Scripps also partnered with the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency and the San Diego Fall Prevention Task Force to moderate 20 virtual sessions during National Fall Prevention Awareness Week. The free ses sions were open to the public and featured a variety of topics including: Fall Prevention 101 Keeping Your Daily Balance Medication Management in Older Adults Kitchen Safety in a COVID -19 World Fall Prevention Screening & Getting Up Safely After a Fall Current as of: September 8, 2021 Page 19 of 56 Scripps Health Implementation Plan FY 20 Hospital Facility Programs and Strategies Partnerships & Collaborations Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets and Other Comments Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla A Matter of Balance: Managing Concerns About Falls Scripps educates older adults countywide on preventing falls through exercise and taking proactive safety measures in the home. \"A Matter of Balance\" is an eight -week program on practical strategies to manage falls, improve safety awareness and utilize ava ilable resources to promote independence and overall safety. Scripps physical therapists and physical therapy student volunteers provide fall risk assessments, and lead balance classes to help enhance stability, posture and coordination. Participants are t aught to view falls as controllable, set goals for increasing activity, make changes to reduce fall risks at home and encouraged to exercise to increase strength and balance. County Aging & Independent Services While COVID -19 restricted access to the program for much of 2020, Scripps was chosen as a pilot site to test a virtual edition of the program and in early 2021 the program rolled out successfully. During this 8 -week series lectures and information were giv en on practical strategies to manage falls, improve safety awar eness and how to utilize available resources to promote independenacne and overall safety. In FY20, 41 individuals enrolled in the program and were given a pre/post -test to measure their knowledge. All participants increased their knowledge on the post -test. 1.

Hospital Facility Programs and Strategies Partnerships & Collaborations Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets and Other Comments Scripps System wide Project Dulce Care Management Diabetes prevalence is predicated to rise dramatically during the next 20 years, and associated spending is expected to increase threefold. Low -income and uninsured individuals have been found to be at most risk for poor health status. Cultural barriers contribute to this burden by preventing optimal care among diverse ethnic groups that are at elevated risk for high -cost c omplications. Scripps offers a comprehensive culturally sensitive diabetes self-management program for underserved and uninsured populations called Project Dulce. The program is team based and incorporates the chronic care model. Nurse led teams strive for measurable improvements in their patients' health, nurse educators lead multidisciplinary teams that provide clinical management; and peer educators from each cu ltural group, known as Promotoras, provide public and patient education for their communities. This innovative program combines state of the art clinical diabetes management with proven educational and behavioral interventions. Neighborhood Healthcare: Escondido and Temecula, Family Health Centers of San Diego, San Ysidro Health Center In Fiscal Year 2020, Project Dulce provided 42 people with 15 diabetes care educational classes for low income and underserved individuals throughout San Dieg o and 2,842 Project Dulce's patients attended Scripps clinical visits. In addition, 917 patients were provided diabetes retinal screenings held at Neighborhood Healthcare facilities. Out of these 917 retinal visits, 6.4 percent had some degree of diabetes -related eye disease. This program referred 38 people who had advanced disease, 2.4 percent of all screened or nearly 36.9 percent of positives, to specialists for further care. Current as of: September 8, 2021 Page 42 of 56 Scripps Health Implementation Plan FY 20 Hospital Facility Programs and Strategies Partnerships & Collaborations Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets and Other Comments These educators \"Promotoras\" reflect the diverse population affected by diabetes and help teach others about changing eating habits, adopting exercise routines and other ways to help manage this chronic disease. The Project Dulce model has demonstrated positive effects on physiological, behavioral, and cost -effectiveness outcomes. Project Dulce's comprehensive care management approach has demonstrated improvements in clinical outcomes and demonstrated an economically significant reduction in hospital expenditures. Economical, effective, and culturally tailored interventions such as the Project Dulce model are a crucial link in the health care delivery system in order to achieve improved diabetes an d overall health outcomes.

Hospital Facility Programs and Strategies Partnerships & Collaboration s Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets and Other Comments Scripps System wide Scripps Health CalFresh Screenings As health care delivery systems moves towards a population health paradigm that incentivizes keeping patients healthy, hospitals and clinics are recognizing the significance of addressing social determinants of health, such as Food Insecurity (FI). Hospitals have been more proactive in intervening at some level of care to aid the individuals suffering from FI and their ability to gain control over their health. Accordingly, food assistance provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014known as CalFresh in California, significantly reduces the rate and severity of poverty throughout the state (Ca lifornia Budget & Policy Center, 2018). CalFresh and Women's, Infants, Children (WIC) have been successful in assisting low -income children and their families with additional funding for purchasing healthy food. There is evidence that suggests screening fo r FI in healthcare settings is the best indicator for patients to access food -related assistance. County of San Diego The Public Resource Specialists (PRS) team has been successful in having the important conversation about food insecurity with patients they have screened in this past fiscal year. PRS screening is triggered by income below 200% of FPL. Based on conversation with patients , the PRS team determines appropriate assistance.
