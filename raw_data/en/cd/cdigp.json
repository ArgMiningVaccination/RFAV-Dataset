In Cuba and India homeopathy has also been given prophylactically to prevent infection and could help to explain how their figures are much lower than ours. Scotland has a long history of using this medicine effectively and has a homeopathic hospital in Glasgow. Conventional treatment of this virus is at best experimental as little is known of it where homeopathy has over 200 years' experience of treating viruses and was enormously successful during the 1918 pandemic. On top of this, supporting the immune system with good quality vitamin C, D and Zinc is well-documented for its success in treating flu and colds and many people who were unable to be tested for Covid-19 took these supplements and got better without needing to go to hospital. Why the contribution is important Waiting for a vaccination before we can go back to school and work would consign many people to death. People are dying as a result of the lockdown and the state cannot supplement incomes indefinitely which will lead to thousands more dying from poverty. When the best defence against this disease is health, surely it is more important to promote that than lock up the entire country waiting for an un-proven, barely tested, vaccine which has had no long-term trials. by [Greenegirl](https://www.ideas.gov.scot/author/Greenegirl) on May 10, "}
