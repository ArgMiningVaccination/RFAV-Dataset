Perelson\u00a7 *University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131;Santa Fe Institute, Santa Fe, NM 87501; andTheoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545 Edited by Robert May, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom, and approved September 20, 1999 (received for review April 5, 1999) Conclusions have differed in studies that have compared vaccine efcacy in groups receiving influenza vaccine for the rst time toefcacy in groups vaccinated more than once. For example, theHoskins study [Hoskins, T. W., Davis, J. R., Smith, A. J., Miller, C. L.& Allchin, A. (1979) Lancet i, 33-35] concluded that repeat vacci- nation was not protective in the long term, whereas the Keitelstudy [Keitel, W. A., Cate, T. R., Couch, R. B., Huggins, L. L. & Hess,K. R. (1997) Vaccine 15, 1114-1122] concluded that repeat vacci- nation provided continual protection. We propose an explanation,theantigenic distance hypothesis, and test it by analyzing seven influenza outbreaks that occurred during the Hoskins and Keitelstudies. The hypothesis is that variation in repeat vaccine efcacyis due to differences in antigenic distances among vaccine strainsand between the vaccine strains and the epidemic strain in eachoutbreak. To test the hypothesis, antigenic distances were calcu-lated from historical hemagglutination inhibition assay tables, anda computer model of the immune response was used to predict thevaccine efcacy of individuals given different vaccinations. Themodel accurately predicted the observed vaccine efcacies the efcacy in Thus, the antigenic distance hypothesis offers aparsimonious explanation of the differences between and withinthe Hoskins and Keitel studies. These results have implications forthe selection of influenza vaccine strains, and also for vaccinationstrategies for other antigenically variable pathogens that mightrequire efcacy urepeated vaccination uantigenic distance Antigenic drift of the influenza virus exposes the human population to new but related influenza variants on an annual basis. Thus, components of the influenza vaccine areupdated, sometimes yearly, to maintain a reasonable correspon-dence between the vaccine and epidemic strains. Public health recommendations are for annual vaccination of at-risk individ-uals (1). Influenza vaccination works effectively in first-time vaccinees (2). However, efficacy in repeat vaccinees has been difficult todetermine definitively. A meta-analysis of 19 repeat vaccinationstudies showed that on average repeat vaccinees were protectedat least as well as first-time vaccinees (3). However, in the 12studies in which protection was measured serologically, there wasstatistically significant unexplained heterogeneity: In some yearsrepeat vaccinees were better protected than first-time vaccinees;in other years they had worse protection (3). Similarly, twowidely cited vaccine efficacy field studies have reached differentconclusions: The ''Hoskins study'' (4) concluded that repeatvaccination was not effective, whereas the ''Keitel study'' (5)concluded that repeat vaccination was effective. There was alsoheterogeneity within the Hoskins (6) and Keitel studies (Fig. 1).Meta-analysis found no factor that explained the heterogeneityamong 12 serological studies; among the factors tested weredifferences in influenza subtype, age, study design, hemagglu-tination inhibition (HI) assay method, and vaccine type (3).We propose and test a hypothesis to explain the heterogeneity of repeated influenza vaccination. The hypothesis extends theidea that the closeness of the antigenic match between thevaccine strain and the epidemic virus is important for vaccineefficacy in first-time vaccinees, by also considering the closenessof the vaccine and epidemic strains to previous vaccine strains todetermine how vaccine efficacy is modulated by prior vaccina-tion. This ''antigenic distance'' hypothesis is illustrated in Fig. 2. The experiments reported here were performed in machina . Like any model system (animal or computer), a computer modeltrades off accuracy for controllability, observability, repeatabil-ity, speed, and lower cost. Using a computer model allows us tostudy a large number of vaccination regimens, and to isolate theeffects of antigenic difference from other effects such as doseand antigenicity of the vaccine, immunocompetence of thevaccinee, and virulence and transmissibility of the influenzavirus. Materials and Methods Computer Model. The model simulates a repertoire of 107B cell clones, each with a different specificity for antigen. Whenantigen is introduced into the model, B cells with sufficientaffinity have a chance to bind the antigen, be stimulated todivide, undergo somatic hypermutation, and differentiate into aplasma or memory cell. Secreted antibody has a chance to bindantigen, and antigen-antibody complexes are removed from thesystem. In the simulation, just as in animals, one sees differencesamong individuals. This is due to different random number choices for each individual, which result in different repertoiresand hence variation in the number and specificity of B cells thatare stimulated by an antigen. We are concerned with protectionfrom infection conferred by inactivated influenza vaccine andmediated by circulating antibodies; thus we do not considermucosal or cell-mediated immunity. Receptors on B cells, antibodies, and antigens are represented by strings of 20 symbols, each of which can take on one of fourvalues. The reasons for choosing this representation are de-scribed in ref. 10. The distance between two antigens is measuredbyHamming distance\u2014i.e., the number of point mutations in the string describing one antigen required to make it identical tothose of the second antigen. Similarly, the distance between anantibody (or B cell) and an antigen is the number of changesrequired to make the antibody a perfect match for the antigen.This measurement of the distance between antigens by theirHamming distance allows antigenic difference to be computedin quantitative terms. Antigenic (Hamming) distances varybetween 0 and 20, where a distance of 0 implies antigenicidentity, and a distance of 7 or more implies no cross-reactivity.

Experimental Design. The computer experiment considered two influenza seasons and four categories of individuals: ( i) those never vaccinated, ( ii) those who received ''vaccine1'' (v1) at the start of the first influenza season and were not vaccinated for thesecond season, ( iii) those not vaccinated for the first season but who received ''vaccine2'' (v2) at the start of the second season (''first-time vaccinees''), and ( iv) those who received v1 at the start of the first season and v2 at the start of the second (''repeatvaccinees''). All simulated individuals were challenged withepidemic virus 2 months into the second influenza season. The same v2 and epidemic strains were used for all simulated individuals, and v1 was varied. The vaccine2-epidemic strainantigenic distance (v2-e distance) was 2. Since cross-reactivedistances vary between 0 and 7, this distance is ''close,'' but it isnot a perfect match. The v1-only category ( ii) was split into eight groups with each group receiving a different v1, and with thevaccine1-epidemic strain antigenic distance (v1-e distance)varying between 0 and 7. Similarly, the repeat vaccine category(iv) was split into 31 groups, \u00b6with each group receiving a different v1, and with the v1-e distance, and different vaccine1-vaccine2 antigenic distances (v1-v2 distances) varying between0 and 7. Dosage and timing of the vaccinations and epidemicchallenge are summarized in Table 1. The vaccine strains werenonreplicating. For each member of each group, the viral load, and antibodyquantity and affinities for each antigen, were measured every 6 hr. In addition, prior to each vaccination and epidemic challenge,and at the peak of each response, the number, affinity for eachantigen, and clonal history of each B cell involved in the responsewere recorded. If the viral load exceeded 1,500 ''units'' it wasdeemed to have passed a ''disease threshold'' and the simulatedindividual was considered symptomatic. Every simulated indi-vidual was exposed to epidemic virus, and the attack rate withina group was defined as the proportion of the group in which theviral load exceeded the disease threshold. Statistical Analysis. Two-sample ztests were used to compare proportions. Two-tailed testing was used for Pvalues. Results Table 2 shows the experimental attack rate in each experimental and control group. The attack rate was 1.0 in the group never vaccinated.iThe attack rate was 0.55 for first-time vaccinees. Attack rates varied from 0.01 to 1.0 in the v1-only groups, andthe attack rate increased as the v1-e distance increased. Attackrates varied from 0.0 to 0.78 for repeat vaccinees, and the attackrate depended on the v1-v2 distance and the v1-e distance.

An illustration of the antigenic distance hypothesis. Shape space diagrams are a way to illustrate the afnities between multiple B cells yanti- bodies and antigens, and also the antigenic distances between antigens (7). Inthese shape space diagrams, the afnity betwee n a B cell or antibody ( 3) and an antigen ( F) is represented by the distance between them. Similarly, the distance between antigens is a measure of how similar they are antigenically.(a) B cells with sufcient afnity to be stimulated by an antigen lie within a ball of stimulation centered on the antigen. Thus, a rst vaccine (vaccine1) creates a population of memory B cells and antibodies within its ball of stimulation.(b) Cross-reactive antigens have intersecting balls of stimulation, and anti- bodies and B cells in the intersection of their balls\u2014those with afnity for bothantigens\u2014are the cross-reactive antibodies and B cells. The antigen in asecond vaccine (vaccine2) will be partially eliminated by preexisting cross-reactive antibodies (depending on the amount of antibody in the intersec-tion), and thus the immune response to vaccine2 will be reduced (8, 9). ( c)I fa subsequent epidemic strain is close to vaccine1, it will be cleared by preexistingantibodies. ( d) However, if there is no intersection between vaccine1 and the epidemic strain, there will be few preexisting cross-reactive antibodies to clearthe epidemic strain quickly, despite two vaccinations. Note, in the absence ofvaccine1, vaccine2 would have produced a memory population and antibodiesthat would have been protective against both the epidemic strains in candd. For an antigen with multiple epitopes (such as influenza) there would be a ballof stimulation for each epitope. Table 1.

This increase in attack rate was due to decay of cross-reactiveantibody (data not shown). Repeat Vaccination Was Beneficial When Given to Previous Vaccinees. In all groups that received v1, it always lowered experimentalattack rates to receive v2. The lowering of attack rates wasstatistically significant, P,0.01, other than in the group in which the v1-v2 distance was 0 and the v1-e distance was 2 ( P,0.05), and in the group in which the v1-v2 distance was 2 and the v1-edistance was 0. This can be seen by comparing the experimentalattack rates in the v1-only column of Table 2 with the attack ratesin the corresponding row of the repeat-vaccine columns (a rowcorresponds to groups in which the v1-e distance was the same). Negative and Positive Interference of a Prior Vaccine. Attack rates for repeat vaccinees were sometimes lower, and sometimeshigher, than the attack rate for first-time vaccinees (Table2)\u2014even though the timing, dose, and v2-e distance wereidentical. The effect of v1 on the apparent efficacy of v2 can besplit into two factors: negative and positive interference. Becauseof the first vaccination, v2 is partially eliminated by preexistingcross-reactive antibody produced in response to v1 and by v2stimulating v1 memory clones. These effects, which lead toreduced effectiveness of v2, we call ''negative interference.''Negative interference is greater when the v1-v2 distance is small. The second factor influencing the attack rate in repeat vaccinees is ''positive interference,'' in which preexisting cross-reactive antibody produced in the response to v1, and boosted bythe response to v2, helps to clear the epidemic virus. Positiveinterference is greater when the v1-e distance is small\u2014thistrend can be seen in the columns of Table 2. Fig. 3 ashows an example of negative interference of v1 on v2. The response to v1 reached levels** typical for the model. Theresponse to v2 caused a 6-fold increase in the antibody cross-reactive with v1. This increase was caused by stimulation ofcross-reactive memory B cells produced in the response to v1(data not shown). After the response to v2, the antibody reactivewith v2 was approximately one-half of that usually seen after aprimary vaccination (e.g., the level in the response to v2 in Fig. 3b, and the response to v1 in Fig. 3 aand c). Furthermore, the antibody produced in response to v1 and v2 was stronglycross-reactive with v1, but only weakly cross-reactive with the epidemic strain. This absence of protective antibody cross-reactive with the epidemic virus allowed the virus to exceed the1500 antigen unit threshold and ''cause disease'' (Fig. 3 a). The antibody level reactive to the epidemic strain was large after theepidemic virus was cleared, though the antibody levels to v1 andv2 remained mostly unaffected (Fig. 3 a), suggesting a de novo immune response to the epidemic strain. The effects of negativeinterference are most evident in comparison with the responsegenerated by the v2-only control (Fig. 3 b). The antibody pro- **Assays such as the HI assay implicitly take into account afnity as well as concentration of antibody. This fact is useful in assessing the effectiveness of antibody to clear anantigen. Thus, the antibody levels in Fig. 3 have been weighted by afnity; the details aredescribed in the supplemental material (www.pnas.org). Fig. 3. An example of negative interference by v1 on v2 ( a), a v2-only control for comparison ( b), and positive interference by v1 on the epidemic challenge (c).

Attack rates in other repeat vaccination groups did not differ signicantly from that for rst-time vaccinees, either because v1 was toofar from v2 and the epidemic strain to have an effect, or because the effects of positive and negative interferencecanceled each other out. Attack rates as high as 1.0 are due the large-dose experimental challenge of eachsimulated individual. Smith et al. PNAS uNovember 23, 1999 uvol. 96 uno. 24 u14003 MEDICAL SCIENCESduced in this case cross-reacted with the epidemic strain and provided protection against the epidemic challenge. Fig. 3 cshows an example of positive interference of v1 on the epidemic challenge. As in Fig. 3 a, the response to v1 was typical, and v1 negatively interfered with v2 by about the same amount(the v1-v2 distance was the same in both cases). The differencebetween this example and Fig. 3 ais that the antibody produced in response to v1, and boosted by v2, was cross-reactive with theepidemic strain, whereas it was not cross-reactive in Fig. 3 a(the v1-e distance is 2 in Fig. 3 cand 4 in Fig. 3 a). The antibodies cross-reactive with the epidemic strain were sufficient in numberand affinity to clear the epidemic virus before it caused disease.Because the epidemic virus was cleared quickly, it did notstimulate the production of new antibody and the antibody levelsto all three antigens was mostly unaffected by the challenge. For some repeat vaccine groups, positive interference domi- nated over negative interference (entries marked with an porpp in Table 2) and the attack rate was lower than for first-timevaccinees. In other repeat vaccine groups negative interferencedominated (entries marked wit hao ri n Table 2) and the attack rate was higher than for first-time vaccinees. When the v1-e distance was less than 4, a greater proportion of memory B cells that cross-reacted with the epidemic strainwere initially produced in response to v1 than to v2 (data notshown). This observation, the result of negative interference, wasmore pronounced when the v1-v2 distance was small. When the v1 and v2 strains were the same, there was a high attack rate (0.78) for repeat vaccinees (Table 2, v1-v2 distance 5 0). This finding was investigated further with experiments inwhich the v-e distances were 0, 1, and 3. In these homologousvaccination experiments, repeat vaccinees had higher attackrates than corresponding first-time vaccinees and lower attackrates than corresponding v1-only groups (Fig. 4 a). Historical Analysis. The Hoskins and Keitel studies reported vaccine and epidemic strains, together with vaccine efficacies infirst-time and repeat vaccinees, for each outbreak (Table 3);thus, they can be used to test the antigenic distance hypothesis.Field study data were accepted according to the definitions inref. 3: first-time vaccinees were defined as individuals vaccinated immediately before the influenza season in which an outbreakoccurred, and not vaccinated in the preceding years; repeatvaccinees were defined as individuals vaccinated immediatelybefore the influenza season in which an outbreak occurred, andalso vaccinated in one or more consecutive preceding years. Thusfor our study, the Hoskins 1976 (H3N2) outbreak was excludedbecause there was no strict first-time vaccine group (6), and theoutbreaks in the first year (1983) of the Keitel study wereexcluded because there was no strict repeat vaccine group. Theantigenic distances among the vaccine and epidemic strains weredetermined from historical HI assay tables kindly provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta. Dif-ferences in HI values were scaled to equate them with ourmeasure of antigenic distance and are shown in Table 3. Using our model and the HI derived antigenic distances, we predictedthe vaccine efficacy for first-time and repeat vaccinees. Noattempt was made to tune parameters of the model to fit theHoskins and Keitel observations. The predictions from the model of vaccine efficacy in repeat vaccinees relative to the efficacy in first-time vaccinees had goodcorrelation ( r50.87) with that seen in the Hoskins and Keitel studies (Table 3, Figs. 1 and 5). However, the model did notaccurately predict absolute vaccine efficacies. Nor was there anycorrelation between vaccine efficacy in first-time vaccinees andthe v2-e distance. Discussion Our results show that antigenic distances between the first and second vaccines, and between the first vaccine and the epidemicstrain, significantly affect attack rates in repeat vaccinees. Themodel accurately predicted vaccine efficacy in repeat vaccinees,relative to that in first-time vaccinees, for outbreaks duringHoskins and Keitel studies of annual influenza vaccination (Figs.1 and 5). Thus, the proposed antigenic distance hypothesis offers a parsimonious explanation for the differing observations in theHoskins and Keitel studies. In repeat vaccinees, when the v1-v2 distance was small, antibodies produced by the immune response to v1 cross-reactedwith v2, eliminating some of v2 before it induced an immuneresponse\u2014a phenomenon we call negative interference . When the v1-e distance was small, antibodies produced by the response tov1 cross-reacted with the epidemic strain and helped clear it\u2014aphenomenon we call positive interference by v1 on the epidemic virus. Thus, attack rates varied in repeat vaccinees depending onthe combination of negative and positive interference induced byv1, which in turn depended on the v1-v2 and v1-e distances,respectively. Positive and negative interference are well docu-mented aspects of the cross-reactive immune response (8, 9); inthis study we have combined them in a quantitative way topredict vaccine efficacies in first-time and repeat vaccinees. The HI assay measures the ability of ferret antibodies, raised in response to one influenza strain, to inhibit a second influenza strain from agglutinating red blood cells. Because the HI assay measures titers, we assume that the difference between log 2of HI values is equivalent to antigenic distance [details in supplemental methods (www.pnas.org)]. For example, a 2-fold difference in HI values is assumed equivalent to antigenicdistance 1, and an 8-fold difference, antigenic distance 3. Fig. 4.

The predicted vaccine efcacy is computed frompanel aas 1 2attack rate. In computing the efcacy relative to rst-time vaccinees we assumed that rst-time vaccinees received the vaccine in thecurrent season. 14004 uwww.pnas.org Smith et al.Homologous Vaccination. Intuitively, it seems wrong that repeat vaccinees given the same (homologous) vaccine for two succes-sive years could be less protected than first-time vaccinees.However, the model predicts that as the v-e distance increasesfrom 0 to 2, the ratio of vaccine efficacy in repeat vaccineescompared with that in first-time vaccinees will fall monotonicallyfrom 1.0 to 0.5. This prediction holds for the four outbreaks inthe Hoskins and Keitel studies that were preceded by homolo-gous vaccination (Fig. 4 b). Homologous vaccination can result inlow vaccine efficacy because it causes maximum negative inter- ference of the first vaccine on the second vaccine, and thusrepeat vaccinees are protected only by the positive interferenceof the first vaccine on the epidemic strain (which depends on thev-e distance). In two other cases of homologous vaccination [1976 (H3N2) and 1986 (H1N1)], the v-e distance was 2, and thus the modelwould have predicted poor efficacy in repeat vaccinees. How-ever, in both cases, a second nonhomologous v2 strain was alsogiven and the model predicted approximately equal efficacy infirst-time and repeat vaccinees (a good prediction for the 1986outbreak, and not testable for the 1976 outbreak). Failure of homologous strain vaccination to boost after 2 weeks (11) and after 6 months (12) has been seen in human trials.We have previously performed simulations, similar to thosereported here, but in which antibody levels fell close to zerolevels before revaccination (13). In those experiments a homol-ogous revaccination provided good protection. Thus, the resultsof the model depend on the persistence of antibody and whetherthat persistence remains above protective levels. Negative interference of a prior vaccine on a subsequent vaccine has been seen in influenza vaccination in humans (14,15), as has the preferential production of antibody cross-reactivewith the prior vaccine (15, 16). As in the model, the amount ofvaccine antigen elimination by preexisting cross-reactive anti-body appears to be proportional to the amount of circulatingantibody (11, 17). Historical Analysis. The ability of the model to predict the ratio of repeat to first-time vaccine efficacies, yet not predict absolutevaccine efficacies, suggests that taking the ratio cancels out alinear factor that affects first-time and repeat vaccinees equal-ly\u2014a factor that has been obscuring the relationship betweenantigenic distance and vaccine efficacy. This factor (or factors)could be caused by variation in the antigenicity or dose of thevaccine\u2014factors not explored in the current study. Fig. 5.

Smith et al. PNAS uNovember 23, 1999 uvol. 96 uno. 24 u14005 MEDICAL SCIENCESAlthough the results from the two Keitel study outbreaks in 1983 were excluded from the statistical testing of the hypothesis,the differences between the predicted and observed ratios forthese outbreaks support the hypothesis. The outbreaks wereexcluded because although repeat vaccinees received v1 some-time within the 3 years preceding the study, not all of them hadreceived v1 in the fall of 1981. This would allow antibody levelsto decrease before vaccination in the fall of 1982. Lower antibodylevels would decrease the negative interference of v1 on v2, andthus favor repeat vaccinees (as was seen). The extreme 4-foldfavoring of repeat vaccinees in the 1983 (H1N1) outbreak alsosupports the hypothesis: The vaccine (A yBrazil y11y78) appears to have been of low antigenicity (observed vaccine efficacy infirst-time vaccinees was only 21%) and antibody persistence wasless than for concomitant H3N2 and B vaccination (12). Thusnegative interference would be likely to be low, and a repeathomologous vaccination would produce a more classic second-ary response with high antibody titers, and thus be highlyeffective (as was seen). In the Hoskins study it was found that boys who had confirmed influenza infection were better protected against subsequentoutbreaks than boys who had not been infected (but who hadbeen vaccinated). The results from the model offer a potentialexplanation. In the model, antibody levels after the epidemicchallenge were different, depending on whether the experimen-tal challenge caused disease. If the challenge caused disease, theantibody levels cross-reactive with the epidemic strain were atleast 3-fold higher than after a primary or secondary vaccination(Fig. 3 a)\u2014in the model this was due to the antigen stimulating the immune system for a longer time, leading to more plasmacells and antibodies being produced. Thus, antibody levels to theepidemic virus remained higher for longer, and would be pro-tective for longer, than the lower antibody levels in response tovaccination. Conversely, when the epidemic virus was clearedquickly it had little effect on antibody levels (Fig. 3 bandc); thus, we would expect it to have little influence on future protection. In the model, repeat vaccinees received only two vaccinations, and were exposed to a single experimental epidemic challengeafter the second vaccination. However, in both the Hoskins andKeitel studies, some repeat vaccinees were vaccinated more thantwice, and individuals might have been exposed to epidemicchallenge multiple times; yet the model still made good predic-tions. This observation suggests that the last two vaccinations arethe most important in determining efficacy in repeat vaccinees. Vaccine Design. One focus of influenza vaccine strain selection is the selection of a strain that will be close to the (unknown)upcoming epidemic strain. The antigenic distance hypothesissupports this strategy, and adds the following: If there is a choiceamong otherwise equivalent strains (i.e., strains thought to beequally good guesses of the upcoming epidemic strain andequally appropriate for manufacture), then choosing the strain farthest from the previous vaccine strain would reduce theeffects of negative interference and thus potentially increasevaccine efficacy in repeat vaccinees. Vaccine design strives for persistent high antibody titer and persistent cellular memory. However, this may not be theoptimal strategy if the pathogen is antigenically variable andrevaccination is necessary. In the case of annual influenzavaccination, if the antibody titer is high for more than a year thenit has the potential to negatively interfere with a subsequentrevaccination. One option to overcome negative interferencewould be to increase the vaccine dose; although this could workfor one influenza season, the strategy has the danger of resultingin high antibody levels that would increase negative interferencein subsequent years. An alternate, counter-intuitive, optionwould be to design vaccines in which the vaccine specificantibody titer remained high only during the influenza season,and then decreased substantially before revaccination, thuslowering the potential negative interference on subsequentvaccinations. Skipping vaccination for a year would be another method to allow antibody titers to fall and thus reduce negative interferencein the following year. However, while skipping vaccination mightbenefit repeat vaccinees in the following year, they would sufferin the year they skipped because, even though some repeatvaccination groups in our experiments had significantly higherattack rates than the first-time vaccination group, they still hada lower attack rate than groups that skipped the second vacci-nation (Table 2). Summary. The antigenic distance hypothesis, as tested by com- paring the predictions from a computer model to seven influenzaoutbreaks observed in the Hoskins and Keitel studies, accuratelypredicted the year-to-year variation in vaccine efficacy of repeatvaccinees relative to that in first-time vaccinees. The hypothesissuggests considering antigenic distance to the previous year'svaccine strain as part of the vaccine strain selection process, arefinement that has the potential to increase the vaccine efficacyin repeat vaccinees. The methods presented here may also haveapplication to vaccination strategies for other antigenically vari-able pathogens requiring multiple vaccinations for protection.
