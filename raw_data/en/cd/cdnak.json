Detoxification is a process of biotransformation in our bodies. Its fundamental purpose is to release any waste we might be carrying around. Our bodies are constantly cleaning house by way of our paths of elimination like the liver, kidneys, lungs, lymph, colon, and skin. Each of these organs works to eliminate excess waste products (or toxins) produced by our natural metabolic process. How waste is handled Biotransformation and elimination refer to how the body handles products of metabolism, toxic elements, drugs, and other chemicals and eliminates waste through the urine, stool, and sweat. Isn't it amazing that our bodies know to do this on their own? In the modern world, everyone is exposed to a mixture of chemical compounds daily. Research by the Centers for Disease Control found detectable levels of more than 200 environmental chemicals like pesticides, flame retardants, and tobacco smoke by-products in the blood and urine of large sample groups. Some of these substances are carcinogens, while others likely mess with hormones and organ function. When you add these on top of the Standard American diet, heavy in processed foods, refined sugars, additives, and preservatives, it's no surprise that we can feel groggy, tired, and inflamed. Our bodies do it naturally Our bodies are equipped to detoxify natural compounds, like a little too much sugar from an indulgent night out. However, it's difficult to process the amounts of toxins in food and the air that we all encounter today. Some chemicals, like those derived from plastics, are stored in our fat cells for years. When there are imbalances in the biotransformation and elimination processes, a person may notice sensitivity to perfumes or smells, painful periods, skin issues, headaches, chronic fatigue, brain fog, muscle pain, digestive problems, and more. An overloaded detoxification pathway may also lead to clinical patterns such as immune dysfunction or endocrine disruption. Dietary changes can help Fortunately, dietary changes can help us eliminate some of this. Foods that may support the biotransformation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for example, include cruciferous vegetables, berries, soy, garlic, and spices like turmeric (1). Phytonutrients in cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, regulate liver enzymes and support phases one and two of liver detoxification (2). Consuming more fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients may help the liver and promote efficient biotransformation and elimination. Specific nutrients necessary for the biotransformation and elimination processes include vitamin A, glutathione, magnesium, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folate, glutamine, N-acetylcysteine, copper, zinc, etc. In addition to nutrients, modifiable lifestyle factors likesleep, movement, and stress play a role here and support the body's natural drainage pathways. Holistic whole body approach Overall, the presence and use of plastics, herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, food additives, household cleaners, personal care products, and toxic metals have burdened what the body has evolved to tolerate in its environment.
