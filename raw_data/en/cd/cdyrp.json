Most doctors will lead you to believe symptoms are a normal part of aging. This is not the case and no symptoms are ever normal. Having this painful condition of Endometriosis is not easy or fun to live with. Do you know it has a specific CAUSE? Dr. Huntoon's promise is he will help you get to the source of your Endometriosis and will help you get rid of it once and for all. To Request an Action Plan to Address Endometriosis [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Endometriosis is a female health disorder that occurs when cells from the lining of the womb (uterus) grow in other areas of the body. This can lead to pain, irregular bleeding, and problems getting pregnant (infertility). Pain is the main symptom of endometriosis. A woman with endometriosis may have: Note: There may be no symptoms. Some women with a large number of tissue implants in their pelvis have no pain at all, while some women with milder disease have severe pain. Causes, Incidence, and Risk Factors Every month, a woman's ovaries produce hormones that tell the cells lining the uterus (womb) to swell and get thicker. The body removes these extra cells from the womb lining (endometrium) when you get your period. If these cells (called endometrial cells) implant and grow outside the uterus, endometriosis results. The growths are called endometrial tissue implants. Women with endometriosis typically have tissue implants on the ovaries, bowel, rectum, bladder, and on the lining of the pelvic area. They can occur in other areas of the body, too. Unlike the endometrial cells found in the uterus, the tissue implants outside the uterus stay in place when you get your period. They sometimes bleed a little bit. They grow again when you get your next period. This ongoing process leads to pain and other symptoms of endometriosis. The Cause of Endometriosis from a Medical Perspective is unknown. One theory is that the endometrial cells shed when you get your period travel backwards through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis, where they implant and grow. This is called retrograde menstruation. This backward menstrual flow occurs in many women, but researchers think the Immune System may be different in women with endometriosis. Most likely this is due to a \"tipped\" uterus. Endometriosis is common. Sometimes, it may run in the family. Although endometriosis is typically diagnosed between ages 25 - 35, the condition probably begins about the time that regular menstruation begins. A woman who has a mother or sister with endometriosis is much more likely to develop endometriosis than other women. You are more likely to develop endometriosis if you: Treatment depends on the following factors: Mild Symptoms If you have mild symptoms and do not ever want children, you may choose to have regular exams every 6 - 12 months so the doctor can make sure the disease isn't getting worse. You can manage your symptoms by using: For other women, treatment options include: Treatment to stop the endometriosis from getting worse often involves using birth control pills continuously for 6 - 9 months to stop you from having periods and create a pregnancy-like state. This is called pseudopregnancy. This therapy uses estrogen and progesterone birth control pills. It relieves most endometriosis symptoms. However, it does not prevent scarring or reverse physical changes that have already occurred as the result of the endometriosis. Other hormonal treatments may include: Severe Symptoms Surgery may be recommended if you have severe pain that does not get better with other treatments. Surgery may include: Alternative Treatments and Hope Dr. Huntoon has had quite a number of successful resolutions for Endometriosis. This involves addressing the tipped uterus that causes reverse menses creating the basis for endometriosis to develop. Then by addressing the other components associated with the endometriosis has proven to solve this challenging condition. There is a specific relationship Dr. Huntoon discusses in Dr. Huntoon's Endometiosis Solution Protocol. Having a [Consultation with Dr. Huntoon](YourConsultationWithDrHuntoon.asp) warrants gaining this understanding BEFORE starting any care. Many Holistic practitioners have had success helping women with Endometriosis. Finding a [Holistic Chiropractor](WhatIsAHolisticChiropractor.asp), Acupuncturist, Homeopath or Naturopath and reviewing your condition will be the first step to developing a plan to get to the underlying cause of your endometriosis. Working with a practitioner who has experience with Endometriosis is vital. Nutritional supplementation, homeopathic preparations and herbal remedies may be warranted to restore balance to the areas being affected by the condition. Expectations (prognosis) When working with an Alternative Treatment, be sure to understand if the tipped uterus is being addressed to allow for normal evacuation of the uterus to take place during menstruation. This will prevent the reverse evacuation of uterine tissue from finding its way into the endometrium. Treatment of this form will prevent complications from developing and allow for normal pregnancy to occur. By working closely with a [Holistic Chiropractor](WhatIsAHolisticChiropractor.asp) who can help you develop a well-rounded, multifaceted approach to addressing the causes of your endometriosis and reproductive concerns is warranted. Using specific techniques will help address the tipped uterus and help you resolve your endometriosis. Hormone therapy and laparoscopy cannot cure endometriosis. However, these treatments can help relieve some or all symptoms in many women for years. Removal of the womb (uterus), fallopian tubes, and both ovaries (a hysterectomy) gives you the best chance for a cure from a Medical perspective, yet having your reproductive organs removed may hardly seem like a true cure. Rarely, the condition can return. If it does, this was not a cure. Signs and Tests The healthcare provider will perform a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. Tests that are done to help diagnose endometriosis include: Treatment Complications Endometriosis can lead to problems getting pregnant (infertility). Not all women, especially those with mild endometriosis, will have infertility. Medical treatments, including Laparoscopy to remove scarring related to the condition may help improve your chances of becoming pregnant. If it does not, fertility treatments should be considered. Other complications of endometriosis if not treated properly include: Calling your Health Care Provider Call for an appointment with your healthcare provider if: Consider getting screened for endometriosis if your mother or sister has been diagnosed with endometriosis, or if you are unable to become pregnant after trying for 1 year. Prevention Birth control pills may help to slow down the development of the endometriosis. Unfortunately, taking artificial hormones in an effort to regulate your reproductive system will most likely lead to complications and new problems related to your reproductive system. Eventually they will recommend you having a complete hysterectomy.
