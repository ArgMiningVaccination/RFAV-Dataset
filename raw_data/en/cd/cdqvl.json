I want to know what is acupuncture and how does it help? 12 Answers [Ms. Ellen D. Leonard](/Expert/1434534-Ellen-D-Leonard)Acupuncturist Grants Pass, OR I went through 4 years of a masters program to get the answers to your questions. To say that it balances the body's energy doesn't really tell you much. I suggest you pick up the book, \"The Web that has no Weaver\" by Ted Kaptchuk. It does a good job of explaining the processes in laymen's terms. [Mr. Anthony James Lorenzo](/Expert/2819877-Anthony-James-Lorenzo)Acupuncturist Acupuncture is a treatment modality of oriental medicine that comes from Asia. We use needles to stimulate the balancing of energy/life force to improve health. Science has not figured out how it works yet... though studies have shown it causes the release of cortisol in rats, a relaxing hormone. Hopefully some day soon, scientists will figure out the how! [Dr. Alexandre Yves Hillairet](/Expert/2554708-Alexandre-Yves-Hillairet)Acupuncturist Ventura, CA Acupuncture is used in almost all the fields of medicine and it is primarily used to reduce inflammation, pain and increase blood flow. If you search lavieacupunctureclinic.com on google, our website will provide a more detail explanation about CA Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese method of healing which dates back thousands of years ago. Some say 2500-4500 years ago are the earliest recordings of this method being utilized. It helps with a variety of conditions by smoothing our the life force energy, or qi, which helps our bodies function optimally. It serves to balance the body by soothing and supporting the corresponding imbalanced organ and body systems. It's a very complex modality. The best way to describe in a western perspective is that it creates a neurocascade pd brain activity which puts best functioning into action. It helps by balancing the body to reduce the results of imbalance, such as disease, pain, and varying conditions. Thanks and all the best! Thanks and all the best! [Natalie Ramsey](/Expert/3662693-Natalie-Elizabeth-Ramsey)Acupuncturist Montclair, New Jersey Acupuncture is a medical discipline Where in needles are used at specific points on the body along meridians that correspond to specific organs. When the needles are inserted at specific points they perform specific functions that improve the circulation of blood and energy through the body. In this way, acupuncture boost the immune system, reduces pain, and improves general health and well-being. [Snohomish Brown](/Expert/1782420-Snohomish-Brown)Acupuncturist Los Angeles, CA Acupuncture is the practice of inserting tiny hairlike filiform needles, which are different and much thinner than hypodermic needles used for injection, under the skin, to tell the body how to heal itself. Although the exact mechanism of how this happens is not well understood, there is hope for further research to uncover these mysteries. *The Rainbow and the Worm* is a book I would recommend if you have interest in this study. First published over 20 years ago, it is Mae Wan Ho's initial attempt to answer the questions posed by the Nobel Laureate Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in *What is Life?*. Often regarded as the founder of quantum theory, probably Schr\u00f6dinger's most important question was \"How can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?\" His emphasis on genes inspired the discovery that DNA held some clue to the puzzle. Ho's insight is that life is not a thing or a structure, but a process. Instead it is an organizing wholeness, whereby all of the molecules of the body interact together in correlated synchronized union, achieving a state of quantum coherence. I hope that by researching her published works you may someday come to an answer to your question, and I hope that my help in this matter was useful to you. In the meantime, regardless of how the human body works, even those who make pain medications cannot fully explain the mechanism by which their products affect the body's pain signals. Your question dives right into the heart of \"What makes life work?\". Whoever answers this will do very well for themselves, and all of mankind, I am sure. Without a detailed explanation of the physiological processes involved, we do know from animal studies and some functional MRI studies on humans that acupuncture does produce certain physiological effects on the body and it is not simply a placebo effect that eliminates pain. Current studies show acupuncture activates chemical messengers, endogenous opioid mechanisms, and may stimulate gene expression of neuropeptides. Recent data, obtained by using functional magnetic resonance imaging, suggest that acupuncture has regionally specific, quantifiable effects on relevant brain structures. I would invite you to do a search for yourself using the database found here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov as the literature on these studies is extensive. Ultimately, however, it is helpful to know that acupuncture is only one of the tools that a competent Doctor of Chinese Medicine can use to treat disease. Herbal remedies, moxibustion, and exercises like Tai Chi and Qi Gong are also important tools for health, which should not be overlooked. Chinese Medicine is a complete system that is capable of treating all manner of injury or illness. That being said, the World Health Organization has summarized a comprehensive list of conditions for which there is sufficient clinical research demonstrating the effectiveness of acupuncture. That list has been constantly updated since 2003.

[ryan bishop](/Expert/81226544-ryan-bishop)Acupuncturist loxahatchee, fl Acupuncture is one modality of Oriental medicine it can help the body and mind to maintain balance and optimal functioning [Phranque Wright](/Expert/81225847-Phranque-Wright)Acupuncturist Chicago, IL This is a very big question but I will try to keep my answer simple. Acupuncture is a form of treatment forr a multitude of health issues ranging from simple pains, colds, flu all the way up to helping recovery from stroke, infertility and other major issues. It comes from an Eastern view on health and nature and has been around since early man. It helps by regulating the body's own internal healing mechanisms and communication between the body's functional systems. By helping the body regulate itself and function more efficiently the body then starts to heal itself as nature intends and function more properly this relieving ailments and sicknesses. It takes a 4 year medical training to learn the basics and become a competent practitioner, then a lifetime to perfect. It helps people stay healthy in not only a physical way but an emotional, psychological and spiritual sense too.

[Jeff Rippey](/Expert/81225813-Jeff-Rippey)Acupuncturist Saint Joseph, MO There are a variety of ways in which we can define acupuncture. I'm going to give you a bare bones description that I think, for most folks, works well. Acupuncture is the insertion, manipulation and removal of very fine, filiform (solid) needles at particular points on the body with the aim of affecting some health condition. How it helps is a very complicated question. A complete answer would require us to have a discussion about: holography, fractals, physics, embryology, anatomy and physiology, the structure and composition of connective tissues, cell biology, systems theory, and how living organisms utilize information. The bottom line is: there are measurable biochemical effects which occur as a result of needle insertion and, often, these biochemical changes depend on the nature of the health condition under treatment and which acupuncture points were stimulated.
