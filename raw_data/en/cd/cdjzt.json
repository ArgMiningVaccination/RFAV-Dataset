They're all around us\u2014in the air we breathe, the food we eat, and even, the water we drink. We're even exposed to toxins in our homes. Over time, these toxins accumulate in your body and may cause a variety of illnesses and symptoms. The only way to rid your body of toxins is by detoxing. However, many toxins are present at the cellular level. Therefore, cellular detoxing may be the answer. Before starting cellular detoxing, you first need to determine the source of the toxins. Many of the most common toxins we're exposed to daily can be found in your home. Toxins you may encounter on a daily basis include: Heavy metals are also everywhere and enter our bodies continuously via air, water, and food. These toxins affect all aspects of our body, but more specifically, the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine glands, lungs, liver, bones, and kidneys. The result is often a number of diverse symptoms that may directly be related to the occurrence of [Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome (AFS)](/adrenal-fatigue/). The reason for this is that toxins cause our body to go into a state of stress and prolonged stress of any kind usually starts to affect the endocrine system, and thus, the adrenal glands. Toxins accumulate in four places in the body and the level of toxicity depends on the type of toxin and where they accumulate. Toxins such as mercury, dioxins, and certain solvents like benzene are fat-soluble. Toxins in the visceral fat surrounding your organs are the ones you need to worry about. In other words, the fat and toxins surrounding your kidneys, pancreas, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Research suggests these toxins may increase your risk of diabetes, whereas toxins found in close proximity to your nerves may contribute to brain fog, headaches, and mental illness. The main toxin found in bone is lead, which tends to enter your bloodstream when calcium levels are depleted and bone porosity is compromised. This usually occurs during pregnancy or if you suffer from osteoporosis\u2014your bone density gradually becomes lower and bone fractures are more common. Toxins tend to gather in connective tissues, joints, and lymph nodes due to the more sedentary lifestyles of today. Lack of movement, i.e., sitting behind a desk or driving, causes toxins to accumulate in these areas. Some toxins are water-soluble and can be found in blood cells. Although your blood is constantly being detoxified as it moves through your circulatory system, it's also constantly being exposed to an ever-increasing amount of toxins that bombard us from everywhere. The most common water-soluble toxins are chlorinated pesticides and heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, and thallium. When we think about a detox, the first thing comes to mind is a purgative that cleanses the bowels or a diuretic that flushes out the liver to rid the body of toxins. Yet over time, toxins accumulate in every cell of your body. While flushing out the bowels or liver may allow you to feel better for a short period of time, toxins are still present, to a large degree, at the cellular level. Homeopathic remedies work at the cellular level along with your body's own [naturally occurring detox](/blog/detoxification-circuit-dysfunction-part-1/) and immune systems, ridding cells of toxins and other matter, which are then expunged from the body in a natural way. In so doing, homeopathic remedies holistically address your body's functions and do not concentrate solely on one aspect of toxin removal. The focus is on a whole body toxin elimination process that starts within your cells. The benefits of a holistic approach to cellular detoxification are many and may include: When doing a cellular detox, you may find your symptoms are aggravated at first before getting better, you may find immediate relief, or you may only start feeling better towards the end of the detox period. This is because each person is different and reacts to holistic remedies in a different way. There are numerous effective remedies for detoxing your body at a cellular level. Echinacea is a plant belonging to the daisy family, i.e., Asteraceae. It is purported to have antimicrobial properties and beneficial effects on the immune system helping to fight colds, flu, infections, and other minor complaints. These effects may be due to its cellular detoxing ability. Echinacea contains phenols\u2014compounds that control a number of activities associated with enzymes and cell receptors\u2014and thus works at a cellular level. They may be especially helpful in protecting against infections and ultraviolet radiation damage, which suggests this remedy may be effective against electromagnetic radiation as well. The alkylamides in echinacea may be effective in boosting the immune system and therefore, aid in fighting infections at the cellular level. Some of the symptoms associated with Adrenal Fatigue may benefit from cellular detoxing with echinacea including chronic fatigue, digestive issues, migraine, dizziness, rheumatism, and a variety of infections. Phytolacca decandra is a plant native to the United States. Traditionally, it was used for treating gland-related, skin, mental, and pain-related issues. Recent studies indicate that Native Americans may have been correct since Phytolacca decandra triggers caspase-mediated signaling and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Caspases are enzymes that play an important role in cell death and inflammation, whereas the production of ROS is the result of oxygen metabolism in the body and plays an important role in both cell signaling and maintaining homeostasis. Both of these occur at the cellular level. Research into Phytolacca decandra as a means of combating certain cancers is promising. Using this remedy in cellular detoxing is also beneficial to those with other symptoms related to Adrenal Fatigue, such as rheumatism, eczema, and hemorrhoids. The lymph nodes play a crucial role in removing accumulated toxins from your body from\u2014not only ingested toxins, but dead blood cells, excess fluid, and cancer cells. When these start to accumulate in your lymph node cells, your lymph nodes swell since they are unable to get rid of the toxins. Thus, swollen lymph nodes are usually a symptom of another underlying issue. Cellular detoxing may help remove toxins from your lymph nodes, which subsequently leave the body through urination or defecation. The Conium maculatum plant is native to Europe and Western Asia and was introduced to America as an ornamental plant. These days, it grows abundantly and is considered a weed. Conium maculatum, or hemlock as it is more commonly known, helps with cellular detoxing and drainage functions of the lymphatic system. Please be aware that all hemlock plants are poisonous and should not be used in homemade remedies. Ferrum iodatum, an iodine and iron remedy, can enhance your body's own detoxing ability and thereby helps with cellular detoxing of the lymph glands, kidneys, and liver. It may be effective in addressing some of the symptoms associated with Adrenal Fatigue, such as lymph gland issues, rheumatism, as well as thyroid and blood-related issues like anemia. Hepar sulphuris calcareum is made by combining powdered oyster shell and Flowers of Sulphur (yellow sulphur powder). Both ingredients are heated to a certain temperature to obtain a powder, which is then dissolved in hot hydrochloric acid mixed with milk sugar. The final mixture is then diluted to form the homeopathic remedy. Hepar sulphuris calcareum has strong [anti-inflammatory properties and works](/blog/stress-induced-inflammation-and-the-nem-stress-response/) at the cellular level to rid the body of toxins. Kali muriaticum detoxes at the cellular and tissue level. It has anti-inflammatory properties and helps relieve glandular issues, rids the body of excess mucus, and may reduce symptoms related to Adrenal Fatigue, including colds, indigestion, eczema, psoriasis, and headaches. Lachesis mutus is a homeopathic remedy made from the venom of a viper, the bushmaster snake, which is found in Central and South American jungles. This remedy detoxes at the cellular level and is effective in reducing inflammation and healing infections. It may be of help with certain Adrenal Fatigue symptoms including rheumatism, neuralgia, gland problems, and menopausal issues. Silicea, although derived from quartz, is a component found in our bones and cartilage. It is effective at cellular detoxing and aids with conditions that have built up over time. Silicea is particularly potent when it comes to detoxing your body of aluminum and other heavy metals. Alzheimer's and brain calcification are both linked to aluminum toxicity. Aluminum tends to accumulate in those tissues of the body where cellular turnover is not fast such as the brain, heart, and bones. The brain itself is responsible for correct functioning of the central nervous system, where chronic fatigue, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and autoimmune diseases tend to manifest. Thus, Silicea supplementation may aid conditions associated with Adrenal Fatigue. Stress is the main cause of Adrenal Fatigue but there are many other types of stressors. In other words, psychological factors may not be the only cause of stress. Environmental factors, such as toxins, also put a lot of stress on your body. Any type of stress leads to an automatic response in your body, known as the NeuroEndoMetabolic (NEM) stress response. This is when the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis automatically kicks in and your adrenals start producing larger quantities of cortisol to help your body cope with the perceived stress. During this time, you are more focused and your body is ready to spring into action\u2014either to face the threat or run away from it. In addition to increased cortisol production, any body functions that are deemed unnecessary to support immediate life are either switched off or slowed down. This is usually not an issue since everything returns to normal once the threat has passed. Prolonged stress, however, means the constant production of larger quantities of cortisol resulting in a totally different scenario unfolding. Hormone production is compromised, function of other glands such as the thyroid are undermined, brain health suffers, inflammation sets in, and your immune system cannot function properly. One of the main stressors affecting adrenal health these days is toxins, something we are constantly subjected to. Cellular detoxing has numerous health benefits, especially for those suffering from Adrenal Fatigue. Your internal organs perform best when there are no toxins present. When your organs are functioning at their best, your body is can absorb the vitamins and minerals it needs to fight infections. Weight gain is a common symptom of Adrenal Fatigue and hormone imbalance. There may be a link between heavy metal toxins and weight gain, and also with hormonal imbalances. Cellular detoxing may rid your body of heavy metals, thereby balancing hormone levels and helping with weight loss. The primary organ responsible for getting rid of toxins is your liver. Chronic fatigue is often the result of an overburdened liver. With cellular detoxing and getting rid of toxins throughout the body, liver function improves. The presence of toxins in your body can cause all kinds of digestive issues including gas, diarrhea, and bloating. A cellular detox may improve digestive issues. Although these remedies are deemed safe, you still need to be cautious when using them. In many instances, you may not see in improvement immediately because many of these remedies are designed to work over a longer period of time. Deciding on the correct remedy should not be a case of hit and miss. In other words, these remedies would be much more effective under the supervision of someone qualified in the field of natural health care. The thing is, what may work for one person may not work for another since everyone is different and responds differently to remedies. The correct dosage is also a key factor to consider. Someone qualified is the best person to advise you on this. Certain remedies may not be of benefit you if you're suffering from particular conditions. To reiterate, a qualified individual with knowledge of your medical history would best to advise you on this. Finally, cellular detoxing will put your body under a certain amount of strain and [may not be advisable](https://www.chiroeco.com/cellular-detox/) for those who are in the latter stages of Adrenal Fatigue, however, a professional should be able to ascertain whether these remedies are suitable for you or not. Although many cellular detoxing remedies are derived from poisonous sources, they are indeed regarded as safe, as they have been diluted down or any poisons removed. Do talk to a healthcare practitioner before embarking on any course of treatment, as each person's need with respect to remedy and dosage may differ. "}
