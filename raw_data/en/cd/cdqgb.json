[SUBSCRIBE](/pages/subscribe) Power of Plants Face Nat\u00fcr was founded by herbalist and holistic health practitioner, Birgit Carlson, to create handcrafted skincare using the finest organic and wildcrafted ingredients. Our meticulously crafted formulas deliver the beautifying nutrients found naturally in the Earth's most powerful plants directly to your skin. The first step of handcrafting our multi-correctional skincare products is our Plant Luminous Infusion, this is our process where ancient wisdom and science meet. We are combining modern science with a time honored, ancient process of infusing nutrient rich herbs & botanicals to create our potent bases. Our Plant Luminous Infusion can take up to six weeks to complete. During this time the plants impart their phytonutrients, minerals, antioxidants, phytoceramides, fatty acids and vitamins into our cold-pressed organic botanical oils or aqueous solutions. These highly concentrated infusions are now the heart of our products. To further elevate the formulas, we incorporate organic cold-pressed plant, seed oils, and organic essential oils of the highest grade to create, what we believe, are the most vital and effective natural organic skincare products available. Our Commitment To The Environment And Sustainability We believe that our beautiful planet is a gift and should be treasured, valued, respected and loved. Face Nat\u00fcr Practices The 5 R's of Recycling. ReduceWe have chosen to not use excess cardboard for our packaging and mailing. We have chosen to reduce by not including paper leaflets but have instead designed our packaging to include areas to share information about the key ingredients and their benefits. ReuseWe have elected to use recycled materials from our containers to our packaging. Even the envelopes we use to mail our products to your door are made from recycled materials and are reusable. RefuseWe avoid the use of plastic containers. Instead, we have chosen to use containers made from recycled glass. Did you know that glass can be recycled indefinitely or continuously? RepurposeWe opted to package our glass containers in beautiful kraft tubes, to not only offer protection to the glass bottles, but to act as storage and even a travel case. Many of our clients reuse and repurpose our glass containers, as well. Also each of our mailing envelopes are reusable. RecycleWe urge you to recycle. Our glass containers are 100% recyclable, our packaging is recyclable as well as reusable, and our mailing envelopes are recyclable and reusable. Testimonials -Sophia P So glad I found your product! I heard the hype about another botanical serum and wanted to try it but it is very costly at $185 an ounce price tag. When I saw that yours had all the same ingredients plus a few key extra and its organic for 1/3 of the price, I couldn't wait to try it! And now I can say I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! -Karly E I love the soaps. There's nothing else like them -- anywhere!! I have tried several different kinds. My favorite is the one with active charcoal and clay. I love how it detoxes my skin but doesn't dry it out. It leaves my skin feeling clean and incredibly soft. -Kaitlin M Using the Vital Botanical Serum the is best thing I have done for my skin. -Shelly B. After just 3 days of using the Vital Botanical Serum, my co-worker asked me what I was using on my skin because it was \"glowing\". I had noticed a difference right away but was shocked to know others noticed too. -Andrea D. My infant daughter's skin was being irritated by other soaps, at the recommendation of my mom I started using Face Nat\u00fcr's soaps. Immediately her skin changed, gone was the dry irritated skin. It is now soft, smooth and healthy looking. I was so relieved and amazed at the difference in her skin after just the first bath. -Sara T. My skin is noticeably softer in just a few days of using it. The redness on my face is already looking so much better. At first I thought I would enjoy a stronger scent but my skin is much less itchy without all the fragrances. -Tom H. I had a problem with oily skin. I immediately noticed a change with my skin when using Face Nat\u00fcr's soaps. My skin is no longer oily it feels clean and refreshed. My wife also appreciates how nice my skin feels. -Karen D. I immediately noticed how soft and moisturized my skin feels, I can't stop touching my face, my skin feels amazing. -Wendy S. I am addicted! My skin feels awesome and it looks amazing! I can never go without. Let me know when the next batch is ready! I need some soap, toner and some serum. -Melissa L. My skin feels amazing, the weather in Utah is not skin friendly. People ask me what I am using. Definitely worth every penny. My results have been incredible! - Our Quality Begins In The Fields - The quality of our products starts in the fields of our beautiful Earth where the plants are nourished using wildcrafted or organic growing practices.
