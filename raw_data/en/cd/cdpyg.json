Our success in fulfilling our vision is measured by dispensary and patient satisfaction, team member excellence and happiness, improvement in the state of the environment, return on capital investment, and community support. C-THREE's corporate leadership emanates from Executive Director Tom Macre. His work and dedication to medical cannabis is a natural extension of 20 years of work in pain management, and a testament to his executive leadership. His two-decade history within the health care community is rooted in Neuromodulation and Electrotherapy through Medtronic Neurological . In 2010, Tom started his own medical device company MedTech Healthcare Solutions. Through Mr. Macre's relationships in the medical community, he has come to understand the immense benefits of medical cannabis and its low toxicity profile. He envisions a medical model of distribution in Connecticut focused on non-intoxicating cannabis products that alleviate suffering. His practical knowledge in the field of non-invasive pain management and rehabilitation services provides him with significant insight into a patient's experience with debilitating, chronic, and acute health conditions. This insight and experience is at the core of C-THREE's structure, philosophy, and operations. Mr. Macre has built an experienced, compassionate, and dedicated team with vast industry experience. Highlights include: /g1A uniquely experienced product development team that is poised to ensure that all medicine is pure, and that all products are dosed accurately, profiled and labeled clearly, and manufactured to exacting standards. This team includes leading cannabinoid and terpene scientists, Dr. Jeff C. Raber, Ph.D and noted cannabis research scientist Sytze Elzinga, formerly in charge of quality control for all pharmaceutical marijuana entering the Dutch market under contract with the Dutch government. Dr. Raber and Mr. Elzinga have developed and consulted for successful, precisely dosed marijuana products on a commercial scale in the United States and abroad, including cannabis oral products, mechanical products, baked goods, capsules, smoothies, drinks, topical ointments, tinctures, chocolate bars, and even ice cream. Additionally, Dr. Raber and Mr. Elzinga have set the standard in the cannabinoid and cannabis terpene testing market, and are best positioned to meet changing patient demands; they carry extensive experience working with and purifying cannabinoids and, critically, analyzing and working with 37 cannabis terpenes - responsive patient care requires a detailed understanding and analysis ofterpenes, which modulate and modify cannabinoids like THC and CBD. /g1C-THREE enters the market with fully developed and reliable organic cultivation practices as implemented by Phyto Management, 1 of 6 companies that has secured A.2 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6approval to cultivate medical cannabis in Washington D.C. from the Department of Health in the District - a highly competitive and tightly regulated market. Phyto's Managing Member, Andras Kirschner, and his staff carry more than a decade of specialized, organic cultivation experience on a commercial scale. Additionally, he has advanced degrees in Plant Science and Sustainable Agriculture. Phyto ensures consistent, pure yields, and mitigates the risk that other licensed Cultivation Centers will underperform, leaving the remaining businesses to compensate for any resulting shortfall in supply, or an underserved patient population. /g1As a redundancy to the independent labs and when economically feasible, an in-house laboratory screening for contaminants and to perform cannabinoid and terpene analysis. The lab will be managed by C-THREE's Dr. Jeff Raber Ph.D and Sytze Elzinga - two leading cannabinoid researchers that have set the standard in medical cannabis screening and profiling, and who have been invited to lecture and present their findings at cannabinoid and terpene conferences in the US, China, the Czech Republic and Germany, including Dr. Raber's seminal presentation on the chemical identification of cannabis varietals at the International Association of Cannabinoid Medicine meeting in Cologne. This expertise is critical to ensuring purity, that the strains are what they purport to be, and that all brands are within the allowed variance under the Regulations. /g1Safety, security, and strict compliance are critical to successful production. To that end, C-THREE has partnered with Matt D. Cook, author of the Colorado Marijuana Regulatory Scheme and former Senior Director of Enforcement, Colorado Department of Revenue. Mr. Cook has essentially defined medical marijuana regulation and compliance for Colorado and for other parts of the nation, and has been instrumental in the planning and development of the C-THREE organization and its security and compliance measures. /g1A Board of Advisors that includes two local, qualified doctors. Dr. Douglas W. Vaughn, M.D. is the Medical Director for Yale-New Haven Hospital. Dr. Lucien Parrillo, M.D. is the Medical Director for Pain Care Associates, specializing in pain management. /g1C-THREE's cultivation protocols are all natural (live soils), organic, and provide consistently impressive yields. An ideal partner, Phyto does not rely on hydroponics - a cheaper, more common process in commercial facilities that is less labor- intensive. C-THREE will not tolerate shortcuts nor rely on hydroponics, which will work to differentiate the C-THREE product line - a benefit to qualified patients that demand naturally grown medical cannabis. /g1C-THREE has access to a variety of exclusive cultivars (genetics). Selected and propagated for their specific genetic expressions and therapeutic effects, these cultivars offer consistent yields that consistently alleviate the qualifying conditions. A.2 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6/g1C-THREE's eco-friendly facility was designed specifically to maximize the output of indoor plants, while minimizing the impact on the environment and surrounding community. The facility has been designed to meet or exceed any forthcoming FDA regulations, incorporates cleanroom elements, and adheres to the relevant cGMP. The cultivation processes and protocol designed and perfected by Mr. Kirchner and Phyto Management are at the core of the C-THREE business model. The operation is a scalable, perpetual harvest cultivation model designed to produce pure, organic yields at regular intervals. In customizing Phyto's cultivation protocol for the C-THREE facility, Mr. Kirschner worked closely with architects, contractors, and a draftswoman to design an eco-friendly facility capable of efficient yet large yields. The operation is supported by an efficient, highly secure and responsive cloud-based inventory management and tracking software (AgriSoftTM) to help ensure strict compliance and prevent diversion. With more than 12 years of commercial scale, highly specialized experience, Mr. Kirschner and Phyto are ideal partners toward C-THREE's goal of a safe, healthy Connecticut. Please see the Cultivation Plan at Appendix G.1 for additional cultivation experience. C-THREE's unique facility design reflects the highest standards in medical marijuana cultivation management: a secure, eco-friendly, cleanroom facility equipped with next generation cultivation protocols and automated or semi-automated controls governing each phase of the cultivation cycle. Additionally, C-THREE Cultivation will only cultivate first class genetics - carefully selected strains chosen for their effectiveness in treating the list of qualifying conditions under the Regulations, including high-Cannabidiol (CBD) strains. Finally, C-THREE will strive to demonstrate the highest levels of integrity in all aspects of our operation, and to exist as the standard-bearer among the Connecticut's registered cultivation centers.

Board of Directors Thomas Macre Peter Merritt David Tortorello High Level Employees Jeffery C. Raber Ph.D Sytze Kirschner Lucien Parrillo, M.D. Douglas Vaughn, M.D. 1. SOURCES OF FUNDS AND USE OF PROCEEDS; FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS 1 (a) Sources and Use of Proceeds Funding sufficient for cons truction of the C-THREE Cu ltivation Center and for cash flow requirements of the first 6 months of business has been raised through the sale of equity. The proceeds to C-THREE from the sale of equity is $2,500,000. V80 is an investment vehicle owned by Board Members Peter Merritt and Dave Tortorello. V80 has i ssued a $2,000,000 revolvin g credit to C-THREE. Additionally, V80 has $50 0,000 in its bank account, which will be transferred to C-THREE upon issuance of a License. The following sets forth the estimated use of proceeds for one Cultivation Center license. The amounts set forth below only represent the best estimates of management, and are based upon a mid-range of anticipated costs. All estimates are subject to change. The start-up costs for C-THREE can be found in the chart and table below. (1) One Cultivation CenterRequired Funding Equipment $375,000 Construction $475,000 Fixed Business Costs $530,000 6 months Operating Expenses $650,000 License $100,000 Grower Fee $75,000 Lab / Extraction Equipment $200,000 Reserve $145,000 TOTAL $2,500,000 136C.1 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 62. Start-Up Timetable Once the Company is considered an approved applicant it will obtain the necessary building permits and commence construction. The C-THREE Cultivation Center will be fully operational within three (3) months. After the Cultivation Center has been issued a certificate of occupancy, and subsequently the registration, it will take approximately sixteen (16) more weeks to grow, harvest, cure, and package the first batch of medical marijuana. Subsequent harvests will occur every two (2) weeks. The bases for these time estimates are C-THREE's (1) experience in organic cultivation, (2) experience in the construction industry, and more specifically (3) the design and construction of marijuana cultivation facilities. 3. The Business 3 (a) The Company C-THREE (the Company) was organized in Connecticut in June 2013. Until it opens for business, the Company will maintain its executive offices at the address of its registered agent: 182B East Aurora, Waterbury, Connecticut 06708. The Company was formed by Mr. Macre to apply for one (1) Cultivation Center license from Connecticut which, if granted, would allow the Company to cultivate and sell marijuana for medical uses in Connecticut. Mr. Macre has made the effort to create a business concept, detailed below, focused on establishing a secure medical marijuana cultivation facility that meets the needs of patients without jeopardizing the safety or health of the public at large. 3 (b) The Concept C-THREE LLC is a marijuana-cultivation and operational management company. The C-THREE Cultivation Center will house growing, processing, production, and packaging facilities. The Company's operational designs and manufacturing standards are based on those of the pharmaceutical industry. Such an approach has been taken to ensure that the quality of C-THREE products and services exceed the requirements set forth by the Connecticut. Once a license is acquired, C-THREE will work to continually build a brand and corporate identity that successfully transmits the Company's focus on applied science, sustainable innovation, biological security, product development, and stringent quality control. Management believes that such focus will play a key role in demonstrating the feasibility of commercially cultivating medical marijuana in a secure, safe manner. 3 (c) Development and Operational Overview Operations. C-THREE anticipates starting construction as soon as a building permit is secured and plans to complete construction within ninety (90) daysthereafter. This will include the installation of security, emergency, business, and environmental control systems. 137C.1 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6Employees. Within the first twelve (12) months of business, the Company anticipates hiring approximately ten (10) employees, up to two (2) of whom are expected to be managers, and the remainder of whom will constitute the core and support teams of the C-THREE Cultivation Center. The core team will be comprised of a Chief Horticultural Scientist, Deputy Horticultural Scientist, Ingestible Item Preparer, Security Guards, Trimmers and Lab Technician. Staffing is a key element of maintaining exceptional quality and production capacities and our management team will strictly adhere to staffing guidelines for the Company. The initial hiring process will be completed during the first five (5) months of operations. Training. There is no substitute for good training. As a commitment to our investors, customers and employees, the Company will have well-planned training, development and retention programs for staff and management alike. 3 (d) Marketing & Branding Although the Cultivation Center will not have direct personal contact with registered patients, C-THREE will attempt to brand its products through a comprehensive marketing campaign. C-THREE plans to market via the internet and printed informational materials distributed through client dispensaries. To that end, C-THREE will also build and launch a website. Management is currently seeking a designer or design team to work with the development of its corporate brand which will identify all of its prepackaged marijuana, ingestible items, and other preparations. The main goal will be to ensure that C-THREE logos and other trademarks are intertwined with all facets of the patient experience \u2014 haptic, olfactory, visual, taste, and therapeutic. Once construction of the C-THREE Cultivation Center is complete, management projects that the Company will be producing medical marijuana at its maximum rate and harvesting every two (2) weeks by the end June of 2014. Ultimately, the production capacity of C-THREE will be dictated by patient demand. Throughout the launch and operation of the Company, management will be evaluating operations, adjusting budgets and goals. 3 (e) Competitive Overview C-THREE's competitive advantage will be derived from the following factors: /g1A uniquely experienced product development team that is poised to ensure that all medicine is pure, and that all products are dosed accurately, profiled and labeled clearly, and manufactured to exacting standards. This team includes leading cannabinoid and terpene scientists, Dr. Jeff C. Raber, Ph.D and noted cannabis research scientist Sytze Elzinga, formerly in charge of quality control for all pharmaceutical marijuana entering the Dutch market under contract with the Dutch government. Dr. Raber and Mr. Elzinga have developed and consulted for successful, precisely dosed marijuana products on a commercial scale in the United States and abroad, including cannabis oral products, mechanical products, baked goods, capsules, smoothies, drinks,topical ointments, tinctures, chocolate bars, and even ice cream. Additionally, Dr. Raber and Mr. Elzinga have set the standard in the cannabinoid and 138C.1 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6cannabis terpene testing market, and are best positioned to meet changing patient demands; they carry extensive experience working with and purifying cannabinoids and, critically, analyzing and working with 37 cannabis terpenes - responsive patient care requires a detailed understanding and analysis of terpenes, which modulate and modify cannabinoids like THC and CBD /g1As a redundancy to the independent labs, and upon securing approval, an in- house laboratory screening for contaminants and to perform cannabinoid and terpene analysis. The lab will be managed by Dr. Jeff Raber Ph.D and Sytze Elzinga - two leading cannabinoid researchers that have set the standard in medical cannabis screening and profiling, and who have been invited to lecture and present their findings at cannabinoid and terpene conferences in the US, China, the Czech Republic and Germany, including Dr. Raber's seminal presentation on the chemical identification of cannabis varietals at the International Association of Cannabinoid Medicine meeting in Cologne. This expertise is critical to ensuring purity, that the strains are what they purport to be, and that all brands are within the allowed variance under the Regulations. /g1C-THREE enters the market with fully developed and reliable organic cultivation practices as implemented by Phyto Management, 1 of 6 companies that has secured approval to cultivate medical cannabis in Washington D.C. from the Department of Health in the District - a highly competitive and tightly regulated market. Partnering with Phyto mitigates the possibility that other licensed Cultivation Centers will underperform, leaving the remaining businesses to compensate for any resulting shortfall in supply, or an underserved patient population. /g1Safety, security, and strict compliance is critical to successful production. To that end, C-THREE has partnered with Matt D. Cook, author of the Colorado Marijuana Regulatory Scheme and former Senior Director of Enforcement, Colorado Department of Revenue. Mr. Cook has defined medical marijuana compliance for Colorado and the nation, and has been instrumental in the planning and development of the C-THREE organization and its security and compliance measures. /g1C-THREE's cultivation methods all natural (soil), organic, and provides consistently impressive yields. An ideal partner, Phyto employs only organic, sustainable, soil-grown cultivation practices as opposed to hydroponics - a cheaper, more common process in commercial facilities that is less labor- intensive. C-THREE will not tolerate shortcuts nor rely on hydroponics, which will work to differentiate the C-THREE product line - a benefit to qualified patients that demand naturally grown medical cannabis. /g1C-THREE has access to a variety of exclusive cultivars (genetics). Selected and propagated for their specific genetic expressions and therapeutic effects,these cultivars offer consistent yields that consistently alleviate the qualifying conditions. 139C.1 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6/g1C-THREE's eco-friendly facility has been designed specifically to maximize the output of indoor plants, while minimizing the impact on the environment and surrounding community. Additionally the facility has been designed to meet or exceed any forthcoming FDA regulations, incorporates cleanroom elements, and adheres to the relevant cGMP. 3 (f) Target Market & Marketing Strategy The company's target market shall consist of Connecticut residents suffering from any of the qualifying conditions set forth in the regulations. The main objective of the Company marketing strategy will be to educate potential patients within Connecticut about the medicinal properties of marijuana, and how it can be used as a therapeutic alternative to other drugs for qualified individuals seeking such an option. Developing and maintaining the Company's brand identity will be a cornerstone of its business philosophy and overall marketing and promotion. More than just a logo or a name, the C-THREE brand will be built through the following daily commitments: Complete Genetic Expression C-THREE will use its specialized knowledge, skill, and practical experience to maximize the overall therapeutic properties of its medical marijuana by cultivating for complete genetic expression. Product Quality C-THREE shall safeguard the quality of its products by following strict protocols of process flow, repeated screening, and laboratory testing designed to eliminate the risk of contamination. Education Making objective scientific information available to registered patients alongside the Company's medicinal products will be another key element of the C-THREE commitment to the Connecticut patient community. These informational materials will be developed by management and staff. Civic Revitalization C-THREE plans to utilize its economic strength to build alliances with other local businesses focused on revitalizing Connecticut communities. We feel this strategy will play a key role in the Company acquiring public goodwill and helping to change the image of the medical marijuana industry as a whole. Public Relations Management plans to engage a public relations firm. This firm will advise and help guide Company promotions, and assist in gaining mention and placement in the leading print and online media portals. Direct Marketing The Company will use traditional direct marketing to increase patient awareness and thereby convincing customers to purchase C-THREE product for the first 140C.1 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6time. The Company believes that online marketing will be more relevant in generating brand loyalty. C-THREE will invest in introductory advertising in targeted publications and will maintain sustained advertising in any relevant and justifiable outlets. 3 (g) Company Philosophy C-THREE's mission is to consistently provide superior-quality, organically-grown marijuana, as well as nutritious and innovative ingestible items and other preparations to the Connecticut's registered patients. C-THREE aims to set new standards for secure, safe, scientific medical marijuana cultivation. 3 (h) Products and Product Development C-THREE will endeavor to produce high-quality medical marijuana and ingestible items which reflect the Company belief in the significant therapeutic value of medical marijuana, and its ability to provide relief to patients. Ingestible active ingredient product lines will fit into two categories: cannabinoid-rich powders, and vegetable glycerin or oil-based tinctures. Management anticipates that it will be able to sell these as branded and packaged products, as well as use them to produce a range of other ingestible items. These products will be processed in the Cultivation Center using equipment acquired with working capital raised in this offering. In addition to generating an important revenue stream, manufacturing ingestible items makes use of trimmings from the finished marijuana that would otherwise be disposed of thereby minimizing waste. 3 (i) Standard Operating Procedures C-THREE horticultural scientists, using software such as AgriSoft in combination with other data collection and analysis tools, will follow a prescribed set of cultivation practices and procedures. These standard operating procedures (\"SOP's\") have been designed to mirror those of a pharmaceutical manufacturer. C-THREE horticulturalists will conduct basic research on a daily basis, following a schedule designed to track the physical characteristics of each plant in the facility as well as environmental factors that play a role in plant growth. This data will be used to optimize the growth of each strain of marijuana so that all plants fully realize and express their compliment of medicinal compounds. 3 (j) Striving to Meet Pharmaceutical Industry Standards Although medical marijuana producers are not eligible for certification for adherence to standards developed by current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), or the International Organization for Standards (ISO), C-THREE sees advantages in adhering to a combination of the standards promulgated by those organizations. The Company believes that following such guidelines will help it to consistently produce and deliver high- quality medical marijuana and ingestible items. These guidelines taken directly from the cGMP, USP-797, and ISO, include: /g1Basing facility design on: ergonomic flow informed by SOP's; growing and cleaning protocols; and environmental controls; 141C.1 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6/g1Using building materials prescribed by aforementioned standards of cleanroom design; /g1Integrating regular operational participatory, knowledge-based management; 4. High C-THREE's mission is to provide consistently pure, medical-grade marijuana and consistently dosed medical marijuana infused products (MIP's), designed specifically for patient needs, in strict Compliance with the Connecticut Medical Marijuana Program as codified at Connecticut General Statutes, sections 21a-408 et sequens. Our success in fulfilling our vision is measured by dispensary and patient satisfaction, team member excellence and happiness, improvement in the state of the environment, return on capital investment, and community support. To execute on its mission, and after vetting various top industry candidates, C-THREE has reached agreements with: (1) Werc Labs LLC, a group comprised of renowned cannabinoid scientists and experienced marijuana product designers engaged to oversee and implement the production of marijuana products to exacting standards, and (2) Warnish LLC d/b/a Phyto Management (\"Phyto\") to cultivate superior quality, naturally grown, medical-grade marijuana. Additionally, Matt Cook, author of the Colorado Marijuana Regulatory Scheme and former Senior Director of Enforcement, Colorado Department of Revenue, has been hired as Chief Security and Compliance Consultant. Mr. Cook oversaw 220 full time employees and a $54 million dollar budget. Werc Labs, LLC: Advanced Production Techniques and Marijuana Products by Leading Cannabinoid Scientists C-THREE shares DCP's commitment to a healthy Connecticut. Accordingly, after vetting several candidates, C-THREE has partnered with the product development team most capable of meeting patient needs on an ongoing basis: Werc Labs. Werc Labs is known for operating the most advanced cannabinoid and terpene laboratory serving the medical cannabis market in the United States. In addition to laboratory analysis of cannabinoids and, critically, terpenes, Werc's scientists have designed and overseen the manufacture of successful marijuana infused products in other medical marijuana jurisdictions; Werc is second to none in efficacy, consistency, and quality control (QC). Additionally, Werc is best positioned to develop new products with C- THREE as they continue to uncover how 37 different terpenes intereact and treat the qualifying conditions - while helpful, merely scrutinizing the weight component of a few cannabinoids (e.g. THC and CBD) is insufficient and leads to different patient outcomes. Dr. Jeffrey C. Raber, PhD Werc is led by Dr. Jeffrey C. Raber, Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Southern California with a focus on developing new synthetic organic methodologies. Dr. Raber studied plant phylogenetics of the RuBisCO enzyme while at Lebanon Valley College, and was named to the USA Today 1997 All-USA College Academic Team for his research accomplishments in this area. Dr. Raber completed his degree at USC in less 142C.1 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6than 5 years, and was awarded the Harold and Lillian Moulton Fellowship. Upon receipt of his degree from USC Dr. Raber was asked to join a start-up company as the Director of Product Development where he created new molecular scaffolds for use as starting points in the investigation of new pharmaceuticals by medicinal chemists and successfully transferred proprietary reaction methodology and know-how to a production partner. Dr. Raber was subsequently approached to join another start-up company focusing on development and commercialization of a novel chemical reactor technology. Dr. Raber initially joined the company as the Chief Chemist and thereafter became Vice President and then President, and was appointed as a member of the company's Board of Directors. Dr. Raber frequently works with local educational institutions assisting MBA students in deriving their business plans and evaluating their technologies while continuing to develop and create new technologies of his own. Dr. Raber is an accomplished scientist, patented inventor and seasoned executive with all of the skills necessary to direct The Werc Shop's efforts. Recognizing the need for quality control and assurance in California's Medical Cannabis market, Dr. Raber founded an analytical testing laboratory that provided services to market participants: Werc. Having studied peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to the beneficial impacts of cannabinoid receptor medications, a specialty area for Dr. Raber, he envisioned the means for furthering everyone's understanding and fundamental knowledge of the sustainable medication provided through the use of Cannabis sativa L. derived products. Dr. Raber, Ph.D is an accomplished marijuana product designer and quality assurance specialist, and has presented at cannabinoid and terpene conferences across the United States and abroad. Sytze Elzinga As a cannabinoid scientist and marijuana product designer, Sytze's experience is invaluable and, for lack of a better description, unique. C-THREE is pleased to partner with the only team with meaningful expertise pertaining to the proper analysis and quality control of medicinal cannabis. While at Werc, Sytze continues to push the frontier of scientific understanding of medicinal cannabis. Sytze received his bachelor's degree in biochemistry and subsequently went on to complete his masters of science in natural product chemistry from Leiden University in The Netherlands in 2006. Sytze's early research work involved investigations of Artemisinin and sesquiterpene precursors found in dead and green leaves of Artemisia annua L. Additional work involved investigation of the origin of licorice through the use of NMR. Following the completion of his master's thesis Sytze moved on to Farmalyse, a pharmaceutical contract laboratory which performs the quality control and release of pharmaceutical products. Farmalyse possesses the sole contract with the Dutch government for the quality control of the medicinal cannabis provided on prescription through the pharmacies in the national medical marijuana program. At Farmalyse Sytze was responsible for the quality control of all medicinal cannabis for the Dutch pharmaceutical market. Research at Farmalyse was conducted on the extraction and purification of THC from medicinal cannabis. These efforts lead to a spin-off company, Echo Pharmaceuticals, 143C.1 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6where Sytze was the laboratory manager and was responsible for all laboratory activities. Sytze was responsible for the, creation and validation of cannabinoid standards as well as purification of THC to be used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for the production of a novel tablet, which is currently undergoing Phase II clinical studies. Agricultural and Cannabis Cultivation Experience - Phyto Management Phyto Management is a marijuana-cultivation and operational management company with deep experience in all aspects of commercial cannabis cultivation and production. Besting more than 80-plus would-be applicants, Phyto was recently awarded approval to operate a medical cannabis cultivation center in Washington DC by the DC Department of Health, a highly regulated medical marijuana market under strict scrutiny.1 Phyto's Managing Member, Mr. Andras Kirschner, carries with him more than a decade of relevant, commercial experience, and has advanced degrees in Plant Science and Sustainable Agriculture from the University of Maine. In addition to his Bachelor's Degrees from University of Maine, Mr. Kirschner is six (6) credits shy of his Masters in Business Administration (MBA) from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles - a distinction he has placed on hold to further the success of Phyto Management./g1 Supported by his able staff, Mr. Kirschner will manage and oversee the design, construction, and operation of the C-THREE cultivation facility. The cultivation processes and protocol designed and perfected by Mr. Kirchner is at the core of the C-THREE business model. The operation is a scalable, perpetual harvest cultivation model designed to produce pure, organic yields at regular intervals. In customizing his cultivation protocol for the C-THREE facility, Mr. Kirschner worked closely with architects, contractors, and a draftswoman to design an eco-friendly facility capable of efficient yet large yields. With more than 12 years of commercial scale, highly specialized experience, Mr. Kirschner and Phyto are poised to oversee the production of pure, organic medical marijuana in the state of Connecticut. While earning degrees in Sustainable Agriculture and Plant Science at the University of Maine, Mr. Kirschner solely managed the Black Bear Food Guild, and successfully shepherded the Guild through the organic certification process as administered by the Maine Organic Farmers and Growers Association, (MOFGA). Established in 1994, the Black Bear Food Guild is a community supported, agricultural initiative that managed acres of organic produce, and delivered and sold fresh fruits and vegetables to 60 shareholders comprised of local businesses including restaurants and grocery stores. After obtaining his B.S. degree, Mr. Kirschner moved to Vermont, where he founded and established Stony View Farms - an organic farm set on 90 acres of land purchased from the Vermont Land Trust. From 2004 to 2006 Mr. Kirschner raised organic produce in 3,000 square feet of Greenhouse space and 2 acres of land. He sold produce to local restaurants and health food stores. Mr. Kirschner sold the farm in 2009. In addition to his extensive scientific knowledge and practical cultivation experience, Mr. Kirschner is also a professional contractor and carpenter, and has served as general /g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1/g1 1Phyto Management LLC is a separate cannabis cultiva tion entity operating in Washington DC under license from the Department of Health in the District.

A unique blend of contractor and cannabis cultivation specialist, Mr. Kirschner is well-suited to lead these initiatives. Additionally, in 2010, Mr. Kirschner moved to Los Angeles to pursue a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) at Loyola Marymount University. He is 6 credits shy of earning this distinction, which he has placed on hold to further the success of Phyto Management. In 2011, Mr. Kirschner formed Phyto Management LLC in Washington, DC to apply for one of ten Cultivation Center licenses. Besting more than 80 would-be applicants, Phyto was awarded one of the first six (6) licenses issued by the DC Department of Health. 5. Internal Modular Expansion (IME) The facility located at 182 E Aurora, Waterbury, CT. has a footprint of approximately 38,400 with additional floors in some parts of the building. C-THREE will initially build out 8,000 square feet of Cultivation rooms which will be a mix of vegetative and flowering rooms. The remaining 8,000 square feet of (IME 1) expansion will be framed and partially constructed. When patient demand begins to outstrip the production capacity of the initial 8,000 square feet of cultivation space, C- THREE will equip the previously constructed rooms and begin cultivating in them. (IME 2) includes building an additional 16,000 square feet of Cultivation space in the rear of the building. Using this Internal Modular Expansion C-THREE will effectively double its maximum production capacity twice without interrupting production in the current facility or neighborhood. Initially, there will be a total of four (4) flowering rooms. (IME 1) will consist of building another four (4) flowering rooms. A second (IME 2) will involve building an additional 8 flowering rooms. When the expansion plan is completed there will be a total of sixteen (16) flowering rooms occupying 24,000 square feet and six (6) large vegetative rooms occupying 7,500 square feet of the building. The Cultivation Center has been designed so that these expansion projects can be completed in multiple phases without disrupting the perpetual-harvest. Moreover, IME will minimize any impact on the surrounding communities by confining company production to a single property and building. /g1Initially (4) Flower rooms total = 6,ooo square feet of dedicated flowering space /g1IME 1 - (8) Flower rooms total = 12,000 square feet of dedicated flowering space /g1IME 2 - (16) Flower rooms total = 24,000 square feet of dedicated flowering space 6. Expected Production Capacity The bases for these estimates are C-THREE's (1) experience in organic cultivation, (2) experience in the construction industry, and more specifically (3) the design and construction of marijuana cultivation facilities.

Mission C-THREE's mission is to provide consistently pure, medical-grade marijuana and consistently dosed medical marijuana infused products (MIP's) to the registered patients of Connecticut in strict Compliance with the Connecticut Medical Marijuana Program as codified at Connecticut General Statutes, sections 21a-408et sequens . Our success in fulfilling our vision is measured by dispensary and patient satisfaction, team member excellence and happiness, improvement in the state of the environment, return on capital investment, and community support. Intelligent product design takes careful pla nning from the outset. Accordingly, C- THREE has partnered with uniquely e xperienced marijuana product development specialists, Dr. Jeff C. Raber Ph.D and noted research scientist Sytze Elzinga of Werc Labs. More generally, C-THREE has taken a comprehensive approach to the manufacture of effective, safe, and reliable marijuana products to Connecticut's registered dispensaries. Equal parts dedication and science yield consistent results, and professional standards help ensure strict compliance. In addition to the list of products offered, and the packaging and proposed labels herein, C-THREE addresses strain selection, extraction methods, cannabinoid and terpene profiling and treatment, a nd quality assurance measures - each a necessary component of C-THREE's ultimate product offerings. 2. Strain Background Phyto Management, C-THREE's designated cultivation team, will cultivate coveted strains propagated within small circles of medical marijuana cultivators for decades. The strains are heralded for their specific genetic expressions, superior bioavailability, and efficacy in treatment protocols. Many growers propagate strains that bear the same name as Phyto's genetics, but the progeny are not identical - these genetics have often been cross bred, but labeled as an original to command a higher price in genetics markets. In contrast, Phyto remains in possession of, and is pleased to provide, original genetics sought after by patients suffering from epileptic disorders, intractable neuropathic pain, central nervous system disorders, and other preva lent, qualifying conditions. Sativa ,Indica , and Sativa-Indica Hybrid strains of cannabis have marked differences in their cannabinoid profiles, and yield different effects when mediated by the body's CB1 and CB2 receptors. It is important for patients to be aware of the various cannabinoid profiles made available, as it has been shown that certain profiles are best suited for certain conditions. In consultation with their physicians, patients can select the optimal strain and cannabinoid profile for their condition. It is important to note that these are general guidelines, and the effects of particular strains can vary from person to person. SativasC.2.a 151 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6Originating in the tropical climates of south Asia, Sativas are generally the more psychoactive of the two cannabis species. This species and its subspecies tend to contain higher concentrations of THC, and may be more effective in treating the psychological effects of some illne sses, and in palliative care. Benefits commonly associated with Sativas include: /g120analgesic; alleviates or reduces awareness of /g120antiemetic; alleviates nausea /g120appetite stimulant /g120expectorant Indicas The effects of Indicas can include a more physical aspect.

Strain List In consultation with Phyto Management and Werc Labs and after considerable analysis of available data, C-THREE has selected the following strains for cultivation in the first year of operation. Our driving tenant in identifying these varietals was patient care - we chose a range of strains that will effectively address the list of qualifying conditions, including strains high in CBD content and low in THC content. Phyto shall propagate and cultivate one or more strains exhibiting the identical cannabinoid traits as certain strains that have been credited with effectively fighting epileptic disorders in Colorado. Strains were also selected for their time-to-flower and historical yields to ensure that C-THREE is consistently yielding a sufficient supply of medical-grade cannabis. See Cultivation Plan at A ppendix G.1 for additi onal information. The following chart provides an overview of C-THREE's strain selection. It C.2.a 152 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6should be noted that C-THREE will not employ any street names commonly associated with these genetics; street names are provided herein for application purposes only and ease of reference.

Concentrates and Extraction Concentrates offer a pure, concentrated source of the active compounds. Whether by pulmonary uptake (smoke or vapor), transdermal absorption (topicals), or metabolizing (pills/edibles), concentrates can be helpful to pa tients that require large doses, including those enduring chemotherapy. Concentrates are createdthrough an extraction process whereby raw flower and plant matter is reduced down to a liquid state. C-THREE's has partnered with highly experienced extraction technicians as overseen by Phyto Management and Werc Labs. Phyto's experienced technicians will utilize three (3), proven, solvent-free ex traction techniques. Specifically, the extraction team has had great success with: Dry Sieve Extraction (DSE), Cold- Water Extraction (CWE), and Direct Heat Infusion (DHI). Each is effective in working with the cannabinoid and terpenoi d-rich resin heads, and without (the commonly used) toxic petroleum distilla tes or environmentally harmful tactics. Solvent-free methods of extraction will be utilized to provide concentrated cannabinoids with no residual solvents present. This base material can be used directly in a tincture, or further refined, to serve as a base starting point. This mixture contains cannabinoid acids, the natural THCA and CBDA produced by the plant. Non-heated methods of infusion of this concentrate will be used to provide cannabinoid-acid rich base material. Additionally, as another option for patients, controlled atmosphere heating of the cannabinoid-acid rich material will be conducted to provide a decarboxylated product, the neutral cannabinoids THC and CBD, with minimization of loss in to the degradation product CBN. This neutral cannabinoid base material can be directly infused while warm under vigorous mixing to provide a homogeneous oil or tincture solution. These oil and tincture solutions can serve as an end product directly or be used to infuse additional non-inhalation products. Extraction, Generally Before any extraction can commence, stems, fan leaves, and general plant debris must be carefully removed. This process is performed by Phyto Management's skilled cultivation support team - proper handling of the raw flower is critical in preserving the purity of the flower, and the integrity of the cannabinoid-rich resin heads. The resulting plant material is processed utilizing a dry sieve, and then subjected to cold water extrac tion or direct heat infusion. Once extracted, cannabinoids and terpenes, can be consumed via pulmonary uptake (vapor or smoke). Alternatively, the extract can be infused directly into butters, cooking oils, al cohols, and hypoallergenic moisturizers for optimal transdermal absorption or metabolizing. C.2.a 154 1 82 East Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6In the C-THREE production facility, such infusion will occur in the MagicalButter botanical extraction device - a stainless steel, industrial-grade processor designed specifically for botanical extraction and infusion. The MagicalButter is fully automated; a microprocessor effects a set of sequences depending on the substrate to be infused. Temperature is controlled by an integrated digital thermostat that ma intains the micro-climate between 160-250 degrees Fahrenheit. After the infusion, the substrate is strained of plant material and ready for laboratory testing. The device was manufactured to work with the following; /g120Butter /g120Tincture - vegetable oil /g120Avocado oil /g120Hypoallergenic Moisturizers 4 (a) Dry Sieve Extraction DSE is labor intensive, especially when performed by hand, as C-THREE has committed to. It is highly eff ective, however, in isolating the resin powder from the plant material - a necessary step in concentration - without compromising the integrity of the cannabinoid essential oils andcritical terpenes. Resin powder consists of the encapsulated, bulbousglands which are filled with viscous cannabinoid and terpene concentrations. Once isolated, collected, and processed, the concentrate is readily and consistently dosed during the infusion process, after strict lab screens for purity and profiling. The rema ining plant material (fan leaves, stems, small flowers) can be processed via cold-water extraction to create additional concentrate. 4 (b) Cold Water Extraction The plant debris (e.g. leaves, stems, etc) can yield quality and substantial amounts of concentrate in CWE. Fresh or dry plant material is placed in a sterile mesh bag, and submerged in a bath of ice water in a commercial grade, stainless steel washing machine. The machine gently agitates the water for approximately 30 minutes. Next, the water is drained and strained through additional screens that allow the dislodged resin glands to sink rapidly to the bottom of the collection well, where can be collected and dried. Unlike the resin glands, the essential oils dissolve when exposed to the cold water, so this technique produces a concentrate with less terpennes than the previously described dry sieve technique. 4 (c) Direct Heat InfusionC.2.a 155 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6Cannabinoids and terpenes are readily di ssolvable in vegetable oils which may be used for both extraction and as a substrate. Oils are for the most part non-soluble in water and therefore they do not extract excessive water soluble constitutes, like chlorophyll. There are practical limits to the potency that can be achieved extracting with oil, because as the oil becomes saturated with cannabis terpenes the solvent action slows down before stopping altogether. A key factor in achieving maximum removal rates and efficiency, is keeping the boundary layer between the un-dissolved resins and the unsaturated oils used for extraction regularly removed and this is accomplished by mixing 5. List of Marijuana Infused Products (MIPs) Working with our product development team, renowned cannabinoid scientists Jeff Raber, Ph.D and Sytze Elzinga of C-THREE is to offer consistently dosed marijuana products manufactured to exacting standards. Werc labs recognizes the importance of profiling terpenes, in addition to cannaboids, as understanding the physiological response of the patient requires terpene analysis, not simply a CBD/THC ratio. Werc wa s the first laboratory to begin profiling terpenes within the medicinal cannabis industry, and today remains the leaders in new frontier by screening for 37 different terpenes using advanced gas-chromatographic techniques. Accordingly, C-THREE will offer a suite of precisely dosed, effective products, including: Product Type Extraction Technique Extracts and Tinctures Dry Sift / Cold Water Standardized Oral Spray Direct Heat Infusion Coconut Infused Oil Direct Heat infusion Transdermal Patches Direct Heat Infusion Topical Oils and Moisturizer Direct Heat infusion Pills and Capsules Dry Sift / Cold Water Extraction 6. Detailed Product Descriptions The following therap eutics and nutraceuticals have been formulated by renowned cannabinoid and terpene scientists responsible for the successful design and manufacturing of consistently dosed, effective marijuana products in California and the Netherlands, including cannabis p ills (extract and powder-based), baked goods (metabolites), oral products, skin topicals, and mechanical products on a commercial scale. Each product is derived of a specific strain bred for a specific cannabinoid and terpene profile. Each brand of product will carry a cannabinoid profile within the allowed variance under the Regulations. C.2.a 156 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6Each brand name assigned to the following products will be submitted for approval pursuant to the Regulations, Section 21a-408-59. The proposed marijuana products include: 6 (a) Raw Flower C-THREE raw flower will be pre-sorted and packaged into single grams, 1/8 ounce, \u00bc ounce, \u00bd ounce, and ounce packages for resale at the dispensary level. Please see Cultiva tion Plan for a detailed description of the raw flower and raw flower cu ltivation and manufacturing process. 6 (b) Pill and Capsules Cannabis concentrate infused in a desirable oil, such as coconut oil, can be used to create a capsule based product that is available for oral delivery. Oral products are subjected to absorption and first-pass liver metabolism to create hydroxylated neutral cannabinoid derivatives that are typically longer lasting, but slightly diffe rent, than inhaled cannabinoids. For example, 11-hydroxy-tetrahydrocanna binol (11-OH-THC) is five (5) times more active at the CB 1receptor than the non-metabolized neutral THC. This means less of the compounds are needed to provide a similar effect, some of which some patients prefer wh ile others will not. Liquid capsules offer more easily standardized dosage delivery while powder forms may be slightly more challenging to completely homogenize on a tightly standardized dosage loading. Therefor e, initially we will provide oil based capsules for oral consumption, and if patients are not accepting of this formulation, we will develop a tightl y standardized powder formulation. Each batch of capsules made will be tested using 10 different capsules for assurance of capsule weight and capsule cannabinoid content and will be labeled according to the average of these batch values. 6 (c) Baked Goods - e.g. C-THREE Cookies and Brownies C-THREE Baked Goods shall be individually and made with only the Grade-A ingredients, with gluten-free options available. The Baked Goods will be infused with cannabis butter or dairy-free cannabis infused oil (e.g. coconut oil) for vegan diet ary needs. All products will be baked in commercial ovens in C-THREE' s registered kitchen in C-THREE production facility, and produced in acco rding to C-THREE's Policies & Procedures. Our staff shall carefully monitor and employ controlled dosed monitoring of critical control points concerning raw material input, conversion into intermediate oils and advanced ingredients, and ultimately incorporation of the active cannabinoids into the final baked good. Multiple monitoring points are follo wed by advanced chromatographic techniques allowing for the detailed monitoring of the physiologically active ingredients derived from th e raw cannabis material. Close C.2.a 157 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6monitoring ensures minimal variations and more tightly controlled dosage delivery across consistent medicinal product lines. Each individually wrapped c ookie or brownie will be available in single, double, and triple strength, corresponding to single dose, double dose, and triple dose, respectively - unless patients require different allotments as directed by their physicians. Each dose or titration shall contain 10mg of THC. The amount of additional CBD, THCA, and CBDA in each dose will depend on the brand of baked good. Products high in CBD and low THC shall be made available, as well as a 1:1 ratio of the samecannabinoids. No preservatives shall be tolerated in the manufacturing process, and all baked goods made to order and cold-stored until retail sale. 6 (d) Tinctures Generally, bioavailable cannabis tinctures can be made with various base liquids. C-THREE tinctures will be prepared from glycerin, olive oil, grapeseed oil, soy lecithin or other base, prepared in a controlled dose fashion from quantified concentrate bl ended as necessary, and diluted to specifications to create standardized THC and CBD based products . Tinctures are generally administered by a pipet, or medicine dropper, and can be delivered in a quantified fashion based on gradations. Sublingual delivery allows for bypassing the liver and rapid introduction of the same compounds available from inhalation ro utes. Directly, cannabinoids and terpenes of interest can be introduced to the blood-stream providing relief in only minutes. C-THREE will seek to avoid the use of alcohol in our tinctures to avoid potential mouth burning or physiological contraindications with other medications the patient may be consume. In no event will alcohol be used outside the limitation set forth in the Regulations. 6 (e) Marijuana Infused Coconut Oil Cannabis Coconut Oil can be used as a topical or infused into food for digestion. Base concentrate can be infused to coconut oil at different concentrations to provide a product for the desired use. Coconut oil allows for a high concentration of cannabinoids and makes for an easy base to work with in forming an end product topical or a direct food additive. 6 (f) Topical Oils and Lotions Topical oils and moisturizers will be infused with the same base materials used to make tinctures. All natural product bases will be created and infused with a preferred cannabis concentrate oil that is amenable to inclusion in the product base. Topicals can be produced with various combinations of acidic and neutral cannabinoids. We will be able to provide THCA/THC and CBDA/CBD product formulations, in addition to C.2.a 158 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6combinations thereof.Cannabinoid acids can serve as excellent anti- inflammatory agents and do not offer any psychoactive effects. Products containing these cannabinoids may be exceptionally effective against inflammatory conditions. 6 (g) Transdermal Patches Cannabis concentrate may be administered via a medicated adhesive patch that is placed on the skin to deliv er a specific dose of medication through the skin and into the bloodstream. An advantage of a transdermal drug delivery is that the patch provides a controlled release of the medication into the patient, usually through either a porous membrane covering a reservoir of medication or through body heat melting thin layers of medication embedded in the adhesive. 6 (h) Oral Sprays The C-THREE Oral Spray is a similar way to sublingually deliver cannabinoids directly to the bloodstream while by-passing liver metabolism. Oral sprays offer a dir ect means of accurately titrating the amount of medicine delivered and may be preferred by some patients over tinctures. 6 (i) Sublingual Alternatives Breath strips and lozenges offer alternatives to tinctures for sublingual product delivery methods. These product s will be developed to again include various cannabinoid concentrations and where possible use natural ingredients as the specialized base. Cannabis concentrate material will serve as the foundation of cannabinoids to be included in these specialized products. 7. Quality Control Quality control is not simply a matter of testing, it is a mindset, and requires constant monitoring and pre-determined redundancies throughout the manufacturing process and supply chain. As most products are derived of the same raw material, that initial material will be monitored regularly and rigorously for all required safety and active ingredient profiles. As a matter of course, raw plant material is the fundamental base, followed by the initial cannabis concentrate. The secondary concentrate will be tested for microbiological agents that may have formed in the processing, along with cannabinoid concentrations before be ing further processed for infusion. Active ingredient concentrations must be monitored at all points along the production process including concentrate form, oil/base form, and final product form. Multiple internal replicates will be performed on final product forms to provide an average value of the whole batch, generating an accurate representative value for C.2.a 159 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6labeling that will be verified through our external independe nt laboratory. All final products will be subjected to microbiological and my cotoxin/afflatoxin testing immediately before packaging and release. Packaging lines will be monitored for the generation of any poten tial contaminations through rigorous cleaning and microbiological safety testing assurance protocols. 8. Titration or Dosing Unit doses in non-smokable products will initially be standardized according to cannabinoid concentration, this may include all of THC, CBD, THCA and CBDA. A unit dose of the cannabinoids delineated on each label shall equate to 10 milligrams of active ingredient. For example, a single strength C-THREE Pill (brand name TBD) may contain one dose (10mg) of THC and one dose (10mg) of CBD. A double strength Pill of the same brand would contain 20mg of each THC and CBD. Patient titration is best achieved t hrough providing a diverse platform of product types and varying ratios of cannabinoids. If a patient can achieve single milligram dosing within each product type, t hey will more easily be able to provide their own titration points. Products in 1mg, 5mg and 10mg dosing levels may be made upon special requests to allow patients to find their most optimal dose in their desired product form. Based on our work in other medical marijuana jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a significant demand for these smaller doses, as exceeding the amount of required cannabinoids and terpenes is generally very safe, and often do not cause disorienting side-effects. This is especially the case with exaggerated amounts of CBD and cannabinoid acids such as THCA and CBDA. 9. Product Labeling C-THREE's production team is deeply experienced in all aspects of production, including compliant labeling and packaging when dealing with controlled substances such as cannabis. All marijuana and marijuana containing products will be labeled and packaged in stri ct accordance with Connecticut General Statutes, Section 21a-408-56; Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, 21 C.F.R 111; and in child-resistant and light-resistant \"special packaging\" as set forth in the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 Regulations, 16 C.F.R. 1700.1(b)(4).

Consistency of Product Consistency begins by propagating identical clones of each strain. Cultivating genetically identical plants helps ensure the highest degree of consistency across each area of the final-product, a safe, predictable physiological experience for patients, and ultimately better patient outcomes. Additionally, consistent conditions and rigorous plant care help ensure that cannabinoid and terpene profiles are consistent. Phyto Management renders a meticulous approach to cultivation, precisely tracking the growth of the medical marijuana at all stages, and closely monitoring the environmental conditions of the Cultivation Center (including each micro-climate in the various rooms) according to Policies & Procedures. Optimized feeding regiments are closely monitored and adjusted based on the then-current expression of the plants. Software-powered alerts indicate when attention is required, in addition to the staff's regularly scheduled examinations. Consistency is confirmed through analytical testing under the auspices of C- THREE's partnership with Werc Labs, and its renowned cannabinoid and terpene scientists Dr. Jeff C. Raber Ph.D and Sytze Elzinga. In addition to serving on C-THREE's product development team, Dr. Raber and Mr. Elzinga are the preeminent cannabis lab technicians in the United States, and have been invited to present their lab findings at cannabinoid conferences throughout the US, in Germany, China, and the Czech Republic The partnership with Werc is critical for several reasons. First, Werc is the only laboratory in the United States that investigates, tracks, and analyzes cannabis terpenes (37 of them). Cannabis is a complex plant, and understanding how it affects patients takes a more detailed analysis and understanding than simply identifying cannabinoid weight ratios e.g. THC/CBD/THCA/THCV. Terpenes greatly modify and modulate the e ffects of THC and other cannabinoids. Understanding and augmenting terpene combinations is the process by which a true pharmaceutical approach to cannabis can be administered; Second, it is not possible to confirm that a strain is the strain it purports to be without an analysis of terpenes (in addi tion to the basic cannabinoid profiling). In addition to independent lab testing required under the Regulations, C-THREE's medical marijuana will be tested to determine its phytochemical contents (cannabinoids, and other secondary metabolites) at regular intervals during its growth, and post-harvest before being packaged and sold. C.2.a 165 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 613. Quality Assurance Besides the aforementioned testing C-THREE staff will conduct Plant to Package Screening. PTPS shall be a continual part of daily activities within the Cultivation Center and will work to safeguard all C-THREE products. All medical marijuana will be screened throughout its growth and harvest. Testing prior to packaging, and screening all material as it is being packaged will ensure that no contaminated or otherwise adulterated medical marijuana leaves the premises. Any medical marijuana that is deemed unfit for sale will be destroyed acc ording to procedures set forth in the Security Plan. Furthermore, the cannabinoid content of all plant matter will be tested and the results shall be included on the label. 14. Cannabinoid Profiling All harvested and dried marijuana will be tested for bacteria, mold, fungi, terpenes, and cannabinoid profiles prior to being prepackaged for sale to client dispensaries. At least four (4) samples of each batch of harvested marijuana shall be Standard Plate Count tested to verify the batch is free of bacteria, molds, and fungi. Cannabinoid profiling will be completed in-house using, when economically feasible, a quadrupole mass spectrometer / liquid chromatograph, in addition to the registered,independent laboratories in Connecticut. A sample profile has been attached as Appendix \"__\". Cannabinoids Antibiotic Analgesic, Euphoriant 15. Terpenoid Profiling Led by C-THREE's product development team, Jeff Raber and Sytze Elzinga, Werc was the first laboratory to be gin profiling terpenes within medicinal cannabis in the summer of 2011. Werc remains the leaders in this dynamic new frontier of understanding by screening for 37 different terpenes using advanced gas-chromatographic techniques. Terpenes are critical to confirming that a strain C.2.a 166 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6is the particular strain it is claimed to be, and they are ultimately responsible for delivering the complex effects provided by whole plant medicinal cannabis products. Any patient who has attempted to utilize only THC, CBD and CBN (an artifact of improper analysis which is actually not in fresh flowers), will be able to tell you that comp aring only THC values will not help you identify which strain is most effective for their condition. Cannabis is far more complex than one or two cannabinoids. Terpenes modify an d modulate the effects of THC and other cannabinoids, and impact the overall medicinal properties of the particular cultivar. Terpenes are also predominant play ers in the smell and taste of medicinal cannabis. Terpenes are all flavor and fragrance components common to human diets, and they have been designated \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" by the US Food and Drug Administration. Terpenes share a common precursor with phytocannabinoids and they are quite potent, being known to affect animal and even human behavior when inhaled from ambient air at serum levels in the single digit ng/mL range. It doesn't take much of them to make a physiological impact. Terpenes display unique therapeutic effects that may contribute to the overall effects of medicinal cannabis; a reason whole based medicines are superior to single-molecule cannabinoid therapies like Marinol\u00ae or other synthetics like Rimonabant. The synergy of terpenes and cannabinoids are most likely responsible for providing the effective treatment of pain, anxiety, epilepsy, inflammation, depression, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Terpenes are the components responsible for the plethora of powerful medicinal benefits delivered by cannabis. A recent publication by Ethan Russo of GW Pharmaceuticals in the British Journal of Pharmacology (http ://10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01238.x) describes this effect, which is now being termed the entourage effect. For medicinal cannabis patients to receive the proper medication, finding the right strain/product required to meet their medical needs, th ey will need to understand the terpene content and seek to harness the complete entourage effect being delivered by their particular strain selection. Werc is unique in the breadth of terpenes it analyzes; thus it is only lab that can possess a fundamental understanding of a cannabis strain. Recently a particular cultivator discovered this important differentiation. Having submitted a variety of new strains they were working on developing, unique terpene profiles were observed. Out of approximately 10 different samples submitted, if you were to only look at THC and CBD content, the strains would have appeared only average and non-unique. However, comparing their terpene profiles revealed significantly new strains had been created which possessed profiles unlike anything our laboratory had seen before. If these samples were processed at another lab, they most likely would have sacrificed these new strains assuming they were still common. In itial explorations are exceptionally C.2.a 167 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6promising, and the patients being positivel y impacted by these unique strains are the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently there is not a great deal of information known about the terpenes and their combined effect with the cannabinoids present in cannabis, and certainly not in any vast combination like you experience with any strain you encounter today. Individually there is a small understanding of some of the effects of these molecules in general, and can be described as follows. Pinenes: Pine odor, bronchodilators that opens the lungs to possibly improve THC absorption. Responsible for increasing focus, self-satisfaction, and energy. Caryophyllene: Sweet, woody, clove taste responsible for anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects through CB2 receptor activation. Linalool: Floral smell that is believed to provide some anti-cancer effects as well as being known to cause severe sedation. Limonene: Has a citrus scent and may possess anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti- fungal and anti-depression abilities.Myrcene: Most likely effects intake of THC by brain cells to increase the overall effects of THC when ingested together. It is important to note that while the effects listed above were predominantly found for the single component being studied individually. The effects within a cannabis matrix may be far different than when delivered alone. We strongly suggest patients seek to understand their preferred strains by identifying the top few terpenes (now found on our labels) and continue to seek the same medicine in the future through identification of a sim ilar top terpene fingerprint, whether or not the name of the strain is the same. C-THREE wants to develop the best natural products for the registered patients of Connecticut, and is pleased to be partnered with the scientists capable of properly investigating and analyzing terpenes. C-THREE intends to develop the next generation of cannabis therapeutics truly designed to address specific conditions.

Policy The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the security requirements of C-THREE are clearly defined and understood by all persons on a need to know basis. As a condition of employment at C-THREE, all persons shall be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement to ensure the integrity of this and all C-THREE policies and procedures. Compliance with this policy is necessary to ensure the safety of C-THREE employees and its physical resources. It is the policy of C-THREE that all statutory and regulatory provisions of the Act be complied with at all times. C-THREE has a zero tolerance for violations of this policy of any of the statutory or regulatory provisions of the Act and violations shall result in immediate termination as well as civil or criminal penalties. It is the responsibility of all C-THREE staff to be familiar with this policy. Any violations shall immediately be reported to security and supervisory personnel. 5. Objective The objective of the C-THREE Security Manual is to: /g1Ensure the safety of C-THREE employees; /g1Safeguard marijuana from theft /g1Protect C-THREE private property, equipment and facilities; /g1Protect the intellectual property of C-THREE; /g1Protect Cultivation Center Books, Reports, and Invoices The following control mechanisms shall form the backbone of software/hardware; /g1Information Risk Management; /g1Strict adherence to Connecticut Laws, Rules, and Regulations, and /g1Carefully Controlled Production. 6. GAP Analysis Marijuana is still an illegal Schedule I Controlled Substance under federal law. The Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies sections 21a-408-1 to 21a-408-70 allow qualified Connecticut residents to register as patients in order to purchase medical marijuana from registered dispensaries. Marijuana has retained a high black market value due to the overall inelastic demand for illegal drugs within the U.S. As long as these conditions exist diversion will continue to be the greatest threat to the legitimacy of the Connecticut's medical marijuana program and the 196C.2.b Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6existence of C-THREE. In order to develop an effective security strategy, areas of vulnerability and potential threats have been examined below. 6 (a) Areas of Vulnerability /g1Main entrance - A breach of this entrance would pose a direct threat to staff members working inside of the Cultivation Center. /g1Loading dock - Likely target for intruders. /g1Transport - Cargo in a vehicle on public roads would increase risk of theft. 6 (b) External Threats /g1Criminals - The high black market value of marijuana increases the risk of violent intrusion, theft, and other criminal activities. /g1Federal Intervention - DEA raids and Federal prosecution remain a possibility because of the conflict between Connecticut Law and the Federal Controlled Substances Act. 6 (c) Internal Threats /g1Employee Theft - Staff members will be privy to in depth knowledge of the security systems, operational schedules, and not perceived as a typical threat by other staff members. /g1Systems Malfunctions - System malfunctions may occur as a result of a power outage/brown-out or equipment failure. 7. Security Personnel C-THREE will contract with a private security firm that specializes in providing armed security personnel. C-THREE has been researching firms that staff individuals which meet the specific needs of each client. There will be at least one(1) armed guard on duty during operational hours. The armed guard shall arrive one half (1/2) hour prior to the Cultivation Team in order to secure the premises and leave after everyone else has left the premises. 8. The Facility The C-THREE Cultivation Center will contain rooms classified as Limited Access Areas. Delivery personnel will only be allowed to access the loading dock and will not be allowed in the facility. The main entrance will be monitored and controlled by the security guard Admissions clerk at the registration desk. This Clerk will grant access to authorized visitors such as the Department and Police by scanning their fingerprint into the access control system. The doors will be 197C.2.b Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6secured with a biometric access control device connected to an electronic locking mechanism. These redundant security measures shall ensure that anyone entering the facility is authorized. Every door within the Cultivation Center will be monitored during and after business hours. All rooms that contain any form of medical marijuana will be equipped with biometric access control devices, electronic locking mechanisms, and volumetric intrusion detection. The delivery area will be enclosed by a razor wire topped fence and an electric gate with proximity card access controls. The loading dock has two doors that will provide a secure and redundant transaction zone. There will be an armed guard present in the cultivation center during all business hours. 8 (a) Interior Security All interior doors inside the limited access areas shall remain locked at all times. Authorized persons will be allowed access on a \"need\" basis only. All locks shall be biometric and all activity shall be recorded and documented in the inventory tracking system (Agrisoft). Security personnel shall physically check the security of each door to the flowering, vegetation, curing, drying and inventory storage rooms hourly and record the physical check on the security log. At no time shall security personnel enter flowering, vegetation, curing, drying or inventory storage rooms or vaults in the limited access areas alone unless there is a valid public safety emergency. For purposes of this policy, \"public safety emergency\" shall mean an incident that causes the security team to believe human life is in danger. If a room is found to be unsecure during non-business hours, security personnel shall secure the door and immediately notify the designated person in charge of that room. All incidents of this nature shall immediately be reported to management. 8 (b) Exterior Security The exterior of the building shall be provided with adequate lighting to ensure the ability to see and identify any persons 24 hours a day. During non-daylight hours, C-THREE security personnel shall randomly travel around the facility to ensure its security by checking the building and fences. All doors shall be remain secure and security personnel shall check the doors every hour by attempting to open them. An hourly log shall be maintained and every check performed shall be documented with by date, time, and initials. Any discrepancies shall be reported to management immediately and if evidence of a break-in or other physical damage, the scene shall be secured and law enforcement officials and management shall be notified immediately. All incidents of this nature shall immediately be reported to management. 198C.2.b Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 69. Security Systems The C-THREE security system will be professionally installed to meet the requirements of the Regulations. The locations of the security system components detailed below are indicated on the floor plans at the front of this Security Plan. 9 (a) Cameras There will be cameras installed to visually record and monitor all building entrances and exits, the parking lot/delivery area, the adjacent drive, and the entire inside of the facility. A combination of fixed focal length digital and analog cameras will be used. The horizontal viewing angle of each camera will be at least 74 degrees. The following cameras or equivalents will be used: 9 (b) DVR C-THREE will utilize a DVR recording server which meets the requirements set forth in the Regulations. This DVR server will be fully integrated into the alarm system and will have a host of additional analytic capabilities. Monitors connected to the DVR system will be located at the security desk and inside of the Monitoring Room. 9 (c) Doors All doors will be equipped with keyless entry biometric access control devices. These devices will trigger fail-safe solenoid deadbolts, electric door-strikes, or electromagnetic locks. The access control devices will be fully integrated into the alarm system. Additionally, all doors will be equipped with magnetic position indicators.

With over one hundred and thirty years of experience providing professionally installed systems and world-class service, our company has consistently provided quality, affordable, profession ally designed and installed, value-engineered products and services for its Customers. 2. Overview of electronic protection systems: A. Burglary protection and emergency police call system: I am herewith providing sales literat ure that describes Honeywell's VISTA- 128FBP alarm control panel, an Internet communicator with backup cellular transmitter and interactive alphanumeric op erator's touchpads. Sales literature that describes high security, balanced, biased magnetic contac t protection is also enclosed which I would recommend for the perimete r pedestrian and overhead doors in the production areas here. Standard door contact protection would be provided for exterior and interior doors in the office area. Sales lit erature that describes both passive infrared intrusion sensors and \"verifie d\" passive infrared/microwave intrusion sensors is enclosed. These sen sors would provide interior \"trap\" burglary protection. Anticipating that the burglary protection system would need to be \"U.L. certified\" protection, an exterior alarm bell would be installed on the building exterior. Off-premises U.L. Central Statio n alarm monitoring center co nnections would be provided via a highly supervised IP connection with a backup cellular transmitter. My survey of the building exterior revea led that entry through a perimeter wall in the large production area could be simply made with something as simple as a box wrench. We discussed the provision of a ch ain link fence to reinforce the production area walls against forced entry. I have enclosed sales literature that describes a seismic sensor that could be used to detect an attempt to cut though this interior fence barrier. Routine opening and closing signals woul d be supervised by Tyco Integrated Security. These routine opening/closing signals will be logged by Tyco and made available to you and other authorized co mpany representatives via the Internet using our DataSource service described in the en closed sales literature. The system includes a rechargeable standby power suppl y to help ensure that your protection system remains fully functional in the event of a local or regional commercial power interruption. Honeywell VISTA-128FBP multiplexed system \"point annunciates\" each protection device making it easy to identify and correct abnormal building conditions that would otherwise impede turning the bu rglary protection system ON at closing. This same point identification technology will also enable Tyco's Central Station operators and field service technicians to pi npoint and repair/replace the exact device that might have caused a nuisance alarm. B. Emergency police call system Additional sales literat ure discussed both hardwi red and wireless emergency police call devices. My suggestion is to stra tegically locate a number of the hardwired devices\u2014reception desk, security office, etc. Your per sonnel could carry wireless, portable emergency police call transmitters on lanyards of with belt clips. 252C.2.b Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6 C. CCTV surveillance/recording/retrieval system: It will be impossible for you and others to continuously be at your location to monitor activity in and around your buildin g. A Tyco Integrated Security-provided surveillance/recordin g/retrieval system can be th ere 27/7/365 to provi de critical event information for the improved safety and security of these premises by: /g1Continuously recording activity in and around your building /g1Helping improve operational efficienc ies, e.g. cleani ng services, snow removal services, landsca ping services, etc. /g1Allowing video-based audits of even ts occurring in and around your building /g1Reducing the misuse of your faciliti es, vandalism and theft of services by improper use of your dumpster, illegal dumping, etc. /g1Reducing the risk of fraudulent \"slip and fall\" and auto damage insurance claims Tyco Integrated Security's proposal for a comprehensive CCTV surveillance/ recording/retrieval system will probably include the following components: American Dynamics TVR digital video recorder American Dynamics introduced its \"TVR\" line of digital recorders in 2009. The enclosed sales literature di scusses these DVRs that incorpor ate the security industry's video compression techno logy. H.264 video co mpression technology provides the clearest possible recorded im ages while using a reduced amount of DVR storage. The each of the proposed 16-channe l DVRs provide 4.0TB of internal storage. Both DVRs will be provided with DVD R/W drives so that selected activity and be permanently achieved as court- admissible evidence if needed. With Internet connectivity and static IP addresses provid ed at the digital video recorder, you and other authorized people will be able to access the DVR remotely via Internet-connected PCs and mobile devices to view live the surveilled scenes and to access stored video. Both live and recorded video can be effectively and efficiently retrieved remotely via the In ternet because of the reduced bandwidth requirements of these digital video recorders that utilize H.264 compression technology. American Dynamics \"0 lux\", vandal-resistant \"bullet\" cameras These surveillance cameras ar e discussed in another piec e of sales literature. These cameras are available with either 2.8-10mm or 9-22mm auto-iris, manually adjustable lenses and provide 690TVL ima ges. These cameras have integral IR illuminators (NOT to be used in production areas) and are adaptable to varying surveilled scene lighting levels...and provide usable images in total darkness. Criminal activity will not be hidden fr om these cameras because of poor scene illumination! D. Addressable fire alarm/fire evacuation system with \"intelligent\" fire detection devices: Because of the significant changes planned for the building the Fire Marshal will most likely have requirements for an updated, upgraded fire detection/fire evacuation system. Once your licensing ha s been approved, I will be pleased to accompany you to meet with officials of the F.D. as well as your fire insurance carrier to determine specific fire alarm system need s and requirements. Assuming that an 253C.2.b Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6updated fire protection system will be required, I wanted to provide you with information concerning \"addressable\" fire alarm system techno logy and \"intelligent\" fire detection devices. For decades \"conventional\" fire alarm systems consisted of fire detectors connected to a number of \"zones\" of automa tic fire protection. In the event of an alarm, emergency responders were able to only generally locate the source of the alarm. Precious time could be lost by firefighters traveling throughout a building searching for the source of the alarm. Microprocessor technology has enabled manufacturers to offer affordable, \"addressabl e\" fire alarm systems that are able to isolate the exact location of a fire or trouble condition. Addressable fire alarm control panels are able to quickly id entify the exact source of alarm, trouble and supervisory co nditions. The fire alarm control panel can indicate the type of alarm as well as th e exact device that initiated the signal. Firefighters responding to an alarm signal from your pr emises will be directed by means of English text messages on the fire alarm control panel as well as on any remote annunciators to the sp ecific location of the fire...ver sus spending valuable time traveling throughout your building in an effo rt to locate the source of the emergency. An addressable fire alarm system also ta kes the guesswork out of locating which devices require cleaning or replacement. A service t echnician responding to a system \"trouble\" condition would be direct ed to the specific device that requires cleaning, repair or replacement. Similarl y, smoke detectors th at require cleaning report themselves to the fire alarm contro l panel before nuisance false alarms are generated. Firelite's \"intelligent\" spot-type combination photoelectric smoke/heat fire detectors are described in the enclosed sales literatur e. The unique and impressive features of this intelligent de tection device are as follows: /g1Adjusts sensitivity l evels without the need for owner/operator intervention or programming /g1Sensitivity of smoke detection el ement increases with increases in temperature /g1Combination photoelectric and thermal technology /g1Activity-based sensitivity The technology built into th is intelligent device liter ally precludes nuisance alarms. Honeywell's Firelite division (the division that manuf actures thousands of addressable fire alarm panels that Tyco I. S. installs and services annually) markets this detector as \"the in telligent fire sensor that never stops learning\". I am herewith forwarding sa les literature that describes a single-ended smoke detection beam which might find good application in your facility's larger production areas. 3. Summary: I trust that you will find the above a nd the enclosed both informative and interesting. As plans for th is facility develop, I will look forward to providing you with a very specific proposal and price quotation based on your company's specific 254C.2.b Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6protection needs and drawings, In the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me with questions, to discuss, if added information is needed or if I can provide clarification of any item.

Each power supply, outputs 1 and 2, are a nominal 12vdc at 10 Amps with 12v lead acid battery charger. These outputs can be used as separate isolated 12vdc power supplies, or they can be connected in parallel or series to provide 12vdc, 24vdc or both 12vdc and 24vdc at the same time. When outputs 1 & 2 are connected in parallel, the output is 13.75vdc at 20 Amps. When outputs 1 & 2 are connected in series, the output is 27.5vdc at 10 Amps. Because each output is independently regulated, you may draw additional current from the 12V output 1, while using the 24vdc output at the same time. The 12v current used has to be subtracted from the 10 266C.2.b Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6AQM20 Series Power Supplies continued AQM20 Installation Instruction: Doc.#500-33010 Rev.A Page 2 of 8 16\" 18 gauge wires shown beloware needed for the outputs to share the load whenconnected in parallel for full power.Amps available on the 24vdc.

The PDB-8F8Ris an 8 position power distribution board with individual Relays with input (IN) control for each output (OUT). An EOL resistor trigger input (TRIG), will force all output relays to de-energize that are selected (FT). In a typica l installation, the TRIG would be connected to a Fire Alarm panel via a set of contacts. When the Fire Alarm trips, all enabled relays would be forced to be de-energized to unl ock electric doors, shut down air systems, and or retu rn elevators to ground floor. Input / Output Terminals, Jumpers and LED Details and Specifications Control Power (- CONTR +) Two position un-pluggable terminal block is used to power the coils of the relays. The control voltage must be between 11 and 27.5 Vdc. Each relay energized will draw 20ma of current. By default, Control Power and Main Power are connected together with jumpers J1 & J2 so no connection would be made here unless you were usi ng Dual/separate power as described below. Note D ual/separate power source configuration has not been ev aluated by UL and cannot be configured for UL Listed products. Main Power (- POWER +) Two position un-pluggable terminal block provides the power to the outputs to be distributed and power to Control through J1 & J2. In a normal application the Power must be between 11 and 27.5 Vdc and would be connected here. 271C.2.b Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6 AQM20 Series Installation Instructions AQM20 Rev.A. Page 7 of 8 Dual/Separate Powe r J1 & J2 Jumpers Note Dual/separate power source configuration has not been evaluated by UL and cannot be configured for UL Listed products. J1 Connects (-) Power to (-) Control, J2 Connects (+) Power to (+) Control. By default J1 & J2 are connected together. When J1 & J2 are cut, you must supply 11 to 27.5Vdc to Control power, then you may connect any voltage to 32V AC or DC to the Main Power Terminals. See Dual/Separ ate Power application figure below. Inputs (1-8 IN C) Eight, two position un-pluggable terminal blocks. When IN & C are shorted together, the like number output relay will energize. Each relay can also be energized by an open collector that is common to the control power, sinking 20ma for each input. Each of the C's (common) are connected to control negative power. Input LED's (1-8) Whenever an input is active (relay energized) the associated input red LED will illuminate. FDT/FT (1-8) Jumpers - These are three pin headers adjacent to each fuse with a shunt with handle that shorts the center pin to FTD or FT. FTD = Fire Trigger Disabled - When selected, the Trigger will not effect that output. FT = Fire Trigger - When selected Triggering will force that Input Relay to De-Energize. Dry/Wet Option (1-8 Fuse Models) Through a Fuse, the (+ Power) is connected to the swing arm of each Relay to distribute power to its output. Removing the Fuse, removes the power from the relay. The (+) now becomes the Common Swing Arm and the \"O\" is the N/O or N/C contact as selected with jumper. Outputs (1-8 OUTPUT C, +, O ) Eight, Three position un- pluggable terminal blocks. \"C\" is Power Common and is connected to (- power). \"+\" is connected to fused (+power) and the relay swing arm. \"O\" is the relay switched output as selected with N/O or N/C selector jumper Output Relay Contacts Sel ector (1-8 NC/NO) Jumpers These 3 pin headers with shunt selectors are located just above each output which selects whether the N/C or N/O contacts are c onnected to the \"O\" switched output terminal. With N/C selected, output would be normally ON, or connected to swing arm. With N/O selected, output would turn ON, or close when input is activated. Fire Alarm Interface Trigger (2.2K EOL TRIG) Two position un- pluggable terminal block. This input must see the 2.2K ohm EOL (End Of Line) resistor to be in the normal condition. The EOL is to be placed in a Listed fire alarm panel. See Fig 1 illustrating that shorting or opening the EOL will cause the PDB-8F8R to trigger. TRIG LED (TRIG) Green LED normally ON. Whenever the Trigger is active the LED will be OFF.

PI-05 is injector which powers PoE-Plus compliant devices. It delivers unprecedented technology, is compact, and is enclosed in a heavy-duty, heat-dissipating metal housing which ensures durability and maximum cooling. The Gigabit PoE technology is an innovative solution that eliminates the need for a nearby electrical outlet to power network devices such as IP cameras, wireless access points, and VoIP phones. In addition, it carries Ethernet at Gigabit speeds. This new and improved power injector can now power devices that require up to 25.5 Watts. For example, it can power six radios on a concurrent dual-band wireless access point or a higher-resolution IP camera. The PI-05 protects against damage to non-compliant equipment by withholding power until it detects a valid PoE signature from the devices attached to the Ethernet cable. In addition, voltage is inserted at 48V into the Ethernet cable, so the installer does not need to worry about voltage drops due to cable length. The PI-05 will power any device fully compliant with the IEEE 802.3at standard, and is functional directly out of the box. It is completely plug-and-play and does not require additional programming or software./g73/g66/g38/g41/g46/g3/g65/g66/g64/g65/g38/g73/g72/g80/g62/g75/g62/g61/g3/g64/g66/g64/g58/g59/g66/g77/g73/g104/g62/g3/g66/g71/g67/g62/g60/g77/g72/g75/g37/g3/g66/g62/g62/g62/g3/g49/g41/g43/g39/g44/g90/g109/g38/g60/g72/g70/g73/g69/g66/g58/g71/g77 284C.2.b Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6PAKEDGEWWW.HTTP:// Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 61163 to a specic outlet and provide the P20 with the IP address of the device.

In the event that any such person shall serve as Functionary of any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity in which the Company maintains an investment, it shall be conclusively presumed for purposes of the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.10 that 354E.1 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6/g1 8/g1such service has been undertaken at the request of and in connection with the business of the Company. The foregoing presumption shall apply regardless of whether such Indemnified Person is serving such entity at the request of a third party or that such Indemnified Person's service with such entity was commenced prior to the Indemnified Person becoming a Member or Manager(s) of the Company. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnified Person engaged in willful misconduct. Determination of willful misconduct and its direct result(s) must be the result of a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. (b) Any indemnification made under this Section 5.10 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Company only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that such indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the person seeking indemnification has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 5.10(a). Such determination shall be made by (i) the Manager(s), if not a party to such proceeding, or (ii) by a vote of the Members, if not a party to such proceeding, holding a Majority Interest; or if there are no such Members, or if the Members so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion. (c) The Company shall pay the expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by each person entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.10 in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided that such advance payment shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 5.10 or otherwise. (d) If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this Section 5.10 is not paid in full by the Company within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the Company, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant also shall be entitled to be paid the expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim. Subject to applicable law, in any such claim the Company shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses. (e) The rights conferred on any Indemnified Person by this Section 5.10 shall not be exclusive of any other rights but shall be cumulative of, and in addition to, any and all rights, remedies and other recourse to which the Indemnified Person shall be entitled, whether pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, a vote of the Members, at law, in equity or otherwise. Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted to prevent the Company from entering into an indemnification agreement with any person. Furthermore, any indemnification hereunder shall be made solely and entirely from the assets of the Company and no Member or Manager(s) shall be personally liable to any Indemnified Person under this Section 5.10. (f) The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself, any Member or Manager(s) or any Functionary of the Company or any Functionary of any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to 355E.1 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6/g1 9/g1indemnify such person against expense, liability or loss under applicable law. (g) The Company's obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a Functionary of any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity. (h) The rights granted pursuant to Sections 5.9 and 5.10 shall be deemed contract rights based upon an offer from the Company which shall be deemed to be accepted and acknowledged by each person who becomes a Member or Manager(s) of the Company or who serves at the request of the Company as a Functionary of the Company or any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity.

The Company may offset damages for breach of this Operating Agreement by a Member whose interest is liquidated (either upon the withdrawal of the Member or the liquidation of the Company) against the amount otherwise distributable to such Member. (d) Except as otherwise required in the Act (and subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2), no Member shall have any liability to restore all or any portion of a deficit balance in such Member's Capital Account. (e) The Manager shall not have any personal liability to any Member for the repayment of any amounts outstanding in the Capital Account of a Member, including, but not limited to, Capital Contributions.

Any elections or other decisions relating to the allocations shall be made by the Managers in any manner that reasonably reflects the purpose and intention of this Agreement. Section 9.2. - Regulatory Allocations. (a) Minimum Gain Chargeback. The term \"Minimum Gain\" shall have the meaning set forth in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(b)(2) and 1.704- 2(d). Minimum Gain shall be computed separately for each Member in a manner consistent with the Treasury Regulations under Code Section 704(b). Notwithstanding any other provision of Section 9, if there is a net decrease in Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year or other period, each Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to the portion of such Member's share of the net decrease in Minimum Gain, such Member's share to be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g), except that, to the extent that any exceptions contained in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f)(2) (exception for certain conversions and refinancings), 1.704-2(f)(3) (exception for certain capital contributions), 1.704-2(f)(4) (waiver for certain income allocations that fail to meet minimum gain chargeback requirement if minimum gain chargeback distorts economic arrangement) and 1.704-2(f)(5) (additional exceptions) apply to any Member, such minimum gain chargeback may be avoided. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f)(6). This Section 9.2(a) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f)(1) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. (b) Member Minimum Gain. The term \"Member Minimum Gain\" has the meaning set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i) for \"partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain.\" Notwithstanding any other provision of Section 9, if there is a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year or other period, each Member who has a share of that Member Minimum Gain has as of the beginning of the Fiscal Year shall, to the extent required by Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Treasury Regulations, be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) equal to that Member's share of the net decrease in Member Minimum Gain. Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in accordance with Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Treasury Regulations. This Section 9.2(b) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. (c) Qualified Income Offset. In the event any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations, or distributions described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704- I(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5), or (6), items of the Company's income and gain shall be specially allocated to each such Member in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations, the capital account deficit of such Member, provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 9.2(c) shall be made if and only to the extent that such Member would have an capital account deficit after all other allocations 362E.1 Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6/g1 16/g1provided for in this Section 8 have been tentatively made as if this Section 9.2(c) were not in the Agreement. (d) Nonrecourse Deductions. The term \"Nonrecourse Deductions\" shall have the meaning set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(b)(1). The amount of Nonrecourse Deductions for a fiscal year or other period equals the excess, if any, of the net increase in the amount of Minimum Gain during the fiscal year or other period, over the aggregate amount of any distributions during such year or other period of proceeds of a Nonrecourse Liability that are allocable to an increase in Minimum Gain, determined according to the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(c). Nonrecourse Deductions for a taxable year or other period shall be specially allocated among the Members in proportion to their Interests. (e) Member Loan Nonrecourse Deductions. The term \"Member Loan Nonrecourse Deductions\" means any of the Company's deductions that would be Nonrecourse Deductions if they were not attributable to a loan made or guaranteed by a Member within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i). Any Member Loan Nonrecourse Deduction for any taxable year or other period shall be specially allocated to the Member who bears the risk of loss with respect to the loan to which the Member Loan Nonrecourse Deduction is attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(b). (f) Code Section 754 Adjustment. To the extent an adjustment to the tax basis of any asset pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or 743(b) is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining capital accounts, the amount of the adjustment to the capital accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases basis), and the gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Members in a manner consistent with the manner in which their capital accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to that Section of the Treasury Regulations. (g) Code Section 704(c). In accordance with Section 704(c)(1)(A) of the Code and Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(i)(iv) of the Treasury Regulations, if a member contributes property with a fair market value that differs from its adjusted basis at the time of contribution, income, gain, loss and deductions with respect to the property shall, solely for federal income tax purposes, be allocated among the Members so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Company and its fair market value at the time of contribution. Pursuant to Section 704(c)(1)(B) of the Code, if any contributed property is distributed by the Company other than to the contributing Member within seven (7) years of being contributed, then, except as provided in Section 704(c)(2) of the Code, the contributing Member shall be treated as recognizing gain or loss from the sale of such property in an amount equal to the gain or loss that would have been allocated to such Member under Section 704(c)(1)(A) of the Code if the property had been sold at its fair market value at the time of the distribution.

Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[1]F. Agricultural and Production Experience 1. Introduction Responsible product formulations derived of commercial scale, medical-grade marijuana requires intelligent design from the outset. With a unique experience and insight into organic cannabis cultivation, natural products, ethnopharmacology and human physiological function, C-THREE's production team offers a sustainable, efficient, safe, and effective product development protocol. C-Three has retained the services of a diverse group of professionals with significant agricultural and production experience, each intensely dedicated to C- THREE's mission. Briefly, highlights include: /g1A uniquely experienced product development team that is poised to ensure that all medicine is pure, and that all products are dosed accurately, profiled and labeled clearly, and manufactured to exacting standards. This team includes leading cannabinoid and terpene scientists, Dr. Jeff C. Raber, Ph.D and noted cannabis research scientist Sytze Elzinga, formerly in charge of quality control for all pharmaceutical marijuana entering the Dutch market under contract with the Dutch government. Dr. Raber and Mr. Elzinga have developed and consulted for successful, precisely dosed marijuana products on a commercial scale in the United States and abroad, including cannabis oral products, mechanical products, baked goods, capsules, smoothies, drinks,topical ointments, tinctures, chocolate bars, and even ice cream. Additionally, Dr. Raber and Mr. Elzinga have set the standard in the cannabinoid and cannabis terpene testing market, and are best positioned to meet changing patient demands; they carry extensive experience working with and purifying cannabinoids and, critically, analyzing and working with 37 cannabis terpenes - responsive patient care requires a detailed understanding and analysis ofterpenes, which modulate and modify cannabinoids like THC and CBD /g1As a redundancy to the independent labs, and upon securing approval, an in- house laboratory screening for contaminants and to perform cannabinoid and terpene analysis. The lab will be managed by Dr. Jeff Raber Ph.D and Sytze Elzinga - two leading cannabinoid researchers that have set the standard in medical cannabis screening and profiling, and who have been invited to lecture and present their findings at cannabinoid and terpene conferences in the US, China, the Czech Republic and Germany, including Dr. Raber's seminal presentation on the chemical identification of cannabis varietals at the International Association of Cannabinoid Medicine meeting in Cologne. This expertise is critical to ensuring purity, that the strains are what they purport to be, and that all brands are within the allowed variance under the Regulations. /g1C-THREE enters the market with fully developed and reliable organic cultivation practices as implemented by Phyto Management, 1 of 6 companies 721F. Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[2]that has secured approval to cultivate medical cannabis in Washington D.C. from the Department of Health in the District - a highly competitive and tightly regulated market. Partnering with Phyto mitigates the possibility that other licensed Cultivation Centers will underperform, leaving the remaining businesses to compensate for any resulting shortfall in supply, or an underserved patient population. /g1Safety, security, and strict compliance is critical to successful production. To that end, C-THREE has partnered with Matt D. Cook, author of the Colorado Marijuana Regulatory Scheme and former Senior Director of Enforcement, Colorado Department of Revenue. Mr. Cook has defined medical marijuana compliance for Colorado and the nation, and has been instrumental in the planning and development of the C-THREE organization and its security and compliance measures. /g1C-THREE's cultivation methods all natural (soil), organic, and provides consistently impressive yields. An ideal partner, Phyto employs only organic, sustainable, soil-grown cultivation practices as opposed to hydroponics - a cheaper, more common process in commercial facilities that is less labor- intensive. C-THREE will not tolerate shortcuts nor rely on hydroponics, which will work to differentiate the C-THREE product line - a benefit to qualified patients that demand naturally grown medical cannabis. /g1C-THREE has access to a variety of exclusive cultivars (genetics). Selected and propagated for their specific genetic expressions and therapeutic effects,these cultivars offer consistent yields that consistently alleviate the qualifying conditions. /g1C-THREE's eco-friendly facility has been designed specifically to maximize the output of indoor plants, while minimizing the impact on the environment and surrounding community. Additionally the facility has been designed to meet or exceed any forthcoming FDA regulations, incorporates cleanroom elements, and adheres to the relevant cGMP. C-THREE Production Led by Experienced Cannabis Horticulturalists and Leading Cannabinoid Scientists C-THREE's mission is to provide consistently pure, medical-grade marijuana and consistently dosed medical marijuana infused products (MIP's), designed specifically for patient needs, in strict Compliance with the Connecticut Medical Marijuana Program as codified at Connecticut General Statutes, sections 21a-408et sequens. Our success in fulfilling our vision is measured by dispensary and patient satisfaction, team member excellence and happiness, improvement in the state of the environment, return on capital investment, and community support.. 722F. Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[3]To execute on its mission, and after vetting various top industry candidates, C- THREE has reached agreements with: (1) Werc Labs LLC, a group comprised of renowned cannabinoid scientists and experienced marijuana product designers engaged to oversee and implement the production of marijuana products to exacting standards, and (2) Warnish LLC d/b/a Phyto Management (\"Phyto\") to cultivate superior quality, naturally grown, medical-grade marijuana. Additionally, Matt Cook, author of the Colorado Marijuana Regulatory Scheme and former Senior Director of Enforcement, Colorado Department of Revenue, has been hired as Chief Security and Compliance Consultant. In faithfully executing his office, Mr. Cook oversaw 220 full time employees and a $54 million dollar budget. 2. Werc Labs, LLC: Marijuana Products by Leading Cannabinoid Scientists C-THREE shares DCP's commitment to a healthy Connecticut. Accordingly, after vetting several candidates, C-THREE has partnered with the product development team most capable of meeting patient needs on an ongoing basis: Werc Labs.1 Ensuring patient safety begins with understanding the nature of the plant, and thescientifically appropriate methods of characterizing products derived from the plant. From this knowledge base, products can be produced accurately, consistently, and with the correct mix of 37 different terpenes and cannabinoid weight ratios. This foundation begins with a strong analytical testing protocol, which our team possesses and excels with arguably more so than any other laboratory operating within cannabis in the United States today. Werc scientists have successfully developed or co-developed marijuana products including brownies, cookies, cakes, breads, capsules, smoothies, drinks, topical ointments, tinctures, hard candies, chocolate bars, and even ice cream. Werc is also known for operating the most advanced cannabinoid and, critically, terpene laboratory serving the medical cannabis market in the United States. Werc is second to none in efficacy, consistency, and quality control (QC). Additionally, Werc is best positioned to develop new products with C-THREE as they, uniquely, continue to uncover how 37 different terpenes intereact and treat qualifying conditions - while helpful, merely scrutinizing the weight component of a few cannabinoids (e.g. THC and CBD) is insufficient and leads to different patient outcomes.

Confidential Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[4]Werc was founded by Dr. Jeffrey C. Raber, Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Southern California with a focus on developing new synthetic organic methodologies. Dr. Raber studied plant phylogenetics of the RuBisCO enzyme while at Lebanon Valley College, and was named to the USA Today 1997 All-USA College Academic Team for his research accomplishments in this area. Dr. Raber completed his degree at USC in less than 5 years, and was awarded the Harold and Lillian Moulton Fellowship. Upon receipt of his degree from USC Dr. Raber was asked to join a start-up company as the Director of Product Development where he created new molecular scaffolds for use as starting points in the investigation of new pharmaceuticals by medicinal chemists and successfully transferred proprietary reaction methodology and know-how to a production partner. Dr. Raber was subsequently approached to join another start- up company focusing on development and commercialization of a novel chemical reactor technology. Dr. Raber initially joined the company as the Chief Chemist and thereafter became Vice President and then President, and was appointed as a member of the company's Board of Directors. Dr. Raber frequently works with local educational institutions assisting MBA students in deriving their business plans and evaluating their technologies while continuing to develop and create new technologies of his own. Dr. Raber is an accomplished scientist, patented inventor and seasoned executive with all of the skills necessary to direct The Werc Shop's efforts. Recognizing the need for quality control and assurance in California's Medical Cannabis market, Dr. Raber founded an analytical testing laboratory that provided services to market participants: Werc. Having studied peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to the beneficial impacts of cannabinoid receptor medications, a specialty area for Dr. Raber, he envisioned the means for furthering everyone's understanding and fundamental knowledge of the sustainable medication provided through the use of Cannabis sativa L. derived products. Dr. Raber, Ph.D is an accomplished marijuana product designer and quality assurance specialist, and has presented at cannabinoid and terpene conferences across the United States and abroad. Sytze Elzinga As a cannabinoid scientist and marijuana product designer, Sytze's experience is invaluable and, for lack of a better description, unique. C-THREE is pleased to partner with the only team with meaningful expertise pertaining to the proper analysis and quality control of medicinal cannabis. While at Werc, Sytze continues to push the frontier of scientific understanding of medicinal cannabis. Sytze received his bachelor's degree in biochemistry and subsequently went on to complete his Masters of Science in Natural Product Chemistry from Leiden University in The Netherlands in 2006. Sytze's early research work involved 724F. Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[5]investigations of Artemisinin and sesquiterpene precursors found in dead and green leaves of Artemisia annua L. Additional work involved investigation of the origin of licorice through the use of NMR. Following the completion of his master's thesis Sytze moved on to Farmalyse, a pharmaceutical contract laboratory which performs the quality control and release of pharmaceutical products. Farmalyse possesses the sole contract with the Dutch government for the quality control of the medicinal cannabis provided on prescription through the pharmacies in the national medical marijuana program. At Farmalyse Sytze was responsible for the quality control of all medicinal cannabis for the Dutch pharmaceutical market. Research at Farmalyse was conducted on the extraction and purification of THC from medicinal cannabis. These efforts lead to a spin-off company, Echo Pharmaceuticals, where Sytze was the laboratory manager and was responsible for all laboratory activities. Sytze was responsible for the, creation and validation of cannabinoid standards as well as purification of THC to be used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for the production of a novel tablet, which is currently undergoing Phase II clinical studies. 3.

Striving to Meet Pharmaceutical Industry Standards Although medical marijuana producers are not eligible for certification for Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), or the International Organization for Standards (ISO), C-THREE is committed to adhering to a combination of the operating standards promulgated by those organizations. The additional resources required to execute on thisinitiative should provide a return on investment once cannabis businesses must withstand scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These guidelines taken directly from the cGMP, USP-797, and ISO, include briefly: /g1Facility design strictly accounting for ergonomic flow informed by SOP's, growing and cleaning protocols, and environmental controls; /g1Incorporating building materials prescribed by aforementioned standards of cleanroom design; /g1Integrating regular operational evaluation into procedural design; systemized record keeping; automated monitoring of measures with human knowledge-based management with clearly defined rolesand responsibilities;/g1 6. Experience with Cultivation Techniques The following section details some of C-THREE's experience with cultivationtechniques. A more complete description of C-THREE's cultivation techniques as implemented by Phyto Management is found in the C-THREE Cultivation Plan, found at Appendix G. Phyto employs only sustainable and organic cultivation practices that produce a superior quality product, while working to lower the carbon footprint of the C- THREE Cultivation Center. All fertilizers, liquid nutrients, and soil amendments will be certified organic. Additionally, the Phyto elects for a combination and careful balance of multi-spectrum, high pressure sodium, and plasma lights, as well as CO 2generators and industrial de-humidifiers. The practices and methodologies employed by Phyto have been developed to yield plants with full genetic expression. 6 (a) Living Soils C-THREE strictly uses high quality, living soil mixes and aerated compost 728F. Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[9]teas in its cultivation process. The soil mix is prepared and allowed to stabilize for two weeks to facilitate the growth of microbial populations, which in turn increases the availability of plant nutrients in the soil. Compost tea and other amendments will be used during initial soil preparation and throughout the cultivation process to maintain and augment the healthy microbial activity, ensuring the vitality of the soil- food web. Chief Horticultural Scientist Andras Kirschner has refined a soil mixture with specified ratios of the following ingredients: compost; worm castings; phosphate; greensand; and azomite. Additionally, soil moisture shall be continually monitored to ensure optimal levels of microorganism populations. 6 (b) Full Spectrum Lighting The C-THREE Cultivation Center will use a combination of both High Pressure Sodium (HPS) and Light Emitting Plasma (LEP) lamps. Plants use light to produce chlorophyll cells which enable the plant to conduct photosynthesis \u2014 the process of converting air, water, and light into carbohydrates and oxygen. Aside from this basic function, the various spectrums of light have different complex effects on each species of plant. Though these effects are still not completely understood, many believe a full light spectrum, including some ultraviolet light, plays a role in greater cannabinoid production. A combination of LEP and HPS provides a much better spectrum because the HPS is lacking blue spectrum, and generally most spectrums below 560 nm. Light spectrum is one of the factors that define how a plant develops. There are many mechanisms in a plant that are responsible for stretching, photosynthetic rate and morphogenesis. One effect of blue light is the development of sun leaves which have higher rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf area. Another very important factor is the morphogenesis: Leafs develop in a better position to intercept the light, which results in a higher photosynthesis and faster vegetative development. It also puts the plant in a favorable position for generative development. Additional advantage is the UVA and UVB light that the plasma adds to the spectrum. Blue light and a continuous spectrum is very important in any development phase of the plant, be it vegetative or generative, as the full spectrum contains colors that define photosynthetic rate, morphogenesis and high energy (blue) photons that help maintain the photosynthetic system in the plant during the generative phase. 6 (c) Integrated Pest Management IPM is a holistic approach to managing pests that utilizes cultural practices, biological, and organic pesticide application. When performing the daily walk through special attention will be paid to screening for pests and diseases. C-THREE IPM protocol will consist of the following steps: 729F. Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[10]1. Identifying / Monitoring Pests & Diseases 2. Monitoring the environment 3. Deciding on the proper IPM intervention 4. Implementing the intervention 5. Post-intervention reassessment Identifying / Monitoring Pests & Diseases Monitoring is the foundation of IPM and requires the regular inspection of plants, insect traps, and soil samples. Staff shall make sure to monitor hard-to-see spots like back corners of the room and in between dense vegetation. Special attention will be paid to \"hot spots\" located near doors and vents. Daily observations shall be logged using the iPad. If pests are present, staff shall estimate their number and record date, time of day, temperature, and humidity. Infested plant will be marked with a bright- colored flag for further intervention. Staff shall scout daily for the following pests, diseases, and related issues: /g1Insects - Spider mites, aphids, fungus gnats, thrips, and /g1Fungi and Bacteria - Powdery mildew and/or botrytis /g1Viruses - Hemp mosaic virus and hemp streak virus are very rare. Nutritional Deficiencies - Nutritional deficiency shall be diagnosed by observing characteristic symptoms on foliage. Soil and plant material will be tested to help identify exact nature of nutritional deficiencies. Once problem is identified adjustments will be made to the feeding schedule. Environmental - The indoor environment can be manipulated to help control pests. Sealing the room and raising the levels of CO2 for a short amount of time can combat any signs of insects. Afterwards, the enriched air will be purged until the CO2 level is returned to 1500 ppm. Cultural Practices Cultural and mechanical practices will be used as a preventative measure and consist of the following practices designed to safeguard plant health: Maintain Proper Moisture Levels /g1Staff shall avoid over watering and under watering, as these practices will increase the chances of disease and pest growth. /g1Excess humidity can cause some disease and pests to flourish. Staff shall maintain proper ventilation to keep humidity between acceptable levels. /g1Staff shall monitor temperature changes via the environmentalcontrol computer to ensure that there are no large day / night temperature fluctuations. 730F. Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[11]Optimize soil food web and nutrition /g1Staff shall never over fertilize plants as this will predispose the plants to bacteria, fungi, and leaf eating insects. /g1Adding aerated compost teas will augment the soil food web. /g1Other organic amendments will be added to the soil to augment naturally occurring biological controls of pests and pathogens. /g1Municipal sludge shall never be used. Mechanical insect trapping and monitoring:Insect traps will be used not only to monitor for pests but also to trap and kill them. Blue and yellow sticky traps will be strategically placed throughout the room and checked daily. Prune limbs with fungal infections or insects: Once a plant part is identified as being infected it shall be removed and placed in a plastic container and sealed. It shall then be taken back to the microscope for further identification and disposal. Provide food, water, and habitat for bio-control organisms: The likelihood of a pest infestation is greatly reduced due to the strict policies and procedures designed to keep the facility free of contaminants. In the event that pests are identified, C-THREE horticultural scientist may decide to use predatory insects such as lady bugs to control a pest population. If such a course of action is taken staff will make efforts to sustain the population of predator insects by providing food and habitat. Organically Certified Pesticide Application: If a plant is identified as contaminated it shall be tagged and immediately removed to the quarantine room where the decision to treat or destroy will be made. Organic pesticides approved for use on vegetable food crops will be used only if absolutely necessary and as a last resort. Application rates and techniques will be strictly followed per the instructions on the label of the pesticide. 7. The Organic Difference Management has chosen to cultivate marijuana in an organic and sustainable fashion because it is environmentally responsible and allows the plant to more fully realize its genetic expression. A complete genetic expression allows for whole-plant care, and more effective medical care. The mentality of most medical marijuana cultivators is similar to that of a commercial farmer: maximize output, minimize input. The easiest way to grow large amounts of marijuana is to use a hydroponic system. The plants either spend their entire lives in constantly flowing water or are embedded in a sterile substrate 731F. Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[12]and fed at regular intervals via drip irrigation or a flood table. The water is filled with a potent combination of soluble mineral fertilizers. The debate between hydroponic and organic, soil cultivators rages on. This row can be correlated with the larger debate within the scientific community as to whether organically grown food (fruits, vegetables, etc...) has greater nutritional content than conventionally grown food. In this larger debate conventional food is defined as that which is grown using synthesized inorganic fertilizers, genetically modified cultivars, and/or chemical pesticides or fungicides. Growing plants hydroponically dictates the use of inorganic liquid fertilizers making it a practice that falls under the category of conventionally grown. Within the agricultural industry, farmers must comply with the regulations of the FDA. At a minimum it is known that the products used by farmers, even if they are completely synthetic, have been approved for use in food production. This is not the case for medical marijuana. The FDA does not recognize medical marijuana as a beneficial drug, let alone a food, so there are no regulations regarding the types of fertilizers and/or pesticides/fungicides allowed to be used in its cultivation. Under such conditions many medical marijuana cultivators engage in the dangerous practice of using systemic pesticides meant for ornamental flowers as opposed to edible foods. The legal standing of medical marijuana also prevents it from being certified organic regardless of whether it is grown in such a manner that would meet the requirements set forth by the National Organic Program. The cultivation practices that C-THREE will adhere to were designed by Andras Kirschner to meet the standards of organic certification programs. C-THREE is taking a similar stance to that of GW Pharmaceuticals in that it believes that the therapeutic effects of medical marijuana come as a result of multiple phytochemical compounds working in a synergistic manner. The levels and types of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other phenols differ from strain to strain lending each a host of characteristic therapeutic properties. The medicinal properties of marijuana are a product of secondary metabolites, specifically phenolic compounds. Cannabinoids are phenolic compounds unique to marijuana that are responsible for the bulk of the plant's therapeutic properties, both psychoactive and non-psychoactive. More than sixty (60) cannabinoids have been identified thus far. Terpenes also exist in marijuana but are not unique to the plant. These compounds are responsible for the scent/taste of the plant, and some of them also have therapeutic and anti-bacterial properties. Marijuana also contains powerful anti-oxidants called flavonoids. Most studies management has reviewed commonly measure a level of \"total phenolic compounds,\" (often abbreviated as TP). A 2003 study published in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry concludes, \"...results demonstrate a statistically relevant trend of higher levels of TPs in organically and sustainably produced crops.\" This study looked at the differences in TP between organic and 732F. Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[13]sustainably grown marion berries, strawberries, and corn, as opposed to conventionally grown. The study found organically grown strawberries to have \"19.1% more TP's than conventionally grown. Organically grown and air-dried corn was found to have 58.4% higher levels of TP than the conventionally grown.\" Another article published in 2007 in the same journal reported findings from a ten year study comparing flavonoid content in organic and conventionally grown tomatoes. This group of scientists also found that the organic method of cultivation employed throughout the study yielded tomatoes with higher flavanoid and total phenolic content. This article's introduction also mentions other studies which yielded similar conclusions. 8. Extraction Experience C-THREE's product development team includes experienced extraction technicians that strictly employ solvent-free extraction techniques. Dr. Raber and Mr. Elzinger's extraction methods are proprietary, and consistently produce highly pure extracts. C-THREE's technicians are also experienced with, and can utilize, three (3) common, solvent-free extraction techniques. Specifically, great success has been had with: Dry Sieve Extraction (DSE), Cold-Water Extraction (CWE), and Direct Heat Infusion (DHI). Each is effective in working with the cannabinoid and terpenoid-rich resin heads, and without (the commonly used) toxic petroleum distillates or environmentally harmful tactics. Extraction, Generally Before any extraction can commence, stems, fan leaves, and general plant debris must be carefully removed. This process is performed by Phyto Management's skilled cultivation support team - proper handling of the raw flower is critical in preserving the purity of the flower, and the integrity of the cannabinoid-rich resin heads. The resulting plant material is processed utilizing a dry sieve, and then subjected to cold water extraction or direct heat infusion. See sections 6a-c, infra, for additional detail. Once extracted, cannabinoids and terpenes, can be consumed via pulmonary uptake (vapor or smoke). Alternatively, the extract can be infused directly into butters, cooking oils, alcohols, and hypoallergenic moisturizers for optimal transdermal absorption or metabolizing. In the C-THREE production facility, such infusion will occur in the Magical Botanical Extractor - a stainless steel, industrial-grade processor designed specifically for botanical extraction and infusion. Humorous name aside the appliance is fully automated; a microprocessor effects a set of sequences depending on the substrate to be infused. Temperature is controlled by an integrated digital thermostat that maintains the micro-climate between 160-250degrees Fahrenheit. After the infusion, the substrate is strained of plant material and ready for laboratory testing. 733F. Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[14]The appliance was manufactured to /g1Tincture - vegetable oil /g1Avocado oil /g1Hypoallergenic Moisturizers 8 (a) Dry Sieve Extraction DSE is labor intensive, especially when performed by hand, as C-THREE has committed to. It is highly effective, however, in isolating the resin powder from the plant material - a necessary step in concentration - without compromising the integrity of the cannabinoid essential oils and critical terpenes. Resin powder consists of the encapsulated, bulbous glands which are filled with viscous cannabinoid and terpene concentrations. Once isolated, collected, and processed, the concentrate is readily and consistently dosed during the infusion process, after strict lab screens for purity and profiling. The remaining plant material (fan leaves, stems, small flowers) can be processed via cold-water extraction to create additional concentrate. 8 (b) Cold Water Extraction The plant debris (e.g. leaves, stems, etc) can yield quality and substantial amounts of concentrate in CWE. Fresh or dry plant material is placed in a sterile mesh bag, and submerged in a bath of ice water in a commercial grade, stainless steel washing machine. The machine gently agitates the water for approximately 30 minutes. Next, the water is drained and strained through additional screens that allow the dislodged resin glands to sink rapidly to the bottom of the collection well, where can be collected and dried. Unlike the resin glands, the essential oils dissolve when exposed to the cold water, so this technique produces a concentrate with less terpennes than the previously described dry sieve technique. 8 (c) Direct Heat Infusion Cannabinoids and terpenes are readily dissolvable in vegetable oils which may be used for both extraction and as a substrate. Oils are for the most part non-soluble in water and therefore they do not extract excessive water soluble constitutes, like chlorophyll. There are practical limits to the potency that can be achieved extracting with oil, because as the oil becomes saturated with cannabis terpenes the solvent action slows down before stopping altogether. A key factor in achieving maximum removal rates and efficiency, is keeping the boundary layer between the un- dissolved resins and the unsaturated oils used for extraction regularly removed and this is accomplished by mixing 734F.

Raber Ph.D and noted research scientist Sytze Elzinga, at least four (4) samples of each batch of harvested marijuana shall be Standard Plate Count tested to verify the batch is free of bacteria, molds, andfungi. Cannabinoid profiling will be completed in-house using, when economically feasible, a quadrupole mass spectrometer / liquid chromatograph, in addition to the registered, independent laboratories in Connecticut. A sample profile has been attached to the end of the document. Additionally, all harvested and dried marijuana will be tested for bacteria, mold, fungi, terpenes, and cannabinoid profiles prior to being prepackaged for Cannabinoids Antibiotic /g1cannabichromene Analgesic, Euphoriant 10. Terpenoid Profiling Led C-THREE's product developers Jeff Raber and Sytze Elzinga, Werc was the first laboratory to begin profiling terpenes within medicinal cannabis in the summer of 2011. Werc remains the leader in this new frontier, screening for 37 different terpenes using advanced gas-chromatographic techniques. Terpenes are critical to confirming that a strain is the particular strain it is claimed to be, and they are ultimately responsible for delivering the complex effects provided by whole plant medicinal cannabis products . Comparing the values of THC, CBD, CBN (an artifact of improper analysis which does not actually exist in fresh flowers), and other basic cannabinoid will not reveal whether a strain is most helpful in treating a qualifying condition; cannabisis far more complex than one or two cannabinoids. Terpenes modify and modulate the effects of THC and other cannabinoids, and impact the overall medicinal properties of the particular cultivar. Terpenes are also predominant players in the smell and taste of medicinal cannabis. 735F. Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[16]Terpenes are all flavor and fragrance components common to human diets, and they have been designated \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" by the US Food and Drug Administration. Terpenes share a common precursor with phytocannabinoids and they are quite potent, being known to affect animal and even human behavior when inhaled from ambient air at serum levels in the single digit ng/mL range. It doesn't take much of them to make a physiological impact. Terpenes display unique therapeutic effects that may contribute to the overall effects of medicinal cannabis; a reason whole based medicines are superior to single-molecule cannabinoid therapies like Marinol\u00ae or other synthetics like Rimonabant. The synergy of terpenes and cannabinoids are most likely responsible for providing the effective treatment of pain, anxiety, epilepsy, inflammation, depression, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Terpenes are the components responsible for the plethora of powerful medicinal benefits delivered by cannabis. A recent publication by Ethan Russo of GW Pharmaceuticals in the British Journal of Pharmacology (http://10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01238.x) describes this effect, which is now being termed the entourage effect. For medicinal cannabis patients to receive the proper medication, finding the right strain/product required to meet their medical needs, they will need to understand the terpene content and seek to harness the complete entourage effect being delivered by their particular strain selection. To our knowledge, Werc is unique in the breadth of terpenes it analyzes; thus it is only lab that can possess a fundamental understanding of a cannabis strain at this time. Recently a particular cultivator discovered this important differentiation. Having submitted a variety of new strains they were working on developing, unique terpene profiles were observed. Out of approximately 10 different samples submitted, if you were to only look at THC and CBD content, the strains would have appeared only average and non-unique. However, comparing their terpene profiles revealed significantly new strains had been created which possessed profiles unlike anything our laboratory had seen before. If these samples were processed at another lab, they most likely would have sacrificed these new strains assuming they were still common. Initial explorations are exceptionally promising, and the patients being positively impacted by these unique strains are the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently there is not a great deal of information known about the terpenes and their combined effect with the cannabinoids present in cannabis, and certainly not in any vast combination like you experience with any strain you encounter today. Individually there is a small understanding of some of the effects of these molecules in general, and can be described as follows. Pinenes: Pine odor, bronchodilators that opens the lungs to possibly improve THC absorption. Responsible for increasing focus, self-satisfaction, and energy. 736F. Confidential 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6[17]Caryophyllene: Sweet, woody, clove taste responsible and neuroprotective effects through CB2 receptor activation. Linalool: Floral smell that is believed to provide some anti-cancer effects as well as being known to cause severe sedation. Limonene: Has a citrus scent and may possess anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti- fungal and anti-depression abilities. Myrcene: Most likely effects intake of THC by brain cells to increase the overall effects of THC when ingested together. It is important to note that while the effects listed above were predominantly found for the single component being studied individually. The effects within a cannabis matrix may be far different than when delivered alone. We strongly suggest patients seek to understand their preferred strains by identifying the top few terpenes (now found on our labels) and continue to seek the same medicine in the future through identification of a similar top terpene fingerprint, whether or not the name of the strain is the same. C-THREE wants to develop the best natural products for the registered patients of Connecticut, and is pleased to be partnered with the scientists capable of properly investigating and analyzing terpenes. C-THREE intends to develop the next generation of cannabis therapeutics truly designed to address specific conditions. In fact, Werc scientists have recently developed new product formulations and processing methods for a variety of products, including capsules, edibles,tinctures.

Scope & Intent This document outlines the operational details of how the proposed Cultivation Center will consistently meet the demands of the reg istered dispensaries while remaining in compliance with the Regulations. 2. Mission C-THREE's mission is to consistently provide superior-quality, medical-grade marijuana in flower form, bioavailable ingestible items, and other preparations to Connecticut'sregistered patients. C-THREE aims to set new standards for secure, safe, scientificmedical marijuana cultivation. The C-THREE Cultivation Center will house growing, processing, production, and packaging facilities. The Co mpany's operational designs and manufacturing standards are based on those of the pharmaceutical industry, and incorporate cleanroom elements. Suchan approach has been taken to ensure that the quality of C-THREE products and servicesmeet and exceed the requirements as set forth by the Connecticut Regulations. 3. Timeline Once granted a registration, and after commencing construction, the C-THREECultivation Center will be fully operationa l within ninety (90) days. It will take approximately sixteen (16) more weeks to grow, harvest, cure, and package the first batchof medical marijuana. Initially, subsequent harvests will occur every two (2) weeks. The basis for the aforementioned time estimates are C-THREE's (1) experience in organic cultivation, (2) experience in the const ruction industry; and m ore specifically (3) the design and construction of the C-THREE Cultivation Center. 4. Werc Labs, LLC: Marijuana Products by Leading Cannabinoid Scientists C-THREE shares DCP's commitment to a h ealthy Connecticut. Accordingly, after vetting several candidates, C-THREE has part nered with the product development team most capable of meeting patient needs on an ongoing basis: Werc Labs. 1 Ensuring patient safety begins with understanding the nature of the plant, and thescientifically appropriate methods of characterizing products derived from the plant.From this knowledge base, products can be produced accurately, consistently, and withthe correct mix of 37 different terpenes and cannabinoid weight ratios. This foundationbegins with a strong analytical testing protocol, which our team possesses and excels witharguably more so than any other laboratory operating within cannabis in the United Statestoday. Werc scientists have successfully developed or co-developed marijuana products including brownies, cookies, cakes, breads, capsules, smoothies, drinks, topical 1 Werc Labs LLC is an entity created by The Werc Shop LLC for the purposes of operating in Connecticut under the C-THREE license ConfidentialG.1 743 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6ointments, tinctures, hard candies, chocolate bars, and even ice cream. Werc is also known for operating the most advanced cannabinoid and, critically, terpene laboratory serving the medical cannabis market in the United States. Werc is second to none in efficacy, consistency, a nd quality control (QC). Additionally, Werc is best positioned to develop new products with C-THREE as they, uniquely, continue to uncover how 37 different terpenes intereact and treat qualifying conditions - while helpful, merely scrutinizing the weight component of a few cannabinoids (e.g. THC and CBD) is insufficient and leads to different patient outcomes. Dr. Jeffrey C. Raber, PhD Werc was founded by Dr. Jeffrey C. Raber, Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Southern California with a focus on developi ng new synthetic organic methodologies. Dr. Raber studied plant phylogenetics of the RuBisCO enzyme while at Lebanon Valley College, and was named to the USA Today 1997 All-USA College Academic Team for his research accomplishments in this area. Dr. Raber completed his degree at USC in less than 5 years, and was awarded the Harold and Lillian Moulton Fellowship. Upon receipt of his degree from USC Dr. Raber was asked to join a start-up company as the Director of Product Development where he created new molecular scaffolds for use as starting points in the investigation of new pharmaceuticals by medicinal chemists and successfully transferred proprietary reacti on methodology and know-how to a production partner. Dr. Raber was subsequently approached to join another start-up company focusing on development and commercialization of a novel chemical reactor technology. Dr. Raber initially joined the company as the Chief Chemist and thereafter became Vice President and then President, and was appointed as a member of the company's Board of Directors. Dr. Raber frequently works with local educational institutions assisting MBA students in deriving their business plans and evaluating their technologies while continuing to develop and create new t echnologies of his own. Dr. Raber is an accomplished scientist, patented inventor and seasoned executive with all of the skills necessary to direct The Werc Shop's efforts. Recognizing the need for quality control and assurance in California's Medical Cannabis market, Dr. Raber founded an analytical testing laboratory that provided services to market participants: Werc. Having studied peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to the beneficial impacts of cannabinoid receptor medications, a specialty area for Dr. Raber, he envisioned the means for furthering everyone's understanding and fundamental knowledge of the sustainable medication provided through the use of Cannabis sativa L. derived products. Dr. Raber, Ph.D is an accomplished mar ijuana product designer and quality assurance specialist, and has presented at cannabinoid and terpene conferences across the United States and abroad. Sytze Elzinga As a cannabinoid scientist and marijuana product designer, Sytze's experience is invaluable and, for lack of a better description, unique. C-THREE is pleased to partner ConfidentialG.1 744 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6with the only team with meaningful exper tise pertaining to the proper analysis and quality control of medicinal cannabis. While at Werc, Sytze continues to push the frontier of scientific understanding of medicinal cannabis. Sytze received his bachelor's degree in biochemistry and subsequently went on to complete his Masters of Science in Natural Product Chemistry from Leiden University in The Netherlands in 2006. Sytze's early research work involved investigations of Artemisinin and sesquiterpene precursors found in dead and green leaves of Artemisia annua L. Additional work involved investig ation of the origin of lic orice through the use of NMR. Following the completion of his master's thesis Sytze moved on to Farmalyse, a pharmaceutical contract laboratory which performs the quality control and release of pharmaceutical products. Farmalyse possesses the sole contract with the Dutch government for the quality control of the medicinal cannabis provided on prescriptionthrough the pharmacies in the national medical marijuana program. At Farmalyse Sytze was responsible for the quality control of all medicinal cannabis for the Dutch pharmaceutical market. Research at Farmalyse was conducted on the extraction and purification of THC from medicinal cannabis. These efforts lead to a spin-off company, Echo Pharmaceuticals, where Sytze was the laboratory manager and wa s responsible for all laboratory activities. Sytze was responsible for the, creation and validation of cannabinoid standards as well as purification of THC to be used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for the production of a novel tablet, which is currently undergoing Phase II clinical studies. 5. Phyto Management: Agricultural and Cannabis Cultivation Experience Phyto Management is a marijuana-cultivation and operational management companywith deep experience in all aspects of commercial cannabis cultivation and production. Besting more than 80-plus would-be applicants, Phyto was recently awarded approval tooperate a medical cannabis cultivation center in Washington DC by the DC Departmentof Health, a highly regulated medical marijuana market under strict scrutiny. 2 Phyto's Managing Member, Mr. Andras Kirschner, carries with him more than a decade ofrelevant, commercial experience, and has advanced degrees in Plant Science and Sustainable Agriculture from the University of Maine. In addition to his Bachelor's Degrees from University of Maine, Mr. Kirschner is six (6) credits shy of his Masters inBusiness Administration (MBA) from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles - adistinction he has placed on hold to further the success of Phyto Management. Supported by his able staff, Mr. Kirsc hner will manage and oversee the design, construction, and operation of the C-THREE cultivation facility. The cultivation processes and protocol designed and perfected by Mr. Kirchner is at the core of the C-THREE business model. The operation is a scalable, perpetual harvestcultivation model designed to produce pure, organ ic yields at regular intervals. In customizing his cultivation protocol for the C-THREE facility, Mr. Kirschner worked closely with architects, contractors, and a draftswoman to design an eco-friendly facility 2Phyto Management LLC is a separate cannabis cultivation entity operating in Washington DC under license from the Department of Health in the District. Mr. Kirschner is the founder and Managing Member of that DC entity, and Warnish LLC d/b/a Phyto Management, C-THREE's cultivation partner. ConfidentialG.1 745 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6capable of efficient yet large yields. With more than 12 years of commercial scale, highly specialized experience, Mr. Kirschner and Phyto are poised to oversee the production of pure, organic medical marijuana in the state of Connecticut. While earning degrees in Sustainable Agriculture and Plant Science at the University of Maine, Mr. Kirschner solely managed the Black Bear Food Guild, and successfully shepherded the Guild through the organic certification process as administered by the Maine Organic Farmers and Growers Association, (MOFGA). Established in 1994, the Black Bear Food Guild is a community supported, agricultural initiative that managed acres of organic produce, and delivered and sold fresh fruits and vegetables to 60 shareholders comprised of local businesses including restaurants and grocery stores. After obtaining his B.S. degree, Mr. Kirschner moved to Vermont, where he founded and established Stony View Farms - an organic farm set on 90 acres of land purchased from the Vermont Land Trust. From 2004 to 2006 Mr. Kirschner raised organic produce in 3,000 square feet of Greenhous e space and 2 acres of land. He sold produce to local restaurants and health food stores. Mr. Kirschner sold the farm in 2009. In addition to his extensive scientific knowl edge and practical cultivation experience, Mr. Kirschner is also a professional contractor and carpenter, and has served as general contractor on multi-million dolla r construction projects. Havi ng led and worked with teams of subcontractors and carpenters in th e construction of high-end residential homes in Vermont and Oakland, Mr. Kirschner will work with and manage C-THREE's general contractor upon securing final approval. A unique blend of contractor and cannabis cultivation specialist, Mr. Kirschner is well-suited to lead these initiatives. Additionally, in 2010, Mr. Kirschner moved to Los Angeles to pursue a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) at Loyola Marymount University. He is 6 credits shy of earning this distinction, which he has placed on hold to further the success of Phyto Management. In 2011, Mr. Kirschner formed Phyto Management LLC in Washington, DC to apply for one of ten Cultivation Center licenses. Bestin g more than 80 would-be applicants, Phyto was awarded one of the first six (6) licenses issued by the DC Department of Health. 6. Facility Design Years of research combined with the experience of building and managing greenhouses as well as experience in the construction industry have given Mr. Kirschner aninterdisciplinary understanding of the design elements necessary to create the idealindoor growing environment. Mr. Kirschner worked with architects to design a state ofthe art facility utilizing the newest technologies available on the market. The Cultivation Center will contain thirty-three (33) separate rooms built within a preexisting structure. Initially, marijuana will be cultivated in six (6) and processed in six (6) newly constructed, freestanding, sealed rooms. All sealed rooms will be independently cooled with ductless air conditioners. All odor within the sealed roomswill be filtered by activated carbon air scrubbers. ConfidentialG.1 746 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6The thirty-three (33) rooms shall (2) Vegetative Rooms; four (4) Flowering Rooms; six (6) Processing Rooms; one (1) Curing & Drying Room; one (1) Nutrient Mixing & Amendment Storage Room; one (1) Pesticide Storage Room; one (1) Soil Mixing & Stabilization Room; one (1) Kitchen; one (1) Extraction Room; one (1) Kitchen lab room; one (1) Security Monitoring Room; two (2) Locker Rooms; one (1) Conference Room; one (1) Company Lounge; one (1) Security/Check-In room; two (2) Restrooms; one (1) Cloning Station; one (1) Mother Room; one (1) Vault Room; one (1) Secure Storage Room; one (1) Utilities Room; and one (1) loading dock. The environmental conditions in each of these rooms, including temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels, will be monitore d and controlled separately so as to facilitate the various stages of the marijuana life cycle, supply preparation, storage, and ingestible item manufacturing. The Cultivation Center will be built to a set of specifications based on those used in the construction of pharmaceutical laboratories. The following materials will be used in the construction of the facility: /g120Water resistant drywall /g120Anti-microbial, anti-fungal paints /g120Anti-bacterial, hospital-grade flooring & anti-fatigue mats In addition to meeting all Washington D.C. bu ilding codes the Cultivation Center will be constructed acc ording to the following additional requirements. /g120Light tight rooms /g120Completely sealed rooms with seamless joints and abutments The biological safety of this facility, deta iled further in the Product Safety and Labeling Plan, will allow C-THREE to cultivate medical marijuana of the highest quality without using any harmful chemical pesticides. Included below are brief descriptions of the rooms that are especially pertinent to medical marijuana cultivation and medical marijuana product manufacturing. 6 (a) Vegetative Rooms Each of these sealed growth chambers will have a light tight set of doors and a computer controlled environmental system including: lights, HEPA/HVAC, dehumidifiers, fans, and CO 2 generators. These rooms will be located within the Limited Access Area. Light levels will be lower than in the flowering rooms. Humidity will be kept at 65% during the vegetative state. The plants will go through their first eight (8) weeks of growth in the vegetative rooms. 6 (b) Flowering Rooms Each of these sealed growth chambers will have a light tight set of doors and a computer controlled environmental system including: lights, HEPA/HVAC, dehumidifiers, fans, and CO2 generators. These systems will be used to maintain ConfidentialG.1 747 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6optimal growth conditions for the various strains cultivated by C-THREE. 6 (c) Security Monitoring Room This room will contain computers connected to the environmental control systems, security surveillance/alarm systems, DVR, as well as a separate computer for the storage of POS records and books. 6 (d) Processing Room Harvested medical marijuana will be trimmed in this area. Additionally, trimmings that will be further processed a nd used to manufacture ingestible items will be separated and packaged here. Green spectrum lights will be used in this room in order to prevent cannabinoid degradation. 6 (e) Drying Room After being trimmed or as whole plants, medical marijuana will be taken to this room to be dried. The humidity and temperature of this room will be strictly monitored in order to optimize the moisture level of the marijuana prior to packaging. The temperature will be kept at 68 F and 55% humidity for the first three days of drying when the plant material will decrease to 30-40% water content. Then th e temperature will be dropped to 64 F and the humidity will be raised to 60% for 7-10 days or until the plant matter is between 12-15% water content. The air exchange within this room will not exceed 10% of total air volume per hour. 6 (f) Curing Room The curing process will take anywhere between 2-4 weeks depending upon demand. Curing takes place in a dark room 64 F degrees and 50% humidity. The air exchange within this room will not exceed 10% of total air volume per hour. Curing cannabis will increase the intensity of the flavor and will steadily lower THC in favor of other cannabinoids. Th e flavor changes and becomes more complex and refined, gaining depth as well as variation of bouquet. After the curing process is finished, bulk items will be packaged and placed in the vault. 6 (f) Nutrient Mix & Amendment Storage Room This locked storage room is located in the Limited Access Area and next to the growth chambers. Reverse Osmosis water will be stored in tanks and transferred to reservoirs before mixing each batch nutrient batch for specific rooms. Nutrients will be mixed and the pH w ill be balanced before the food is fed through irrigation lines to the plants. A plumbing specialist will professionally install these systems. 6 (g) Soil Mixing & Stabilization Room Living soils will be mixed, and put into th e large pots in this area. Each pot will eventually contain one (1) plant. Compost t eas and liquid nutrients are also mixed and aerated in this room. After pots have been filled with the living soil mix, which has been subsequently primed with liquid nutrients, they shall be stored. This will allow the soil time to stabilize before the next round of clones is planted. ConfidentialG.1 748 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6The soil filled pots will remain in this room until the temperature of the soil has become stable. 6 (h) Pesticide Storage Room Pesticides will be stored separately from fertilizers, nutrients and amendments. This will eliminate the risk of cross conta mination that could occur as a result of a pesticide container leaking or breaking due to some anomalous event, or employee error. A special ventilation system will be installed in this room as to make sure no odors leak into the work environment 6 (i) Gowning Room As further detailed in the Product Safety & Labeling Plan and the Staff Handbook, the C-THREE Cultivation Center will contain a gowning room. Staff working within the Cultivation Center shall follow gowning procedures and change into provided pocket less sterile garments prior to entering the Limited Access Areas of the Cultivation Center. 6 (j) The Kitchen The licensed C-THREE Kitchen will be built to code and shall contain all of the equipment necessary for manufacturing, storing, and packaging ingestible items. The Kitchen shall also have its own ventilation system with an active carbon filter that will eliminate any noticeable aromas from exhausted air. 6 (k) Air Quality All air coming into the Cultivation Cent er will pass through HEPA filters that catch 99.9% of airborne contaminants including bacteria, mold, pests, and particulate pollutants. The whole bu ilding HEPA filtration system will continuously filter all air within the warehouse that contains the Cultivation Center. A specifically designed UV Air Purifier will be installed in the air- conditioning housing units to change the molecular structure of the contaminants through DNA Sterilization and Photo-Oxida tion. This sterilization process will destroy both biological and chemical contaminates, killing mold, bacteria and viruses. 6 (l) Odor The activated carbon filters strategically placed throughout the Cultivation Center shall remove over 99% of all odors. These filters will continuously exhaust air from the warehouse creating negative pressure. This pressure gradient ensures that no odor leaks out. Additionally, air w ithin the sealed rooms inside of the Cultivation Center will be cycled t hrough a separate set of these filters. Most commercial filters advertise a 12 to 24 month effective life for each filter, and accordingly advise operators to chan ge filters every twelve (12) months. However, C-THREE policies require that all filters be changed every nine (9) months without fail. 7. Internal Modular Expansion (IME) ConfidentialG.1 749 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6The facility located at 182 E Aurora, rbury, CT. has a footpri nt of approximately 38,400 with additional floors in some parts of the building. C-THREE will initially build out 8,000 square feet of Cultivation rooms which will be a mix of (2) vegetative and (4) flowering rooms. The remaining 8,000 square feet of (IME 1) expansion will be fra med and partially cons tructed. When patient demand begins to reach the production capacity of the initial 8,000 square feet of cultivation space, C- THREE will equip the previously constructe d rooms and begin phase (2) cultivation. A second internal modular expansion project (I ME 2) will involve building an additional 16,000 square feet of Cultivation space in the rear of the building. Using this Internal Modular Expansion C-THRE E will effectively double its maximum production capacity twice without interrupting production in the current facility or neighborhood. Initially, there will be a total of four (4) flow ering rooms. IME will consist of building another four (4) flowering rooms. A second IME will involv e building an additional 8 flowering rooms. When the expansion plan is completed there will be a total of sixteen (16) flowering rooms occupying 24,000 square feet and six (6) large vegetative rooms occupying 7,500 square feet of the building. Th e Cultivation Center has been designed so that these expansion projects can be completed in multiple phases without disrupting the perpetual-harvest. Moreover, IME will minimize any impact on the surrounding communities by confining company production to a single property and building. /g120Initially (4) Flower rooms total = 6,ooo squa re feet of dedicated flowering space /g120IME 1 - (8) Flower rooms total = 12,000 square feet of dedicated flowering space /g120IME 2 - (16) Flower rooms total = 24,000 square feet of dedicated flowering space 8. Expected Production Capacity The bases for these estimates are C-THREE's (1) experience in organic cultivation, (2) experience in the construction industry, and more specifically (3) the design and construction of marijuana cultivation facilit ies. Cultivating large plants indoors takes experience to master, but once a perpetual system is developed large yields can be achieved. /g120Each flower room is approximately (25) f eet x (60) feet or (1,500) square feet; /g120Each flower room will have (60) x (1,000) wa tt High Pressure Sodium lights /g120Each flower room will have (60) x (270) watt Light Emitting Plasma lights /g120Each (1,500) square foot flower room will have a total of (80,000) kW; /g120On average the cultivator yields (1.5) to (2) pounds per 1,000 kW light. /g120Yields of (100) lbs. to (160) lbs. can be expected per harvest per flowering room; Each flower room can be harvested a minimum of 4 times a year and a maximum of 5 times per year depending on strain and other factors and therefore; /g120(1) Flower room can produce 400 - 600 lbs. per year; /g120(4) Flower rooms can produce 1,600 - 2,500 lbs. per year; /g120(8) Flower rooms can produce 3,200 - 5,000 lbs. per year, and ConfidentialG.1 750 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6/g120(16) Flower rooms can produce 6,400 - 9,000 lbs. per year 9. Cultivation Practices Andras Kirschner, the Chief Horticultural Scientist, will employ sustainable and organic cultivation practices that produce a superi or quality product while working to lower the carbon footprint of the C-THREE Cu ltivation Center. All fertiliz ers, liquid nutrients, and soil amendments will be certified organic. Additionally, the CHS will employ multi- spectrum high pressure sodium a nd plasma lights as well as CO 2 generators and industrial de-humidifiers. The practices and methodologies employed by the CHS have been developed to yield plants with full genetic expression. 9 (a) Living Soils C-THREE shall use high quality, living soil mixes and aerated compost teas during the cultivation process. The soil mix will be prepared and allowed to stabilize for two weeks to facilitate the growth of microbial populations which in turn shall increase the availability of plant nutrients in the soil. Compost tea and other amendments will be used during initial soil preparation and throughout the cultivation process to mainta in and augment the healthy microbial activity which will ensure the vitality of the soil-food web. Chief Horticultural Scientist Andras Kirschner has refined a soil mixture with specified ratios of the following ingredie nts: compost; and azomite. A dditionally, soil moisture shall be continually monitored to ensure optimal levels of microorganism populations. 9 (b) Full Spectrum Lighting The C-THREE Cultivation Center will us e a combination of both High Pressure Sodium (HPS) and Light Emitting Plasma (LEP) lamps. Plants use light to produce chlorophyll cells which enable the plant to conduct photosynthesis \u2014 the process of converting air, water, and light into carbohydrates and oxygen. Aside from this basic function, the various spectrums of light have different complex effects on each species of plant. Thoug h these effects are still not completely understood, many believe a full light spectrum, including some ultraviolet light, plays a role in greater cannabinoid production. A combination of LEP and HPS provides a much better spectrum because the HPS is lacking blue spectrum, and generally most spectrums below 560 nm. One effect of blue light is the development of sun leaves which have higher rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf area. Another very important factor is the morphogenesis: Leafs develop in a better position to intercept the light, which results in a higher photosynthesis and faster vegetative development. It also puts the plant in a favorable position for generative development. Additional advantage is the UVA and UVB light that the plasma adds to the spectrum. Blue light and a continuous spectrum is very important in any development phase of the plant, be it vegetative or generative, as the full spectrum contains colors that define photosynthetic rate, morphogenesis and high energy (blue) photons that help maintain the photosynthetic system in the plant during the generative phase. ConfidentialG.1 751 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 69 (c) Integrated Pest Management IPM is a holistic approach to managing pests that utilizes cultural practices, biological, and organic pesticide application. When performing the daily walk through special attention will be paid to screening for pests and diseases. C- THREE IPM protocol will consist of the following steps: 1. Identifying / Monitoring Pests & Diseases2. Monitoring the environment3. Deciding on the proper IPM intervention4. Implementing the intervention5. Post-intervention reassessment Identifying / Monitoring Pests & Diseases Monitoring is the foundation of IPM and requires the regular inspection of plants, insect traps, and soil samples. Staff shall make sure to monitor hard-to-see spots like back corners of the room and in between dense vegetation. Special attention will be paid to \"hot spots\" located near doors and vents. Daily observations shall be logged using the iPad. If pests are present, staff shall estimate their number and record date, time of day, temperature, and humidity. Infested plant will be marked with a bright-colored flag for further intervention. Staff shall scout daily for the following pests, diseases, and related issues: /g120Insects - Spider mites, aphids, fungus gnats, thrips, and /g120Fungi and Bacteria - Powdery mildew and/or botrytis /g120Viruses - Hemp mosaic virus and hemp streak virus are very rare. Nutritional Deficiencies - Nutritional deficiency shall be diagnosed by observing characteristic symptoms on foliage. Soil a nd plant material will be tested to help identify exact nature of nutritional de ficiencies. Once problem is identified adjustments will be made to the feeding schedule. Environmental - The indoor environment can be manipulated to help control pests. Sealing the room and raising the levels of CO2 for a short amount of time can combat any signs of insects. Afterwards, the enriched air will be purged until the CO2 level is returned to 1500 ppm. Cultural Practices Cultural and mechanical practices will be used as a preventative measure and consist of the following practices designed to safeguard plant health: Maintain Proper Moisture Levels /g120Staff shall avoid over watering and under watering, as these practices will increase the chances of disease and pest growth. /g120Excess humidity can cause some disease and pests to flourish. Staff shall maintain proper ventilation to keep humidity between acceptable levels. /g120Staff shall monitor temperature changes via the environmental control computer to ensure that there are no large day / night temperature ConfidentialG.1 752 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6fluctuations. Optimize soil food web and nutrition /g120Staff shall never over fertilize plants as this will predispose the plants to bacteria, fungi, and leaf eating insects. /g120Adding aerated compost teas will augment the soil food web. /g120Other organic amendments will be added to the soil to augment naturally occurring biological control s of pests and pathogens. /g120Municipal sludge shall never be used. Mechanical insect trapping and monitoring:Insect traps will be used not only to mo nitor for pests but also to trap and kill them. Blue and yellow sticky traps w ill be strategically placed throughout the room and checked daily. Prune limbs with fungal infections or insects: Once a plant part is identified as being infected it shall be removed and placed in a plastic container and sealed. It shall then be taken back to the microscope for further identification and disposal. Provide food, water, and habitat for bio-control organisms: The likelihood of a pest infestation is greatly reduced due to the strict policies and procedures designed to keep the facility free of contaminants. In the event that pests are identified, C-THREE horticultural scientist may decide to use predatory insects such as lady bugs to control a pest population. If such a course of action is taken staff will make efforts to sustain the population of predator insects by providing food and habitat. Organically Certified Pesticide Application: If a plant is identified as contamin ated it shall be tagged and immediately removed to the quarantine room where the decision to treat or destroy will be made. Organic pesticides approved for use on vegetable food crops will be used only if absolutely necessary and as a last resort. Application rates and techniques will be strictly followed per the instruc tions on the label of the pesticide. 10. The Organic Difference Management has chosen to cultivate marijuana in an organic and sustainable fashion not only because it is environmentally responsibl e, but also because C-THREE believes that this practice allows plants to more fully realize their gene tic traits. The company believes such full expression results in more potent, and effective medicinal plant. The mentality of most medical marijuana cultivators is very similar to that of a commercial farmer: maximize output, minimize input. The easiest way to grow large amounts of marijuana is to use a hydroponic system. The plants either spend their entirelives in constantly flowing water or are embedded in a sterile substrate and fed at regular ConfidentialG.1 753 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6intervals via drip irrigation or a flood table. The water is filled with a potent combination of soluble mineral fertilizers. The debate between hydroponic and organic, soil cultivators rages on. This row can be correlated with the larger debate within the scientific community as to whether organically grown food (fruits, vegetables, etc...) has greater nutritional content than conventionally grown food. In this larger debate conventional food is defined as that which is grown using synthesized inorganic fe rtilizers, genetically modified cultivars, and/or chemical pesticides or fungicides. Growing plants hydroponically dictates the use of inorganic liquid fertilizers making it a practice that falls under the category of conventionally grown. Within the agricultural industry, farmers must comply with the regulations of the FDA. At a minimum it is known that the products used by farmers, even if they are completely synthetic, have been approved for use in food production. This is not the case for medical marijuana. The FDA does not recognize medical marijuana as a beneficial drug, let alone a food, so there are no regulations rega rding the types of fertilizers and/or pesticides/fungicides allowed to be used in its cultivation. Under such conditions many medical marijuana cultivators engage in the dangerous practice of using systemic pesticides meant for ornamental flowers as opposed to edible foods. The legal standing of medical marijuana also prevents it from being certified organic regardless of whether it is grown in such a manner that would meet the requirements set forth by the National Organic Program. The cultivation practices that C-THREE will adhere to were designed by Andras Kirschner to meet the standards of organic certification programs. C-THREE is taking a similar stance to that of GW Pharmaceuticals in that it believes that the therapeutic effects of medical marijuana come as a result of multiple phytochemical compounds working in a synergistic manner. The levels and types of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other phenols differ from strain to strain lending each a host of characteristic therapeutic properties. The medicinal properties of marijuana are a product of secondary metabolites, specifically phenolic compounds. Cannabinoids are phenolic compounds unique to marijuana that are responsible for the bulk of the plant's therapeutic properties, both psychoactive and non-psychoactive. More than sixty (60) cannabinoids have been identified thus far. Terpenes also exist in marijuana but are not unique to the plant. These compounds are responsible for the scent/taste of the plant, and some of them also have therapeutic and anti-bacterial properties. Marijuana also contains powerful anti-oxidants called flavonoids. Most studies management has reviewed measure the level of \"total phenolic compounds,\" (often abbreviated as TP). A 2003 study published in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry concludes, \"...results demonstrate a statistically relevant trend of higher levels of TPs in organically and sustainably produced crops.\" This study looked at the differences in TP between organic and sust ainably grown marion berries, strawberries, and corn, as opposed to conventionally grown. The study found organically grown strawberries to have \"19.1% more TP's than conventionally grown. Organically grown and air-dried corn was found to have 58.4% higher levels of TP than the conventionally grown.\" Another article published in 2007 in the same journal reported findings from a ConfidentialG.1 754 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6ten-year study comparing flavonoid content in organic and conventionally grown tomatoes. This group of scientists also found that the organic method of cultivation employed throughout the study yielded tomatoes with higher flavanoid and total phenolic content. This article's introduction also me ntions other studies which yielded similar conclusions. 11. Strain Background PHYTO, C-THREE's designated cultivation team, will cultivate coveted strains propagated within small circles of medical marijuana cultivators for decades. The strains are heralded for their specific genetic ex pressions, superior bioavail ability, and efficacy in treatment protocols. Many growers propagate strains that bear the same name as PHYTO's genetics, but the progeny are not identical - these genetics have often been cross bred, but labeled as an original to command a higher price in genetics markets. In contrast, PHYTO remains in possession of, and is pleased to provide, original genetics sought after by patients suffering from epileptic disorders, intractable neuropathic pain, central nervous system disorders, and other prevalent, qualif ying conditions. Sativa ,Indica , and Sativa-Indica Hybrid strains of cannabis have marked differences in their cannabinoid profiles, and yield different effects when mediated by the body's CB1 and CB2 receptors. It is important for patient s to be aware of the various cannabinoid profiles made available, as it has been shown that certain profiles are best suited for certain conditions. In consultation with their physicians, patients can select the optimal strain and cannabinoid profile for their conditi on. It is important to note that these are general guidelines, and the effects of particular strains can vary from person to person. Sativas Originating in the tropical climates of south Asia, Sativas are generally the more psychoactive of the two cannabis species. This species and its subspecies tend to contain higher concentrations of THC, and may be more effective in treating the psychological effects of some illnesses, and in palliative care. Benefits commonly associated with Sativas include: /g120analgesic; alleviates or reduces awareness of /g120antiemetic; alleviates nausea /g120appetite stimulant /g120expectorant Indicas The effects of Indicas can include a more physical aspect. It is believed that Indicas originated in the highlands of Asia, northwest of the Himalayas. Indicas tend to be more sedative. Indicas include: /g120muscle relaxant /g120anti-inflammatory ConfidentialG.1 755 1.727 /g120relieves intraocular pressure /g120expectorant /g120analgesic; reduces pain 12. Strain List In consultation with Phyto Management and the WERC Shop, and after considerable analysis of available data, C-THREE has selected the following strains for cultivation in the first year of operation. Our driving tenant in identifying these varietals was patient care - we chose a range of strains that will effectively address the list of qualifying conditions, including strains very high in CBD content and low in THC content. Strains were also selected for their time-to-flower and historical yields to ensure that C-THREEis consistently yielding a sufficient supply of medical-grade cannabis. See Cultivation Plan Appendix G.1 for additional information on C-THREE perpetual-harvest cultivation plan. The following chart provides an overview of C-THREE's strain selection. It should be noted that C-THREE will not employ any street names commonly associated with these genetics; street names are provided herein for application purposes only and ease of reference.

Concentrates and Extraction Concentrates offer a pure, concentrated source of the active compounds found in the marijuana plant. Whether by pulmonary uptake (smoke or vapor), transdermalabsorption (topicals), or metabolizing (pills/edi bles), concentrates can be helpful to patients that require larger doses, including those enduring chemotherapy. Concentratesare created through an extraction process whereby the resinous trichomes are separatedfrom raw flower and plant matter and collected. C-THREE's has partnered with highly experienced extraction technicians as overseen by Phyto Management and the WERC Shop. These technicians will utilize three (3), proven, solvent-free extraction techniques. The extraction team has researched andconcluded the safest and most medicinally active extraction techniques are: Dry SieveExtraction (DSE), Cold-Water Extraction (CWE ), and Direct Heat Infusion (DHI). Each is effective in extracting the cannabinoid and terpenoid-rich resin heads, and without (the commonly used) toxic petroleum distilla tes or environmentally harmful tactics. Extraction, Generally Before any extraction can commence, stems, fan leaves, and general plant debris must be carefully removed and separated. This process is performed by Phyto Management'sskilled cultivation support team - proper handl ing of the raw flower is critical in preserving the purity of the flower, and the integrity of the cannabinoid-rich resin heads.The resulting plant material is processed utilizin g a dry sieve, and then subjected to cold water extraction or direct heat infusion. See sections 6a-c, infra , for additional detail. Once extracted, cannabinoids and terpenes, can be consumed via pulmonary uptake (vapor or smoke). Cannabis resin is a hydrophobic oil, meaning it is insoluble in water but soluble in lipids (oil/fat) and alcohol. The extract or raw plant material can be infused directly into butters, cooking oils, alcohol s, and hypoallergenic moisturizers for optimal transdermal absorption or metabolizing. In the C-THREE production facility, such infusion will occur in a botanical extractor appliance named \"MagicalButter.\" Playful name aside, the appliance is a stainless steel, industrial-grade processor designed specifically for botanical extraction and infusion.The appliance is fully automated; a microprocessor affects a set of sequences dependingon the substrate to be infused. An integrated digital thermostat precisely maintains thetemperature between 160-250 degrees Fahrenheit. After infusion, the substrate isstrained of plant material and ready for laboratory testing. The MagicalButter botanical infusion device was manufactured to work with the following; /g120Butter /g120Tincture - vegetable glycerin /g120Olive oil /g120Coconut oil /g120Sunflower oil ConfidentialG.1 758 1 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6/g120Avocado oil /g120Hypoallergenic Moisturizers 13 (a) Dry Sieve Extraction DSE is labor intensive, especially when performed by hand, as C-THREE has committed to. It is highly effective, however, in isolating the resin powder from the plant material - a necessary step in concentration - without compromising the integrity of the terpenoid rich essential oils. Resin powder consists of the encapsulated, bulbous glands which are filled with a viscous cannabinoid and terpene substance. Once isolated, collected, and processed, the concentrate is readily and consistently dosed during the infusion process, after strict lab screens for purity and profiling. The remaining plan t material (fan leaves, stems, small flowers) can be processed via cold-water extraction or direct heat infusion to create additional concen trate or substrates. 13 (b) Cold Water Extraction After dry sieve extraction the remaini ng plant matter can yield quality and substantial amounts of concentrate in CWE. Fresh or dry plant material is placed in a sterile mesh bag, and submerged in a bath of ice water in a commercial grade, stainless steel washing machine. The machine gently agitates the water for approximately 30 minutes. Next, the water is drained and strained through additional screens that allow the dislo dged resin glands to sink rapidly to the bottom of the collection well, where they can be collected and dried. Essential oils evaporate when exposed to the water, so this technique produces a concentrate with less terpennes than the previously described dry sieve technique but is pure and without any harmful petroleum residues. 13 (c) Direct Heat Infusion Cannabinoids and terpenes are readily dissolvable in vegetable oils which may be used for both extraction and as a substrate. Oils are for the most part non-soluble in water and therefore they do not extract excessive water-soluble constitutes, like chlorophyll. There are practical limits to the potency that can be achieved extracting with oil, because as the oil becomes saturated with cannabis terpenes the solvent action slows down before stopping altogether. A key factor in achieving maximum removal rates and efficiency, is keeping the boundary layer between the un-dissolved resins and the unsaturated oils used for extraction regularly removed and this is accomplished by mixing. The appliance chosen has an internal mixer that is activated at re gular intervals to accomplish maximum infusion.

Cannabinoid Profiling Led by the Werc Labs scientists, Dr.. Raber Ph.D and noted research scientist Sytze Elzinga, at least four (4) samples of each batch of harvested marijuana shall be Standard Plate Count tested to verify the batch is free of bacteria, molds, and fungi. Cannabinoid profiling will be completed in-house using, when economically feasible, a quadrupole mass spectrometer / liquid chrom atograph, in addition to the registered, independent laboratories in Connecticut. A sample profile has been attached to the end of the document. Additionally, all harvested and dried marijuana will be tested for bacteria, mold, fungi, terpenes, and cannabinoid profiles prior to being /g120cannabichromene Analgesic, Euphoriant 16. Terpenoid Profiling Led C-THREE's product developers Jeff Raber and Sytze Elzinga, Werc was the first laboratory to begin profiling te rpenes within medicinal cannabis in the summer of 2011. Werc remains the leader in this new frontier, screening for 37 different terpenes using advanced gas-chromatographic techniques. Terpenes are critical to confirming that a strain is the particular strain it is claimed to be, and they are ultimately responsible for delivering the complex effects provided by whole plant medicinal cannabis products . ConfidentialG.1 760 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 203.64 1.727 6Comparing the values of THC, CBD, CBN (an artifact of improper analysis which does not actually exist in fresh flowers), and other basic cannabinoid will not reveal whether a strain is most helpful in treating a qualifying condition; cannabis is far more complex than one or two cannabinoids. Terpenes modify and modulate the effects of THC and other cannabinoids, and impact the overall medicinal properties of the particular cultivar. Terpenes are also predominant players in the smell and taste of medicinal cannabis. Terpenes are all flavor and fragrance components common to human diets, and they have been designated \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" by the US Food and DrugAdministration. Terpenes share a common precursor with phytocannabinoids and they are quite potent, being known to affect animal and even human behavior when inhaled from ambient air at serum levels in the single digit ng/mL range. It doesn't take much of them to make a physiological impact. Terpenes display unique therapeutic effects that may contribute to the overall effects of medicinal cannabis; a reason whole based medicines are superior to single-molecule cannabinoid therapies like Marinol\u00ae or other synthetics like Rimonabant. The synergy of terpenes and cannabinoids are most likely responsible for providing the effective treatment of pain, anxiety, epilepsy, inflammation, depression, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Terpenes are the components responsible for the plethora of powerful medicinal benefits delivered by cannabis. A recent publication by Ethan Russo of GW Pharmaceuticals in the British Journal of Pharmacology (http://10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01238.x) describes this effect, which is now being termed the entourage effect. For medicinal cannabis patients to receive the proper medication, finding the right strain/product required to meet their medical needs, they will need to understand the terpene content and seek to harness the complete entourage effect being delivered by their particular strain selection. To our knowledge, Werc is unique in the breadth of terpenes it analyzes; thus it is only lab that can possess a fundamental understanding of a cannabis strain at this time. Recently a particular cultivator discovere d this important differentiation. Having submitted a variety of new strains they we re working on devel oping, unique terpene profiles were observed. Out of approximately 10 different samples submitted, if you were to only look at THC and CBD content, the strains would have appeared only average and non-unique. However, comparing their terpene profiles revealed significantly new strains had been created which possessed profiles unlike anything our laboratory had seen before. If these samples were processed at another lab, they most likely would have sacrificed these new strains assuming they were still common. Initial explorations are exceptionally promising, and the patients being positively impacted by these unique strains are the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently there is not a great deal of information known about the terpenes and their combined effect with the cannabinoids present in cannabis, and certainly not in any vast combination like you experience with any strain you encounter today. Individually there is a small understanding of some of the effects of these molecules in general, and can be described as follows. ConfidentialG.1 761 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6Pinenes : Pine odor, bronchodilators that opens the lungs to possibly improve THC absorption. Responsible for increasing focus, self-satisfaction, and energy. Caryophyllene : Sweet, woody, clove taste responsible for anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects through CB2 receptor activation. Linalool: Floral smell that is believed to provide some anti-cancer effects as well as being known to cause severe sedation. Limonene: Has a citrus scent and may possess anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-depression abilities. Myrcene: Most likely effects intake of THC by brain cells to increase the overall effects of THC when ingested together.It is important to note that while the effects listed above were predominantly found for the single component being studied individually. The effects within a cannabis matrix may be far different than when delivered alone. We strongly suggest patients seek to understand their preferred strains by identifying the top few terpenes (now found on our labels) and continue to seek the same medicine in the future through identification of a similar top terpene fingerprint , whether or not the name of the strain is the same. C-THREE wants to develop the best natural products for the registered patients of Connecticut, and is pleased to be partnered with the scientists capable of properly investigating and analyzing terpenes. C-THREE intends to develop the next generation of cannabis therapeutics truly designed to address specific conditions. In fact, Werc scientists have recently developed new product formulations and processing methods for a variety of products, including capsules, edibles, tinctures. Werc Labs currently screens /g120Selina-3,7(11)-diene (t) /g120Eudesm-7(11)-en-4-ol (t) /g120Valencene (t) 17.

ConfidentialG.1 766 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 618. Quality Assurance/Quality Control Quality control starts with intelligent design and begins from the ground up. Accountability, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and empowered workforce bolster this tenet that lies at the core of C-THREE's corporate culture. C-THREE designs its policies and procedures based on pharmaceutical labs, cGMP, and clearnroom procedures. Additionally, C-THREE' s Sytze Elzinga is deeply experienced in controls: Mr. Elzinga previously worked for Farmalyse, the pharmaceutical laboratory which manages the quality control of the Dutc h national medical marijuana program. At Farmalyse, Mr. Elzinga was responsible for th e quality control of all medicinal cannabis for the Dutch pharmaceutical market where the dried flower products are providedthrough pharmacies under prescriptions. Besides the aforementioned screening, C-THREE staff will conduct Plant to Package Screening (PTPS). PTPS shall be an ongoi ng part of daily activities within the Cultivation Center, and will work to safe guard all C-THREE products. All medical marijuana will be screened throughout its growth and harvest. Testing prior to packaging,and screening all material as it is being packaged will ensure that no contaminated orotherwise adulterated medical marijuana leaves the premises. Any medical marijuana thatis deemed unfit for sale will be destroye d according to procedures set forth in the Security Plan. Furthermore, the cannabinoid content of all plant matter will be tested andthe results shall be included on the label. 18 (a) Hand-Harvesting & Trimming All C-THREE plants will be harvested by hand. During this process, branches containing mature flowers will be removed from the main stems and placed on hangers. These hangers will in turn be placed on taught cables strung on rolling racks. Once these rolling rack s are filled with harvested marijuana they will be moved into the Processing Room. Once harvested medical marijuana has been brought into the Processing Room it will be trimmed by hand and/or machine. 18 (b) Sterilization All equipment, tools, and utensils used to harvest, trim, or otherwise process medical marijuana, edible medication or other medicinal preparations, including kitchen utensils, will be sterilized accordi ng to procedures detailed in the Product Safety and Labeling Plan, and Staff Handbook. These documents also include procedures for the post-harvest sanitizatio n of Flowering Rooms, and the regular cleaning/sanitization of the Kitchen. 18 (c) Process Flow & Cleanroom Protocol The C-THREE Cultivation Center was designed to accommodate a process-flow based system built around cleanroom protocol s. Anyone entering Limited Access Areas shall follow strict gowning procedures. 18 (d) Drying & Curing Drying and Curing are the two final steps to producing high quality medicine. The temperature and humidity levels of both the Processing and Drying & Curing ConfidentialG.1 767 1 82 East Aurora Street Waterbury, Connecticut 06708 203.64 1.727 6rooms shall be monitored closely as a means of controlling the moisture content of the harvested marijuana. It is of the utmost importance that the flowers not become overly dry before they ar e trimmed and removed from the stem. Once the trimmed marijuana is removed from the stem it is placed in a curing closet where the humidity will be closely controlled. Curing is a critical step in the creation of the highest quality medicine. The goal is to have just the right amount of moisture present in the marijuana flowers before it is packaged. Proper curing ensures that the uni que medicinal properties of each particular strain are fully realized. 18 (e) Consistency Consistency begins by propagating identical clones of each strains, and is confirmed with terpene screening. Growing genetically identical plants ensures the highest degree of consistency across all areas of the final-product including C-THREEchemical content (e.g. THC, CBD, and other secondary metabolites). C-THREE will also be precisely tracking the growth of the medical marijuana, and closely monitoring the environmenta l conditions of the Cultivation Center according to standard operating procedures. This will work to ensure the consistent and optimized feeding regiments. When plants are grown with consistent conditions and feedings the cannabinoid profiles are consistent. Additionally, medical marijuana will be tested to determine its phytochemical contents (cannabinoids, and other secondary metabolites) at regular intervals during its growth, and post-harvest before being packaged and sold. 18 (f) Quality Assurance All medical marijuana will be screened throughout its growth and harvest. Testing prior to packaging, and screening all materi al as it is being packaged will ensure that no contaminated or otherwise adulterated medical marijuana leaves the premises. Any medical marijuana that is deemed unfit for sale will be destroyed according to procedures set forth in the Security Plan. Furthermore, the cannabinoid content of all plant matter will be tested and the results will be included on the label. 19. Product Safety Product safety begins with best practices across the staff and facility. Accordingly.Detailed Policies & Procedures will govern each discipline within the facility, withclearly defined roles and accountability for managers and employees. Additionally, before beginning their employ, each em ployee will receive the C-THREE Employee Manual and the applicable Policies & Procedures manual for a given department. Eachemployee will likewise be trained, including wr itten tests to ensure they understand their roles and C-THREE standards of performance. 19 (a) Facility Design and Construction The facility has been designed for op timal process flow.
