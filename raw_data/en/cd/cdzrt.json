Diagnosing Your Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow when normal, antibody-producing plasma cells become malignant myeloma cells. The myeloma cells build up in the bone marrow, forming tumors in many bones of the body and preventing the bone marrow from creating healthy blood cells that your body needs to function properly. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma is often initiated during routine blood tests for other conditions and is difficult to confirm on the basis of any single laboratory test result. Accurate diagnosis generally results from consideration of a variety of factors, including physical evaluation, patient history, symptoms, and lab results. A number of laboratory tests and medical procedures are used to help confirm a diagnosis of myeloma, including bone marrow biopsy and imaging tests such as x-ray, CT scan or PET scan. Your doctor will determine the appropriate tests for you. Abnormalities in the plasma cells can cause other disorders that can affect various organs in the body. These plasma cell disorders include AL amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome or monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) among others. If you have been diagnosed with any of these conditions, visit our [plasma cell disorders page](plasma-cell-disorders.html) to learn about your treatment options. Learn About Cancer For reliable, in-depth information about cancer symptoms, staging and diagnosis, visit [CancerQuest](http://www.cancerquest.org/patients), an educational and outreach program at Emory University. Your Treatment Options Because of ground-breaking research and clinical trials at Winship and elsewhere, treatments for multiple myeloma are changing every day. Our doctors and researchers are studying the genetic components of multiple myeloma and using that knowledge to come up with better, more targeted drugs and individualized therapies. The goal of controlling multiple myeloma as a chronic disease, or even curing it, is within reach. Your treatment options will be tailored to your diagnosis based on the stage of your multiple myeloma and other factors such as lifestyle, age, and general health. Chemotherapy: Multiple myeloma is sensitive to different combinations of chemotherapy, which may involve one or a combination of anticancer drugs that destroy cancer cells. Targeted drugs and combination therapies: Recently, the U.S. FDA approved a number of new drugs that use the patient's immune system to fight multiple myeloma. Winship has pioneered the use of these drugs in combination with front-line therapies. Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation: This treatment consists of destroying myeloma cells by using higher doses of a chemotherapy medication called melphalan and then replacing them with healthy stem cells. CAR T-cell Therapy: During treatment, a patient's white blood cells are removed from the body and genetically changed to recognize and kill cancerous cells. The re-engineered cells are then infused back into the patient. The U.S. FDA approved CAR T-cell therapy for use in some patients with multiple myeloma [, thanks in part to clinical trials that took place at Winship Cancer Institute.](https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/patient-care/cancer-types/multiple-myeloma.html) Winship's Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant Center has pioneered many advances in stem cell transplant and cellular therapy procedures and drugs. Clinical Trials Consider talking with your doctor about participating in a clinical trial at Winship. Our award-winning team has been recognized for our demonstrated leadership in, and exceptional contributions to, the development of recently FDA-approved drugs to treat multiple myeloma. Through these trials, you may have access to treatments that are not widely available. For myeloma patients, [Sparkcures.com](https://sparkcures.com/center/10/winship-emory) provides information on clinical trials tailored to you. We encourage you to visit their website to learn more.
