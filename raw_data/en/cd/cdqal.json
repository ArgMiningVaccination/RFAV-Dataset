Head this way to find out more about the different types of massage therapy we offer. Deep Tissue Massage Deep Tissue is a type of massage that focuses on releasing the deeper myofacial restrictions of the deeper muscles, tendons and ligaments of the body. Sometimes referred to as myofacial release, it is used by many massage therapists, physical therapists and osteopaths. Deep Tissue Massage is a specific massage, which employs techniques like trigger point therapy, to work below superficial connective tissue with the intent of breaking up old structural patterns and allowing the free flow of nutrients and oxygen to the blood. Going deeper does not mean applying strength or force. When a therapist tries to force a muscle through brute force the result is that a muscle will usually respond with more resistance. The key to working deeper is to work slow, steady, and gentle. Swedish Massage Therapy (Holistic Massage) Swedish Massage, sometimes called Holistic Massage, is a type of massage therapy. Swedish Massage is probably the most commonly known massage, and what people think most often when they think of massage. The Swedish Massage technique, used primarily for relaxation, is a full-body massage done with scent-free oils. Swedish Massage includes gentle gliding strokes used with minimal pressure. Though the purpose of Swedish Massage is to increase the level of oxygen in the blood while decreasing the level of toxins, the benefits also include improved circulation and flexibility while easing tension. Techniques used include circular pressure and tapping with hands and palms, firm kneading, bending and stretching, and long gentle strokes. Aromatherapy Massage An Aromatherapy Massage is very much like a Swedish Massage/Holistic Massage with a few exceptions. An Aromatherapy Massage is done with an essential oil or a combination of essential oils. Essential oils are defined as, a natural oil typically obtained by distillation and having the characteristic odor of the plant from which they were extracted. An Aromatherapy Massage will usually begin with three deep inhalations of the oil chosen. These three deep breaths help you to relax and become present in the moment. Often, the massage will begin at the head so that the oil can be smelled during the entire massage, making the most of the essential oil properties. Therapeutic grade essential oils are believed to contain the same healing properties as the plants they come from. While there is no evidence that essential oils can cure or prevent disease they can offer spiritual and therapeutic well-being. The medicinally healing properties of essential oils have been well known for generations, and the ritualistic use of Aromatherapy can be seen throughout several ancient civilisations. A few key points about Aromatherapy Massage: - Make sure that your therapist has been educated in Aromatherapy and that this is not just a hobby. - Make sure that your therapist is using therapeutic grade essential oils. - Make sure that you are not allergic or have any sensitivity to the products being used.
