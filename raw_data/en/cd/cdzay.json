A few months ago, in the spring CCA report, I had the pleasure of introducing myself to you as the new Chair of the Board. I shared a little about my background and my priority to connect with as many members as pos-sible over my tenure as Chair. BACK Matters is one way for us to connect. In every quarterly publication I will provide thoughts and perspectives on issues affecting the profession and the ways in which the CCA Board of Directors is representing our national interests. Feedback and exchange are essential components of communications today and so I hope to hear from you directly at dr.warren@chiropracticcanada.ca. Your Board of Directors meets face to face four times a year. These meetings are integral to building trust, finding inspiration and developing relationships among the direc-tors and with members. The meeting content is focused on strategic issues and our discussions are informed by the CCA vision, mission and values. In my last communica-tion, I talked about the significant work on governance undertaken by the board and how this new framework will enable the association to be more strategic, respon-sive, effective and accountable. At our last meeting, the board adopted new bylaws, adopted all our governance charters that will guide our actions as a board, hosted the CCPA AGM and reviewed detailed work that is underway on our new strategic plan. I can tell you, an incredible effort is underway at the CCA to make ourselves relevant and meaningful to our members...but don't just take my word for it - the CCA board is made up of individual directors from across the country. At the last face-to-face board meeting, I took the opportunity to do a cross-coun-try check-in. Dr. Jeff Warren, DC Chair, CCA Board of Directors \"The CCA is solid, unified and moving forward with great capacity. We're here to engage members in helping us achieve and establish chiropractic as part of Canada's healthcare process. Jump on board!\" ~ Dr. Vince Adams, DC, CCA Director, PEI \"The CCA is serious about governance. The changes that are being implemented will provide new opportunities and a clean slate to pursue greater accomplishments. Our strategic planning gives focus to our efforts and an out-ward accountability to members. It's a new era of engage-ment.\" ~ Dr. Debbie Wright, DC, CCA Director, BC \"I am optimistic and confident in the CCA board as a body where all voices are heard. The work is inspiring and relates to my life, my practice.\" ~ Dr. Charles Caron, DC, CCA Director, QC \"Chiropractors want to be an integral part of a health- care system that delivers uncompromising, quality care to patients. I see the CCA as a significant driving force to support individual chiropractors in realizing a unified vision which seeks credibility and a desire to deliver an integrated vision of chiropractic for Canadians.\" ~ Dr. Judy Forrester, DC, CCA Director, AB \"My view is that the navel gazing is over and the question is - how do we relate to all Canadians? The strength of the CCA is in our vision: Chiropractors will be an integral part of every Canadian's healthcare team by 2023 . We need to position chiropractic as an essential part of Canada's healthcare, for users and non-users alike.\" ~ Dr. Ken Brough, DC, CCA Director, ON I couldn't have said it better myself. This is, of course, not our entire board. Next time, we'll hear from Saskatche-wan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and New-foundland - we simply ran out of room. As stated above, I do hope to hear from you directly. Please remember we're here for you.6 Canadian Chiropractic Association | Summer 2013It is a delight to be writing my first CEO message in the inaugural issue of BACK Matters , and to let you know that the CCA has a renewed commitment to creating an exceptional member experience and engaging our members with the work we are undertaking on your behalf. We value our members' input and views and invite you to join the conversa-tion about what matters most to you. The CCA is your national non-profit association representing the chiropractic profession in all national health matters. Last November, the Board of Directors decided on a mission state-ment that mandates the CCA to provide inspired leadership to our members, our provincial stakeholders, our fellow healthcare professions, our employees and volunteers, our Canadian and international partners and the public. Activities and resources are geared toward supporting our counter-parts in the provincial associations in advocacy efforts, government relations, policy development, and communications and marketing initiatives. We also assist with coordinating national leadership meetings for the profession to build consensus on messaging to the public and to government, on developing position statements around matters of significant impact, on fostering research opportunities that will forward the profession's growth and development, on building government relations strategies to integrate chiropractic into collaborative health initiatives, on creating risk management strategies to address clinical trends that emerge, and on identifying marketing strategies that will increase utilization. In addition, the CCA is also focused on creating a strong mem- bership advantage program with savings for our 7,000 members across the country. We are launching a new discount program with GoodLife Fitness, as well as health, dental and EAP benefits with Morneau Shepell. More is in the works - stay tuned for upcoming announcements. The CCA's aim as a national association over the next 10 years is to position chiropractors as an integral part of every Canadian's healthcare team by 2023. As a first step toward this mission, we are refreshing our website and logo, creating a new look and feel for the profession nationally. This fall, we are conduct-ing a public opinion poll to examine how the public views chiropractic care and chiropractors, and creating a new marketing strategy that addresses and engages those views. Part of this new marketing strategy is to launch a robust cross-country coordinated social media presence that will include our provincial counter-parts and you, our members. We will need everyone ready and willing to write blogs, short articles, and post videos that direct their patients to the national website to join the ongoing conversation about why chiropractic is an integral part of prevention and treatment for neck, joint and back pain. The CCA is undergoing many changes to better serve our mem- bers and the profession at large. We want to be the benchmark association that other professional associations use to measure their success. We have a dedicated staff team committed to achieving the key priorities outlined in the CCA strategic plan, and ready and willing to assist you. We also have a cohesive, unified Board of Directors determined to be strategic in its ac-tions to achieve the CCA vision, and devoted to bringing value to members and the profession at large. Your national association is here for you. We have restructured, and are feeling refreshed and energized by the work ahead. I hope you enjoy BACK Matters - it was created with the vision of building connections between our members nationally and to provide you with information about how your membership in the CCA is working for you. If you have any inquiries or concerns, please email info@chiropracticcanada.ca or contact the office directly. We will address your concern within 24 hours. Please also let us know your feedback about our new magazine by emailing backmatters@chiropracticcanada.ca. We are always interested in hearing what you like and what you want to see changed. Dr. Allan Gotlib, C.M., D.C. Director of Research Programs andEditor of the JCCA7 Summer 2013 | Canadian Chiropractic Association In 1995, the Canadian Chiropractic Association undertook a pivotal Task Force on Chiropractic Research in Canada to make recommendations about the design, direction and implementation of a coordinated plan to support the devel- opment of research in chiropractic in Canada. From the findings and recommendations of that Task Force, the CCA implemented its strategic programming initiative which has facilitated the creation of a true research culture in Canada. The CCA's strong leadership role in the research sector has expanded the breadth and depth of the profession's collective intellectual capacity. Where little research capacity existed in the past, today the profession boasts world-class researchers at Can-ada's most prestigious universities and is armed with academic expertise in neurophysiology, epidemiology, biomechanics, and cellular/molecular biology. The vision that was born 18 years ago has blossomed into a vibrant, academic, intellectual milieu with 12 university -based Chiropractic Research Chairs and Professorships in almost every province across the country. The Scientific Research Sympo-sium held every two years brings together a Consortium of distin- guished chiropractic researchers from 25 different universities. This Consortium lends tremendous credibility and expertise to our profession. By investing in people, the CCA has created extraordinary opportunities for many chiropractors to pursue a career in re-search, obtain their PhDs and secure the training and expertise required to advance our profession. Today in Canada there are 30 DC/PhDs in active full-time research. But what is incredible to me is that we have an amazing 19 DC/PhD candidates cur-rently training in university-based PhD programs across Canada. By initially funding the creation of a university-based Research Chair with the aim of generating high-quality evidence to support our clinical successes with patients, the CCA undertook a tremendous leadership role to address the challenges facing our profession. The CCA has put in place the mechanism to create research capacity and the means to generate critical high-quality research evidence that withstands the scrutiny of the scientific community. Our world-class researchers are publishing their chiropractic research in the world's leading biomedical scholarly journals. This is vitally important given the evidence-driven ba-sis of policy and decision makers in government and the private sector. As an example, Dr. Steven Passmore, DC, PhD, holds the CCRF Professorship in Spine Biomechanics and Neurophysiol-ogy in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Manitoba. He recently won three prestigious competitive funding awards, the 2013-2014 Manitoba Health Research Council (MHRC) Establishment Grant of $83,000 for a project entitled, \"An ex-ploration of spinal manipulation dosage\", the Manitoba Medical Service Foundation Research Grant of $20,000 and a Workers Compensation Board of Manitoba research grant of $199,167 dollars. These have important discovery implications in the treatment and prevention of neuromusculoskeletal disease which is a significant societal burden and is precisely the kind of chiro-practic research needed now. We are now entering the next phase of our strategic focus - the Knowledge Translation and Uptake phase. This means translat-ing the new chiropractic knowledge and transferring it to our 7,000 clinicians in everyday practice to improve the health of Canadians in accordance with the best evidence. It also means the effective transfer of new chiropractic knowledge to other healthcare providers, planners and policy makers, providing the basis for integration of chiropractic knowledge into the Cana-dian healthcare system. As our capacity grows, the profession is better positioned to inves- tigate the research questions important to all Canadians. The CCA has fostered a true research culture in the profession and provided a mechanism for new knowledge and new capacity to be inte-grated into both the health research system and the healthcare sys- tem in Canada - all to the benefit of Canadians and their health. Dr. Allan Gotlib, C.M., D.C. Director of Research Programs andEditor of the JCCA8 Canadian Chiropractic Association | Summer 2013The CCA believes that our vision of Canadi- ans' healthcare is possible; however, achieving this goal will need a concerted effort from the profession. This effort is already underway with the chiropractic associations promoting and advocating for the profession, the frontline researchers building a body of evidence that shows the profound contributions that chi-ropractic can make in MSK healthcare, and the colleges training the next generation with the best available tools and techniques. It doesn't end there, however, and individual Canadian chiropractors also have an important role to play in a sustainable healthcare system, particularly in the manage-ment of MSK conditions. Until recently, Canadians deemed our healthcare system as one of the best, and after the release of the Romanow Report in 2002, the consensus was that maintaining such standards would require continued investment. However, it has since become clear that more money is not the answer, as Canada's spending on health has doubled in real terms between 1997 and 2011 1 while the performance of our healthcare system has lagged behind most other OECD countries. Steven Lewis and Terrence Sullivan 2 have explained that our healthcare sys- tem is not underfunded, but rather that we must seek to gain greater value from the money spent. They suggest ten strat-egies for \"bending the cost curve\" that will transform our system to squeeze more value out of each dollar. What is notable for the chiropractic profession is that within each of these ten strategies to bend the cost curve, there is a potential role for chiropractors related to the delivery of better outcomes at lower cost for MSK condi-tions. This role is supported by a growing body of evidence. For example, a study 3 suggested that 42.7% of workers who \"\" Chiropractors will be an integral part of every Canadian's healthcare team by 2023.

The study suggests a strong association between surgery and the primary contact provider seen after the injury, after adjusting for other variables. Moreover, in 2012 the OCA supported a consulting chiropractic demonstration pilot project aimed to tackle current barriers in the provision of care for low back pain in primary care 4. The pilot study revealed that we are delivering what the Institute for Healthcare Improvement has called the Triple Aim: simultaneously improving population health, improving the patient experience of care, and reducing per capita cost. 5 Chiropractic Contribution to Bending the Cost Curve Lewis and Sullivan believe that the kind of transformation needed to improve value for money in the delivery will not be easy, and that an effective transformation requires fundamental rethinking of how care is delivered, and by which providers. Below are some potential contributions the chiropractic profession can make to some of Lewis and Sullivan's proposed strategies. 1. C ompensation in the healthcare system must shift from \"activity\" to achieving outcomes: For MSK conditions that can be treated with conservative care, chiropractors, as an integrated part of a patient's team, may well be the lowest-cost provider of effective outcomes. This is already a reality in Switzerland and Denmark, as well as some models of care in the US. 2. T eam-based primary care should be the back- bone of the healthcare system: Chiropractors have the potential to emerge as the MSK leaders in primary care teams. Excellent evidence is emerging from existing integrated-care clinics. 3. R educing unnecessary care: Early access to chiroprac- tic care can channel patients away from expensive and unnecessary care for issues that can be addressed through conservative MSK treatments.4. I ncentives should match transformation objectives: Rethinking funding models to include all regulated healthcare providers could allow more provider groups, including chiropractors, to make a full contribution to transformation goals. 5. C reate incentives to seek the most cost-effective care patterns: Chiropractors have a strong case for shifting the high cost of the status quo for MSK assess- ment and treatment. The opportunity exists to include chiropractors in a patient's 'care bundle' to promote early assessment and treatment, including lower-cost conserva-tive care where appropriate. A capitation-based primary care funding model could also increase incentives to favour conservative management of MSK conditions. Transformation will not be easy for the healthcare system, and there are challenges to overcome in achieving this nat-ural role: chiropractic has been marginalized as an 'alterna-tive' profession, significant barriers exist to interprofessional education, funding creates particular concern for access by marginalized Canadians, and change must happen province by province. As well, the profession itself must be broadly prepared to work within models of care if chiropractic is to make its full contribution. Canadians value the healthcare system, but appear to be increasingly open to major changes, particularly those that will give them better value. The CCA is already working at the federal level to encourage dialogue, and playing an active role in identifying new approaches to transformation that respect the efficacy and value of chiropractic care. The CCA invites your feedback on these issues, and would welcome the chance to speak with you about local opportunities you see for how chiropractors can help save public health dollars in MSK. Send us an email at backmatters@chiropracticcanada.ca or give us a call. We are open to your ideas and feedback. 10 Canadian Chiropractic Association | Summer 2013At the CCA, our mission is to provide inspired lead- ership to our members by providing an exceptional member experience and by promoting innovation, excellence and integrity in the delivery of chiroprac- tic care. An exceptional member experience is the first declara-tion in the new CCA mission statement.

Over the past decade, the Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation (CCRF) has worked with various provincial and federal agencies, chiropractic and otherwise (including CIHR), in order to establish Chiropractic Research Chairs/Professorships within the Canadian university system. There are now twelve of these positions across Canada with representation within departments of medicine, schools of physiotherapy and rehabilitation science, kinesiology, and health policy. The investments of time, effort and finances to develop these Chiropractic Research Chair/Professorship positions are significant, not to mention the various DCs who rise to the challenge of PhD-level training. Is the investment worth it? Does the profession as a whole benefit from supporting research? Clinically Relevant Research By: Dr. W. Mark Erwin, DC, PhD13 Summer 2013 | Canadian Chiropractic Association From my perspective, the returns are enormous, and we are only just beginning to reap the rewards. The road to becoming a clinician/scientist is a long one, starting of course with the many years of study required to obtain a PhD, as well as the associated financial challenges. With some success at becoming a principal investigator, along with sufficient funding and a robust publication record, the DC/PhD investigator may then be in a position to mentor the next generation of scientists. We have gained a foothold in the gradual development of a more broadly-focused research culture, and the gains made to date are just the beginning. Although blending the roles of clinician and scientist certainly present time-and-attention-management challenges, maintain - ing a clinical presence while engaging in research helps to keep one's eye on the prize: clinically-relevant research. The exchange of ideas and development of collaborative studies between DC/PhDs and other widely varied academic investigators provide a strong foundation for academic and professional dialogue. This kind of dialogue is collaborative and informed by other disciplines in a university setting where there is significant integration with other universities and hospitals. The DC clinician/scientist has the opportunity to break down barriers, improve communication, scientifically dissect the biology of spinal disease and develop rich collaborative networks of like-minded clinicians and scientists. Along with that comes an elevated recognition of the value of DC training and increased credibility.The opportunity now exists to help mentor the next generation of DC/PhDs and to capitalize on the hard-won advances made thus far. At the University of Toronto, I have had the pleasure and privilege of teaching dozens of future orthopaedic and neurosurgeons with respect to intervertebral disc biology, conservative management of mechanical spinal pain and cell biology of joint disorders. Small steps like these can go a long way towards facilitating improved communication between professions and the ultimate goal, helping to establish chiropractic as the authority and preferred provider for non- surgical spine conditions. Recognition, credibility and authority can come through better interprofessional com - munication and lead to full integration within the health-care system. We can look to Europe for existing examples of chiropractic taking its place alongside physicians and other healthcare providers. Accord-ing to a recent publication, \"We need to rethink front line care for back pain\" 1, an increasing percentage of patients are now seeing chiropractors for back pain. In Denmark, 33% of back pain sufferers seek out chiropractic, and in the US, more than 50% of patients suffering back or neck pain have consulted a chiropractor or massage therapist rather than a conventional health-care provider 2. Interestingly, in Denmark, chiropractic is integrating into the univer-sity and hospital system where the right to practice indepen-dently comes after a five-year Masters degree plus an addi-tional one-year internship. In Switzerland, chiropractic is recognized by the government as a medical profession and has a well-integrated role in the provision of spinal pain management. Students of chiropractic who are admitted into the faculty of medicine are required to pass medical entrance examinations in addition to their specialty chiropractic training. It is clear that when patient demand for better treatment is cou- pled with a robust evidence-based, scientific approach (both in education and a strong research commitment) the result can be that chiropractic can play a leadership role in a fully integrated healthcare system. 14 Canadian Chiropractic Association | Summer 2013It is my hope that chiropractic in Canada can continue to mature and follow a similar path as some of our European and other colleagues have done, to become significant partners within the healthcare system in the diagnosis and management of non-surgical spinal pain syndromes. There has been some encouraging movement in this direction with the development of community clinics, partnerships, such as with the orthopae-dic department in Saskatoon some years ago, and participation in programs like the St. Michael's Hospital family medicine clinic in Toronto. In order to develop further measureable gains in this direction, good quality, scientifically-robust research into understanding and managing spinal pain matters, is empowering, and is un-assailable. We need to continue to support the research and the CCRF mandate to increase the research currency within chiro-practic. As the saying goes, \"If you build it, they will come.\" You can find more detailed information about the fascinating research that Canadian chiropractors are engaged in, join as a CCRF member or contribute to Canadian chiropractic re-search, by visiting the CCRF website at www.canadianchiro-practicresearchfoundation.com. Lab Work To give you an idea of the kind of research that is underway in Canada, I'll outline the work we are doing in my lab. My personal academic appointments are within the Divisions of Orthopaedic and Neurological Surgery under the Department of Surgery at Toronto Western Hospital, as well as the Toronto Western Research Institute where I am a principal investigator. My research interests concern fundamental cellular and molecu-lar biological approaches to understanding spinal disease, with a particular emphasis upon the intervertebral disc. My laboratory research program is directed along a regenerative medicine theme in general. Specifically, it is with respect to the biology of the intervertebral disc and stem cell applications to spinal disease. A number of manuscripts have emerged from my laboratory regarding the impact of notochordal cells upon the biology of intervertebral disc (IVD) nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. But what are notochordal cells and why do they matter? Notochordal cells are the primitive cells that form the very first identifiable structure in the developing embryo, the notochord. In all mammals, cells from the notochord reside only within the intervertebral disc nucleus pulposus. However, some unique animals retain their notochordal cells, resulting in a resistance to developing degenerative disc disease (DDD) (See Figure 1). The canine species are arguably the most interesting: there are naturally occurring sub-species, such as beagles and dachshunds, known as 'chondrodystrophic' canines that lose their noto-chordal cell populations early in life - mostly by one year of age - and they are known to suffer herniated and degenerative discs frequently. The non-chondrodystrophic canine sub-species, such as mongrel and greyhound dogs, do not develop DDD until much later in life - normally not until 6 to 8 years of age. The human disc loses notochordal cells in a similar fashion to the chondrodystrophic canines, and humans, like beagles, lose their notochordal cells in youth and begin to show degen erative changes at about the same age-matched time in their lives.

In fact, work from my lab has demonstrated that soluble factors secreted by notochordal cells suppress degen-eration and protect NP cells from apoptotic cell death. We have also identified a number of molecules secreted by notochordal cells and have validated appropriate tissue culture conditions with which such cells may be maintained over long-term culture 3,4,5,6. Taking a very robust cellular/molecular approach, we are uncov-ering the mechanisms whereby notochordal cell-secreted factors affect NP cells, and are now working on an in vivo animal model to test our hypothesis that notochordal cell-secreted factors may be useful in a percutaneous treatment for disc disease. During our disc biology research, we found that the IVD contains stem/progenitor cells (See Fig. 1c) 7. Disc-derived stem cells can be differentiated into chondrogenic, adipogenic, and neurogenic lineages in vitro, and most interestingly, also robust neurodifferentiation in vivo. In this phase of the research, we injected disc-derived stem cells into the brain of a mutant mouse that is totally lacking compact myelin (myelin basic protein) within its central nervous system. We demonstrated that these nucleus pulposus stem/progenitor cells (NPPCs) are capable of differentiating into all major classes of neural cells: neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These cells are also capable of producing myelin basic protein within the brain of an animal that otherwise completely lacks any myelin! (See Fig. 2). We continue to pursue an enhanced understanding of the inter- action of notochordal cell-secreted factors with NP cells and the interplay between stem/progenitor cells and NP cells within the overall context of degenerative disc disease and the potential to intervene with a biologically-based therapeutic strategy for both disc disease and neural repair. Hopefully, we will be able to validate that appropriate 'factors' can be delivered in a minimally invasive method that may be able to reduce pain that originates from the disc as well as to mediate the degenerative process that can lead to ongoing pain and disability. Furthermore, we are hopeful that we will be able to demonstrate that a suitable source of stem cells may be appro-priate to transplant in such cases where a decline in the popula-tion of viable cells within the disc leads to ongoing degenerative disease. Patients who may receive such treatments currently have few options and it is the mission of my research program to de-velop a bedside-bench-bedside treatment for these patients. The ability to modulate the degenerative process affecting the disc within an overall spine-care treatment program such as suitable chiropractic care will offer an improved outcome for many.Figure 1: (a) NCD disc with healthy, gelatinous nucleus pulposus, (b) Freshly digested NCD disc NP.

Chiropractors have always been leaders in health promotion strategies and we routinely encourage healthy lifestyle choices as part of our management plans for our patients. Health promotion strategies in-clude posture, sleep hygiene, nutrition and at our core, specific exer- cises for mechanical neck and back pain. Certain dominant lifestyle habits aren't always advisable. Fast food and sedentary behaviour reflect the post-industrial-ized and technology-driven age we live in, therefore, we need to increase efforts around encouraging healthy lifestyle choices, correcting sedentary behavior and creating a cultural shift toward physical activity. We know that regular aerobic exercise can have significant benefits in decreasing the risk of heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. It is also known to decrease disability associated with knee osteoarthritis, decrease the progression of demen-tia, delay cognitive decline, reduce anxiety and depression, and is considered the best treatment for fatigue. Not surprisingly, regular exercise consistently improves quality of life. There is continued research to determine what factors seem to have the largest effects on the disease conditions most affecting us today. The \"Aerobic Cen-tre Longitudinal Study (ACLS)\", authored by Dr. Steven Blair is considered a landmark study due to the surprising outcomes that were looked at over a period of 20 years. The study focused on the impacts of low exercise level, smoking, diabetes and obesity on the risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease, which is still the number one cause of death in Canada. Low fitness status was found to be more risky than smoking, diabetes and obesity combined. According to Dr. Blair, low cardio respiratory fitness was found to have the highest attributable factor with respect to development of cardiovascular disease. The bar graph shows how the other risk factors compared. Checking a patient's physical activity level is the new vital sign. The Ca - nadian Physical Activity Guidelines state that adults need to be getting 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week. Therefore, to meet this target our patients need to be doing about 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity five days per week. Keep in mind that it is well established that more exercise will lead to further health benefits. Remember what we learned from the CCA initiative, Fit-in-15 (www.fitin15.ca): those 30 minutes can be broken up into smaller bouts of exercise and accumulate over the day. It is significant that these 10-15 minutes bursts of exercise are also beneficial and contribute equally to the total minutes per week because it's easier for patients to find the time to exercise and for us to provide additional motivation to engage in physical activity. Exercise is Medicine Canada (EIMC) is a national initiative guided by a national task force made up of medical doctors, physiotherapists, ex - ercise physiologists, other allied health professionals and chiropractors working together. The mission of this task force is \"to provide national leadership in promoting physical activity as a chronic disease prevention and management strategy to improve the health of Canadians.\" Attributable Risks (Reproduced from British Journal of Sports Medicine, \"Physical inac - tivity: the biggest public health problem of the 21st century\" by Steven N. Blair, 43: 1, 2009 with permission from BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.) By: Dr. Chris deGraauw, DC, FRCCSS(C)17 Summer 2013 | Canadian Chiropractic Association EiM C's goals are to: I ncrease the number of health care professionals who are assessing, pre- scribing and counselling patients in physical activity I ncrease the number of Canadians meeting the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines and the Ca-nadian Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines E ncourage the appropriate use of qualified exercise professionals in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease This is an interprofessional collaboration to which the Royal College of Chiropractic Sport Sciences is excited to contribute. Chiropractors can contribute and be an integral part of this move-ment and help EIMC in achieving its vision: \"Physical activity is an integral part of prevention and treatment of chronic disease in the Canadian healthcare system.\" The task force is working to develop clinical tools that will support the clinician in physical activity assessment and counsel-ing. One tool being developed is an exercise prescription pad to be utilized by health pro-fessionals. In addition, a new workshop was recently piloted at the Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine annual meeting to teach members how to implement a physical activity intervention in the context of a busy practice. Dr. Laframboise of the RCCSS(C) has given multiple talks to members regard-ing the Physical Activity Guidelines and chiropractic's role. The RCCSS(C) is also looking to provide educational opportunities for the profession as well as graduate and undergraduate studies. Here is what you can do. It is imperative that chiropractors continue to invest the time, not only to assess, but also to prioritize, prescribe and counsel their pa-tients on physical activity. As primary contact practitioners, we will continue to have the opportunity to promote and prescribe exercise as an intervention for our patients. Conduct further investigation into activity and exercise levels when taking histories, and consider this the new vital sign. Establish goals, prescribe cardiovascular exercise, and follow up to reassess if the goals are being met. It may be necessary to refer a patient to an exercise professional or com-munity-based program to assist with specific exercise requirements. Prescribing and counselling patients on physical activity helps to build bonds and trust with your patient as you strategize and nego-tiate what exercises will work best for him or her. The patient be-comes an equal player in the process and will have more motivation to follow through. When goals are achieved it is rewarding to ob-serve the effects of the change in lifestyle. I look forward to being a part of the movement where every chiropractor in Canada makes an even bigger difference one patient at a time, one practice at a time, by checking the Physical Activity(PA) vital sign and promoting it. Chiropractic Case Study Exercise is Medicine Benefits of exercise prescription: Forty-eight year old homemaker is referred to you for her chronic neck and back pain. She confides that she feels fatigued a lot of the time and stopped doing her exercise classes over a year ago due to increased low back pain. Physical activity for her is walking the dog for 10 minutes, 5 days per week. PA Vital Sign = 10 minutes x 5 days = 50 minutes (Guide- lines recommend 150 min per week) Your diagnosis is chronic cervical joint irritation, mechani-cal lumbosacral joint dysfunction and low cardio respiratory fitness. From your muscle testing you also find weak low back extensors common with chronic low back pain. Your hands on care includes spinal mobilizations, adjustments and soft tissue therapy. In addition, you prescribe an increase in her exercise by 100 minutes per week to meet the required 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week for a total of 150 minutes per week. Your patient agrees to ride the station-ary bike at your office twice a week for 20 minutes while attending for chiropractic care and to increase her walking time with her dog to 30 minutes the other 3 days. Simple home exercises are prescribed to address the weakened spinal stabilizers. At your four-week evaluation with your patient, she is quite excited and proud of her progress in exercising. She has actually been doing 30-minute rides at the office and two of her dog walks have increased to 45 minutes in length. She is exercising for 170 minutes per week, surpass-ing her physical activity vital sign. She is no longer fatigued and is very satisfied that her neck and back pain have im-proved with your treatment. She reports she was better able to tackle her increases in exercises with your care. Physical ac tivity Promotion: at t he Community Level In our clinic, with multiple sports specialist chiropractors, we felt it was important to lead by example when it comes to promoting physical activity. We decided it would be great to put on an event for our patients and local com-munities that would provide the platform for creating fun, outdoor activity, even in the cold of winter. Our free snowshoe day was enjoyed by patients, families, children and seniors. This innovative way to get our community moving brought out over 60 people for a great workout. More important, we know many have continued snow-shoeing in the winter after our clinic introduced them to this Canadian-inspired cardiovascular experience. It was nice to be involved in promoting physical activity in our community. Do you have a similar program at your clinic?

These four inspiring students from the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College have committed to cycling across Canada from June to Au-gust 2013 with the goal of motivating, inspiring and educating Canadians through the Unleash Your Potential (UYP) pro-gram. UYP is a national student-run health awareness campaign that was created to encourage Canadians to live their best life possible by embracing a healthy and active lifestyle. As they travel 7,000 km across the country, stopping in almost 50 cities, their mission is to promote the integration of physical activity, proper nutrition, and stress management into the daily lives of Canadians. As the obesity rate in children has continued to rise, the campaign's focus has shifted to reaching Canadian youth through visits to day camps and children's groups, and the team intends on presenting at over 20 schools. Their hope is to kick-start these youth toward a way of living that will last a lifetime and create a healthier generation for the future.This student-run initiative has grown immensely since its launch in 2005, allowing the teams to connect with Canadi-ans through hundreds of media appearances and educational events, spreading the word about the importance of creating and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The campaign is run every two years and the 2013 team is determined to surpass all previous achievements, and make this the most successful tour yet. The team has a true understanding of how important this tour is and the lasting effects it will have on impressionable youth. As team member Brenna MacPhail said, \"I directly attribute who I am today to growing up as an active child and adolescent. My work habits, outlook on life, level of activity and general well-being are all things which I know were influenced by participation in sport and being active from an early age.\" Thanks to the generosity of Canadians across the country, the team has had immense support in their quest to create a health-ier nation. Follow the 2013 UYP team on their journey as they travel across the country from Vancouver to Halifax at www.unleashyours.ca. The Canadian Chiropractic Associa-tion is a proud sponsor and supporter of Unleash Your Potential 2013. \"The most exciting part of this tour so far is realizing how much people truly care about our cause. The support has been remarkable and the people we have met have been unbelievably inspiring.\"Joseph Sinopoli \"The kids we're talking to in the schools and summer camps each have their own ideas of what it means to be active and live healthy, which is awesome. I feel like we're the ones learning from them.\"Matthew Missiha20 Canadian Chiropractic Association | Summer 2013I have been a practising chiropractor since 1977. It has been largely rewarding, and I have had a lot of fun along the way. Relationships fostered with patients and colleagues have helped me grow pro-fessionally and personally. The growth and acceptance of the profession has been encouraging. Cu-riously, however, those same stumbling blocks to the profession's maturation and actualization that I became aware of in 1977 still seem to haunt us somewhat to this day. For that reason, I'd like to take a few column inches to speak of ethics. Not so very long ago, I attended a leadership forum. While speaking about our profession's ranking on the ethics and trust spectrum on this conti-nent, the keynote ran through a myriad of articles and surveys. Predictably, the results cited were linked primarily to individual behaviours, rather than more objective measures, such as quantitative scientific evidence, quality of education or a paucity of research. It is much more difficult for a profession to answer for individuals than to defend hard science and breakthroughs for healthcare, but the reality is that when it comes to trust and ethics, the natural human response tends to be emotional. Admittedly, most healthcare profes- sions struggle to some extent with the ethics of a few bad apples, but this fact is no reason to be lackadaisical. As we perch on the cusp of cultural authority, we need to be vigilant about our own house, and to keep the dialogue open, particu-larly around so-called 'grey' areas. So, what are ethics? How should we study the subject and how do we inculcate ethics into practice? Ethics is not synony-mous with morality. Conversations about ethics are not conver-sations about religion. (That being said, religion is quite inter- ested in ethics.) Ethics is that branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. The term comes from the Greek word ethos, which means \"character.\" Do you remember the other branches of philosophy? Clever folks would debate this endlessly, but for the sake of anchoring this discussion, let me keep it simple (which is about the extent of my grasp!) The branches of philosophy look something like this: Epistemology: the study of knowledge Metaphysics: the study of what is really real ax iology: the study of value (and also encompasses ethics and aesthetics) E thics: the study of values in human behavior or the study of moral problems \u00c6 sthetics: the study of value in the arts or the inquiry into feelings Logic: the study of reasoning, both rational and erroneous In our chiropractic world, we love to talk about philosophy, and honestly, we probably get it mixed up a bit with history. (We do love our history, and are sometimes irrationally committed By: Dr. Clark R. Mills, DCTheEthics Part 1 21 Summer 2013 | Canadian Chiropractic Association to it, making it our raison d'\u00eatre for the practice of chiropractic.) Curiously, we might even call ourselves philosophically-based prac- titioners, but the study of knowledge, the evaluation of what is really real, and the logical scrutiny of our art often gets disre-garded. Back in 1977, when I embarked on my practice journey, this group of practitioners called themselves principled chiroprac - tors. I may have believed myself to be one of these. Flash ahead to the brave, new world of 2013: outcome assess- ment, evidence-based practice, clinical practice guidelines and patient-centered practice are the watchwords of the day. Amaz-ing strides have been made toward a healthier, more vibrant population, and the real determinants of health in a community are known and understood. Public health issues can now be better addressed by healthcare providers, and chiropractors are poised with our skill set for full integration. So, what does this have to do with ethics? As pointed out earlier, the ethics and trust spectrum tends to be based on individual behaviours rather than the hard facts behind any specific treatment approach. However, that doesn't mean that our profession as a whole cannot agree upon a set of ethics and personally rise to meet the challenge of following it. While we probably all observe behaviours among our peers that make us cringe a little (at least on the inside), that behaviour should not reflect on you as an individual practitioner. The best thing to do is to have the conversation. W ould it be ethical to prescribe a course of treatment that is incongruent with best available evidence for a stated condition? W ould it be ethical to maintain a course of care where clinical markers and indicators are absent? I s it ethical to ensure patient compliance by financial handcuffing? W ould it be ethical to make the provision of chiropractic care contingent on a family plan buy in? I s it ethical to avoid a difficult patient conversation for fear they may not choose your intervention? W ould it be ethical to deride a public health policy that has demonstrated positive impact on the health of a population? Our philosophy of chiropractic needs to also include some good old-fashioned critical thinking and a fulsome consideration of ethics. All healthcare providers are facing increased scrutiny in the ethics arena, which we should take as a call to action, an opportunity to rise to the challenge of in-depth discussion and professional soul-searching. The conversation may be difficult, but the character of chiropractic deserves it. Tell us what you think! backmatters@chiropracticcanada.ca.

As part of the annual congress that brings together chiropractic leaders from around the world, re - searchers are invited to submit papers for the (newly named) NCMIC Louis Sportelli Research Awards. WFC Congresses typically attract approximately 200 research submissions. This year, 32 submissions were selected for oral presentation, and 90 were chosen for poster presentation. Poster awards include first and second prizes as well as prizes for best poster from each of the WFC's seven world regions - Africa, Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Pacific. The poster awards are sponsored by the International Board of Chiropractic Examiners (IBCE). This year, three out of the four top awards went to Canadian researchers. First prize, the Scott Haldeman Award, and the second prize both went to teams from the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in To - ronto, and the award for the best new research from cli - nicians in private practice went to Dr. Rick Ruegg and colleagues. The top prize for a student paper also went to a Canadian team for their paper, \"The effect of spinal manipulation on sensorimotor integration and cortical effects of motor training in a cohort of participants with subclinical neck pain.\" The first-prize-winning study from Dr. Wong and her colleagues analyzed worker's compensation data in the Province of Ontario, and reported on the relationship between policy changes and the frequency of lost-time claims. Dr. Quesnele and colleagues, employed sophisticated measurement techniques for their paper, \"Changes in Vertebral Blood Flow following Various Head Positions and Manipulation,\" and found no significant changes related to head position and manipulation. Third prize went to Michael Meier, PhD and col-leagues from the School of Chiropractic at the Uni-versity of Zurich, Switzerland for their paper, \"Brain Activation Induced by Spinal Movement: A Novel and Promising Method for Investigating Neuroplas-tic Changes in Chronic Low-Back Pain,\" which outlines a functional MRI study showing changes in the brain in patients with chronic pain. The award-winning work engaged in by Dr. Rick Ruegg and colleagues was supported by the Canadian Chiropractic Association and titled, \"Evidence-based Guidelines for the Chiropractic Treatment of Adults with Neck Pain.\" All of these papers will soon be published in the Journal of Manip - ulative and Physiological Therapeutics (JMPT). At the presentation ceremony, Dr. Scott Haldeman, Chair of the WFC Research Council, explained why the name of the awards at the profession's leading biennial original research competition was changed to the NCMIC Louis Sportelli Research Awards . Dr. Sportelli, who has served as President of the NC-MIC Group since 1999, has been a leading developer and supporter of chiropractic research for the past 30 years. NCMIC is currently part-way through a 10-year agreement to fund the WFC research awards through to 2019. 23 Summer 2013 | Canadian Chiropractic Association OVER aL L POSTER aWaR DS Sponsored by IBCE First prize ($1,000) - UK Evaluation of a GP-referral multidisciplinary service for manual treatment of back and neck pain: an update Jennifer Bolton, Mark Gurden, Marcel Morelli, Greg Sharp, Katie Baker, Nicola Betts Second prize ($750) - SWITZERLAND Outcomes from MRI confirmed symptomatic cervical disc herni-ation patients treated with high velocity, low amplitude, spinal manipulative therapy: A prospective cohort study with 3 month follow-up Cynthia Peterson, Christof Schmid, Serafin Leemann, Bernard Anklin, B.

Her project won a Gold medal at the Bluewater Regional Science and Technology Fair, the Canadian Nuclear Society Award, the Sydenham Conservation Award, and was featured in the August 2010 issue of Canadian Chiropractor magazine. Then, at age 12, her second project, called Family Spines , took her all the way to the 2012 Cana-da-Wide Science Fair where she represented the province of Ontario team, and her project won her a Bronze medal (Award of Excellence) and a scholarship to Western University. Both ideas came to her while on family outings at Sauble Beach. Carina first took notice of footprints in the sand and how the sets of prints between families bore a striking resemblance. Then, a couple of years later, after the success of her Family Footprints study, she further observed that some family members walking along the beach appeared to have crooked spines or walked liked they had kinks in their lower backs, while other members of the same family did not. This caused her to wonder if there was a genetic or hereditary link when it came to lower back problems. Pursuing her curiosity, Carina developed her next science project called Family Spines . Researchers have long thought that there might be a genetic rela-tionship to lower back problems, but they are unsure. With her study, Carina hoped to prove that there was a hereditary relation-ship in families with respect to lower back function as measured by dynamic surface electromyography (sEMG) and range of mo-tion (ROM) measurements in the lumbar spine. While deciding on the best way to measure and collect data, Carina came across an article about the MyoVision 3G Wireless Physiomon - itoring System, and thought that this technology would suit her needs. Carina contacted MyoVision and flew to Seattle so she could be trained on the eq uipment before bringing it back to Canada with her.Carina Fascinato, the 13-year-old daughter of Ontario chiro- practor Dr. Frank Fascinato, is an inquisitive young lady. Aside from school and helping out in her father's clinics, Carina's abid-ing interest in science also prompted her to launch not one, but two award-winning in-depth studies. Both studies investigated possible hereditary connections, the first one concerning foot function, and the second one regarding lower back function. Family Spines 25 Summer 2013 | Canadian Chiropractic Association Goodlife Fitness Toronto Marathon Congratulations go out to CCA member Dr. Terry Gehl, a DC from Quebec who came in first place in this year's Goodlife Fitness Toronto Marathon held on Tuesday, May 14, 2013. Dr. Gehl came close to not competing in the marathon due to an injury that kept him from participating in the Bos-ton Marathon, but on the Friday before the marathon, he decided to run. It seems he made the right decision, finishing in first place with a time of 2:37:29. Dr. Gehl has been running for 35 years, competing in 5-, 10- and 15-km races, as well as marathons and half marathons. He comes from a family of runners - he is the son of one of Canada's best all-time ultramarathon runners and his sister also holds the Canadian record for the 24-hour race. Dr. Gehl has a background in Kinesiology from the University of Waterloo, graduated from Palmer College in 1993, and practises with his wife in St. Charles, Quebec. He is also a father of three children and has been a member of the Saucony elite road racing team for 12 years. In her study, Carina tested 79 participants spanning three genera-tions in 13 families for lumbar forward flexion, left lateral flexion, right lateral flexion, left rotation and right rotation. In 10 out of 13 families, there appeared to be a high correlation between the same-gender grandparents, parents and children in their lumbar forward flexion ranges of motion, left and right lateral flexion ranges of motion and in their left and right lateral flexion and rotation in sEMG. Carina Fascinato's research supports early detection examinations in families to help prevent spinal problems for younger genera-tions. Early detection means patients have the opportunity to get treatment before the condition becomes symptomatic. According to Carina's study, if there is a lower back problem in a family member, this can indicate that other same-gender grandparents, parents and children should also be checked for a similar problem. They can seek assessment and possible treatment earlier to reduce risk and improve quality of life. The results of Carina's study have far reaching implications for society. Early detection and treatment means a potential reduction in future back problems and the overall burden to society may also be reduced. This is significant because one of the most serious socioeco - nomic health problems today is lower back pain, affecting 80% of the population at one time or another in their lives and accounting for an extremely large percentage of Workers' Compensation payments. Aside from her studies and hanging out at the beach, Carina also participates in highland dancing, baseball and public speak-ing at a competitive level. She also enjoys ballet, piano, singing and other health sciences. You might think that such a young investigator would be nervous presenting her work in a large, national competition. \"Not really,\" says Carina, \"I came pre-pared and I really enjoyed it.\" She has always had an interest in science, largely influenced by her father's 20-year chiropractic practice where she witnessed first-hand how chiropractic treat-ment can dramatically improve the quality of life for patients. Unsurprisingly, she is leaning toward pursuing a career as a chiropractor or medical doctor, and is keen to delve deeper into the study of genetics. When asked how it felt to bring home a Bronze medal from the 2012 Canada-Wide Science Fair, Carina did not hesitate: \"It felt phenomenal. It was the culmination of more than a year of hard work and it was ex-tremely gratifying.\"26 Canadian Chiropractic Association | Summer 2013CCPA Backstory In late 1985, the insurance industry withdrew offering professional liability insurance coverage for chiropractors. There were many reasons for this but the net effect was that chiropractors were left in a very difficult position. At the time, the Canadian Chiropractic Asso- ciation shouldered the responsibility for find-ing a solution to this terrible predicament. It turned out to be an impossible task to find replacement insurance for chiropractors, so a unique solution had to be found. At the eleventh hour, literally two weeks before the existing insurance policy for chi-ropractors in Canada expired (December 31, 1985), the Canadian Chiropractic Association's Board of Directors voted to create a professional \" protective fund \". The model they chose to follow was that of the Canadian Medical Protective Association (CMPA). The first step to creating CCPA was the establishment of the Canadian Chiropractic Protective Fund, a commit-tee of the CCA. This was created in early 1986. Within six months, the Canadian Chiropractic Protective Fund became its own, standalone entity, and became what you know us as today - Canadian Chiropractic Protective Association or CCPA. CCPA started without financial reserves or much experience in handling professional liability claims. Dr. Paul Carey was the first President of CCPA and continues to hold this posi-tion today. Dr. Donald Bramham (deceased) was CCPA's first Vice-President and was also instrumental in working with Dr. Carey to get CCPA off the ground. Thanks to the foresight, and careful guidance of these two doctors, along with a stable and experienced Board of Directors, CCPA became a viable and vibrant reality. Today CCPA protects over 7,000 members and has significant reserves and claims experience. Now, 28 years after the private insurance industry failed the chiropractic community, they are now offering \"insurance-based\" protection to chiropractors in Canada. You might ask yourself, \"What sets CCPA apart from private insurance companies?\" Well, CCPA is significantly different from insurance-based prod-ucts in what it offers its chiropractic members within Canada. CCPA is a member-based organization that protects its members from incidents that occur during practice encounters with patients that end up becoming a \"claim\" or a \"lawsuit\". While this is similar to insurance, the key differences are that CCPA is run by chiropractors, the Board of Directors is populated by chiropractors and we have a stakeholder interest in you and the chiropractic profession. Also, the lawyers that CCPA retains to defend you are expe- rienced and trained in the issues specifically relating to the defence of chiropractic claims. CCPA also takes a pro-active approach with our members regarding the risks they may encounter in day-to-day practice so they are able to better protect themselves. We also offer easily accessible guidance to you when you are confronted by unusual circumstances in practice. Rest assured that CCPA will never abandon you or the chiropractic profession, like the insurance industry did in 1985. So, for sleep-at-night protection you can ALWAYS count on - CCPA.
