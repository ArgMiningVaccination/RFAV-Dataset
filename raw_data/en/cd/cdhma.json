Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025P R O C E E D I N G S 1 - - - - - 2 MR. HYMAN: We're going to get started today. 3 For those of you who were not here yesterday and didn't 4 check the website this morning, which includes me, my 5 understanding is the web site accurately reflects that 6 we've canceled the Friday afternoon session on Little 7 Rock. So, we'll do the Friday morning session on Boston, 8 but we won't be doing a Friday afternoon session. We're 9 planning to reschedule that. There were ice storms in 10 Little Rock and people were unable to come. 11 The basic framework for today is there are 12 going to be short introductory remarks by Bill Kovacic 13 followed by presentations by two academics, Professor 14 Peter Hammer and Professor Jim Blumstein, and then we're 15 going to have a panel discussion, short presentations 16 from five members of the panel, followed by a moderated 17 panel encompassing pretty much everybody who's spoken so 18 far, except for Bill, who somehow weaseled out of it. 19 Bill's an academic, so he gets a very short 20 introduction. Bill is General Counsel at the Federal 21 Trade Commission, on leave from George Washington 22 University Law School where I met him when I visited 23 there, and he was foolish enough, after that experience, 24 to hire me to work here. Bill is a long time scholar on 254 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025competition law and policy, here to offer us his 1 perspectives on competition policy in the health care 2 marketplace. 3 MR. KOVACIC: Thank you, David, and on behalf 4 of the Federal Trade Commission and Department of 5 Justice, I want to welcome you back to the second day of 6 our major initiative: hearings on competition policy in 7 health care. 8 What I'd like to do this morning is, once 9 again, to just briefly acknowledge the contributions of 10 our many staff members who have put these hearings 11 together to give you a sense, again, of who's made this 12 all possible. To say a few words about the rationale for 13 the hearings, why we've made a major commitment of 14 resources to this undertaking, and then to simply 15 identify what we see to be some of the major objectives 16 of this enterprise. 17 In doing this, I just want to remind you, 18 again, I'm giving you my own views and not those of the 19 Commission. I had occasion soon after I came to the FTC 20 to have that disclaimer delivered through a translator in 21 a somewhat garbled way and the audience laughed out loud. 22 That's usually not a big applause line, but later I was 23 told that the translator had said, Kovacic is not 24 speaking for the Federal Trade Commission and it's not 255 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025clear that he has any of his own ideas. 1 (Laughter.) 2 MR. KOVACIC: So, though I do speak for myself, 3 let me give you a couple of thoughts about what we're 4 attempting to do and why we've made this commitment. 5 I want to simply highlight for you, again, the 6 types of resources and talent in the agencies that have 7 been brought to bear on this. I do want to thank our 8 colleagues at the Department of Justice. You heard Hew 9 Pate yesterday and I just echo his comments about the 10 enormous value in having a collaboration between the two 11 agencies in doing this work. My own pleasure in getting 12 to work with Hew on this project with two friends from my 13 wife's law firm, Debby Majoras and Leslie Overton, with 14 Bill Berlin and the entire team from the Department of 15 Justice. 16 Let me also simply highlight closer to home, 17 because I have the pleasure of working with them much 18 more extensively, the contributions of our own colleagues 19 at the FTC. First, the folks you met when you came 20 through the door, Angela Wilson, Julia Knoblauch and 21 Mizuki Tanabe, who are responsible for all of the 22 infrastructure that makes the event possible. Nicole 23 Gorham, who sits in the back, who's also provided vital 24 support in simply the preparation of the materials, the 256 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025distributed materials. Sarah Mathias, who came to us in 1 September from Jones Day. 2 And as just a wonderful introduction to one of 3 my favorite corridors in the building, when I walk by our 4 little Policy Studies Group on the fifth floor, I feel as 5 though I'm walking through the locker room of the 1961 6 New York Yankees and seeing names like Maris, Mantle, 7 Howard, Skowron, Ford, on the lockers. It gives me 8 confidence that every day at the agency is going to be a 9 success. 10 And last, I do want to salute David Hyman. To 11 use another baseball analogy, I once had an occasion at a 12 social event to talk to Jim Palmer, the Hall of Fame 13 Baltimore Orioles pitcher, and Palmer was talking about 14 the 1966 season, which was a championship season for the 15 Orioles, and over the off-season, they had picked up 16 Frank Robinson from the Cincinnati Reds in one of the 17 greatest one-sided trades ever in the history of 18 professional baseball. And Palmer talks about how in his 19 rookie year that year, watching in spring training Frank 20 Robinson hit a 450-foot home run with one hand, having 21 been fooled by a pitch. And Palmer turned to Paul Blair, 22 who was a star outfielder on the Orioles, and said, we're 23 going to win the World Series this year. 24 The day that David decided he'd come and work 257 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025with us on this project, I knew we were going to win the 1 World Series of hearings. So, thanks to the entire team 2 for putting this together. 3 Why dedicate the amount of time we have to 4 this? Why make this a focus of 30 days of hearings? 5 First, a bit about the rationale. For the Federal Trade 6 Commission, having compiled a data set of the FTC's 7 competition policy work since 1960, the field of health 8 care, both the provision of health care services, and if 9 you expand that to include pharmaceutical products, 10 health care accounts for more FTC enforcement actions in 11 the past 40 years than any other single sector of the 12 Commission's work. This is simply, far and away, the 13 central and most important area of the FTC's competition 14 policy work in the past 40 years, especially since the 15 filing of the path-breaking American Medical Association 16 case in 1976. 17 It's not an exaggeration to say that this is 18 the single, most significant area of FTC competition 19 policy work and the area in which, starting with the 20 tetracycline investigation in the 1960s, carrying through 21 to the revival of enforcement in several fields of health 22 care, simply the most important competition policy arena 23 of FTC work in that period. And these hearings reflect 24 our own interests. I think if you did a similar profile 258 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025of the Department of Justice, you would likewise be 1 struck with the amount of civil merger and non-merger 2 work that the Division has done since 1960 in this field. 3 A second respect is what I call competition 4 policy research and development, and this is a phrase 5 that I borrow from a recent speech of Tim Muris. Those 6 of you who have spent some time in academia -- and 7 happily, we have a number of you here -- those of you who 8 haven't, I'll simply give you a bit of insight into how 9 academics work. There are two ways to come up with ideas 10 in academia and phrases. One is to develop them on your 11 own. That tends to be painful and difficult. The other 12 is to take them from someone else, which is much more 13 pleasing and a much more effective shortcut. 14 So, I take them from Tim Muris, another 15 academic. He'll understand the ritual, that I've done 16 it. Tim has developed the phrase \"Competition Policy 17 Research and Development.\" What do we mean by this? We 18 mean all of the intellectual development and foundation 19 building that goes into sound enforcement and 20 policymaking. 21 Soon after coming back to the Commission and 22 seeing the amount of effort that we and the Justice 23 Department had dedicated to our intellectual property 24 hearings and to a variety of other non-case enforcement 259 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025matters, I have an acquaintance on the outside who said, 1 that's interesting, but why don't you get down to the 2 serious work of bringing cases, why spend time on this 3 stuff. 4 And I could imagine that same person going to a 5 pharmaceutical company and saying, why do you have an R&D 6 lab, why don't you just fire all the scientists and just 7 put drugs out into the marketplace. Indeed, why test 8 them at all? Trials? Tests? Simply have someone come 9 up with an idea about a new drug and put it out there, 10 see how it goes. People live, people die, it doesn't 11 matter. Tests? Ahh, it's expensive, difficult. Why 12 have an R&D lab? 13 I think what you're seeing, in many respects -- 14 and this is part of an evolution that's taken place over 15 the past decade in particular, you're seeing an 16 increasing recognition on the part of the federal 17 competition agencies that investing in the development of 18 a knowledge base is every bit as important as developing 19 the cases that ultimately show up in the courtroom, the 20 consent decrees or other matters. 21 What we're seeing is a fundamental recognition 22 that the capacity of the agencies to do good work 23 requires investment in what Tim has called competition 24 policy R&D. And the pay-off, the significance is the 2510 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025last point I have on this slide, what I call intellectual 1 leadership. 2 In a world in which competition policy 3 authority is shared, not only across the federal level 4 with two competition policy authorities, but many other 5 federal institutions, as we heard yesterday, that shape 6 the competition policy environment and 50 state 7 governments and public utility regulators at the state 8 level and dozens of competition policy authorities 9 overseas, all of whom have concurrent, non-exclusive 10 authority, how do you make your voice heard? How do you 11 get people to pay attention to you? 12 Intellectual leadership, as Tim has said, is 13 the currency of exchange in the modern world of 14 policymaking. And those who invest in developing the 15 ideas, those who develop the high ground, have the 16 capacity to shape the way people think about competition 17 policy. Thus, the rationale for spending 30 days on 18 hearings. 19 What do we hope to get out of this? Let me 20 simply finish by turning to a couple of specific 21 objectives we have for this undertaking. The first is to 22 improve our understanding of the institutional 23 arrangements through which health care is delivered and 24 through which pharmaceutical products, through which 2511 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025health care providers operate, through which the field 1 functions. 2 Here -- again, my second bit of academic theft 3 -- I turn to a speech that Tim gave about a month and a 4 half ago in Washington called Improving the Economic 5 Foundations of Competition Policy. In this speech, Tim 6 spent a great deal of time focusing on how good economic 7 analysis today increasingly demonstrates an appreciation, 8 developed from the work of Ronald Coase, Oliver 9 Williamson and a number of other scholars, Mancur Olson, 10 Douglas North, that to make sensible judgments about the 11 appropriate content of public policy, one needs to know 12 more about the institutions through which the commercial 13 activity in question takes place. 14 What are these institutional arrangements? 15 First, a host of commercial phenomena that we'll be 16 looking at in great detail. How is the marketplace 17 itself changing? What is the changing relationship among 18 the principal participants in the health care field? And 19 last, a point that several of our contributors yesterday 20 mentioned in here, starting with Tom Scully's comments, 21 but Mark Pauly, Paul Ginsburg and Marty Gaynor's comments 22 yesterday, you have to know more about the regulatory 23 environment, and if you don't focus on how the regulatory 24 environment shapes competition policy outcomes, you've 2512 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025really missed a crucial ingredient of the health care 1 competitive field. 2 I will say that this, again, reflects something 3 we are seeing in other areas. In the work we've done 4 with the Department of Justice in the IP area, we've 5 spent lots of time in our IP hearings looking at 6 collateral government institutions, the work of the 7 Patent and Trademark Office, the work of the Food and 8 Drug Administration. 9 In our work in electric power, in our work in 10 the communications sector, we're also observing how 11 decisions of collateral public institutions shape 12 outcomes. And, indeed, the work we've done in the 13 defense field, which has some striking similarities with 14 health care, both with respect to the price control 15 mechanism that Tom Scully talked about yesterday, the 16 tremendous interface between regulatory design, 17 regulatory intervention with a significant area for 18 private activity and reliance on private service 19 providers. 20 Part of what we hope to do in these hearings is 21 bring to bear and to draw out from our participants 22 observations about how the regulatory environment 23 operates. And, indeed, how it might be changed to 24 improve outcomes in the field. 2513 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025The second key objective is to improve our 1 capacity for formulating policy itself. And the first 2 ingredient of this is to improve the conceptual 3 foundation on which we work. Notice these are called 4 competition policy hearings, not antitrust enforcement 5 alone. That's a deliberate effort to signal our interest 6 in a broader array of policy responses beyond the 7 bringing of specific cases and to take into account, 8 again, the institutional arrangements that shape 9 commercial outcomes and shape government policy that 10 affects those outcomes. 11 Indeed, we intend to focus on consumer 12 protection issues, especially involving the information 13 concerns that our academic panelists addressed in great 14 detail yesterday. And, yes, indeed, where appropriate, 15 to make adjustments in the regulatory arena, to propose 16 those adjustments to improve outcomes in the marketplace. 17 This has an important implication; namely, picking the 18 right policy instruments. I would be surprised if at the 19 end of this process, all we have to say, certainly in the 20 report that we offer, focuses exclusively on the 21 prosecution of antitrust cases through the traditional 22 litigation mechanism. 23 Indeed, selecting the right policy instrument 24 increasingly is going to involve not only the work of the 2514 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025division and the Commission, but the work of state 1 governments in a host of different settings and, indeed, 2 other federal agencies that we don't usually think of as 3 being competition policy agencies, but nonetheless, have 4 an enormous influence on the competitive environment. 5 And here I simply offer, as Tom Scully suggested 6 yesterday, one example, and that's the Department of 7 Health and Human Services. 8 Final observation for this morning and that 9 simply involves improving the empirical basis for 10 policymaking. Again, one of the most encouraging, for 11 me, developments that we are seeing in the competition 12 policymaking environment at the national level today is a 13 greater dedication of resources to improving our 14 understanding of the effects of what we have done and 15 what we have not done in this area. The FTC's hospital 16 retrospectives are, perhaps, the best example. 17 If you use a health care analogy and you apply 18 it to the antitrust world, you see some interesting 19 anomalies in how the agencies have done business before. 20 These are, we bring cases and typically we don't go back 21 and look at what happened. Imagine a hospital or a 22 physician -- a hospital that performs surgery pushes the 23 patient out the door and says, don't come back. In fact, 24 don't talk to us again, we don't want your address, we 2515 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025don't care how things turned out. We're going to assume, 1 as a matter of faith, that you're better. 2 And, indeed, if you were simply to study our 3 press releases and our competitive impact statements, you 4 would believe that we have the most magnificent group of 5 competition policy doctors on earth because we always do 6 better by the patient. We operate, we take out the bad 7 stuff and the patient lives well, so we say. 8 I think what we're seeing now is an increasing 9 willingness to go back and test these propositions 10 empirically in a number of different ways, as well as to 11 do basic empirical research that bears upon the operation 12 of existing regulatory structures, and I simply highlight 13 here our generic drug study, which involved a major 14 commitment over a two-year period to doing this kind of 15 R&D. 16 And, last, we'd really like to continue the 17 momentum that's developing to do more empirical work in 18 this area. And I simply think back to Marty Gaynor's 19 presentation yesterday. Notice how many places where 20 Marty has taught us something. Not only was it a 21 wonderful tour through the field and, again, we're so 22 grateful that our witnesses are devoting this kind of 23 heavy lifting to giving us a fresh look on what's 24 happening. But notice how provocative the presentation 2516 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025was, both in terms of telling us what we know, but what 1 we don't know. And I think part of what we would like to 2 do over time is, indeed, to press the field more in the 3 direction of doing a greater amount of empirical work in 4 this area. 5 So, to finish up, really three things that we 6 hope to take away from these hearings. We want to know 7 more about the institutions. Again, as Tim and Hew put 8 it yesterday, in a non-adversarial setting where we're 9 listening. These are hearings, not talkings. So, you 10 won't hear a lot of -- indeed, you'll hear very little 11 more from me in another 15 seconds. To listen more and 12 to learn more. 13 Second, to use the hearings to formulate 14 strategy in a broad sense. And last, to improve the 15 empirical foundation on which we work. 16 So, again, my thanks to my colleagues of the 17 Division and the Commission for their work in doing this. 18 My thanks to all of the participants for contributing to 19 this vital initiative and my thanks to all of you for 20 coming and participating in the process. Thank you. 21 (Applause.) 22 MR. HYMAN: Thank you, Bill. I'd like to 23 introduce Professor Jim Blumstein now who's going to talk 24 for about 25 or 30 minutes. Jim is the Centennial Chair 2517 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025in Law and the Director of the Health Policy Center at 1 Vanderbilt University. He has written at length about a 2 range of issues in health care, as co-author of one of 3 the leading textbooks, at least I use it for my classes, 4 and for some unaccountable reason, he has also chosen to 5 write at length about constitutional law. 6 DR. BLUMSTEIN: David, thank you. It's a 7 delight to hear Bill talk about the goals of this set of 8 hearings and the analogy to the drug company getting rid 9 of its R&D department. It's nice to see that the Federal 10 Trade Commission is still in the hands now of good 11 academics, and that's a relief. 12 David, thank you for organizing all these 13 programs. It's a pleasure and I'm privileged to be here 14 to participate. I must say, I had a little bit of 15 trepidation this morning as I was sitting in the taxi and 16 totally gridlocked and worried whether we'd make it here. 17 I thought I had left ample time and then the lights kept 18 turning green. I said, why isn't anyone moving. And, of 19 course, you don't understand Washington. I forgot my 20 origins in New York, having lived in Nashville for so 21 long. 22 Debates about health care and the role of 23 competition sometimes take on a very heated dimension and 24 sometimes they really have almost a religious fervor to 2518 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025them. Some advocates of competition thought that 1 competition and that the result of competition would look 2 a certain way when things sorted out and they have been 3 disappointed with the way that the industry has 4 responded. My colleague and sometime mentor, Clark 5 Havighurst, has just recently written a paper that shows 6 great angst about how the system has worked. 7 Some, on the other hand -- and I think Tim 8 Muris' talk yesterday mentioned this -- view competition 9 as a process which is to preserve a structure, set up a 10 system of incentives for competition, look at empirical 11 evidence where that informs, but also look at structure 12 and incentives quite independent of empirical evidence, 13 and not to have a stake in how the system or how the 14 institutions develop or evolve, but to focus on the 15 process. 16 I was thinking of a story, and it's always 17 risky, but the Internet just is so tempting these days. 18 You get all these stories. And I was thinking of a story 19 that would kind of capture the problem of prayers being 20 answered. This is a story of a woman who goes to her 21 rabbi and has a serious problem. She has two parrots, 22 female parrots, and they've picked up a terrible habit 23 that's very embarrassing to her. Whenever she has 24 visitors, the two parrots say together, hi, we're 2519 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025hookers, we want to have some fun, do you want to have 1 some fun. 2 To her surprise, the rabbi breaks into a smile 3 and explains that he has two parrots that he's been 4 training religiously and that they pray a lot and that 5 they're dressed up in religious garb and they have a 6 prayer book and so forth. So, the rabbi has a solution. 7 He tells the woman to bring her parrots over to his house 8 and he would introduce her parrots to his parrots. And 9 so, she does that. She sees the parrots, introduces her 10 parrots into the cage, and immediately her parrots say, 11 hi, we're hookers, want to have some fun. And one of the 12 rabbi's parrots immediately turns to the other and 13 squawks and says, Moisha, put the book down, our prayers 14 have been answered. 15 (Laughter.) 16 DR. BLUMSTEIN: So, I think some people saw the 17 introduction of competition much like those parrots saw 18 the introduction of the other parrots to the cage. And I 19 think we have to be careful and have more modest 20 expectations about what is going to come from or has come 21 from competition, and within the time frame, what 22 realistically can happen and to realize that this is not 23 going to be a win or a lose situation, but an ongoing 24 struggle, and I'm going to talk about that over the 2520 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025course of my presentation. 1 I want to organize my comments around five 2 points or five areas. First, again, taking comments from 3 the Chairman seriously, to talk about some first 4 principles and some background. I want to walk through 5 some of these introductory points about different ways of 6 thinking about health care and the importance of 7 understanding those core differences and differences in 8 values that are involved in the debates. 9 Then I want, secondly, to focus on some 10 substantive areas of inquiry, some thoughts that I want 11 to present about areas that need some additional thought. 12 In this area, bundling and monopsony, I'm going to talk 13 about as major issues. 14 Third, I want to talk about some doctrinal 15 issues. I'm going to make the case against doctrinal 16 exceptionalism. That is to say, I'm going to make the 17 argument that the antitrust law does fine in coping with 18 the specific kinds of concerns that some critics of the 19 antitrust law have brought out and that there's not a 20 case to be made for doctrinal exceptionalism and that we 21 should follow the old-fashioned strategy, which is, that 22 if the values that inhere in antitrust are incompatible 23 or need to be modified in a certain small segment of the 24 health care industry, then the right way to do that is to 2521 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025get legislative exceptionalism rather than doctrinal 1 exceptionalism. 2 Fourth, enforcement issues. I want to talk a 3 little bit about the educational role -- Bill has 4 mentioned this -- for government. I'm going to propose 5 that the Commission do some work in the area of judicial 6 education. And I don't mean that tongue in cheek. I 7 mean in the sense of sponsoring programs that will be 8 oriented towards judges to understand some of the issues. 9 As David knows, for many years, we did judicial education 10 at Vanderbilt. He participated in the program. Those 11 were State Court Justices, but we've also done it for 12 Federal Appellate Judges. 13 And then, finally, the importance of the 14 research mission, which I will talk about as fifth and 15 finally. 16 All right, let's go back to the background. 17 Key health policy issues differ, and how one even 18 identifies issues in the area differ based upon some 19 normative assumptions. This is why the area is so 20 contentious. This is not purely a question about 21 resource allocation, but it's also a question about a 22 normative overlay of why health care is different. Why 23 do we care about access to health care in ways that we 24 don't care about access to certain other things? 2522 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025We worry about it because of our concern about, 1 broadly speaking, redistributive values and some notion 2 of egalitarianism. If one looks at this from a 3 traditional viewpoint, there's an egalitarian objective 4 of access to health care. The access agenda is driven by 5 this egalitarian ethic. Value judgments are critical, 6 but in these debates, they're often -- usually submerged 7 and they're not discussed. Antitrust law has a way of 8 bringing these debates to the fore and requiring that 9 they be addressed quite directly. 10 Also, traditionally, health care has been an 11 area of professional or scientific prerogatives. A 12 notion is that these are scientific judgments, there's a 13 single right way of doing things, and that build together 14 with the egalitarian ideal that there should not be 15 stratification, that there should not be differences 16 within the market, that there's a single right way of 17 providing medical care, and if there's divergence, that 18 we should do what we can to overcome those divergences. 19 Whereas in markets, we know that there's room for lots of 20 different levels of quality, different tastes, and so 21 forth in the market. 22 So, the introduction of markets and market 23 thinking requires some degree of normative change within 24 the traditional vision of how health care is provided. 2523 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025If you ask for customization in a market, that's 1 understood. But customization is a difficult sell now in 2 medical care, although it's beginning to happen, we heard 3 yesterday, from Paul Ginsburg. But it's a difficult sell 4 because doctors have been trained traditionally to think 5 that there's a single medically correct standard of care. 6 What is the standard of care? And it applies to everyone 7 alike. That's a scientific judgment, not an economic 8 judgment. 9 For market-oriented folks, the issues focus not 10 so much on access or on professional prerogatives and 11 judgments but on individual choice and the use of 12 incentives to shape decision making. That is, how do we 13 introduce economic factors into the decision making 14 process. Basically, how much care is provided and who 15 decides? Those kinds of questions. 16 The professional model shifts the authority to 17 the professional decision maker and away from consumers 18 and insulates, to a large extent, those decisions from 19 economic factors. 20 So, the different models, the different ways of 21 thinking are important. Let me talk about those 22 different ways of thinking. The professional or the 23 market oriented models or paradigms are broad categories 24 and we talk about these as if they're very different. 2524 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025But, in fact, elements of both must exist. We're not 1 talking about one or the other. It's a continuum that 2 we're looking at and the issue is, where along a 3 continuum must we be. Traditionally, I would argue that 4 we've been at one end of the continuum, traditionally up 5 until, say, 15 years ago at one end of a continuum, and 6 now we're moving more into some middle ground. The 7 question is, where along this continuum will it lie? 8 Bill was talking about baseball stories, but 9 let me tell you my analogy. Yogi Berra was once asked, 10 what's more important in baseball, physical ability or 11 mental attitude. He thought a moment and said, 90 12 percent of the game is mental, the other half is 13 physical. In the health care arena, one might say that 14 90 percent of the issue is professional, but the other 15 half is economic. 16 What are the assumptions and implications of 17 the professional model? It reflects an approach to 18 perceived market failure. We've heard a lot in the 19 literature about market failure. The professional model 20 observes the lack of knowledge on the part of consumers 21 and the scientific expertise of physicians. The 22 professional model substitutes professional controlled 23 decision making for that of consumers and, as a result, 24 vests tremendous authority to determine quality and 2525 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025volume of services and, ultimately, costs on professional 1 providers. 2 The assumption is that patients are uniformed 3 and that the market cannot function in the face of such 4 consumer ignorance. When we had an election, the last 5 election cycle in Tennessee, there was kind of this 6 person on the street interviewing this -- this fellow was 7 being interviewed and he was asked by the reporter, 8 what's the worst problem today regarding the political 9 process, voter ignorance or voter apathy. And the guy 10 thought for a moment and said, you know, I don't know and 11 I don't care. 12 That's basically the assumption of the 13 professional paradigm, which has, as I said, vested 14 enormous authority in professionals to make fundamental 15 decisions about medical care. 16 A further assumption of the scientific approach 17 is that diagnosis and treatment decisions are not 18 influenced by financial incentives. Financial incentives 19 do not affect professional judgment. I remember being 20 told early on by a doctor, that's a nice young man, that 21 you think economics has some role to play in medical 22 decision making, but it's not like candy. Economics has 23 nothing to do with medical decision making. It's a 24 scientific process. 2526 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025We've come a long way from that. I don't think 1 doctors would say that quite in as extreme a position 2 today, but I think there's certainly a kernel of that -- 3 more than a kernel of that belief that still exists. The 4 lack of influence of financial incentives allowed us to 5 develop a system of third party payment with a blank 6 check and with minimal oversight, which we heard about 7 from Tom Scully yesterday, Medicare, and to some extent, 8 Medicaid. We assume that the flow of dollars would not 9 affect levels of utilization despite the fact that 10 economists have told us that that is completely contrary 11 to what we normally expect in economic thinking. 12 The bottom line was that doctors controlled the 13 system because of their scientific expertise, because of 14 the respect that flowed from that expertise, and to some 15 extent, because they controlled patients and this gave 16 them economic leverage. The hospitals were beholden to 17 doctors and competition, to the extent that it existed, 18 was for doctors, and that's how we got the medical arms 19 race hypothesis -- that hospitals were catering in their 20 competition to doctors. And we heard about some of this 21 yesterday, about how competition in a regulatory 22 environment can lead to some perverse outcomes. 23 The market paradigm challenges many of these 24 assumptions. The assumption and implication of the 2527 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025market model is that the appropriate market oriented 1 response to consumer ignorance is guess what, education 2 and improved flow of information. We've seen this all 3 around us. We now have shared decision making models 4 being developed jointly by Al Mulley at Harvard and Jack 5 Wennberg at Dartmouth with an increased flow of 6 information. The Internet is a font of that information 7 and we now see that in many areas -- and the AIDS victims 8 really were the pioneers here, where the patients know 9 more about the illness that they have than their 10 physicians because they have an incentive to learn about 11 that. 12 The market model contemplates a greater role in 13 decision making for the patient, either directly or 14 through information intermediaries. Payers or consumers 15 control decisions about quality and levels of service and 16 quantity produced. 17 And, bear in mind this riddle. If you have a - 18 - which is the case for the market approach. If you have 19 a donkey race in which a person puts up $1,000 and the 20 owner of the donkey that finishes last -- there are only 21 two donkeys. The owner of the donkey that finishes last 22 gets the $1,000. So, the donkeys are told -- the owners 23 mount their donkeys, the whistle blows and neither one 24 moves. They go through a whole bunch of explanations, 2528 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025they appeal to their better nature, to the fact that the 1 rules require them to try their hardest, and they keep 2 blowing the whistle and no one moves. Can someone 3 suggest a solution? 4 What's the solution? Well, next thing you 5 know, the donkeys are mounted and the whistle blows and 6 they go as fast as they can to the finish line. And the 7 question is, how did they solve this problem? And the 8 answer is, that they had the owners switch donkeys. All 9 right? It changes the incentives. 10 Basically, the goal is to develop a system 11 where incentives are properly aligned and where private 12 decision makers make both self-interested and socially 13 appropriate decisions. The goal is to get a solution 14 like having the owners switch donkeys. 15 Now, why has the market model developed? My 16 punch line here is that the antitrust law is the engine 17 of the market paradigm, but let me go through three or 18 four other -- quickly, other examples, other reasons. 19 We've seen the evidence that financial 20 incentives in medical care influence medical decision 21 making on both the demand side and the supply side. 22 We've seen evidence of that. We've seen a cost 23 escalation that was linked to third party payment that 24 suggested that financial incentives made a difference. 2529 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025We've seen that when we encourage people to have 1 outpatient facilities, they build outpatient facilities. 2 When we encourage them to have dedicated programs, we 3 heard about this yesterday, they tend to build dedicated 4 programs. Paul Ginsburg recounted that example as well. 5 Third, clinical uncertainty. Again, Jack 6 Wennberg at Dartmouth published this eye opening atlas. 7 When you present this to judges and you just see their 8 eyes pop out of their head to see the clinical 9 uncertainty, the different levels of procedures that are 10 being provided and performed in different jurisdictions 11 when the researchers control for everything imaginable. 12 And so, the scientific claim for medicine has been 13 somewhat undermined and suggesting a greater role for 14 consumer choice. 15 And then, of course, in the '80s, the shift is 16 payment systems to the DRGs and more through managed care 17 with capitation, all basically push towards a different 18 vision of medical care suggesting that economics had a 19 role. But I've argued that the antitrust doctrine is the 20 engine of the market model. 21 And now, I want to talk about application of 22 the antitrust law and why it's so important in this 23 transformation, moving down that continuum from a pure 24 professional paradigm to a mixed model that includes a 2530 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025heavy dose of economic thinking. 1 I would argue that antitrust doctrine is 2 substantively and symbolically important. First, it 3 applies to trade or commerce. So, at the threshold, 4 we're thinking about issues that are trade or commerce. 5 It's not purely a professional delivery system, a social 6 services delivery system. 7 It shifts the vocabulary. Things that old-time 8 health planners talked about about how coordination is a 9 good thing all of a sudden becomes conspiracy, not such a 10 good thing, collective action. The old-time hospital 11 managers were told to eliminate wasteful duplication. 12 The plan is to eliminate this, and filtered through the 13 prism of antitrust, this becomes territorial market 14 division. You don't want to say you do services on the 15 west side of the river, we'll do services on the east 16 side of the river. In the health planning model, that's 17 a good thing. In the antitrust world, that's probably 18 five years or more in prison. 19 So, substantively, antitrust evaluates conduct 20 on grounds of a competition and efficiency. It 21 encourages competing away excess profits and cross 22 subsidization. This is something that the health system 23 has lived on for many years, but it is hard to do when 24 super-competitive profits are being competed away and 2531 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025that many monopolies are being targeted. In the old 1 days, the opponents of this would call this cream 2 skimming and pro-competition types would say, competing 3 away super-normal profits. 4 It also has eliminated the worthy purpose 5 defense, that anti-competitive conduct is not justified 6 in the pursuit of laudable goals. And, again, this 7 undermines, to some extent, and explains the hostility to 8 antitrust, in some quarters, the professional commitment 9 to quality at any cost. It also challenged the 10 egalitarian ideal that money should not matter in medical 11 care, that money is just not part of our thinking. 12 So, in summary, with respect to the antitrust 13 agenda, antitrust focuses on efficiency and competition 14 and it necessarily submerges concerns about equity that 15 are the concern of access-egalitarians and quality and 16 autonomy that are concerns of the professionals. And so, 17 one can understand how this would upset folks who are 18 steeped in the traditional professional paradigm. 19 But, ultimately, the potential for antitrust 20 liability is an impetus to a shift in the culture. It 21 limits the traditional guild-oriented collective conduct 22 by professionals and it provides an impetus for hospital 23 managers to make in-roads on professional control within 24 the hospital because of certain kinds of fears of 2532 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025behavior by the institution itself. 1 So, from the perspective of market reform, it's 2 important to maintain the role of antitrust. This has 3 helped to change the way policymakers think about medical 4 care and the way people in the industry think about 5 medical care, to include an economic focus and to empower 6 consumers. 7 Now, let me turn secondly to some areas of 8 inquiry that I want to highlight and to think about. And 9 here, I want to focus on three areas. Bundling is the 10 first, especially as a pricing strategy. U.S. 11 competition law has been, in my view, insufficiently 12 attentive to the potential effect on competition of 13 bundling. It's difficult because bundling can have pro- 14 competitive virtues. It's a requirement to look at the 15 context in which this arises. Pro-competitive virtues 16 include economies of scale in production and economies of 17 scope in marketing or one stop shopping. 18 Where market power exists, however, there is a 19 risk to quality and a risk to innovation. The Microsoft 20 case and insights from the Microsoft case suggest that 21 there can be pro-competitive virtues from bundling, but 22 also there can be adverse effects on competition as well. 23 And I think a fair analysis has to look at both the 24 pluses and the minuses of bundling. 2533 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025But where bundling is primarily a pricing 1 strategy, and that's what I want to focus on, the 2 production economies tend to wash out, the economies of 3 scope are what you're left with, and in Microsoft, there 4 were some clear virtues to the bundling strategy. But 5 when it's limited to pricing and scope economies, I think 6 that it can inhibit entry and it can hamper quality and 7 technological innovation. 8 The Third Circuit is now considering, en banc, 9 an important bundling case, the LePages (phonetic) case 10 involving a pricing strategy by 3M. An earlier Third 11 Circuit case, the SmithKline case, dealt with the 12 question of blocking the introduction of a new 13 competitive drug through a bundling pricing strategy, and 14 the SmithKline case has not had any progeny, but it's one 15 that's worth looking at, and we'll see how the Third 16 Circuit handles the issue in LePages. The panel had 17 rejected the plaintiff's bundling claim, overturning a 18 District Court judgment. That was vacated and is being 19 heard en banc. It was heard en banc earlier this year. 20 Second, insurer or health plan monopsony. This 21 is something that's worth thinking about. It's a paper 22 I'm working on now in the context of the introduction of 23 Tenncare in Tennessee. We heard a lot about 24 countervailing power and antitrust law tends to frown on 2534 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025countervailing power as a vehicle for overcoming anti- 1 competitive conduct, and I support that. 2 The Commission has pursued physician 3 organizations that have been developed for countervailing 4 power reasons. I think that's appropriate. 5 Monopsony, however, can result in the mis- 6 allocation of resources in the long run. For example, if 7 the price signal to the labor market suggests lower 8 prices for labor supply, that suggests, in the long run, 9 that there will be an under-supply of labor, with 10 shortages, bottlenecks and associated queuing. 11 Courts have treated insurers as purchasers with 12 the prerogative to drive a hard bargain. This is the 13 prevailing view. But when you talk to doctors, this is a 14 peculiar area to doctors. They drum up the David and 15 Goliath image and they see themselves as David, not 16 Goliath, although most people tend to see physicians as 17 having some authority. But this strikes hard at their 18 self-concept. 19 Does the reaction of the doctors suggest maybe 20 some tentative thoughts about reconceptualizing what's 21 going on? And I offer this only tentatively because I 22 haven't fully worked this out. We're doing this in a 23 paper. 24 To the extent that insurers are purchasers of 2535 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025provider services, the now conventional view, the 1 argument is in cases like Kartell and Ball Memorial that 2 Blue Cross or the insurer is the purchaser for the 3 account of others. This is the language of Judge, now 4 Justice Breyer in the Kartell case. 5 Are they financial intermediaries or purchasing 6 agents? They're acting on behalf of others. But 7 insurance companies actually have little control over if, 8 when or how services are provided. Patients initiate 9 purchase transactions. But if you look at insurance 10 companies as purchasers on the account of others, what do 11 we do about their subscribers? What role do we attribute 12 to them? Is this a purchasing co-op, are they acting as 13 agents on behalf of their subscribers? And if you look 14 at this, it's the aggregation of buying power that 15 creates the irritant here with respect to insurance 16 companies. So, they are maybe buyers, but they're a 17 different kind of a buyer than we normally think of as 18 buyers because their clout comes from the aggregation of 19 powers of their customers. 20 So, it may be that we have to be a little more 21 modest in how we think about what's going on in this 22 exchange, and I thought about a certain resemblance to 23 the collective conduct by doctor groups that the 24 Commission has prosecuted because of the anti-competitive 2536 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025distortion of the so-called messenger model, where the 1 messengers are coming and negotiating on behalf of the 2 doctors. Under those circumstances, maybe the messenger 3 model distortion that the Commission has looked at with 4 respect to doctor groups is applicable, to some extent, 5 with respect to insurance companies as well. 6 There's another way of thinking about this 7 whole exchange transaction, not that insurance companies 8 or health plans are buyers, but, in fact, are sellers of 9 access to patients. We know that access to patients is 10 very important. Hospitals vertically integrate and 11 become durable medical equipment suppliers and they have 12 an inside track to provide services and it gives them 13 great competitive advantage. 14 The anti-kickback law is concerned about giving 15 special advantage to folks who have access to patients. 16 So, selling of access gives great clout in negotiations 17 and antitrust enforcement and analysis needs to be open- 18 minded to the competitive consequences of this power of 19 selling of access, if that's how we conceptualize this. 20 Again, I haven't fully worked my way through on how to 21 look at those issues, but I think if we listen hard 22 enough to the doctors, we may be sensitive to the fact 23 that what is really irritating them is something that 24 irritates us when we look at it in different contexts, 2537 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025such as when the doctors get together and have these 1 messengers acting in ways that we don't approve, rather 2 than ways in which we do approve. 3 The third area that I want to just present for 4 thinking is standard setting as a tool of defeating 5 competition. Now, on the demand side, standard setting 6 can be pro-competitive, where it facilitates consumer 7 choice, and we've seen that in the California Dental 8 case, which I want to come to, if I have time. 9 But on the supply side, this can inhibit 10 competition and can limit innovation. It's especially 11 important when it's linked to the adoption of standards 12 for which one firm has a monopoly, a patent. So, I think 13 we need to be very careful about private companies using 14 technical features of their patents as a way of 15 inhibiting entry and inhibiting access to new technology. 16 We should insist on some link to quality or cost 17 efficiency; in other words, some pro-competitive 18 justification that would support the standard rather than 19 having kind of a game of gotcha. 20 All right, let me quickly run through -- I'm 21 getting the hook, so let me quickly run through. David 22 has a hard job, so I want to respect that. 23 First, on doctrinal issues, I make the claim 24 for no doctrinal exceptionalism. I've talked about the 2538 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025worthy purpose argument. The Courts have tended to 1 reject this. There's some exceptions to that. I think 2 that it's important to hold the line on no worthy purpose 3 defense. 4 The role of non-profit institutions, the 5 Butterworth case, the merger case is a good whipping boy. 6 It substitutes the rule of noblesse oblige for the rule 7 of competition. That's not what the antitrust laws are. 8 That's everyone's kind of poster child for doctrine run 9 amuck, and I think it's important that we not give up. 10 That's one case, preliminary injunction stage, that I 11 think that it's worth looking at and I'm glad to hear 12 that the Commission is doing research. 13 Market imperfections, I think that the goal 14 here, again, should be to perfect the market, not to 15 substitute the market. I don't see a reason for 16 doctrinal change. Market imperfections can be dealt with 17 within conventional antitrust law. 18 The fourth area, quality. Again, quality can 19 be dealt with within conventional antitrust law. It is a 20 method of non-price competition that is traditionally 21 recognized in competition policy, in competition law. 22 There's no need to develop doctrinal exceptionalism to 23 deal with quality. What it requires is a change in 24 rhetoric. It requires a change in the views of doctors, 2539 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025what they're doing when they're pursuing quality. 1 They're pursuing quality for market share. They're 2 pursuing quality because it's consumer-justified, not 3 because it's their professional prerogative to impose 4 quality standards on willing consumers. And I think it's 5 important that doctors justify their quality rationale in 6 pro-competitive terms. It's hard sometimes to do. 7 Finally, in doctrinal, I want to talk about Cal 8 Dental and then I'll conclude. I'll try to do this in 9 one minute. The Cal Dental case, I think, has caused a 10 great funk among marketeers in some circles. I think 11 that one has to be loyal in looking at Cal Dental and I 12 think that one has to look at this in terms of the 13 procedural posture and also, that it was argued within an 14 antitrust framework. It was good lawyering on the part 15 of the victors in that case, the Dental Association. 16 The claim of improved quality of information to 17 consumers is perfectly consistent with a pro-competitive 18 justification. A standardization on the demand side is 19 something that's totally compatible with a market 20 approach. The problem was that we saw that a procedural 21 shortcut, the so-called quick look analysis was being 22 disapproved in that case. But I think the argument is 23 that what we have to do is do a better job of educating 24 the judges and not taking the procedural shortcuts at the 2540 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025first instance. 1 The per se rules all developed over time where 2 the Courts said, oh, gosh, we've seen these price fixing 3 cases, we've seen a lot of them, we know that they're not 4 pro-competitive, we're going to have a procedural 5 shortcut to do that. You don't do that at the start of 6 the process. One does that strategically as a 7 culmination of a series of cases, of good cases. 8 So, what I would urge, again, is through the 9 enforcement mechanisms, not to get a funk about that 10 case, but to go back and build huge records, big records 11 that show that what was really going on in that case was 12 what Justice Breyer said in his dissent, is that they 13 were creating these barriers so that there was no 14 information flow going forward. The problem was that the 15 result of those restraints on advertising were such that 16 there was -- it was too expensive and there was no 17 communication going forward. 18 So, I think that we should take a better -- 19 maybe I'm a Pollyanna on this, but take a more sanguine 20 view of the Cal Dental case and treat it as a challenge 21 to explain what we're doing, make our case and then 22 eventually get the procedural shortcuts that we want to 23 have after we've won a few of these cases at the Supreme 24 Court level and move forward from there. 2541 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Basically, I'm going to support the research 1 agenda that's going forward. The one area that I would 2 look at in terms of research, with respect to non- 3 profits, is bidding. I think that there's lots of hope, 4 good prospects for encouraging pro-competitive 5 alternatives by a bidding strategy and I would encourage 6 -- and I'll talk about this in the discussion afterwards 7 -- about developing the strategies for bidding as a 8 vehicle for getting cost consciousness into health plans. 9 Thank you very much. 10 (Applause.) 11 MR. HYMAN: Thank you very much, Jim. Our next 12 speak is Peter Hammer who is an Assistant Professor of 13 Law at the University of Michigan, School of Law, who's 14 written a significant number of articles about this 15 particular subject, many of them with Bill Sage, 16 including a major empirical study of health care 17 antitrust litigation since, I think, 1985 to 1999. 18 That's my vague recollection. 19 So, Peter. 20 DR. HAMMER: I'm a neophyte with this brand new 21 technology. So, bear with me. 22 This is the slide -- to sort of give you the 23 warning from the airlines, that this is not the plane 24 that you expected to be flying, that you're at the wrong 2542 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025FTC competition hearing. We're charged today to try to 1 talk about perspectives on competition policy and the 2 health care marketplace. 3 My title or the focus I want to think about is 4 competition in the context of failure. The law school 5 just got done with a large building campaign and there 6 were these cheesy slogans about from excellence to 7 excellence and strength to strength. The problem about 8 trying to build a competition policy, it only gets 9 interesting in light of market failures. So, you really 10 have to be thinking about how to build upon failure and 11 that's the kind of challenge that I'm going to be talking 12 about today, how you successfully develop a competition 13 policy in light of substantial market failures. 14 I'd give deference to the funders. A large 15 part of this is an outgrowth of work that I've done with 16 my colleague, Bill Sage, at Columbia Law School and 17 funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 18 As I read the little precept that David 19 circulated about what we were supposed to talk about in 20 this session, I distilled it down to two observations and 21 one question. The first observation is that simply 22 health care markets are very complicated, right? We sort 23 of have the litany of factors making it complicated, an 24 interesting combination of private markets, regulation 2543 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025both at the state and federal level and substantial 1 public subsidies, which is not what you normally find in 2 competitive markets. 3 Second observation that we are charged to 4 discuss is that there's multiple market failures here. 5 And the question then is how you build a competition 6 policy in light of these facts. 7 When I'm done, I hope that you will see that 8 these are actually consistent. You wouldn't expect to 9 find anything other than substantial public-private 10 cooperation, sometimes competition, sometimes 11 inconsistencies in the light of market failures. And, in 12 fact, any time you're going to have substantial market 13 failures, it is going to invite and, therefore, you're 14 going to observe interesting combinations of public and 15 private non-market institutions and the objective of a 16 competition policy then is to try to calibrate how those 17 market and non-market institutions actually work together 18 as opposed to against each other. 19 I'd like to build a general sort of analytic 20 framework for thinking about a competition policy in the 21 context of market failures, and this dovetails very 22 nicely into what Mark Pauly and Marty Gaynor were talking 23 about yesterday, and I approached this problem as an 24 economist and from the perspective of general equilibrium 2544 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025theory. If you go back as far as Arrow and DeBreu, you 1 have the proof of the efficiency of competitive markets, 2 which is sort of the analytical infrastructure supporting 3 a lot of antitrust analysis. 4 But to get to the efficiency of private 5 markets, you have a tremendous number of very restrictive 6 conditions, conditions that aren't always satisfied in 7 the real world, which leads us to the point of market 8 failures. One way to understand market failures is 9 simply going point by point down the set of restrictive 10 assumptions necessary to establish the efficiency of a 11 competitive equilibrium and say, well, this one is not 12 satisfied here, this one is not satisfied there, and at 13 the end of the day, you have a long list of market 14 failures. 15 The problem is, and this was alluded to again 16 yesterday in work coming out of Lipsey and Lancaster back 17 in the 1950s, is that if you have multiple market 18 failures, you absolutely don't have any compass left to 19 guide you as to what appropriate policy is. In the face 20 of multiple market failures, you have the world 21 oftentimes being turned upside down on itself and 22 sometimes actually having less competition might get you 23 a higher level of social welfare. The sort of 24 implication is that close is not good enough. Once 2545 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025you're dealing with market failures, you have to have a 1 more open conceptual mind to what might be proper 2 policymaking. 3 This has led a number of people to sort of go 4 in the lines of what I call sort of economic nihilism. 5 And a number of people who want to sort of be anti- 6 markets will latch on to the theory of second best as a 7 justification for simply getting rid of economic thought 8 as being useless, or -- and I don't want to put 9 necessarily Richard Markovits as an economic nihilist -- 10 try to devise very sophisticated and sometimes difficult 11 to understand prescriptions on how to then address the 12 problem within an economic framework. 13 I'm going to propose a different approach to 14 the problem of second best, and it's building upon 15 further work by Arrow, done in 1963, where he 16 contemplates an interesting economic rule for social 17 institutions. Although Arrow doesn't use the language of 18 second best in his article, he says, well, when you have 19 market failures, and Arrow's talking about the medical 20 industry back in 1963, you have these optimality gaps. 21 You have the sort of gaps between what a competitive 22 equilibrium would provide you and a level of welfare 23 optimality that you get with failed markets. 24 Sort of building on that, I call it sort of the 2546 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025social analog to the coase theorem. When that happens, 1 people respond. Institutions respond, policies respond, 2 professionals respond, and you have the sort of natural 3 emergence of a variety of social institutions that help 4 to bridge the optimality gap and then he tries to justify 5 and look through a number of traditional medical 6 institutions, circa 1960, as efforts to bridge the 7 optimality gap. 8 I like that as sort of the point of departure, 9 then, to try to think about building a competition 10 policy, one in which you can imagine market and non- 11 market institutions, and it's important to remember that 12 non-market institutions can be public as well as private, 13 and there's a role for potentially private self- 14 regulation. And the interesting question, and one that 15 Arrow doesn't necessarily focus on our answer in 1963, 16 how do you try to get these sets of market and non-market 17 institutions working together. I sort of conceptually 18 view the work of a competition policy as building the 19 proper blend between market and non-market institutions. 20 When you do that, you have to always be 21 policing private self-interest. And this is sort of the 22 critique that Jim Blumstein was alluding to under worthy 23 purposes. This is also a wonderful rationalization for 24 anti-competitive conduct, and sort of the important 2547 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025objective of antitrust enforcement then is to filter what 1 will be welfare enhancing in the public interest from 2 what will be in private self-interest. 3 Interestingly enough, and this is why it's very 4 exciting that the FTC is holding these hearings, 5 historically, there has been no effort to develop a 6 rational competition policy. Historically, it's been 7 path-dependent, it's been accidental, and there's been 8 very few efforts to try to calibrate public and private 9 efforts to resolve market failures. 10 As you're building a competition policy, one of 11 the issues I'm going to try to focus on in my 12 presentation is what should be the proper role of 13 antitrust courts within this general framework. 14 Medical market failures. On one side, you sort 15 of see just the traditional listing. You have 16 information problems, moral hazard, adverse selection, 17 agency issues and down the line. On the other column, 18 you have what I would envision various ways in which 19 private markets or organizations can respond to market 20 failures. On the private side, sort of again thinking of 21 some of the work that Clark Havighurst has done and some 22 of the older work of Ronald Coase, oftentimes, private 23 contracting can be a response to market failure. Clark 24 Havighurst tries to argue that there's a series of legal 2548 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025obstacles about effective contracting and tries to argue 1 that contract failure actually might be a form of market 2 failure. 3 So, you want to think not only about what are 4 the list of market failures, but what's the range of ways 5 that private businesses or markets can respond. 6 Interesting contracting practice is one approach. If you 7 go back to Coase's theory of the firm you have -- really 8 vertical integration and the creation of managed care, a 9 wonderfully novel way to get the two donkeys to be ridden 10 by different riders. So, you have interesting levels of 11 ways you can restructure firms and organizational 12 innovation to respond to market failures and you also 13 have the ability to introduce new forums or products and 14 the ability to create new markets entirely. 15 So, you're sort of thinking, again, an 16 underlying system of market failures, a variety of 17 interesting potential innovative ways to respond to that. 18 How does that then influence the challenge of 19 the DOJ and the FTC? And very consistent with what Bill 20 was talking about, there's a two-fold mission when you're 21 talking about a competition policy, and one is what I 22 call inward-looking and one is sort of external or 23 outward-looking. If you're going to build a competition 24 policy -- and this I would have to have lengthier 2549 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025discussions with Jim about what are the implications for 1 antitrust doctrine -- I think you can tweak the 2 traditional antitrust doctrine and massage it in 3 interesting ways to deal more effectively with market 4 failures, but I do think you have to have some level of 5 massaging. 6 In particular, as a very interesting sort of 7 legal and analytical question, how should antitrust 8 courts deal with the problem of second best? That hasn't 9 been well thought out and there isn't very good law 10 trying to deal with that set of issues. 11 There's another underlying tension with 12 antitrust law itself between the objectives of things 13 that are going to be pro-competitive or sort of 14 structural views of competition versus things that were 15 looked at from a welfare economist as being welfare 16 enhancing, and oftentimes, the two go together. What's 17 pro-competitive is actually welfare enhancing, but there 18 may be important differences between an antitrust 19 doctrine focused on pro-competition, which is under the 20 structural view of competition, and an antitrust policy 21 grounded in social welfare or total welfare. And, 22 indeed, you have to move more in the direction of total 23 welfare if you're going to start dealing with problems of 24 second best and more effectively dealing with problems of 2550 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025market failure. 1 There's another interesting kind of conceptual 2 difference you can think of between types of 3 interventions, either public or private, that are market 4 facilitating versus ones that are market displacing. 5 Much easier to get market facilitating interventions 6 within existing antitrust doctrine. You give better 7 information. You simply make markets work more like 8 they're supposed to in the textbooks. But that will 9 foreclose a wide variety of types of interventions that 10 might be welfare enhancing that would be more market 11 displacing. So, you have another sort of interesting 12 divide about how far you push a market failure defense. 13 Clark Havighurst has an interesting article in 14 a collection of essays looking at Arrow's '63 article 15 where he tries to limit a market failure defense to 16 market facilitating, and some of the work that Bill Sage 17 and I have done try to push the envelope further in 18 antitrust doctrine to say antitrust doctrine should be 19 encompassing to take certain forms of market displacing 20 interventions as well. 21 A competition policy is also going to run 22 headlong into the state action doctrine. What do you do 23 with states that might have legislation that has adverse 24 effects upon competition? I would argue, if you really 2551 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025want to think from the ground level, you might want to 1 introduce a federalized competitive impact statement for 2 state regulations and want to get different ways to force 3 the federal mandate and the infrastructure of the 4 antitrust laws in ways that could actually help root out 5 forms of state regulations that are not pro-competitive. 6 You're going to have similar problems trying to mediate a 7 political action at the federal level and will raise 8 interesting questions on the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine. 9 Those are all things that you sort of have, 10 your antitrust hat and antitrust doctrine. If you think 11 of now external looking, it's great that Tom Scully gave 12 the keynote address yesterday because you can't have a 13 competition policy if you're not getting Medicare and 14 Medicaid into the act. 15 One interesting conceptual issue is, are there 16 ways that you can use monopsony power. Now, I'm thinking 17 not private monopsony power that Jim Blumstein was 18 discussing, but rather public monopsony power in lieu of 19 traditional regulation. That sort of opens the door that 20 actually the purchasing power might accomplish things 21 that are traditionally done through regulation. 22 At a minimum, Medicare has to be aware of its 23 conduct that is both market-shaping and market- 24 facilitating. When Medicare chooses to reimburse a new 2552 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025technology, it creates a new market. When it has a 1 misalignment of the regulatory pricing system, as we saw 2 illustrated numerous times yesterday, it creates 3 competition gaming the regulatory system. So, the 4 regulatory structure has to be conscious of those 5 effects. 6 There's other things that Medicare can do that 7 are market facilitating, improving information, 8 designating centers of excellence, a wide variety of 9 other things that private markets can actually piggyback 10 off of the innovations and improvements of Medicare. 11 More generally, at the same federal level, there has to 12 be a greater sensitivity to the competitive implications 13 of regulation, and I'll sort of raise the issue that Mark 14 Pauly also sort of raised and dodged, technology and 15 innovation has to be thought about in the context of a 16 competition policy. 17 I would argue that we probably have too much 18 innovation, too much technological change, and that you 19 need more rationality and a competitive or competition 20 policy thinking about dynamic efficiency technology and 21 innovation over time. 22 The hard part is, what's the appropriate 23 division of labor? What should the FTC do? What should 24 CMS do? What should states do? If you're going to 2553 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025devise a competition policy, you're going to have to 1 start thinking about what tasks you assign to what 2 actors. And you have to do that in light of a 3 recognition of strong institutional constraints and 4 different comparative advantages of making different 5 types of issues. So, sort of generally thinking what 6 functions can antitrust courts and antitrust enforcers 7 realistically accomplish, what's better left, as Jim 8 Blumstein was saying, to a legislative process to make 9 exceptions. 10 The problem is, at least historically, and this 11 can be solved if everybody's thinking in competitive 12 terms, if it hasn't been an antitrust issue, it hasn't 13 been thought of in competitive terms. So, if you're 14 going to create a division of labor, you want to develop 15 an infrastructure in issues that you declare not to be 16 germane to the antitrust world, to the actors, than to 17 think in competitive terms in areas that traditionally do 18 not. 19 So, what can antitrust courts do well? And 20 this is kind of a brief summary of some of the findings 21 that we found when we did a comprehensive survey of the 22 last 15 years of medical antitrust law. What antitrust 23 courts do very well is create a space for private 24 markets, and I think you can make a strong historical 2554 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025argument that but for rigorous antitrust enforcement, you 1 would not have private health care markets today. 2 The way it did that, however, was through 3 fairly blunt and traditional core antitrust principles, 4 getting rid of price fixing, policing naked restraints. 5 And there's a continuing mission for that. I don't think 6 that will ever go away. There will be a constant need to 7 be policing naked restraints. But antitrust law has not 8 been very effective going beyond these sort of core 9 principles. At least that would be my contention. 10 There's a narrow range in which antitrust law 11 can accommodate and deal with productive efficiencies and 12 I think that it has done that in health care as well as 13 other areas. But it has only limited potential, at least 14 under a traditional application of doctrine, to deal with 15 quality concerns. 16 The way that we've found antitrust laws 17 predominantly accomplishing a quality task was use of 18 heuristics of choice and of information as proxies for 19 non-price concerns. And that's actually fairly strong 20 and powerful and is done fairly successfully in antitrust 21 courts. If things minimize or limit consumer choice, 22 that's anti-competitive and, therefore, declared 23 unlawful. If things normally reduce the amount of 24 information, that's anti-competitive and unlawful. And 2555 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025protecting choice and information can indeed protect a 1 range of non-price attributes and quality competition as 2 well, but there's a lot of quality and non-price concerns 3 that don't fit within those heuristics. 4 The other way that antitrust courts have tried 5 to deal with non-price competition or quality is through 6 what I term the demand side models of non-price 7 competition. If quality can enter into the demand 8 function and either increase the price or increase the 9 number of people consuming at a particular provider, then 10 it fits the traditional antitrust mode in sort of 11 thinking through the way competition works, and to the 12 extent that quality can be incorporated in demand side 13 models, it can be fairly well protected under traditional 14 antitrust doctrine. 15 Again, it's not saying that that's not good. 16 That is good in the domain that it actually takes place. 17 It's just simply saying that these traditional concepts 18 might not necessarily protect a range of non-price and 19 quality concerns that don't fit those tight models. 20 What don't courts do well? And, again, this is 21 sort of learnings for the last 15 years of medical 22 antitrust litigation. They generally don't do well in 23 addressing and acknowledging the problem of market 24 failure. The important exception to that is the 2556 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025California Dental case that Jim was talking about, and 1 there, I think most people would say they didn't deal 2 with it necessarily well. So, there's sort of a 3 continuing challenge for antitrust courts to acknowledge 4 market failures and develop a better infrastructure to 5 try to deal with the problems of market failure. 6 Antitrust courts don't appreciate what I call 7 supply side quality concerns. An interesting sort of 8 economic, an interesting sort of thought experience is 9 what is the production function in health care. I talked 10 about production efficiencies or productive concerns on 11 the earlier slide. Not at all clear exactly what the 12 health care production function is, what is the supply 13 curve? Things that deal with technology, with 14 innovation, with the knowledge base of medicine, practice 15 guidelines, medical errors, all squishy and incredibly 16 more squishy when we when look at the Wennberg studies 17 that show that there's no consensus even on what the 18 answer is for a number of these issues. 19 Those supply side concerns are incredibly 20 important for competition policy and have not yet 21 necessarily been effectively worked into tools or 22 processes that antitrust courts have grappled with 23 effectively. 24 And the last thing I would sort of list on the 2557 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025short list of things courts don't do well, courts do not 1 address price quality trade-offs very effectively. They 2 normally assume that if they're facilitating price 3 competition that that's also protecting quality 4 competition. In a number of instances, that's true. But 5 there's a lot of instances where price and quality might 6 be in conflict and there is no general sort of analytic 7 framework to deal with price quality trade-offs, which is 8 something that's sort of core. Modern health policy now 9 is trying to make trade-offs between price and quality. 10 The objective then is to think about how you 11 get better engineering now between private markets and 12 antitrust law in public institutions or non-market 13 institutions. I would suggest that we go back to Arrow's 14 insights and we see that there's a wide range of things 15 that might be functioning to fill these optimality gaps. 16 The antitrust challenge then is to be able to do that 17 filtering function between what is welfare enhancing and 18 what is actually a sort of special interest capture or 19 private manipulation. 20 In that realm, I would say that antitrust 21 courts need to be more open to market displacing types of 22 mechanisms, to forms of cooperation that might have an 23 optimality gap-filling function, and at least to be 24 willing to have open ears towards non-traditional forms 2558 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025of arranging health care services. 1 The public policy challenge is to better 2 calibrate the social institutions to fit within an 3 interface to work well with private markets. Social 4 institutions can do as much damage as they can do good 5 and those people making public policy need to think more 6 carefully about the interventions that they have and 7 whether or not they're helping or harming competition. 8 One could imagine a wide range of plausible 9 private actions and responses to market failures. This 10 is fairly rote and tentative. You have information 11 failures, which means you get better information, 12 credentialing, accreditation, et cetera. 13 Risk selection is a more complicated problem, 14 and actually one of the difficulties of health policy is 15 trying to deal with the insurance function and the 16 provision of medical services. Would you permit private 17 actors to standardize insurance products? Interesting 18 complicated question. 19 Would you allow them to orchestrate coordinated 20 restrictions on choice in efforts to deal with problems 21 of adverse selection? In some instances you would say, 22 I'd be open to that argument. At some point, you might 23 say, this is better fit for a regulatory or 24 administrative process to set the constraints around 2559 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025which private markets are going to ultimately function. 1 Public goods are sort of straightforward. You 2 can have joint R&D. Practice guidelines might be 3 cooperatively developed. The important thing that I 4 think has been neglected is acknowledging the 5 significance of organizational innovation. And, 6 actually, I think that one of the most important things 7 that could come out of this set of hearings is just 8 simply acknowledging that one of the most important 9 things that law needs to do is not chill or deter private 10 forms of organizational innovation. 11 Creative contracting. This is going back to 12 the earlier slide about private responses to the various 13 forms of market failures, offerings of new products, new 14 forms of contracting and various forms of integration to 15 provide the financing and delivery of health care 16 services. 17 There needs to be, again, a similar sort of 18 function on the public policy screening. The minute you 19 walk in and say that public markets can respond to these 20 optimality gap-filling sort of Arrow functions, it's just 21 a feeding trough for special interest. And you have to 22 be very savvy about special interest manipulation. You 23 need a stronger sort of set of tools to try to police 24 special interest activity. 2560 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025There's a particular -- in this thing, I'm 1 showing my biases. I think that the problem is greater 2 at the state level. I think it's interesting that a lot 3 of provider functions have far greater political power at 4 the state level that eclipses even their economic power 5 within markets, and that is an area where you can get a 6 lot of state regulation that actually might be anti- 7 competitive. This, again, is going back to the thought 8 that we need to be rethinking the state action doctrine 9 and it may not be appropriate simply to defer, as a 10 matter of antitrust or competition policy, to state 11 determinations of regulation. 12 Public action can do harm. So, this is not an 13 open invitation to say that all public action is good, 14 that all public intervention necessarily facilitates the 15 working markets; that's certainly not true. The sort of 16 social engineering, the sort of legal engineering task is 17 to try to filter those that are actually aiding in 18 competition and deterring those that are not successful 19 in aiding competition. 20 Now, that being said, everything I've said so 21 far is basically within the tight economic framework, and 22 I want to sort of add a caveat here. As Jim was 23 suggesting, these are contested boundaries where economic 24 values compete with non-economic values and other 2561 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025concerns, and at some point, antitrust law in economics 1 has to be sensitive to that, and that actually might be 2 the point at which you hand off issues to the legislative 3 realm. I agree with Jim Blumstein's instincts that you 4 don't want antitrust courts to be operating in a 5 framework that would expressly consider non-economic 6 objectives. I think that is an invitation to going down 7 the road that you had in Butterworth and some other 8 opinions. 9 So, I think that there's a need to keep the 10 antitrust focus, both within the enforcement agencies and 11 within the courts, within a tight economic model. And 12 when things are not fitting within a tight economic model 13 and there are important, non-economic concerns or values 14 at stake, I think that's the point where you then send an 15 issue to the legislature. Again, as I said earlier, if 16 you're worried about special interest capture, we're not 17 always guaranteed that the product of legislation is 18 going to be in the public interest. That, at least, is a 19 conceptual framework to think about what's the 20 appropriate division of labor between antitrust in a 21 competition policy and how would you then incorporate 22 important non-economic values that are relevant in making 23 medical decisions. 24 Reiterating what I said a little bit earlier, 2562 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025law can do a lot of damage on the ability of private 1 markets to respond to market failures on their own. 2 Something I just find fascinating is the structure of 3 hospitals, just historically. No other industry has such 4 a sharp demarcation between the ownership and control of 5 sort of the physical capital in the human expertise or 6 the human capital. From a Coasean perspective, 7 completely irrational, it makes no sense. You don't have 8 law firms divided up between the partners and then the 9 people who own the buildings. When you go to an auto 10 mechanic, either the garage employs the mechanics working 11 on your car or the mechanics in a smaller setting might 12 own the garage. But there's an integration of the human 13 and the physical capital. 14 Not so in health care. And there's a lot of 15 reasons for that. You can go back to the corporate 16 practice doctrine. I would argue that the absence of the 17 ability to innovate along this sort of theory of the firm 18 or organizational dimensions has perpetuated a lot of the 19 economic market failures. There's a lot of these 20 failures that could have done more effectively through 21 integration. And, indeed, the sort of antitrust story is 22 a history of professionalism against forms of prepayment. 23 Go back to the 1943 AMA case, you know, the 1956 Oregon 24 Medical Society case, all wars against prepayment. 2563 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Prepayment then being a form of organizational 1 innovation. So, professional boycotts, the corporate 2 practice of medicine doctrine historically preventing 3 forms of efficient organizational innovation. 4 In a modern structure, Medicare is actually 5 perpetuating a lot of the limitations on the ability to 6 innovate on organizational dimensions. Things that are 7 necessary to police, fraud and abuse, in a fee-for- 8 service realm impairs substantially what a hospital can 9 do in terms of structuring its business arrangements. 10 The Stark prohibitions on self-referrals are another 11 area. I think if you're going to want to have private 12 markets freed up to deal with market failures more 13 effectively, you're going to have to think through top to 14 bottom on the whole laundry list of legal impediments to 15 organizational innovation. 16 Similarly -- I mean, and Clark Havighurst is 17 the person who's written most prolifically on this -- 18 there's all sorts of legal barriers to simply entering 19 into contracts, and a lot of this is reflective of what 20 Jim was talking about, the battle between the 21 professional paradigm and a market paradigm. It is dang 22 near impossible for me to enter into a contract to 23 provide you a lower price quality trade-off than would be 24 recognized by tort standards. 2564 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Similarly, if I'm going to now restrict your 1 choice of providers, you have the Supreme Court ERISA 2 case now out of Kentucky dealing with the provider laws. 3 There's a lot of these non-Medicare, non-antitrust rules 4 that limit the ability to private contract and the 5 ability of firms to organize. And a competition policy 6 that really is trying to maximize the ability of private 7 markets to increase total welfare has to deal with those 8 problems as well. 9 Concluding thoughts, and I sort of organized 10 these, all things that start with I, introspection, 11 interdependence, information, and intra-system 12 rationality. 13 Introspection simply says a wake-up call both 14 for antitrust professionals as well as for non-antitrust 15 actors to think about the competitive dimensions. I 16 think that antitrust actors have to be open-minded in 17 ways they historically haven't about the optimality gap- 18 filling roles of non-market institutions and be more 19 accommodating to problems of market failure and second 20 best. And, clearly, the people over at CMS and other 21 government actors that are regulating at the federal and 22 state level have to be far more sensitive to the 23 competitive effects and implications of their 24 regulations. So, some level of introspection on all 2565 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025parties' parts is necessary for competition policy to be 1 built. 2 Interdependence, and this is what makes health 3 care both interesting and perennially complicated. 4 There's multiple dimensions, they all inter-relate. It's 5 a complicated web. And you have to acknowledge that from 6 the beginning and to respect the fact that boundaries are 7 going to be blurred oftentimes and distinctions may be 8 hard to make. 9 That is then the call for information. A lot 10 of these sort of echo -- I like to see -- what Bill was 11 talking about as the objectives of these hearings. We 12 need more empirical understanding of what the effects of 13 particular business relationships are on important 14 outcomes, both price competitive and quality outcomes. 15 One of the most shocking things about the 16 survey of antitrust litigation that we did, not even a 17 handful of cases or sections of cases out of 500 that we 18 examined dealt with learning or information that could be 19 gained from the health services research literature. 20 There's these huge walls between antitrust lawyers, their 21 clients and not trying to incorporate and learn empirical 22 dimensions into the litigation strategies or to try and 23 aid courts as a matter of education or even lawyer's 24 themselves as a matter of competitive consequences. 2566 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Some of that requires generating new 1 information and there's a whole series of important 2 empirical questions that we need to just get better 3 answers to that we don't have the answers. Some of that 4 is actually learning from what we know already, and we 5 haven't even begun that process. 6 And the final I that I would throw out is what 7 I call intra-system rationality. We have to make the 8 pieces that we have fit together. And I think the Arrow 9 framework in thinking about the role, the complementary 10 role of particular forms of non-market institutions and 11 markets can help us make it fit together better. But 12 that's got to be the goal. 13 And so far, if you look historically, 14 everybody's been in their little domains without a lot of 15 discussions of cross boundaries, and one of the most 16 exciting things to me about these set of hearings, 17 particularly one looking at competition policy broadly, 18 and not just antitrust policy, is letting these 19 conversations take place to hopefully get more rational 20 pieces of the puzzle being fit together in the aid of not 21 just simply competition, but of making health care more 22 effective, more affordable and higher quality for the 23 American people. 24 (Applause.) 2567 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025MR. HYMAN: Thank you, Peter. We're going to 1 take about a seven to eight-minute break and we'll start 2 up again at 11:00 with a panel discussion. Thank you. 3 (Whereupon, a brief recess was taken.) 4 MR. HYMAN: Okay, we're now going to continue 5 with a panel discussion and I'm going to briefly 6 introduce everyone on the panel and then we'll get 7 started. Over on my far right is Chip Kahn who now has 8 his slide up and you can see he's the President of the 9 Federation of American Hospitals, which are for-profit 10 hospitals. He's going to start off with a PowerPoint 11 presentation and then we'll just sort of work across. 12 Even though Chip's sitting next to me here, he's standing 13 there so he gets first introduction. 14 Next is Helen Darling who is the President of 15 the Washington Business Group on Health. Then sitting 16 next to her is Jacquie Darrah who is, I believe, the head 17 of Health Policy at the American Medical -- 18 MS. DARRAH: Health Law. 19 MR. HYMAN: Health Law, excuse me, Director of 20 Health Law at the American Medical Association. Then 21 Mark Botti who is the head of Litigation I at the 22 Department of Justice who you've heard mentioned 23 periodically throughout the first day in his absence. 24 Litigation I is the part of the Department of Justice 2568 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Antitrust Division that, among other things, handles 1 health care. Chip's seat is here, but he's not here, 2 he's over there. 3 Then Stephanie Kanwit who is General Counsel of 4 the American Association of Health Plans. And finally is 5 Arnie Milstein who, although it says on the agenda is 6 with the American Benefits Council, he's actually the 7 Medical Director of the Pacific Business Group on Health. 8 He also wins the prize for what is easily the coolest 9 title of anyone on this panel because in addition to 10 being the Medical Director of the Pacific Business Group 11 on Health, he is also the National Health Care Thought 12 Leader for the Mercer Human Resource Consulting. When I 13 found that out, I, of course, went to Bill and said, I 14 want an upgrade in my title. 15 Each panelist will speak for seven to 10 16 minutes and we're going to strictly keep to the time 17 restrictions so that we can have as much time as possible 18 for discussion among the panelists. Mark's and my job is 19 to keep the ball rolling. Thank you. 20 Chip? 21 MR. KAHN: Thank you, David. I will be as 22 brief as possible. I am Chip Kahn and I'm here this 23 morning representing the Federation of American 24 Hospitals. We represent Americans investor-owned 2569 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025hospitals. We are, by definition, strong advocates of 1 market competition and believe that antitrust law, when 2 applied appropriately, considering all the unique 3 characterizations of health care and hospital markets, 4 can contribute to ensuring access for Americans to high 5 quality, affordable health care. 6 Initially, let me say that one of the reasons 7 we are here, at least from my view, is because we have an 8 ever-increasing growth in health care cost and there's a 9 belief that that threatens the availability of affordable 10 quality health care and health coverage. Unfortunately, 11 many of the players in delivering and financing are 12 pointing fingers of blame at one another seeking 13 exoneration from this point, and from my point of view, 14 this finger-pointing is a waste of time and also avoids 15 all of us facing very tough public policy questions 16 raised by the complexity of health care delivery in this 17 country. There are no easy answers. 18 What I'm going to do this morning is cover 19 three areas. First, I want to set a context for health 20 care and hospital spending growth over the last decade 21 and into the future. Second, I want to point out a few 22 of the distinctive characteristics of hospital markets 23 that result in this unique complexity I'm talking about, 24 which I think is critical to take into account when 2570 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025analysis and enforcement is done in the area of 1 antitrust. And, finally, I want to outline a few 2 recommendations that the Federation has for FTC and DOJ 3 as you review specific hospital markets. 4 First, I'd like to point out, and these numbers 5 look at cumulative growth over a decade. This work was 6 done by Price Waterhouse from public numbers, National 7 Health Expenditure numbers that are generally available. 8 And what this shows is that over the last decade, in 9 terms of cumulative growth, hospital care has been 10 growing at a slower pace than other sectors in the health 11 care system. I use this chart not so much to point out 12 that hospitals are that different or should win any 13 prizes, but to make a point that if you looked at the 14 middle '90s, you would see that hospitals arguably 15 underpriced their products to meet the demands of managed 16 care contracts, and then a little bit later in the '90s, 17 we're confronted with BBA-97 and significant Medicare 18 reductions. 19 And then, in recent days, some will argue there 20 is a blip, an upswing in hospital spending, and I would 21 argue that is a combination of things and partly catch-up 22 for the dip in the '90s for the reasons that I outlined. 23 I think if you look at the number growth cumulatively, it 24 gives you a sense for that factor. 2571 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Second, if we look at this period from '97 to 1 '01, which is the period that we have the latest data, 2 where we have this blip, in a sense, this $83.6 billion 3 growth blip in hospitals -- it's higher growth than 4 hospitals had experienced earlier -- we can attribute 5 that to two things. One, more services, that includes 6 both population growth as well as more intense services 7 being provided, all those services being ordered 8 primarily by physicians when patients were in need, and 9 the other side of the cost spending ledger is hospital 10 costs and the primary driver there, almost a third comes 11 from compensation for wages and benefits. So, work force 12 is the big banana in hospital spending. 13 This chart reflects recent projections by the 14 CMS actuaries and shows that blip I described, the 15 actuaries see as evening out, and at least in terms of 16 the decade from the actuaries standpoint, they see 17 hospital growth, and this is gross spending growth across 18 the country for all hospitals, that hospital care will 19 increase at about 6 percent a year. Now, whether this is 20 the right percentage or the wrong percentage is obviously 21 an issue we can talk about. But at least from the 22 actuaries', at CMS, standpoint, we see hospitals 23 basically at a historic pattern in terms of the increases 24 we're likely to see into the future. 2572 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Now, let me describe some of the distinctions 1 of the hospital market that I think are important for our 2 discussion today. 3 First, hospital care is generally inelastic. 4 You don't find that many two-for-one sales on drug- 5 eluting stents and other kinds of services provided in 6 hospitals. 7 Second, the actual cost of hospital care is 8 borne on and from many ledgers. Even hospitals 9 themselves bear a part of that cost because they are 10 mandated, in some cases, to actually provide services and 11 there is no payer other than sort of coming up with the 12 money inside the revenues from the hospital to pay for 13 those services. 14 The idea of so many different types of payers 15 and costs coming from so many different places makes the 16 hospital an extremely complex institution to run, and I 17 was interested in the last presentation. Not only is it 18 complex, but it is, in a sense -- and probably if you 19 compare it to other places, other hospital systems in the 20 world, it's sort of unique, because in most other places, 21 the doctors do work. You have inpatient -- at least on 22 the inpatient side you have doctors working for the 23 hospital. 24 So, here we have those people who order the 2573 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025services not generally working for the hospital and all 1 these different ways in which costs are raised for 2 hospital services. 3 And, finally -- and Tom Scully noted this 4 yesterday, government is the 800-pound gorilla for 5 hospitals. This is important to point out because it 6 makes hospitals, particularly, and actually health care 7 because generally, Medicare, Medicaid and other public 8 programs are the 800-pound gorilla for all providers. It 9 puts providers in a unique situation because, as Tom said 10 yesterday, he basically is a price setter regardless of 11 the years, and I worked on Capitol Hill in the years of 12 some of the development of fee-for-service payment 13 reform. There was always an attempt to try to be market- 14 oriented. But at the end of the day, you have prices 15 that are arbitrarily set that really don't relate very 16 closely to any kind of market scheme that we could 17 define. 18 Beyond the issue of prices, you also have 19 hospitals being probably the most regulated institutions, 20 at least private institutions, in our society and that 21 regulation varies from a life and safety code regulation 22 to a regulation that mandates that if someone shows up at 23 an emergency room in an unstable condition, they have to 24 be treated regardless of their ability to pay and they 2574 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025are not obligated to pay for those services. In a sense, 1 this kind of mandate affects hospital behavior and it 2 ought to be accounted for when analysis is done for 3 purposes of antitrust, looking at consolidations and 4 other kinds of reorganizations of hospital or hospital 5 systems. 6 Finally, let me go to a few recommendations. 7 First, hospital markets are distinct. You've seen one 8 hospital market, you've seen one hospital market. Now, 9 having said that, in terms of that category of antitrust 10 that relates to sham arrangements, naked price fixing or 11 market allocation agreements. I mean, clearly there's no 12 question that you got to get in there and root out a 13 wrongdoing. I think when we get to other levels of 14 judgment, of whether a consolidation is appropriate or 15 inappropriate in terms of antitrust law, things get much 16 more complicated. 17 Second, and this sort of reinforces the point I 18 just brought up, I think traditional antitrust analysis 19 using statistics may obscure the realities of hospital 20 markets, the realities of this relationship of the 21 different payers, the relationships of the mandates, and 22 so, I think all that has to be taken into account, and 23 the earlier speakers referenced that. 24 Third, all hospitals are not created equal. If 2575 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025there is a consolidation, one hospital may bring, in 1 terms of numbers, something to a consolidation but 2 depending on their relationships with their medical 3 staffs, their relationship in a market, any two hospitals 4 that may have the same numbers may not reflect the same 5 issues if you're forming some kind of merger between 6 those institutions, and that has to be accounted for. 7 Fourth, there are competitive effects of non- 8 general hospital providers that need to be taken into 9 account. Now, Paul Ginsburg referred to these yesterday. 10 I use the word \"non-general hospital\" because here I mean 11 ambulatory surgery centers, ancillary kinds of services, 12 but also physician-owned specialty hospitals also sort of 13 fall into this. 14 The fact is that hospitals -- the general 15 hospital to be able to survive, to remain viable in a 16 market, has to be a full service entity. There is cross- 17 subsidization within that entity and anything that's lost 18 in competition with these other kinds of providers cannot 19 necessarily be made up on the inpatient side in areas 20 where hospitals provide unique services by simply upping 21 prices. So, that's something that's got to be taken into 22 account. 23 Also, I should point out that hospitals live in 24 an environment in some areas where payers not only 2576 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025predominate in a market but basically are the market. 1 States like Alabama, places in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, 2 that warrants scrutiny where private payers have so much 3 weight. 4 And, finally, there's just this notion of 5 government policy having unintended consequences that has 6 to be accounted for. The Stark Law was mentioned 7 earlier. One of the unintended consequences of the Stark 8 Law is this issue of physician-owned specialty hospitals. 9 There is an exemption in Stark Law for -- a whole 10 hospital exemption which had in mind, basically, allowing 11 doctors to own stock in hospital companies. 12 What that has been used for, though, are these 13 niche players who have created whole hospitals, whole 14 orthopedic hospitals, whole cardiology hospitals, and 15 taken services or taken doctors, in a sense, into 16 financial arrangements which have great allure, which 17 can't be replicated by general hospitals because of the 18 Stark Law, and those, in a sense, create a situation for 19 general hospitals which, in a sense, attack viability. 20 Those kinds of issues have to be taken into account when 21 you're doing analysis of consolidation mergers and 22 markets because those are realities for financial 23 viability and economic viability that hospitals have to 24 live with. 2577 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Let me end on that note and just say I hope 1 this was useful and I look forward to the discussion. 2 MR. HYMAN: Thank you. And you can speak 3 either from your seat or go up to the podium, depending 4 on your personal preferences. 5 MS. DARLING: I'll go up just because I'm short 6 and nobody could see me. 7 MR. HYMAN: I'm not sure the podium addresses 8 that problem. 9 (Laughter.) 10 MS. DARLING: Well, at least I get to stand up. 11 Thank you for the opportunity. 12 The Washington Business Group on Health is the 13 national voice of large employers committed to innovative 14 and forward-thinking solutions to health care issues. We 15 have about 175 members, and we represent about 40 million 16 workers, retirees and dependents. Employers would like 17 to see a health care marketplace -- clearly, everybody 18 else would as we've heard all morning -- that competes on 19 the basis of quality, service, innovation and price. All 20 of those are important, especially so in the health 21 industry, which is notoriously slow moving in a number of 22 areas. 23 Unfortunately, the health care market falls far 24 short of that. I hate to tell Bill, but hospitals don't 2578 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025follow you outside your admission and keep track of what 1 happens to you. So, that's bad news, I know. They do 2 get your address usually, if they can, in case there's a 3 billing problem. But they don't follow and look at 4 outcomes data and things like that. But it's a nice 5 concept and we should work on it. 6 One of the major problems, as you know, in the 7 health care industry is that information is imperfect and 8 asymmetric. Transparency is a critical ingredient in 9 everything that we're going to be talking about and that 10 we talked about this morning. Unfortunately, we don't 11 have that in the health industry. Consumers need 12 information. They need it to be accessible, which it is 13 not, and they need it in order to compare quality, 14 innovation, service and cost. And some of the recent 15 studies that you've seen reported and some of the recent 16 incidents are very good examples of that. 17 Most people, at least, who are in the know 18 could get information about volume of procedures 19 utilization, some indication of quality, just how many 20 somebody does if they know what they're looking for in 21 about three states in the union, including New York. But 22 if you want that information any other place, you won't 23 be able to get your hands on it and you'd have to know a 24 lot to know that you can even do that in New York. 2579 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Probably a grand total of maybe 100 people know that, and 1 it's all the same people who know all these other things, 2 too. 3 Consumers do need information in order to 4 compare treatment options. I mean, we sort of talk about 5 cost and all these things, but the fact of the matter is 6 an awful lot of care that's recommended may not even be 7 the care you need or want. So, regardless of even 8 quality of price, even the issue of what should you be 9 getting and when you should get it, is information that 10 you should be able to get from the health care industry 11 and from the institutions that we're talking about today. 12 We would like to ensure that every hospital and 13 every institution in the United States is required, at a 14 minimum, to post the publicly reportable information 15 today, in some instances for more than 30 years, on their 16 own web site, just for a matter of convenience. And 17 we're not even debating about what other information we 18 would like to have, just what they already have to give 19 to health departments, to the Federal Government through 20 Medicare, state and federal, for Medicaid and that kind 21 of thing. Right now, they don't even have to do that, 22 which seems bizarre. 23 Employers and consumers -- and I would note, we 24 had a lot of framing this morning. I would add one very 2580 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025important factor. Hard to see in this town and in 1 academia, but we're in a recession in this economy. We 2 only have three parts of our sectors that are growing. 3 Two of them are bad news and one is mixed. The one is 4 corrections. We have more than a million people in jails 5 in America and those costs go up endlessly. We also have 6 -- most jobs last year that were created were the people 7 who inspect you when you go through airports. We had a 8 big job jump-up in those jobs. 9 And the third is the health care industry, and 10 you saw some of the data on that. The rest of the 11 economy is in serious trouble. So, one of the reasons we 12 are all here, I hope and care about, is we are trying to 13 have a more efficient industry because we can't afford 14 the industry that we have been given by the health care 15 industry. 16 You've heard, I'm sure, about employers and 17 consumers double-digit increases. We've had an increase 18 of 50 percent in the last five years, and for 2003, it's 19 either 14 or 15 percent, depending on whose numbers you 20 agree with, and there's no end in sight. We consider 21 good news when we're saying, like with prescription 22 drugs, it used to be 18 to 23 percent, it's now only 17 23 percent increase, and that was considered good news. 24 So, this is really a bad situation we're in right now. 2581 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025The cost increases have broad implications for 1 the entire economy and what we can do in terms of 2 education and all the other things that are important, so 3 we will have a work force in the future. So, it's 4 incumbent on all of us to try to make the system more 5 efficient and effective for what we're paying for, not 6 just debating about whether it's a reasonable thing for 7 somebody to get X amount of dollars or not. We're 8 talking about the whole pie that's important to worry 9 about. 10 Now, employers still actually bear the majority 11 of health care costs. It's estimated that employees pay 12 about 19 percent of the total cost of health care for an 13 individual coverage and about 24 percent for family 14 coverage. So, employers really do pay the vast majority 15 still of health care. 16 To deal with that, employers are making a lot 17 of changes in what they're doing, and you'll just begin 18 to feel the full effects, because most of those really 19 started in January of 2002 and will have a bigger impact 20 for January 2003. What you'll see is starting in 2004 21 and 2005, you'll see the impact of these changes. In 22 some ways, they will be good and other things won't be so 23 good. But everybody will learn more about the cost of 24 health care whether they want to or not, because, among 2582 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025other things, employers will be changing cost sharing. 1 They're going to put in spousal surcharges, heftier out- 2 of-network charges. Everything is going to go up and 3 employers will do everything they can to make the 4 consumer more price sensitive and we will see some big 5 changes in the demands for information because of that. 6 You've had Chip and others talk about -- and 7 there's some material out there -- about the growth in 8 hospital spending. It's not so bad, folks. Well, it is 9 still pretty bad and you could argue that some people 10 need it and some people want it and the economy may want 11 it as a whole, but again, we cannot afford the total 12 package. 13 Provider consolidation, especially hospital 14 consolidation is aggravating these cost increases. In a 15 number of geographic areas -- I would love to be able to 16 be here for the Boston discussion tomorrow -- we have 17 seen contract showdowns, we have seen demands for higher 18 charges. We've also seen an unwillingness to pursue 19 quality inpatient safety initiatives in some markets 20 because, in effect, they don't have to take the pressure, 21 so they're not doing it. 22 Preliminary findings of a recent analysis by 23 CALPERS (phonetic) found the cost of admission at a Tenet 24 hospital in California, adjusting for case mix, is 32 2583 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025percent more expensive than the statewide average cost 1 for all hospitals. The Joel Hay study, done for Blue 2 Cross-Blue Shield Association, attributed 18 percent of 3 rising inpatient costs to hospital market restructuring 4 and concluded that every 4 percent increase in hospital 5 market share due to consolidation leads to a 2 percent 6 increase in inpatient expenditures. I'm sure the health 7 economists of the country can enjoy some more employment 8 for a couple more years debating the merits of these 9 studies and the people who are responding to them. 10 But, frankly, worse yet, the impact is that as 11 a practical matter, purchasers and others who are trying 12 to buy into these markets are finding that they have far 13 less leverage than they had in the past and, again, keep 14 the focus on the total cost. It is astonishing what's 15 happening and it's estimated that costs will double again 16 by 2011. So, we're talking about over a $3 trillion 17 economy. Somewhere, we have to find more efficiency and 18 effectiveness. 19 We've also seen systems that came together, 20 but, in fact, made no changes in anything that would have 21 improved efficiency, whether they came together just to 22 negotiate or they came together because they were in a 23 fantasy world or what, the reality is that, in fact, it's 24 not having an effect in terms of benefits for the 2584 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025consumers, quality or efficiency. 1 Employers support fair market rules that 2 promote access to affordable medicine as well as promote 3 the development of tomorrow's innovative therapies, but 4 we also are concerned about what's happening in the 5 prescription drug arena. I know that's not the subject 6 of this particular presentation or anything that's going 7 on, but we do think that that's a serious problem and we 8 hope the FTC will continue to keep a very strong eye on 9 them. 10 Employers are very concerned about efforts to 11 ease or waive health care antitrust regulations in 12 general and for any specific segment of the health care 13 industry. We believe that this will reduce access and 14 competition and lead to higher costs and, again, make it 15 impossible for purchasers to insist on quality inpatient 16 safety improvements. 17 In an increasingly consumer-driven world, which 18 is where we are, there must be a clear benefit to the 19 consumer. We strongly applaud recent efforts by the FTC 20 to step up antitrust enforcement efforts in health care 21 and your increased staffing in this area. And, 22 obviously, we applaud these hearings and any publicity 23 you can give to these problems. 24 In addition, employers believe that post-merger 2585 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025follow-up and continuing oversight -- we were really glad 1 to hear what was said this morning about that -- are 2 essential to determine whether hospital mergers have 3 actually benefitted consumers and improved quality and 4 efficiency or simply allowed to charge more and resist 5 efforts to improve quality and patient safety. 6 We also were very pleased to hear the comment 7 about judicial education. As a group of employers and 8 purchasers looked at some of the recent decisions and 9 been appalled by the reasoning, not being attorneys, just 10 good old plain common sense, like is having one business 11 person on a board actually going to represent the 12 consumer. I mean, this was even before all the scandals 13 about board rooms. So, the idea that that could make a 14 difference really has never made sense. 15 So, we welcome anything that can be done to 16 make those kinds of changes. Thank you. 17 MS. DARRAH: My test for the podium is always 18 to just see if I can see over it. So, this is good. I'm 19 short, also. 20 Good morning. As David mentioned, my name is 21 Jacquie Darrah. I'm the Director of Health Law at the 22 American Medical Association and it's a pleasure to be 23 here today on behalf of the AMA and to address the 24 Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. 2586 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025The issues raised today by the Commission and 1 the Department, although quite broad, have very specific 2 implications for this nation's patients. The AMA has 3 recently expressed to your agencies a heightened concern 4 that the dramatic consolidation in the market for health 5 insurance has led to decreased competition among health 6 insurers and increased problems for patients and 7 physicians. Therefore, we commend the Commission and the 8 Department for holding these hearings. 9 To put it bluntly, we believe that federal 10 antitrust agencies have placed physicians under far 11 greater scrutiny than is warranted by our comparative 12 economic strength in today's health care system. By 13 contrast, we are aware of only one federal enforcement 14 action against a health insurer. The absence of 15 enforcement activity on the payer side is puzzling 16 because there are plenty of reasons to be concerned about 17 the level of competition in payer markets. 18 In the late 1990s, managed care organizations 19 consolidated at record pace. Today, we are seeing double 20 digit increases in premiums and in health plan profits. 21 At the same time, consumers have expressed deep 22 dissatisfaction with managed care and physicians have 23 found themselves vastly overpowered in their dealings 24 with payers. In any other industry, a merger wave 2587 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025followed by an abrupt rise in prices would cry out for an 1 investigation. Why should health insurance be any 2 different? 3 I will now address market imperfections in 4 health care. There are several characteristics of the 5 health care market which we believe are imperfections or 6 distortions that create unique problems for physicians 7 and patients. One is the system of third party insurance 8 in the U.S. and the Medicare system of payment for 9 physician services. Our written statement goes into more 10 detail about these market imperfections. 11 Today, we'd like to focus on the market problem 12 that concerns us the most, the dramatic consolidation of 13 health insurers in the United States. This consolidation 14 not only exacerbates the problem created by other market 15 imperfections, but it also raises serious questions about 16 the level of competition in the health insurance 17 marketplace. 18 We now turn to the issue of consolidation in 19 payer markets. Today, the 10 largest health plans cover 20 over half of all commercially insured Americans. The 21 effects of this consolidation are mostly clearly seen in 22 local and regional markets. In 2001, the AMA conducted 23 the most comprehensive study ever done on competition in 24 health insurance. Last December, the AMA published its 2588 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025second study based on updated information. 1 What we found confirmed the results of our 2 previous study and show the problem is even more 3 widespread. Using the agency's merger guidelines, we 4 looked at 70 large metropolitan statistical areas or 5 MSAs. In those MSAs, we found the following: 100 6 percent of PPO product markets were highly concentrated; 7 90 percent of HMO markets are highly concentrated; 87 8 percent of combined HMO, PPO product markets were highly 9 concentrated. In almost all of these highly concentrated 10 markets, there was at least one insurer with a market 11 share in excess of 30 percent, and in nearly half of 12 these markets, a single insurer had a market share in 13 excess of 50 percent. 14 The study confirms what patients, physicians 15 and employers around the country already knew. In many 16 parts of the country, not just Pennsylvania, as we 17 highlighted yesterday, health insurance markets are 18 dominated by a few companies that have significant power. 19 We also looked beyond market concentration at other 20 characteristics of the markets for health insurance. 21 Entry into a market requires investing millions of 22 dollars to comply with state regulations governing 23 insurance companies. New health plans in the market must 24 also invest time, labor and money to establish 2589 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025relationships with physicians and health providers in the 1 market. 2 These costs and regulatory hurdles facing a new 3 entrant make it possible for existing dominant firms to 4 increase premiums without the concern that it will lose 5 its market share. Even worse, large health plans often 6 use contractual devices such as most favored nations 7 clauses or all products clauses to lock in physicians and 8 keep out new rivals. The large companies are clearly in 9 the driver's seat. 10 Now, let's shift gears and talk about what's 11 happening with health insurance premiums. In recent 12 years, after the dramatic consolidation of health 13 insurers, health plan premiums and profits have 14 skyrocketed. From 2001 to 2002, premiums increased by 15 12.7 percent. This is the sixth consecutive year of 16 accelerating premium increases. Overall, health 17 insurance premiums increased 42 percent from 1998 to 18 2002. This is more than double the overall increase in 19 medical inflation and more than triple the increase in 20 overall inflation during the same four-year time period, 21 and premiums are expected to rise again by 15 percent 22 this year. 23 It's important to note that medical costs have 24 not been the primary driver of these increases. To the 2590 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025extent these increases may be driven by the rising cost 1 of health products or services, the data continue to 2 show, and we've seen some of these data today, that 3 physician costs have not been one of the major drivers. 4 Data also indicate that premiums have been 5 rising at a faster rate than administrative costs and 6 claims expenses. Recent reports on payer profits refute 7 any notion that claims expenses are driving premium 8 increases. Profit margins of the major national payers 9 have been steadily rising despite a slowdown in the 10 general economy. 11 In 2001, health insurers reported a 25 percent 12 increase in profits. In 2002, third quarter earnings 13 were up 47 percent on average for 11 major insurers and 14 good fourth quarter results are also expected. 15 Let us now turn to the effects of reduced 16 competition in the health insurance sector. When health 17 premiums rise due to a lack of competition, some 18 employers cease providing coverage or reduce the scope of 19 benefits provided. The number of uninsured individuals 20 remains at a crisis level. Lack of coverage for 21 individuals places enormous pressures on other segments 22 of the health system. It leads to increased expenditures 23 for emergency treatment and increased pressure on 24 government programs and the public health system. 2591 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Clearly, continued double digit premium 1 increases don't help the situation for the uninsured or 2 for those at risk of becoming uninsured. As the Justice 3 Department recognized in the Aetna matter, a lack of 4 competition among health insurers may also lead to anti- 5 competitive effects on the health provider markets. A 6 dominant insurer exercising monopsony power can drive 7 physician payment rates well below the level needed to 8 provide medically necessary care. 9 Over time, these fee reductions can lead to a 10 decrease in time physicians spend with patients. 11 Physician departures from the market reduce access to 12 care for patients, and in some cases, medical groups are 13 even forced into bankruptcy. This is exactly what we are 14 seeing in some areas of the country. And from the 15 consumer's perspective, the result has been chaos; higher 16 out-of-pocket costs, longer waiting times, and reduced 17 access to physicians. 18 In conclusion, the agencies should care about 19 competition in the health insurance sector. There's no 20 justification for a one-sided enforcement policy that 21 puts the sole burden of compliance on physicians. We 22 respectfully ask that the agencies reconsider their 23 approach and take a serious look at competition on the 24 payer side. The AMA hopes to continue a dialogue with 2592 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the Commission and the Department regarding these 1 important issues, and thank you for the opportunity to 2 participate in these proceedings. 3 MR. HYMAN: Thank you. Next, Stephanie. 4 MS. KANWIT: Thank you. Everyone's doing it 5 from the podium, so I may as well, too, right? Keep us 6 all awake this morning. 7 Thanks very much for inviting me to participate 8 today. We really, really appreciate it and it's a nice 9 turnout here. 10 I'm Stephanie Kanwit. I'm General Counsel and 11 Senior Vice President of the American Association of 12 Health Plans and, as many of you know, we represent about 13 170 million Americans, our health plans, our 1,000-member 14 health plans who have health care coverage through our 15 members. What's not so widely known is that that 16 coverage doesn't just deal with commercial coverage, you 17 know, the Aetnas, CIGNAs, Humanas and Pacific Care, but 18 also the \"public\" coverage, the S-CHIPS, the Medicare, 19 the Medicaid. Our plans administer many of those very, 20 very important public programs where about half of our 21 health care dollar goes. So, that's very, very critical. 22 I want to stress today briefly, aside from my 23 written testimony, which is out there on the table, what 24 I did in the hearing before the FTC and DOJ last 2593 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025September, which was very worthwhile, the concept of 1 competition and collaboration as the key ingredients in 2 the health care system, that all of us at this table, all 3 these representatives you're hearing from today and 4 yesterday and tomorrow need to work together to get costs 5 down, as Helen Darling so rightly said, and improve 6 quality here. 7 I also look forward to the debate after we give 8 our very short statements here because we have lots of 9 things to say to some of the panel members. Jacquie 10 Darrah's presentation was wonderful, but those of us in 11 the health plan community would say, in a nutshell, hey, 12 wait a minute here, we've got a highly competitive market 13 out there with really, really savvy employers, as Helen 14 knows, and with employees, two-thirds of whom have an 15 enormous number of choices among health plans. So, in 16 terms of concentration, we can discuss some of those 17 issues. 18 I wanted to make two particular points here 19 that are near and dear to my heart as a reformed 20 antitrust litigator. One is this whole issue of consumer 21 empowerment and the need for transparency, the same word 22 Helen used. Very, very critical. Many of you have read 23 the recent IOM, Institute of Medicine, report called, To 24 Err is Human. If you haven't, I commend it to you. It's 2594 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025an excellent report. And it called all of us to be 1 \"accountable to the public\" -- I thought that was a great 2 phrase -- and work to build trust through disclosure, 3 even of the system's own problems. It's just critical. 4 This came home to me this week, of course, with 5 the horrible tragedy of Jesica Santillan at Duke and 6 what's happening right now in Congress with the medical 7 malpractice reform bill, HR-5 that's up there, what's 8 going to be happening. It is an issue we all need to 9 deal with. 10 What I'm very proud of is that our health plans 11 at AAHP have empowered consumers with information to make 12 informed decisions about their health care coverage. For 13 example, provisions of key information to consumers, 14 often by electronic means, and I can't tell you how 15 revolutionary that's been. We can get into details on 16 that. Turn on your computer and find out almost anything 17 you need to know. This flexibility is truly made 18 possible by technology. 19 I was interested to find out last week that 84 20 percent of our health plans have web sites that allow 21 members to choose or to change their PCPs, their primary 22 care physicians online, just terrific. Many of them 23 allow you to fill prescriptions online. The same 24 technology is going to be useful for what we've all been 2595 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025talking about this morning and we're all working toward, 1 which is quality improvements. How do we get information 2 online and in paper, but online is the key right now, to 3 improve communication between medical clinicians and to 4 patients? How do you collect and share medical 5 information? 6 For example, how do our health plans, and we're 7 working hard at this, get information to physicians on 8 up-to-date treatment, cholesterol treatment, beta 9 blockers. How do we get that information out there? 10 You heard Professor Hammer this morning talk a 11 little bit about the need for joint R&D, perhaps, and 12 practice guidelines. We're working on that, too. We're 13 very, very concerned about our ability to get what's 14 called evidence-based medicine out there. Is it safe, is 15 it effective? How do we get the standards up and make 16 sure people are getting the best possible medical care 17 when they need it? 18 So, we all agree that dissemination of 19 accurate, truthful up-to-date information is a goal. The 20 question is how to do that. In a nutshell, I'm kind of 21 mystified, again, as a former antitrust lawyer, at the 22 rush of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade 23 Commission -- I hope we have a debate about this -- to 24 give their imprimatur to information sharing by 2596 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025horizontal competitors, namely physicians, and it's 1 information about pricing, highly sensitive, and these 2 are groups of doctors that want to disseminate 3 information on what they're paid by health plans, all 4 ostensibly on the public good. 5 And I would ask us to discuss three major 6 points on that. Number one, is there, in fact, a 7 disconnect between what these physician groups claim they 8 are doing when they're collecting this information on 9 what they're paid? In other words, they're claiming 10 they're empowering consumers with information, and what 11 they're actually doing in a real world where consumers, 12 as you just heard from Helen Darling, aren't contracting 13 for their health care benefits and aren't paying the bulk 14 of the benefits. Consumers, on average, are paying less 15 than a fifth of their health care benefits and 99 percent 16 of them don't contract for health care benefits. 17 Secondly, questions in real time, does this fee 18 information, what health plans pay providers for specific 19 procedures, you know, a hysterectomy, whatever, 20 appendectomy, does that really make doctors deliver 21 better quality health care? That's really the bottom 22 line. How does it impact consumers? And even more 23 important, is that information useful to consumers? 24 I just have to share with you one of our -- I 2597 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025found out this week, one of our biggest health plans did 1 a survey and said to consumers, what do you want to know? 2 What do you want to know? Because it's going online in a 3 big way, it's costing the plan hundreds of millions of 4 dollars to put everybody's medical records online. What 5 did they want to know? They wanted to know how to refill 6 their prescriptions. They want to be able to e-mail 7 their doctors with questions. They want health 8 information on their own particular chronic conditions, 9 asthma, diabetes. My child has cystic fibrosis, what do 10 I do? 11 Did they want to know how much their doctors 12 were reimbursed for flu shots? No. And I just cite that 13 because the FTC just last week came down with an advisory 14 opinion on a Dayton group of doctors, and we can discuss 15 it in great detail, where the doctors said, we need to 16 tell everybody how much health plans are reimbursing us 17 for flu shots. And I say, who cares? 18 So, the bottom line is that there's, in 19 principle, free flow of information. I'm all for it, but 20 we have to tread carefully, everybody, in this area, lest 21 that dissemination of information facilitate collusion or 22 stabilized physician rates. 23 My second point, and, again, this is covered in 24 great detail in the paper, we are still seeing -- and 2598 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Helen went into this a little bit -- the impact of rising 1 health care costs. We all know this. We're all paying 2 more. Everybody's paying more and they're going up 3 exponentially. One of the issues we are tracking 4 carefully because we have to, our health plans are 5 bombarding us with information on this, with complaints 6 on this. Hospital consolidation is causing a rise in 7 health care costs and affecting their practices and the 8 health plans' ability to contract cost effective care out 9 there in the market. 10 And many of you know that GAO just came out 11 with a report citing provider consolidation as a leading 12 factor contributing to the 11.1 percent growth in 13 premiums in the FEHBP Plan, the Federal Employees Health 14 Benefit Plan. Last year, the average was 5.5 percent. 15 Now, it's 11 percent. Unbelievable. 16 What are we seeing out there? Two things. 17 Many others, but these are the two that are the key. Our 18 health plans are complaining to us bitterly about two 19 things. One is hospitals' refusal to contract at 20 negotiated rates. They're saying that the hospitals are 21 saying, we won't contract with you, managed care. We're 22 just not going to contract with you. We want full billed 23 charges which, as many of you know, can be many times 24 what the contracted rate would be. 2599 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Second is a practice called all or nothing 1 contracting, which many of you may have heard about, 2 where the hospital systems are requiring our health plans 3 to contract with freestanding facilities, radiology 4 facilities, ambulatory surgery facilities. You have to 5 contract with them if you want our hospitals. 6 We're also seeing many issues out there where 7 must have hospitals -- must have hospitals, you can't 8 have a network in such and such an area unless you have 9 the major teaching hospital, the major hospital in that 10 particular area. So, there's tremendous pressure on cost 11 out there. 12 Last -- and this is detailed in my paper -- 13 last, but not least, I really enjoyed Chip Kahn's 14 presentation. He did a nice summary of the context for 15 hospital costs which are soaring and a nice defense of 16 the private hospital market out there. I just want to 17 point out one thing. We took a look at that line chart 18 that he showed you up here on the screen about how our 19 administrative costs were soaring and said, wait a minute 20 here, wait a minute here, this doesn't look right, and we 21 had somebody just take a look at that. That particular 22 line that Price Waterhouse Cooper did on their study 23 amalgamates, public administrative cost and private cost, 24 or private cost as a change, are much, much lower there. 25100 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Also, when you talk about admin costs, and you 1 hear a lot of people out there saying, oh, these private 2 health plans, they're paying, you know, a lot of money in 3 overhead and admin costs. I just want to caution 4 everybody to make sure we're all talking in the same 5 terminology. Our private admin costs include things that 6 are state and federally mandated, like reserves and like 7 premium taxes. 8 So, just to clarify this, I've got some papers 9 out there and I look forward to the discussion. Thanks, 10 everybody. 11 MR. HYMAN: Arnie? 12 DR. MILSTEIN: Thanks. To allow plenty of time 13 for discussion, I'll abbreviate my comments, but they're 14 available in writing on the table. 15 Large employers and consumer organizations 16 agree with the Institute of Medicine's reports over the 17 last four years that there's a very wide gap between the 18 health care that Americans are getting and what health 19 care could and should be. I think it's what Peter was, 20 among other things, referring to as the optimality gap. 21 We think it's very big. We think based on research being 22 published by folks at Dartmouth and expert opinion pulled 23 together by the Doran Institute (phonetic) last year. We 24 think that that optimality gap with respect to American 25101 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025spending on health care could be as large as 40 percent 1 of the dollars that we're spending. 2 Most large employers also agree with the 3 Institute of Medicine that closing what the IOM referred 4 to as the chasm between health care delivery as it is and 5 what it could be in America requires that purchasers and 6 insurers correct some serious flaws in the market for 7 doctor and hospital services by taking two actions that 8 do not require any FTC intervention. 9 Number one, routinizing performance measurement 10 and reporting of doctor and hospital performance. 11 Secondly, rewarding doctor and hospital excellence via 12 either performance-based payment or insurance plan 13 designs which encourage consumer selection of better- 14 performing doctors and hospitals. 15 To accelerate this, large American employers 16 have launched two linked pro-competitive initiatives. 17 One is called the Consumer and Purchaser Disclosure 18 Project, which I'll refer to as the Disclosure Project, 19 and the Leapfrog Group. The Disclosure Project is an 20 informal partnership of large employers, large employer 21 groups, such as Pacific Business Group on Health and the 22 American Benefits Council, and consumer advocacy 23 organizations, such as AARP, the AFL-CIO and the National 24 Partnership for Women and Families. 25102 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025The Disclosure Project's goal is that by 1 January 1 of 2007 all Americans will be able to select 2 hospitals, physicians, integrated delivery systems and 3 treatment options based on public reporting of nationally 4 standardized performance measures for clinical quality, 5 for patient experience, for equity and for efficiency. 6 The Disclosure Project is currently using the 7 National Quality Forum's multi-stakeholder process to 8 come up with that common scoreboard. Its members are 9 also committed to pursuing other options if that progress 10 isn't swift enough. 11 The Leapfrog Group, which is the twin pro- 12 competitive measure, is a private non-profit organization 13 of more than 130 of America's largest employers, as well 14 as unions, which provide over 56 billion in health 15 benefits annually. The members of the Leapfrog Group 16 commit to encouraging their employees to select, and/or 17 their insurers to reward, better performing hospitals, 18 doctors and treatment options. 19 The Leapfrog Group initially focused on 20 identifying and rewarding hospitals that excelled in 21 three important safety features. The Leapfrog Group is 22 now expanding its focus beyond patient safety and 23 aligning its market rewards with doctor and hospital 24 excellence across all the performance domains adopted by 25103 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the disclosure project. 1 Our vision of intensified market competition 2 faces multiple challenges. Among these challenges are 3 doctors or hospitals commonly, but not exclusively, in 4 the form of aggregated doctor and hospital organizations 5 which may, and sometimes do, use relative market 6 dominance in their service areas to impede competition 7 based on disclosure and reward of their comparative 8 performance. 9 Many employers are quite supportive of doctor 10 or hospital aggregation when it is used to create 11 sufficient scale to mobilize the capital or management 12 talent necessary to attain performance excellence. 13 However, we strongly encourage the FTC to consider how 14 its efforts might assure adherence by both aggregated and 15 individual market dominant providers to, what we will 16 just call, pro-competitive rules of the road. 17 The following are eight such rules based on my 18 personal trench level work with employers and insurers 19 across all U.S. regions over the last 24 months. 20 Number one, assure performance-based tiering of 21 providers. Aggregated provider organizations should not 22 restrain insurers from classifying individual providers 23 into performance tiers on which insurers can vary 24 consumer out-of-pocket costs or inclusion in insurance 25104 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025plan offerings. This is because performance may vary 1 widely among individual providers within aggregated 2 provider organizations. Obscuring these important 3 performance differences within multi-provider performance 4 averages and so-called all or none provider contracting 5 demands that Stephanie referred to prevent market 6 recognition and reward of individual provider excellence. 7 Secondly, assure service line based tiering. 8 Market dominant providers, whether individual or 9 aggregated, should not restrain insurers from varying 10 consumer out-of-pocket cost or the content of insurance 11 plan offerings based on an individual provider's 12 performance within specific service lines. Scientific 13 evidence is clear that many hospitals and physicians that 14 excel in one service line, such as cardiac surgery, may 15 perform poorly on obstetrics or other service lines. 16 Performance cannot be optimized if market dominant 17 providers insist on all or none insurer contracts that 18 require that their poorly performing service lines 19 receive the same level of market preference as do the 20 service lines in which they excel. 21 Three, assure uniform provider ID numbers on 22 every provider bill for insurers, consumers and 23 purchasers, to enable detection of individual provider 24 excellence. Aggregated provider organizations should 25105 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025routinely provide, on every bill, the Medicare unique 1 provider ID number or UPIN of the individual physician or 2 hospital providing the service. Without such 3 information, insurers, purchasers and consumer groups 4 cannot assess individual provider performance for 5 services in which individual performance matters, such as 6 surgery. 7 Four, assure dis-aggregated price negotiations. 8 Aggregated provider organizations should not restrain 9 individual provider members from voluntarily, 10 independently negotiating their prices with insurers, nor 11 should they restrain individual providers from 12 independently responding to performance recording 13 requests from insurers when data needed for performance 14 measurement extends beyond billing data. 15 Five, assure consumer access to dis-aggregated 16 performance scores. When an aggregated provider 17 organization exercises de facto control over an insurer 18 by providing a majority of the insurer's services, the 19 provider organization should disclose to the public the 20 same individual provider performance measures as do other 21 providers who do not control an insurer. This will allow 22 consumers who use provided controlled insurers to 23 recognize and preferentially select higher performing 24 individual providers in all health insurance plans. 25106 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Six, assure reasonableness of comparative 1 prices where providers, whether individual or aggregated, 2 dominate a service area, their unit prices as well as 3 their efficiency with respect to the total health benefit 4 costs incurred under their care should be held to a 5 reasonableness test based on comparisons with other 6 providers who do not dominate their markets. 7 Seven, assure customer definition of and access 8 to performance ratings. Market dominant providers, both 9 individual and aggregated, should not restrain insurers' 10 freedom to define and disseminate provider performance 11 measures. It should be up to a customer of a service or 12 the customer's intermediaries to judge the value of a 13 service not the producer. 14 Eight, assure consistency of performance 15 measures. To minimize consumer confusion, insurers in 16 the same market should not be restrained from 17 collaborating and adopting common performance measures 18 for doctors, hospitals and treatment options, including 19 measures intended for performance-based compensation or 20 providers. We understand and accept that insurers should 21 be prohibited from collaborating with each other when 22 negotiating compensation agreements with providers. 23 Let me close by saying that America's large 24 employers do not seek to unwind all of the many hospital 25107 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025mergers and physician aggregations permitted over the 1 last 20 years. However, market dominant providers should 2 not restrain the performance comparisons and the 3 performance contingencies needed to enable the market's 4 invisible hand. It's time to, we think, to emancipate 5 all health care stakeholders from the American irony of 6 offering world class biomedicine via a pre-industrial 7 health care delivery system. Relying on regulation and 8 professionalism to ensure excellence has proved 9 insufficient. Employers, consumer organizations and 10 insurers are ready to foster a more discerning market. 11 Consumer research published in 2001 by the 12 Voluntary Hospital Association indicates that over 85 13 percent of Americans are prepared to select their 14 physicians and hospitals based on credible performance 15 comparisons. We think competition can heal our health 16 care delivery system if we assure that such competition 17 is robust. Thank you. 18 MR. BOTTI: Well, I think the way we'd like to 19 start this is maybe give you a chance to comment on each 20 other's remarks. Since our framing presenters have 21 listened patiently for a little bit, maybe we can give 22 each of them a chance to start us off. 23 Jim, what would you like to comment on? 24 DR. BLUMSTEIN: Let me make a few very brief 25108 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025comments. First, on Peter's -- we don't want to do this 1 all with the academics talking to each other, but on 2 Peter's comment, I think there's a lot of consensus, a 3 little dis-sensus. Where I get nervous is on his last 4 point about balancing non-economic factors and market 5 displacing mechanisms as part of the antitrust analysis. 6 That makes me very cautious. I think if we're going to 7 substitute either non-economic values or market 8 displacing mechanisms, we should go through a legislative 9 process and make the case. I think antitrust enforcement 10 has maintained strength in the political arena. 11 The other thing I want to mention is a number 12 of you have talked about these all or nothing provisions 13 and so forth, and that's an example. That's one of the 14 things I had in mind in discussing bundling. That's an 15 example of bundling. I think that the antitrust law has 16 not been sufficiently attentive to the negative effects 17 of that kind of bundling. In fact, if it's required, one 18 could even call it tying, which would be a harder form of 19 bundling. 20 I think that where there are production 21 efficiencies and where integration brings about 22 efficiencies, we don't want to be blind to the benefits 23 that come from that, also. I think we have to look at 24 the positives. But I don't think we should ignore the 25109 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025negatives that can be associated with that. And the 1 negatives can be a lack of access to higher quality 2 facilities or lack of innovation and technological 3 advancement. And so, I do think that is a real risk 4 where there is some market power, like a must-have 5 hospital and so forth. 6 So, I would like to basically put those two 7 points together. That's one of the things I had in mind 8 when I was discussing bundling. 9 MR. BOTTI: Peter? 10 DR. HAMMER: Just a few brief comments. I 11 think it's important that we don't turn the clock back. 12 I think we've made a tremendous amount of progress in the 13 last 20 years on antitrust enforcement and creating 14 markets where they would not have otherwise existed, and 15 I think the agencies have to be very strong about 16 policing the traditional rules of antitrust price fixing 17 and naked restraints. That will always be an important 18 goal. 19 That should be applied to every actor in the 20 industry. I'm not going to comment on the merits of 21 whether or not the empirics show problems now with 22 provider concentration, but conceptually, the payers are 23 subject to the antitrust rules as strongly as anybody 24 else. And antitrust policy and competition policy should 25110 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025be aggressively pursuing all actors in the industry, 1 without favoritism, with an even playing field. 2 Now, obviously, the issues of payer 3 concentration are different in nature and require a 4 different type of legal and economic analysis and that 5 may well legitimately lead to less enforcement activity 6 against one sector than others. They're just different 7 beasts and one shouldn't necessarily expect the same 8 amount of antitrust enforcement against every actor 9 within an industry. 10 The thing I find most exciting about the 11 presentations here are the innovative efforts to get more 12 information and to have more active purchasers, both 13 employers and consumers. If you really want to know sort 14 of the low-hanging fruit on the tree, that's the first 15 things to be grabbing, more information, more educated 16 choice, compensation levels that are based upon the 17 factors that the market wants to reward, regardless of 18 whatever anybody does as a regulator or antitrust 19 enforcer, active participation by employers and consumers 20 could easily discipline this market and do far more good 21 far more quickly and far more successfully than any 22 amount of government intervention. 23 MR. HYMAN: Why don't we have individual 24 panelists speak, sort of in the order they originally 25111 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025spoke, if they wish to comment on subsequent 1 presentations, and then we had a couple of questions to 2 the extent that doesn't precipitate enough of a battle. 3 MR. KAHN: Well, let me just say, first, I 4 think on a market-by-market basis, you can point to 5 consolidations in certain markets being extremely 6 significant. In terms of broad national policy, we're 7 looking at less than 10 percent of the hospitals since 8 '99 and maybe a blip above that if you bring in earlier 9 years, even be included in consolidations. 10 So, I'm not saying if we look at Washington, 11 D.C. or some other city that we might not find 12 consolidations being a significant factor, but in terms 13 of sort of pointing fingers at consolidations as this 14 incredible cost driver, I don't think it's there because 15 it isn't as prevalent across the country as we make it 16 seem here. 17 Two, I think hospitals are caught in a bind. 18 For years, there was all this hand-wringing over too many 19 beds. We've got too many beds, we've got too many beds. 20 So, hospitals reduced their sizes in response to 21 constraints for managed care, in response to Medicare 22 cutbacks, and now that there are less beds and, in a 23 sense, more market power in negotiating with payers, and 24 all of a sudden, there's a problem. Well, you can't have 25112 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025it both ways. 1 And, finally, in terms of information, I think 2 that you'll find hospitals very open to providing more 3 information. The American Hospital Association, the 4 Federation, the JCAHO and CMS are in the process now of 5 developing a means of making more information -- or 6 information public on measurable results from hospital 7 services. 8 But I think there's also an issue here, too, of 9 there is no free lunch, and a lot of the payers' 10 attitudes about information is -- and particularly the 11 government's -- is that there is some sort of free lunch. 12 The fact is, to collect the kind of information you want 13 in the way you want it, which we can probably do, 14 somebody's got to pay the tab and nobody's stepping up to 15 the plate to do that, except in thinking about more 16 mandates on hospitals. So, I'd just leave it at those 17 thoughts. 18 MS. DARLING: Boy, I just wish I didn't have to 19 follow Chip because I had a lot of things to say and now 20 I want to react to everything he just said. But one of 21 them is that there is a free lunch in the data 22 recommendation we have, which is right now, every 23 hospital in America and surgi-centers and a set number of 24 organizations already report a lot of information to the 25113 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025state health department to the federal government. It's 1 sitting there. It used to be reported to PSROs, now 2 QIOs. I mean, these data are sitting there. 3 Would you agree that this would be something 4 that your hospitals and all hospitals would simply say, 5 we will put on our web site all of that information that 6 we already have to provide, publicly available, there's 7 no cost to that. I mean, they all have web sites for 8 marketing purposes. They could sure just add a little 9 real data. 10 Second, they have to do it anyway and all the 11 battles about whether it's the right information or not 12 have been fought. Now, you can argue about some of the 13 newer stuff and it may take longer to get that, but we 14 could do that right away and you would see, for example, 15 that say in a state there may be 200 hospitals that do 16 somewhere between two and five procedures of a particular 17 type and two or three that do in the hundreds and you 18 could at least check those kinds of things out very 19 easily. 20 I just want to go to a couple other points. 21 The FTC does have the ability, as I understand it -- this 22 is an area, the whole area of consumer information and 23 even information for other providers, in this case, for 24 performance in a quality way and for patient safety, to 25114 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025have that information available is something the FTC 1 could, in its role, insist on and work with the other 2 bodies and there's another IOM report that talks about 3 getting these federal agencies together. Among them, 4 they have a ton of data, too, which they could also make 5 available. So, this is an area you don't need to have 20 6 years of studies to make progress in. 7 Second, your attention and pressure in this 8 area is helping in the sense that it gets everybody out 9 there saying, why aren't we doing some of these things. 10 Let's agree that we shouldn't be pointing fingers. What 11 we should be saying is, what do we know like the 48,000 12 to 98,000 deaths, so maybe it's only 10,000, but 10,000 13 is still a lot that we all would agree, without any 14 further dispute, must be done to protect the consumers of 15 America and to improve quality, patient safety. Could we 16 do that and could the FTC help them make that more 17 likely? 18 Some of you -- I don't know if you're old 19 enough to remember or you read it in the history books, 20 but the whole movement about cigarettes and tobacco in 21 this country did not start at HEW. You know where it 22 started? Actually, it was the FTC. If you don't know 23 that, please do a search on it because it's one of the 24 most important stories -- they did more for American 25115 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025health care and life and death than some other agencies 1 probably ever did, and it might be nice if the FTC 2 thought about getting back to that more, nudge people 3 forward, use what authority you have in order to open up 4 the system for better consumer information. Consumers 5 will react. 6 I mean, this recent story about the transplant. 7 There's so many issues related to that, as you all know, 8 I mean, ethical, everything. And, by the way, it's 9 probably going to totally screw up tort reform. But the 10 fact of the matter is, that's made everybody interested 11 in safety, and perhaps for the wrong reasons in some 12 instances. But it's gotten people's attention and people 13 will be asking questions now that they never would have 14 asked before. 15 The FTC has the ability to drive that process 16 quite differently and I'm impressed that they're trying 17 to do that and we would urge you to do more. 18 MS. DARRAH: First, I'll respond to the issue 19 about the Washington letter from the FTC and I think 20 Stephanie said it right. Who cares? I mean, the FTC has 21 not been shy about going after doctors that are agreeing 22 to collude, that are entering into illegal agreements. 23 But this is information sharing and it's a totally 24 different -- information sharing is good. We have safe 25116 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025harbors, we have court cases. Information sharing is 1 good. And so, who cares because this is -- what we 2 really are talking about is information for consumers, 3 performance standards, things like that and the AMA has 4 always been for quality, for patient safety. 5 We have several initiatives that we can rattle 6 on and on that we participate in, but I think that the 7 point is is that when monopsony power and health plan 8 monopsony power starts to decrease access to care. If 9 access can be, in fact, a proxy for quality, then that's 10 what we should be caring about. We're not suggesting 11 that the FTC -- I think the comments from the person from 12 Michigan Law School -- I'm sorry, I can't remember your 13 name. But it's -- Mr. Hammer, thank you. 14 It's not that we're saying be super heavy- 15 handed. What we're saying is, where you ended up, which 16 is let's level the playing field when it comes to 17 enforcement. Let's take our thumb off the scale and 18 let's look at those data and let's look at the impact of 19 those data and those impact on access and quality. Then 20 just again to reiterate, especially again in light of 21 what Helen said about the patient at Duke is that, you 22 know, we have been in the area of standards and quality 23 before everybody else was thinking about it. We helped 24 create the National Patient Safety Foundation. We've 25117 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025been on record as saying one preventable error is one 1 error too many. So, we would also embrace discussions 2 about quality and those types of initiatives. 3 MS. KANWIT: Thanks. I've addressed a little 4 bit of Jackie's comments and a little bit of Chip's. I 5 want to make two quick points to Arnie's comments which I 6 hadn't heard before. I don't think anybody realizes how 7 much information is already out there and the yeoman 8 work, what the Leapfrog Group has done and the other 9 groups have done in terms of quality. 10 If any of you are interested in this, we just 11 did a study at AAHP talking about the quality information 12 that's available in the single payer systems, the Canada 13 system, the GB, the Great British system and the German 14 system, which is often touted as a model of efficiency 15 and it's minimal, it's really minimal. We are in the 16 forefront here, and what I hope is that we can develop 17 these quality measures and be a leading template, Arnie, 18 for the rest of the world, as to how to get this quality 19 data out there and how do you use it to get evidence- 20 based medicine to people, you know, medicine when they 21 need it, where they need it at the best possible price. 22 Just a quick answer as well to my friend's, 23 Chip's, point about hospital consolidation. Again, you 24 know, it doesn't really matter who's causing what here. 25118 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025We have got to work together. We've got the fastest- 1 rising medical costs in a decade. Our plans are telling 2 us that their hospital costs are going up 20, 30, 40 and 3 even 50 percent. The 50 percent figure, by the way, is 4 from the New York Times. That's the kind of demands out 5 there. You can't blame it on anything specific. You 6 know, the PWC report that Chip referred to says, well, 7 labor costs are going up. Sure, they are. But CMS data 8 says labor costs are going up 6.1 percent. That doesn't 9 justify the price increases. 10 We really all have to work together to get 11 these costs down. I know employers are working very, 12 very hard, as Helen points out, in a very competitive 13 environment to make health care affordable to their 14 employees, because what we're seeing out there is many of 15 these employers, especially smaller, self-insured 16 employers are saying, forget it, I am not going to get 17 into this industry. And remember what we have, I often 18 remind groups of students, we have a voluntary employer- 19 based health care system. There's no employer in this 20 country, not a GM, not a Delta Airlines, not anybody, who 21 is mandated by law, state or federal, to fund a health 22 care plan for its employees, and I think that's a really 23 basic fact here and we do not want to drive the system 24 into the brink. 25119 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025MR. KAHN: Well -- 1 MR. HYMAN: Can we just let Arnie speak, if he 2 wishes to, and then, Chip, you can. . . 3 DR. MILSTEIN: Actually, I'll just ask maybe a 4 question of Chip and -- I can read down there without my 5 glasses -- and Jacquie -- 6 MS. DARRAH: Jacquie. 7 DR. MILSTEIN: Jacquie. And that is, how do 8 you feel about whether or not social welfare is served by 9 all or none contracting conditions by aggregated provider 10 hospital organizations? 11 Let's stay away for the moment from the issue 12 of all or none on service line, but just with respect to 13 our negotiating on behalf of 19 hospitals or 500 doctors 14 and I won't do a contract with you unless everybody in my 15 organization is included, irrespective of their quality 16 and efficiency scores. 17 MR. KAHN: I can't comment on physicians, 18 obviously, but in terms of hospital systems, I mean, if 19 you're a cooperation and, you know, one of my companies 20 and you have three or four hospitals in a market, I don't 21 understand why they can't do a contract for those three 22 or four hospitals. If you don't like it, you don't have 23 to sign a contract with them. 24 It seems to me that's a fact of life and those 25120 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025kind of discussions are going on right now, and if they 1 decide that they can't do business that way, then they 2 won't. But that's how they've decided to approach it and 3 I guess the point for the FTC is, at some point, if the 4 size of the market participation of that system is such, 5 then that brings in questions. But that's a very rare 6 case. 7 Second, you know, I'll go back to the numbers 8 that I had. I just don't see two-for-one sales for 9 stents and the fact is that most of the increase in 10 spending right now is related to people going to the 11 hospital because they're ill, because they need 12 treatment. If you want to stop them, fine. And, 13 actually managed care tried to. They tried to stop them 14 at the door and we had a backlash. 15 So, all I can say is the hospitals, in some 16 ways here, are receiving the orders of the physicians and 17 the patients in terms of demand. Demand is the driving 18 force right now. We can talk about the cost side and 19 debate whether or not we are as efficient as we should 20 be, but that still is not where the spending growth is 21 coming from. It's coming from use. To blame us for that 22 -- and I'll go back to the stents and say that the stents 23 are a good example on the cost side because all of a 24 sudden now, in a few months, we're going to have drug 25121 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025eluting stents and that ought to be good because I had 1 two angioplasties 10 years ago. And I wouldn't have had 2 two if there had been a drug eluting stent, I probably 3 would have just had one. 4 But the fact is that the cost of that stent at 5 the get-go is going to increase hospital costs. They're 6 going to come back and say, well, gee, you know, you're 7 increasing costs. Well, sure, because now there's stents 8 and it will soon become state-of-the-art. We don't have 9 a choice. 10 MS. DARRAH: I think -- 11 MR. KAHN: Now, I'm not saying that 12 efficiencies can't be made, but I think you've got to 13 take those realities into account. 14 MS. DARRAH: From the physician's perspective, 15 I think that we'd like to see where that's happening. 16 The data in our written testimony shows that most 17 physicians that are self-employed are in small group 18 practices, they're not aggregated. In fact, the 19 statements, even though we've got clinical integration 20 and financial integration, they're such high bars for 21 even any type of integration that they can't hit it. 22 MedSouth is a great example of that. 23 So, if that's happening, I'd like to see where 24 it's happening, but I think the secondary answer there is 25122 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025that physicians typically don't walk away from a plan 1 issue in order to -- if it means that their patients 2 aren't going to get access. The physician ethic is to 3 make sure that their patients get the care that they need 4 and access to care that they need. They've been 5 champions of making sure that they're enrolled in the 6 appropriate plans, have the right relationships with 7 hospitals in order to provide that continuity of care and 8 access to their patients. 9 MR. HYMAN: Arnie and then. . . 10 DR. MILSTEIN: I want to say that one of the 11 perspectives from the buy side that's been very much 12 informed by research over the last four or five years is 13 the research published in most of the national papers a 14 couple of weeks ago that's been developed over 20 years 15 at Dartmouth, which suggests that most of the big dollar 16 variation from region to region in how much it costs 17 Americans to pay for health care is not driven by 18 differences in consumer demand. It's driven by what 19 Dartmouth would refer to as supply sensitive services, 20 services that consumers don't actually have a preference 21 one way or the other that much for, but they really seem 22 to be correlated with the volume of specialists and the 23 volume of hospitals in communities. 24 Dartmouth estimates that only about 7 to 8 25123 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025percent of health care cost differences are rooted in 1 what's called preference-sensitive services, where 2 differences in how much you or I may have for kind of a 3 hard-edged, you know, dietary approach to cardiac 4 management versus bypass graft may vary. But I think 5 what Dartmouth is essentially saying is that the amount 6 of cost variation from region to region that's driven by 7 so-called supply sensitive services as opposed to 8 preference sensitive services, the ratio between those is 9 about four to one. So, I think that saying the problem 10 here is a voracious, insatiable American consumer 11 appetite for all these expensive things is partially 12 true, but there's a big opportunity for efficiency, even 13 holding consumer preferences constant. 14 MR. KAHN: You know, there is a big opportunity 15 and the Dartmouth work is great. However, in those 16 articles, they also were careful to note that they didn't 17 have a public policy formula. They didn't have a formula 18 how to come to grips with these differentials. I mean, 19 the differentials are there. Wennberg's been showing 20 them for years. And in some ways, there's nothing new. 21 Maybe it's a little bit more sensitive now. But there is 22 no magic bullet. I mean, I wish there was, I'd be 23 sitting here advocating it. 24 More information is important and can make some 25124 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025differences. But it's not a magic bullet and I would 1 argue it's not a bullet for cost or for quality 2 necessarily. 3 MR. HYMAN: Helen? 4 MS. DARLING: Yeah, these numbers may have 5 changed a little bit, but the last time I saw a study it 6 showed that something like one in five or 20 percent of 7 all hospital admissions result in a hospital related 8 infection. One of the points that we have tried to make 9 to large employers and purchasers is that if we could 10 drive quality and patient safety and different behavior 11 in the hospital, in a different way, that -- and that, in 12 fact, let's say on an average four-day stay would become 13 a five or six day stay because of the infection, if you 14 could stop that, then you wouldn't be paying for these 15 extra visits. 16 By the way, Chip, I've heard you argue this in 17 the past yourself. And we could use then that money to 18 do all the other things, the extra stents that everybody 19 needs and wants and all that, and you could also -- you 20 could pay for the 21st Century digital infrastructure 21 that allows you to do these kinds of things. 22 So, I mean, I don't think it is true, and I'd 23 be surprised if anybody else around the table does, that 24 when we talk about health care cost in any part of it, 25125 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025but especially in hospitals, we're really not talking 1 about just these wonderful stents that everybody ought to 2 have. We're talking about a multi-trillion dollar 3 industry. And there's so many services that are either 4 the wrong services or not the right services or 5 something, and that the rework and consequences of that 6 cost the system a lot. 7 If we could do some of the things we've talked 8 about, for example, we now have, for nursing homes, 9 thanks to Tom Scully and CMS's initiative in nursing 10 homes, you can now find out a couple of really pretty 11 depressing things about nursing home care in this 12 country, and we, as employers have said, in our resource 13 and referral, we contract -- large employers contract 14 with usually elder care EAPs to give advice on nursing 15 homes around the country, and it's usually an employee's 16 mom or dad or something. 17 They now can put into the report, when they 18 send out a list of nursing homes in America that have 19 available beds for your loved one, they can now put the 20 data that show the bed sore rate. Now, if you're sitting 21 there making a choice about somebody, that's a pretty 22 important thing to know. We also -- this has just 23 happened in less than six months. We can also say to our 24 resource and referral people, do you want anybody on your 25126 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025list that has a bed sore rate that's above average. 1 Average, by the way, is pretty grim, too. But maybe you 2 would even want to say, I'm only going to put on my 3 network list those that are 10 percent or less. 4 We ought to have that in the health care 5 system, I mean, infection rates in hospitals and things 6 like that, and people ought to know that if they choose 7 this hospital, that that's a hospital that has a 8 significantly higher infection rate. You have to control 9 and make sure the data are right and everything. But 10 that stuff's been reported since the health services 11 research in the 1940s at the University of Michigan and 12 places like that. 13 So, we could make a big progress without 14 arguing about whether it's going to be about -- you know, 15 somebody's not going to get the stent. That's not what 16 any of us are talking about. 17 MR. HYMAN: Arnie? 18 DR. MILSTEIN: I'd like to re-endorse Chip's 19 comments about there are no villains here. I don't think 20 there are any villains. But I do think there are some 21 solutions and what I would hope would be that we'd get -- 22 that the solutions would get widespread support from 23 multiple stakeholders. Though there's no silver bullet, 24 I think there is an answer to Chip's question to me, and 25127 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025that is, let's begin to create some metrics at the doctor 1 and hospital level with respect to the longitudinal 2 efficiency with which the total stream of resources 3 associated with one doctor's longitudinal is responsible 4 for a patient. Or in the case of what Dartmouth has also 5 shown is that most people with serious illness orbit 6 around the same hospital. 7 So, that's the way to -- I mean, what the 8 Dartmouth research published a couple weeks ago showed is 9 that those huge differences in the number of dollars 10 being consumed and taken care of, in the case of the 11 Dartmouth research, the Medicare population, was not 12 associated with any increase in patient satisfaction or 13 health levels. 14 So, let's begin to move toward, as quickly as 15 possible, some metrics to begin to allow us to discern 16 which providers are generating excellent levels of 17 patient health maintenance and patient satisfaction, but 18 denting the payroll deductions of those consumers a lot 19 less. 20 MR. BOTTI: Let me get a question in here 21 because I don't want to miss this topic. Either Helen or 22 Arnie, you seem like perhaps the best people to respond 23 to this. We've heard some numbers today about 24 concentration among health plans and we've talked a lot 25128 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025about the importance of information in order for 1 consumers, customers to make informed choices. I'm 2 wondering, do the concentration numbers in health plans 3 concern you? Do you see these increased premiums as 4 related to that concentration? Are you looking for 5 differentiation among plans, more information on plans as 6 opposed to providers? 7 Can we turn on these topics, for a moment, on 8 the plans and get your reactions to it as customers? 9 MS. DARLING: Well, our large employers are 10 self-funded, so they pay their own claims, basically, 11 through a plan, usually, that they contract with. So, 12 the only time -- they don't usually pay premiums. I 13 mean, they might in some markets where they happen to 14 choose to. But basically what they pay attention to is 15 what the administrative fees are. So, for example, if 16 you -- you could have a product with, say, Aetna and pay 17 a premium or you could be self-funded and you'd pay their 18 admin fees plus the claims. 19 In our experience, and my experience actually 20 for 20 years is, for the most part, there's still a lot 21 of competition on that front. You can always shift to -- 22 you can hire -- and a lot of small companies do this -- a 23 local TPA which runs like labor funds or something and 24 they pay claims. There are a lot of ways you can get 25129 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025your claims paid, if that's what you want to do. And you 1 can buy reinsurance if you're a medium-sized employer. 2 So, we don't see that as a big problem. 3 I'd say another point, I'm certainly not here 4 to defend the health plans of America, but if you look at 5 the data, it's a little bit disingenuous. The numbers 6 say profits went up 48 percent because it was from 7 actually two or three years of near bankruptcy. And, 8 again, I'm not here to defend them, but if you look at 9 the data, they lost a lot of money. Now, some of us 10 might fuss at them and say, you didn't do a good job of 11 managing and we could always find fault with some of the 12 dollars in there. But the cycle that they're dealing 13 with is why you have, at least -- in a couple years you 14 had a big increase because literally the prior two or 15 three years they probably lost, literally, millions and 16 millions and hundreds of millions of dollars. 17 So, looking at the baseline is important. But 18 we don't want to get anybody off the hook. We're happy 19 to go after anything that's hurting efficiency and 20 quality in this country, but we want to go at it with 21 data that's based on a time frame that's more like a two 22 to three to five-year with hospitals or doctors or 23 anybody else. We don't want anybody off the hook that 24 isn't driving to efficiency, effectiveness, quality and 25130 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025patient safety. 1 MR. BOTTI: Arnie, I'm just wondering, are you 2 folks also not interested in premiums or -- 3 DR. MILSTEIN: I have to say that, you know, 4 the employers I hang out with, I could characterize their 5 behavior as getting insured at favorable points in the 6 insurance cycle and getting into self-insurance at 7 unfavorable points in the insurance cycle. So, we do 8 have some interest in health insurers. 9 I mean, I think our point of view, by and 10 large, is that differences in the value of the health 11 benefits that we're buying are not very much affected by 12 whether we're using Carrier A or Carrier B. There are 13 some minor differences. But in terms of the big 14 differences in the potential value of health benefits to 15 our people, the leverage is not very much as to which 16 plan you pick. It really has to do with the mix of 17 doctors, hospitals and treatments that your health 18 benefits are buying. That's where the big, big value 19 difference is and value uplift opportunities lie. 20 So, for us, I think going forward, our primary 21 test of whether an insurer has become too consolidated is 22 to what degree are they using the consolidation to resist 23 our interest in using their power to begin to create 24 performance metrics that differentiate among doctors, 25131 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025among hospitals and treatment options with respect to 1 their performance, and then any resistance that they 2 might offer in terms of their structuring insurance 3 products to begin to reward excellence on the part of 4 doctors, hospitals and treatment options. 5 I mean, as long as carrier consolidation does 6 not get in the way of intense value differentiation and 7 value seeking at the hospital, doctor and treatment 8 option level, we're okay with carrier consolidation. 9 MS. DARLING: If I could just make one point, 10 in fact, we are asking all the health plans or anybody, 11 whether to network or PPO network, to help us drive this 12 quality and accountability agenda and, you know, we 13 believe because there is competition, if somebody tries 14 to not do that when we want to have that, then we're 15 going to -- we think they're going to lose our market 16 share and we think it's going to be a fair amount of 17 market share. So, we think there's enough there to drive 18 it and we think it's really important to do that. 19 MS. KANWIT: David and Mark, can I just make 20 one quick point? The enormous variation, to piggyback on 21 Arnie and Helen's point, of health care products out 22 there. I mean, an Aetna may offer thousands, literally 23 thousands of different products to thousands of different 24 employers because the employer gets to design, by and 25132 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025large, its own benefit product. And I think as Arnie 1 made the point, it can be a Ford product or a catalog 2 product, depending on what the employer wants to pay and 3 how much money it wants to ask its insureds to pay in 4 terms of copays or deductibles, et cetera. So, you 5 include cosmetic surgery if you really want to pay for 6 it. 7 So, the concentration point is a little 8 mitigated by that. 9 MR. HYMAN: I think my principal job here is to 10 keep the trains running on time, and so, we're going to 11 stop now and reconvene at 2:00 when we'll have two more 12 framing presentations and another panel with different 13 individuals participating. Thank you. 14 (Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., a luncheon recess 15 was taken.) 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25133 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025AFTERNOON SESSION 1 (2:00 P.M.) 2 MR. HYMAN: Okay, if everyone can take their 3 seats, I think we're ready to start. 4 Preliminary announcement, just reiterating, we 5 canceled tomorrow afternoon, the Little Rock session, but 6 we are planning to go forward with tomorrow morning, 7 Boston. If the federal government completely closes 8 down, that's the only circumstances I can conceive of 9 under which we will not do the Boston session, although 10 predictions are always falsifiable. 11 Second, the framework for this afternoon is 12 going to be the same as the framework for this morning. 13 We will have two framing presentations by Judy Feder and 14 Tim Greaney. Judy is Professor and Dean of Policy 15 Studies at Georgetown University and Tim is Professor of 16 Law at St. Louis University. If it looks like I've 17 stacked the agenda with my friends from academics, your 18 assessment is accurate. So, Tim is going to start and 19 Judy will follow. 20 And then we'll have a panel of representatives 21 of the provider, payer and employer communities, each of 22 which will present seven to ten minutes, followed by an 23 extended period of discussion and we will wrap promptly 24 at 5:00 so you can avoid the snow. 25134 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Tim? 1 DR. GREANEY: Thank you, David, for organizing 2 this great set of hearings, and thanks to the DOJ and FTC 3 staff for putting it together. I think it's going to be 4 quite a contribution to understanding and maybe to the 5 literature in this area. 6 Fifteen years ago, I published an article in 7 the Yale Journal of Regulation entitled, Competitive 8 Reform in Health Care: The Vulnerable Revolution. The 9 article cautioned against the assumption that competition 10 would develop without friction or would necessarily 11 flourish in the American health care system. It 12 identified a number of obstacles, legal, institutional 13 and political, that might impair effective competition. 14 For example, I cited state regulation, the slowness of 15 public programs, like Medicare, to adopt competitive 16 principles, the absence of good information and 17 guidelines to help third party payers become better 18 buyers and professional norms. 19 My point here is not to persuade you that you 20 have a latter day Nostradamus before you, but to observe 21 some of the persistent issues that stand between 22 consumers and the benefits of a competitive marketplace. 23 I'm going to divide my remarks into two sets of 24 problems that competition policy encounters today. 25135 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025First, I want to explore some of the issues that are 1 outside the box. Outside the box of antitrust law, per 2 se. That is, issues of health policy and market 3 performance, some of the things I think Peter Hammer may 4 have touched on, that shape the underlying conditions 5 necessary for effective competition. 6 From the Commission and the Antitrust Division 7 standpoint, many of these issues might be beyond their 8 immediate control, but perhaps, however, they can 9 intervene indirectly by broadening their competition 10 advocacy mission, as the Antitrust Division back when I 11 was there with the telecommunications industry in the 12 '70s and '80s. 13 Well, first, let me sketch out some thoughts 14 that underlie my thinking of why the state of health care 15 competition is less than optimal. First, there's ample 16 circumstantial evidence, I think, that despite the 17 furious activity in the marketplace, competition is not 18 living up to its promise. For example, the strong 19 dissatisfaction among the public and legislatures with 20 the performance of managed care suggests a market in 21 which the signals sent by consumers are not effectively 22 communicated to buyers and their agents. 23 Second, the never-ending incidence of false 24 claims, up-coding, fraud, suggest a marketplace in which 25136 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025even large sophisticated buyers have enormous difficultly 1 evaluating exactly what it is they're buying. 2 Third, the fact that some 20 years into the 3 competitive revolution in health care \"evidence-based 4 medicine\" is considered a novel and promising approach to 5 improving health care delivery. That, I think, speaks to 6 the continuing failure of the marketplace to provide 7 adequate information and mechanisms to overcome market 8 failure. 9 Fourth, economic studies have indicated that 10 consolidation of providers, both horizontal and vertical, 11 has had the opposite effect that conventional economic 12 theory predicts. It has, in fact, enhanced more market 13 power more than efficiently rationalized delivery, 14 suggesting the likelihood that the efficiency, market 15 power trade-off has been something of a one-way street. 16 Fifth, quality of health care debate sparked by 17 the Institute of Medicine reports and other sources 18 challenges antitrust's traditional assumption that the 19 market will dictate appropriate trade-offs between cost 20 and quality. 21 I would add, also, that the persistent reports 22 from the field, including those of the Center for 23 Studying Health System Change, to the effect that 24 increased concentration has resulted in higher prices, 25137 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025has at least some probative value on the question of the 1 current state of competition. There are, to be sure, 2 certainly other factors that contribute, including the 3 increased use of expensive technology and new techniques 4 that may or may not indicate lessened managed care 5 rivalry. Nevertheless, there is a robust empirical 6 record out there that suggests a relationship between 7 provider concentration and prices. So, I do take that 8 literature seriously. 9 So, with managed care on the decline to the 10 extent that even the long-time competition advocates, 11 like Professor Clark Havighurst, are wondering out loud 12 whether \"the health care revolution -- the competition 13 revolution in health care is finished,\" one could 14 question where antitrust finds its raison d'etre. Can a 15 convincing case be made for vigorous antitrust 16 enforcement when the market lacks the driving force that 17 most competition advocates claimed was essential to 18 making competition work? 19 Well, let me go outside the box and talk a 20 little about the infrastructure issues. I'll just survey 21 a couple of issues that popped into my mind. I'm sure 22 there are dozens out there. The most obvious place to 23 start, I think, is where the money is, reform in the 24 Medicare system offers the largest opportunity to 25138 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025stimulate formation of sophisticated managed care 1 entities, generation of information and protocols, 2 supplying other pieces of the missing infrastructure. 3 It's worth noting that the studies that attribute the 4 failure of Medicare plus choice, Medicare's attempt to 5 bring managed care into the system, those studies point 6 to the absence of competitive provider markets and 7 networks. I'm thinking of the Kaiser Family Foundation 8 study in California. 9 So, I think the success of Medicare market- 10 based reforms and stimulation of market-improving 11 mechanisms go hand in hand and are certainly something 12 that the competition advocacy program I'm advocating 13 should pay attention to. 14 Second, questions have been raised about the 15 adequacy of the information infrastructure for purchasing 16 managed care by managed care entities. David Eddy's work 17 in this area suggests that the quality and cost 18 effectiveness assessments of technology and procedures 19 are needed to assist purchasers and it's sorely lacking 20 today. 21 The market's inability to produce them is 22 attributable to what economists like to call the public 23 goods nature of these products. Even large managed care 24 organizations cannot benefit by unilaterally developing 25139 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025this information as it could be used by others, or worse 1 yet, they are not able to encourage changes in practice 2 styles across large numbers of independent physicians. 3 By the same token, employers sophisticated or 4 not, large and small, lack the information infrastructure 5 to effectively evaluate and bargain with third party 6 payers. 7 Third, competition policy often overlooks the 8 supply side of the market. Physician work force policy 9 ranging from graduate medical education to availability 10 of foreign trade practitioners and other issues 11 controlling the supply side have come under scrutiny 12 recently. Likewise, issues regarding scope of practice 13 and nurse practitioners and others who could provide an 14 important competitive spur deserve attention. As 15 suggested by the Pew Health Profession Commission, 16 there's a need to take a close look at the possibility of 17 setting national scope of practice standards, removing 18 barriers to professional mobility as well. It's 19 certainly possible that adjustments on the supply side 20 can help as well. 21 Finally, it's impossible to discuss the current 22 state of the market without observing the impact of state 23 laws on managed care and the cost they impose on the 24 system. One estimate supplied by Price Waterhouse 25140 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Coopers attributes 15 percent of total cost increases in 1 2002 to mandates. 2 More problematic, however, may be that these 3 laws may impair, in some instances, the ability of payers 4 to effectively select and monitor providers. 5 As we all know, health care is an enormously 6 complex and highly regulated environment. The success of 7 competition policy is only as good as the infrastructure 8 supporting it. It seems entirely appropriate to this 9 taxpayer for the antitrust and consumer protection 10 agencies, charged with promoting quality and competition, 11 to go outside the box to improve the system. 12 Okay, let me move inside the box and talk about 13 antitrust law and doctrine and the courts. My thesis 14 here on the state of the case law and what's happened in 15 recent years can be summed up simply. The courts have 16 dropped the ball. The problem is not simply that the 17 government has lost a series of cases. Indeed, it 18 deserved to lose some of them given the unappealing 19 factual settings in which some of them were brought. 20 Poor case selection often results in bad precedents. But 21 most troubling is the analytic approach we see in some of 22 these court decisions. The article I'm currently writing 23 on traces some of these mis-steps to a readiness to apply 24 The Chicago School Antitrust Template to health care 25141 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025cases. 1 The tendency is to ignore the nuances of health 2 care markets when applying doctrines, creating 3 presumptions, weighing evidence. 4 The sense of unreality comes jumping out when 5 one reads Judge Posner describe supply side substitution 6 in health plans, saying that HMOs and PPOs are supply 7 side substitutes because their main input, physician 8 services, can be readily obtained by physicians simply 9 switching from one to another. Similarly jarring is the 10 over-simplification found in Judge Easterbrook's Ball 11 State opinion concluding, without a supporting record, 12 that entry into managed care is just a matter of money. 13 Let me just mention a couple of the precedents 14 that I find particularly surprising and troublesome. 15 Most prominently, the hospital merger cases err seriously 16 in determining market definition and their treatment of 17 market definition. The court's naive interpretation of 18 Elzinga-Hogarty into health care is the subject of a 19 number of criticisms committing what one excellent 20 economic analysis calls the silent majority fallacy, 21 drawing inferences about market behavior from one group 22 of customers based on the behavior of their neighbors. 23 With hospitals offering heterogeneous services on the 24 supply side and patients having highly diverse 25142 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025preferences, these cases have created some thoroughly 1 wrong-headed precedents and subdoctrines. 2 These cases, I think, have already had a ripple 3 effect, the hospital merger cases have had a ripple 4 effect by placing a high burden on plaintiffs in rule of 5 reason cases where market definition is required. 6 Other remarkable precedents have added to the 7 plaintiff's burden in these cases. Two circuits have 8 explicitly adopted an evidentiary rule of thumb that 9 discounts the credibility of the testimony of third party 10 payers on facts that are really central to their 11 business; e.g., whether the hospital system will -- 12 whether their patients will respond to incentives to 13 travel greater distances or whether certain hospitals are 14 regarded by them, the buyers, as effective substitutes. 15 It's simply inexplicable to me to say the testimony of 16 the buyers, as a matter of law, when it's unimpeached, 17 not impeached by a showing of bias or other defects, 18 should be presumptively discredited as these courts do. 19 I find the simplifying assumptions of plain 20 vanilla antitrust analysis guilty of other sins, ignoring 21 reputation, learning curves, intangible barriers to 22 entry, for example. But let me add that the erroneous 23 application of plain vanilla assumptions does not always 24 point to less prosecution. Sometimes, it might point in 25143 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the direction of erroneous prosecution as well, over- 1 prosecution. 2 You can make the argument that the Department 3 of Justice's monopsony charge in the Aetna-Prudential 4 merger, where it claimed the merged entity could exercise 5 market power over physicians by virtue of its size and 6 certain characteristics and practices of the market. 7 It's at least debatable whether physicians' service 8 market beats the classic monopsony conditions the DOJ 9 claimed. Real world factors like price discrimination, 10 excess supply in the physician market, preexisting 11 surplus in the physician market may have made the 12 prospect of Aetna exercising monopsony power unrealistic. 13 The essential point I would make for antitrust 14 agencies today is that these unfortunate precedents do 15 not get corrected when they neglect to bring cases. A 16 further point made in a recent article I wrote in health 17 affairs was that I think this recent history may embolden 18 lawlessness among some, admittedly fringe groups that may 19 see the absence of enforcement as a green light and the 20 absence of criminal enforcement as well. 21 It certainly gives one pause when 70 percent of 22 a state's doctors can go out on strike, collectively 23 denying consumers their services, and it fails to evoke 24 any interest in antitrust enforcement agencies, the same 25144 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025agencies, those of us old enough to remember, that 1 successfully prosecuted an antitrust boycott case against 2 lawyers for indigent clients engaging in almost identical 3 conduct. 4 I'm running a little late, so I'll just give a 5 synopsis of the last part of my paper. I just try to 6 review what's happened on the legislative front, a little 7 history of what happened when people decided to raise the 8 claim, as they have in at least four or five different 9 instances, that antitrust needed to be scaled back. 10 There have been a number of such movements and the claim 11 that the industry requires relief from antitrust is 12 really as old as the first cases in antitrust. 13 Interesting, the rationale for these appeals 14 for immunity or special treatment have shifted. But as I 15 surveyed the history, none of them proved accurate. In 16 the early '70s, we heard that health care markets were 17 different and antitrust law was interfering with 18 professional sovereignty and impinging on state 19 regulation. 20 In the '80s, we heard that an overly rigid per 21 se rule was insensitive to nuances and was preventing 22 joint ventures from forming and impairing quality 23 monitoring. In the '90s, as legislation was moving 24 forward to reform the health care system, we heard that 25145 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025relief was necessary so providers could better and more 1 efficiently coordinate and combine through joint ventures 2 and mergers to face the brave new world of managed care 3 contracting. 4 Finally, in the late '90s, we've heard the 5 appeal of leveling the playing field, that managed care 6 has become so popular we need dueling monopolies, what 7 I've called in other contexts the sumo wrestler theory of 8 competition. You get two big guys with big bellies 9 bumping in the middle of the stage and the friction will 10 generate consumer welfare. 11 What I find remarkable about these calls for 12 immunity or repeal is how shallow the economic evidence 13 was supporting them whether viewed at the time or 14 retrospectively. And the same, I think, could be called 15 for some of today's calls for legalizing collective 16 bargaining under the Campbell Bill or state laws or 17 whatever. 18 Well, if I haven't succeeded in raising enough 19 controversy as yet, I'll give a few ideas for the panel 20 to chew on. One question is, how do antitrust enforcers 21 or legislatures find evidence of monopsony power? What 22 are the practical indicia, to borrow from -- I guess it's 23 Brown Shoe -- that fact-finders or courts should rely on? 24 What are the lessons we draw out of MedSouth? Where do 25146 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025we go from there in terms of quality-enhancing 1 performance as a justification for collective conduct? 2 Are there spillovers into the hospital industry 3 specifically that might legitimize virtual networks? Are 4 there similar carry-overs we could see in the insurance 5 industry where insurers could claim that we might have a 6 justification based on quality to have uniform protocols 7 and so forth? 8 And we have some insurance industry 9 representatives here. I certainly would like to know 10 more about how the insurance industry works and what 11 exactly it is that repeal of the McCarran-Ferguson Act 12 would or would not do to the way they conduct business 13 today. 14 I have a lot more questions. I can give you 15 all my final exams for the last five years, but I will 16 spare you of that and look forward to the panel 17 discussion. 18 (Applause.) 19 DR. FEDER: Good afternoon, everybody. I must 20 say that when I was invited to speak at this hearing, I 21 was not at all sure why that invitation was forthcoming. 22 My experience is in efforts to promote the expansion of 23 health insurance coverage, ideally, while containing 24 health care costs. That causes me enough trouble without 25147 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025becoming deeply involved in the issues that you're 1 addressing at this conference. But with a little help 2 from David and from Tim, I realized that to the extent 3 that markets and competition are advocated as strategies 4 to achieve the goals of insurance coverage expansion and 5 of containment of cost, my experience may be quite 6 relevant to your concerns. 7 So, today, as I was advised, for stage setting 8 purposes, what I thought I would do is explore what we've 9 observed in the last decade with respect to efforts on 10 expanding insurance coverage, three periods and three 11 kinds of evidence. 12 First, expectations for the marketplace in the 13 effort to achieve universal coverage, represented by the 14 period of the Clinton health reforms. Then, briefly, 15 because Tim has addressed much of it, but I'll look at 16 the experience with the insurance marketplace, the 17 managed care revolution after the demise of those health 18 reform efforts, and then turn to interest in the market 19 and current efforts to expand health insurance coverage, 20 such as they are. 21 What I realized in putting my remarks together, 22 happily for me, is that I think I do have something of a 23 story in these remarks. There is some coherence. And 24 that is that there are real concerns about whether, in 25148 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the absence of government regulation of some kind or 1 government intervention, whether private market 2 competition in health insurance can pool risk rather than 3 segment the healthy from the sick, and in some 4 circumstances, the better off from the less well-off. 5 So, there are real concerns. 6 But competition is advocated by people who are 7 looking to the market as an alternative to government 8 intervention and regulation, and that poses a real 9 conundrum because if competition is being advocated in 10 order to avoid or to minimize the government role, it 11 makes it politically extremely difficult to create market 12 circumstances or create a public policy framework for 13 operation of the market that will, indeed, be effective 14 in pooling risks and perhaps containing costs in ways 15 that some of us would like to see. I guess I would say, 16 in terms of efficiency and value for the dollar rather 17 than simply benefit reduction. 18 So, that's my story in a nutshell. Let me lay 19 it out for you looking at these three periods. The first 20 period is the Clinton health reform effort, which I think 21 many in the room -- I teach Master's students in public 22 policy, many of which are relatively young and they don't 23 even remember this, but I think many in the room will 24 remember this, although it is receding into ancient 25149 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025history. 1 Although perhaps not perceived or understood 2 this way for good reasons, I will tell you, will argue 3 that the Clinton Health Security Act was, indeed, based 4 on the idea of market competition. It was not 5 competition in the market as we knew it or as it existed, 6 but it was based on the idea of creating a new kind of 7 market or competition among insurers as the real 8 essential basis for the way in which quality care would 9 be efficiently delivered and available to all Americans. 10 The subsidies were structured in order to 11 expand and ensure insurance coverage for all Americans. 12 The subsides were designed in a way intended to promote 13 competition among insurers. You will remember that 14 consumers were essentially guaranteed a subsidy equal to 15 roughly 80 percent of the average price of insurance 16 plans in their communities. Consumers who found 17 insurance for less got to pocket the difference. 18 Consumers who chose insurance for more paid the 19 difference and the idea common to advocates of managed 20 competition was that that would lead to efficient 21 delivery or that insurers would compete for these 22 vouchers. They'd compete based on efficiency and we 23 would have efficient delivery of quality of care. 24 But it was also recognized that in order to 25150 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025have competition that focused on the efficient delivery 1 of quality of care that the system needed new rules for 2 insurers, and I am amused at myself when I give this 3 spiel because it just trips off my tongue. You know, I 4 did it a number of times and we're going to change the 5 rules and here's what the rules -- where we're going to 6 have new rules. 7 We were going to have standardized benefits so 8 that competition would not affect those -- a division in 9 the marketplace among those who needed services and those 10 who do not. We were going to require insurers to take 11 all comers, the idea, to have guaranteed open enrollment. 12 We were going to require insurers to charge all 13 individuals the same rates, and I used to have to say the 14 rates they choose to define, not government-determined 15 rates, but essentially we were going to require community 16 rating. And because community rating can exacerbate the 17 avoidance of high risks, we were going to develop a 18 system to be determined, a risk adjustment to distribute 19 -- to ensure that insurers who, because they were so good 20 at treating sick people, actually got more sick people 21 than other plans. So, we were going to adjust the 22 revenues after the fact. 23 There is no question that this was managed 24 competition with emphasis on the management and, 25151 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025actually, I left out that there were also consumer 1 protections and I did not get a chance to look at the old 2 bill and see what exactly we put in on consumer 3 protections, but a quick conversation with a friend and 4 you'd be amazed at how much of this we actually remember. 5 We think it was unlikely that we had private 6 rights of action in the bill, that we relied on civil 7 monetary penalties thinking that perhaps there were some 8 political battles that we should not take on, which is 9 interesting. But there was definitely an appeals 10 mechanism for consumers and our structure that allowed 11 accountability was inherent in this creation of the 12 alliances within which competition took place, 13 essentially, organized places to shop, to apply the rules 14 and to appeal the use of those rules, the application of 15 those rules when and if necessary. 16 Now, I will, as an aside, acknowledge, because 17 some people in the room might be twitching, that there 18 was some concern that this competition might not be 19 effective in controlling costs, and as I used to say, the 20 President believed that it would control costs. It was 21 the only time I used that language because I didn't. But 22 the President believed this would control costs, but he 23 had to -- because he had to get scored by the 24 Congressional Budget Office, he had to be confident that 25152 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025it would control costs. 1 So, just in case it didn't work, it was -- as 2 those of you who followed it will 3 remember -- this competitive system was backed up by very 4 stringent and enforceable limits on rates paid to 5 insurers and they were enforced through take-backs 6 essentially on rates paid to providers. So, there was a 7 powerful regulatory system underlying this market system 8 in the Clinton proposal. 9 So, in some sense, we did have the best of both 10 worlds, made everybody completely unhappy. If you didn't 11 like competition, you didn't like that. If you didn't 12 like regulation, you didn't like that. I think that to 13 say that the bill did not garner much support would be an 14 understatement. I think it is useful to consider, and I 15 will throw out that insurers' opposition to the new rules 16 played a part in insurance industry's powerful and quite 17 effective opposition to the overall reform. But the 18 truth of the matter is that there was so much to object 19 to and so much opposition that we didn't even have to get 20 to discussions about rating and enrollment and so on. 21 So, needless to say, but I will say it anyway, 22 the Health Security Act went down in flames. 23 The next phase of competition as we observed, 24 and which Tim was describing, is that it went forward in 25153 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025a different form and it is useful -- I have had people 1 say to me, they don't say it much anymore, but about five 2 years ago it was not uncommon -- even a little longer ago 3 than that. It's been a long time. That people would 4 say, isn't it interesting that they didn't enact the bill 5 and it happened anyway. Not quite true. The coverage 6 part didn't happen, but that's an aside. It just needs 7 to be mentioned. And, indeed, I think there's reason to 8 question, as Tim has pointed out and I think many would 9 agree, whether indeed what was anticipated and envisioned 10 in the Clinton version of managed competition, in a word, 11 competition around the efficient delivery of quality of 12 care whether that has remotely taken place. 13 I think there is pretty much general agreement 14 that despite the transformation which, indeed, there was 15 of insurance into more constrained types of plans, that 16 almost nobody thinks that it led to a competition around 17 the efficient delivery of quality of care. 18 Where competition, I think, did have an effect 19 was by employers charging more, charging their employees 20 for more. If they wanted to stay in fee-for-service 21 plans, they pretty much eliminated fee-for-service plans. 22 That really was an anticipated result denied by us 23 because we required the continuation of fee-for-service 24 plans. It was a concern expressed with respect to the 25154 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Clinton Health Security Act and it wasn't all a matter of 1 choice, particularly for smaller and low wage employers, 2 if I remember correctly. It was not a question of 3 choice, those were just the plans that they were offered. 4 But managed care, I don't think anybody thinks 5 that the slowdown in cost growth that occurred with this 6 change, the managed care revolution, was a function of 7 competition around efficient delivery. The insurance 8 plans stimulated, pressed by their purchasers, the 9 employers, negotiated quite heavily or aggressively with 10 providers leading to many of the concerns and issues that 11 you are otherwise addressing, and that that really, I 12 would call, much more like private regulation than 13 competition, they began to negotiate still not -- well, 14 in some areas some argue, more effectively than Medicare 15 or public programs. But that was not the vision that was 16 there before us. It was regarded more as managing costs 17 than managing care and the quality side of this, the 18 efficient delivery did not seem to follow. 19 In fact, there was a greater concern that what 20 was -- instead of management of care, there were barriers 21 to access, relatively arbitrary barriers to access that 22 were being relied upon by managed care plans. 23 Now, the unacceptability of that regulation to 24 employees accompanied by -- and we have to remember the 25155 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025bigger picture, the bigger market in which all this takes 1 place -- accompanied by a booming economy that now 2 restored the ability of employees to complain about their 3 health insurance benefits and get employers to respond. 4 I would argue it was the reverse of that, the recession, 5 that enabled employers to push managed care in the first 6 place. So, now, these empowered in a hot market, 7 empowered workers complained about these arrangements and 8 they began, to some extent, to change. Indeed, I'm not 9 sure that they have changed in terms of responsiveness to 10 consumers' concerns about arbitrary constraints on 11 access. I think those concerns are still there. 12 But it did turn out in this marketplace in 13 which employers were not willing to be so hard on their 14 employees, it did turn out that the best way to attract 15 enrollees was to loosen the regulatory constraints, I 16 would call them, of the plans and give everybody broad 17 access to providers, reducing them the market power of 18 these plans with respect to providers. It was okay with 19 the employers because they wanted to keep everybody 20 happy, but it was not doing a whole hell of a lot anymore 21 to control costs, let alone control costs by providing 22 care efficiently. 23 As Tim has said, that led proponents of managed 24 competition to express tremendous disappointed in the 25156 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025performance of managed care and managed competition. 1 I've already alluded to the concern, the complaint that 2 managed care plans were managing costs, not managing 3 care. I have heard another complaint which really was 4 that it was a failure of the marketplace to create an 5 effective market for health insurance. 6 So, the lessons of that period, I think, or the 7 two periods is that -- the lesson is that the regulations 8 that the Clinton administration sought in terms of 9 creating a market are politically very difficult to 10 achieve. Not only were they not achievable in the 11 Clinton Health Security Act, but they have not been very 12 achievable at the state level as well in terms of 13 establishing rules for the marketplace. 14 In terms of what I think of as an 15 accountability mechanism, the patient bill of rights 16 concept has also at the national level been difficult to 17 establish and without regulations and perhaps other 18 changes, as Tim alluded to in the overall health care 19 system, it seems questionable as to whether the 20 marketplace can achieve the expectations of those who 21 advocated it as leading to a more effective and efficient 22 health care system. 23 Now, let me come to the current period and say 24 that although the coverage debate is, I would say, to a 25157 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025considerable extent, dormant, the market strategy is 1 alive and well. Tim talked about the advocacy of a 2 market approach to Medicare. It is represented not 3 simply by Medicare plus choice, but the administration's 4 newest proposals for Medicare reform would essentially 5 provide Medicare beneficiaries a prescription drug 6 benefit only if they leave Medicare and enroll in private 7 insurance plans. They describe what they're advocating 8 as based on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. 9 We can talk about the competition in that plan. 10 Interesting, but that's the way they describe it. 11 Although there are no details on that plan. 12 They are not looking to a lot of regulation in 13 areas -- benefits, for example, and nature of plan, it's 14 pretty much -- I mean, there are -- that's not quite 15 right. There is a specification of benefits so there is 16 some standardization, but also variation. I was going to 17 say 1,000 flowers bloom, it's not 1,000 flowers. But 18 there is an interest in an array of different types of 19 insurance plans, including a very high deductible plan. 20 So, there is not a concern relative to the 21 desire to get beneficiaries out of a government insurance 22 plan. I think there is relatively little concern with 23 issues that both the Clinton Administration, that being 24 the division or segmentation of the marketplace that 25158 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025would not pool risk, but would separate the healthy from 1 the sick. 2 For the under 65 and uninsured population, the 3 market is also en vogue in forms that range from less to 4 some regulation. The most hands-off approach is 5 represented by proposals like the Bush administration has 6 made to give low income individuals vouchers, refundable 7 tax credits, to shop in the non-group insurance market. 8 The problems with selection in that market are totally 9 ignored in that proposal and, in part, some would argue 10 that with lots of people shopping or some do argue that 11 with lots of people shopping those, problems would be 12 less than they are today. Although, I would argue that's 13 not likely to be the case. 14 It is also regardless of what people think 15 about selection issues, there is also an argument that 16 some coverage is better -- for some people is better than 17 no coverage for any of these people. So, that's an 18 argument behind this approach, and it really is, I think, 19 valued for its hands-offness, a way to provide, to expand 20 insurance coverage and keep the government out. 21 The slightly more hands-on approach does 22 involve some government, but not on a part with what was 23 proposed in the Health Security Act, although it's got 24 similarities. This approach, if pursued through 25159 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025refundable tax credits or others kinds of subsidies, 1 would give subsidies to low income individuals and rather 2 than have them shop in the non-group market, would accept 3 that there are issues of risk selection there and, 4 therefore, would intervene to create a place to buy. The 5 language -- you know, HPIC went out before the Clinton -- 6 or in the midst of the Clinton administration. Nobody 7 would advocate an alliance. So, what they are referred 8 to as is little FEHBP plans. 9 Because, as an aside, warming to the memories, 10 the best line we ever had, which we only used 11 occasionally, was that everybody should have what members 12 of Congress have in terms of health insurance protection. 13 So, that's very popular, even though I think everybody in 14 this room knows that nobody is talking about putting the 15 uninsured into the Federal Employees Health Benefit 16 Program. What they're talking about is building 17 alliances, HPIC, whatever, but places to shop subject to 18 certain rules for health insurance. 19 I heard such a proposal the other day and was 20 hard put not to -- when asked actually whether there was 21 any information available, anyone in the room had any 22 information available or had seen any analysis on how 23 such arrangements, little FEHBPs at the state level would 24 work, I had to bite my tongue not to say I have the 25160 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025tollgates in my office, I'd be happy to provide them to 1 you. Because we spent a lot of time in the Clinton 2 administration thinking about, as did everybody outside 3 the Clinton administration, thinking about how such pools 4 might work. So, there is a good body of literature on 5 which to draw for that. 6 But the interesting thing about these proposals 7 is that they essentially, I would argue, in part, because 8 of the political difficulties of establishing rating and 9 enrollment and risk adjustment rules for all insurers, 10 they kind of agreed to leave the insurance industry 11 significantly alone, create a pool where people -- it may 12 be the only place in which they can use their vouchers, 13 so that would, I think, not be regarded favorably by 14 insurers looking for new customers. But what it says is 15 that what that approach recognizes is that the healthy, 16 the better risks will probably stay outside the pool. 17 The pool will be selected against. It will simply cost 18 more to get people adequate subsidies and adequate 19 protections in those arrangements. 20 And so, I do think that politicians look and 21 can consider, if they are looking to create new 22 arrangements and expand insurance coverage, which 23 political battles they want to fight, the one for the 24 rules on the insurance industry or the ones to get the 25161 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025money, if you don't do those rules, to keep the subsidies 1 adequate, but for the poorer risks. 2 Now, as I said, there's not much push here on 3 expansion of insurance coverage. You know, it's hard to 4 hear on the agenda. But to the extent that there is 5 interest, it is clear that the market mechanisms are a 6 prominent vehicle that people land on as a way to expand 7 insurance protection. Now, I have to say I find it 8 really interesting that this is the case because based on 9 the evidence and performance of the market as it is, as 10 opposed to the market as some would like it to be, I 11 don't see any evidence that this approach makes any kind 12 of sense. 13 If you look at Medicare and talk about reliance 14 on or privatizing Medicare, turning it into a system of 15 competing insurers, it doesn't seem to me to have a leg 16 to stand on, even on the simple issue of health care 17 costs since nobody has more market power than the 18 Medicare program, and essentially, if you look at the 19 history of Medicare costs against private insurance 20 costs, they track pretty closely because health insurance 21 -- they're all buying in the same marketplace, but 22 Medicare does somewhat better historically than does the 23 FEHBP program or private insurance. 24 So, to argue that -- there's no evidence for 25162 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025this view. There's certainly no evidence to say that it 1 leads to -- that competition has brought us anything in 2 efficiency or quality. So, there just isn't anything 3 here. 4 Further, to work effectively, it is, I think, 5 generally recognized that we do need government 6 intervention of some kind, whether it's consumer 7 protections or creating the spreading of risk or assuring 8 the spreading of risk, that some kind of government 9 intervention is needed to, if we do or when we do, rely 10 on competing private insurance plans in order to deliver 11 care. 12 But when I question the evidence on why it is 13 that people are advocating competition and privatization 14 and private insurance, I know the answer to that 15 question. It really, in my view, is advocated to a 16 considerable extent by those who question the role of 17 government in providing these kinds of social benefits, 18 and on the Medicare side, it is indeed the replacement of 19 an extremely successful social insurance program, albeit 20 with some difficulties with the private insurance 21 arrangement. 22 That, to me, is ideologically driven, not 23 evidence driven. And as I said, it is not at all 24 surprising, given that's where the push is coming from, 25163 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025that interest in regulatory or other kinds of structures 1 that could make such a market effective are hardly to be 2 seen in the conversation. 3 Thanks. 4 (Applause.) 5 MR. HYMAN: Okay, we'll take a 10-minute break. 6 So, see you shortly. 7 (Whereupon, a brief recess was taken.) 8 MR. BRENNAN: My name is Jeff Brennan and I'm 9 an Assistant Director in the Bureau of Competition. I'm 10 in the Health Care Division. I appreciate everyone 11 being here today. We'll get started with the afternoon 12 panel. Let me first introduce my colleague, Mark Botti, 13 Section Chief in the Department of Justice. 14 I thought what we'd do first is I'll introduce 15 the panelists who have not been formally introduced yet 16 and then we'll go back to the first person and begin with 17 the remarks. 18 Our esteemed panel this afternoon includes 19 Henry R. Desmarais, who is the Senior Vice President of 20 Policy and Information with the Health Insurance 21 Association of America. 22 We have Timothy F. Doran, M.D., who's with the 23 American Academy of Pediatrics. He's also the Chair of 24 the Department of Pediatrics at the Greater Baltimore 25164 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Medical Center. 1 We have Frank Opelka, M.D. from the American 2 College of Surgeons. He's the Chief, Colon and Rectal 3 Surgery, Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 4 To my immediate left is Peter M. Sfikas 5 representing the American Dental Association. He is the 6 Chief Counsel and Associate Executive Director. 7 Twice to my left is Winifred Carson-Smith, 8 who's the Nurse Practice Counsel for the American Nurses 9 Association. 10 And our final panelist today is Christine A. 11 Varney, representing the American Hospital Association. 12 She is a partner in Hogan & Hartson and a former FTC 13 Commissioner. We welcome her back. 14 With that, I turn it over to Dr. Desmarais for 15 his remarks. 16 DR. DESMARAIS: Thank you very much. The 17 Health Insurance Association of America appreciates the 18 opportunity to participate in these hearings. I think 19 it's important to point out that our member companies 20 provide not only medical expense insurance, but the full 21 array of health insurance products, including disability 22 insurance, dental insurance, long-term care insurance, 23 stop loss and supplemental coverage. 24 What I'd like to do with my seven minutes is, 25165 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025at least, introduce the topic of the health insurance 1 marketplace and say a few words about that, and also talk 2 about two issues of particular concern to us that I think 3 are relevant to today's sessions. 4 Insurers and health plans are often described 5 as having untold amounts of market power and also said to 6 be exempt from antitrust scrutiny, while providers are 7 often described as having little countervailing power to 8 negotiate fairly with insurers. We think this is a 9 deeply flawed assessment. 10 In actuality, the health insurance market is 11 both highly competitive and highly regulated. According 12 to a recent study, the number of managed care 13 organizations competing in each of the top 40 MSAs in the 14 country averaged 14. So, there were 14 competitors in 15 each of those markets on average, with some as high as 41 16 different competing organizations in one market. 17 In addition, each of those organizations was 18 found to offer, on the average, a choice of more than 19 three different types of products in each area, obviously 20 creating a very diverse marketplace. 21 I'd also point out that this is not a static 22 market. Our member companies are busy creating other 23 options, including what is now being described as 24 consumer-driven products. In addition, new technology, 25166 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025in particular, the Internet, is providing new ways for 1 consumers to do comparative shopping for their health 2 insurance products. 3 I should also add, as we talk about the 4 insurance marketplace, that there's not just one 5 marketplace. First, there's individual insurance 6 products, and that's a marketplace unto itself. There's 7 small group insurance marketplace, which has, again, 8 different kinds of issues. You also have to remember 9 there's a great number of people in this country, 10 probably including many of the people in this room, who 11 receive coverage through self-insured health plans 12 through large employers. So, there's a great deal of 13 diversity out there. 14 In addition, in each case, we're often talking 15 about PPOs, HMOs, point of service. So, again, there's 16 not just one flavor in the marketplace. 17 To understand this current marketplace, I also 18 think it's important to recognize that insurers are 19 subject to intense governmental scrutiny of their 20 business practices. State insurance departments review 21 and approve policy forms. They perform market conduct 22 examinations, they investigate consumer complaints. They 23 also regulate the form and substance of information 24 disclosures to consumers. They regulate insurers' 25167 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025investment practices. They also regulate the 1 discontinuance and replacement of insurance policies and 2 even claims payment practices. 3 Further, McCarran-Ferguson notwithstanding, all 4 insurers must be subject to antitrust laws, not only 5 state antitrust laws and rate regulation, and a lot of 6 other requirements that are enforced by state's attorneys 7 general and insurance regulators, but even then, insurers 8 are not free from all aspects of federal antitrust laws 9 and, in particular, they continue to be subject to 10 federal prohibitions against anti-competitive practices, 11 such as price fixing, bid rigging, market allocation or 12 boycotting. 13 On the other side of the equation, I believe 14 it's fair to say that physicians and providers currently 15 have significant market power and plenty of opportunities 16 to legally negotiate with health plans through group 17 practices, IPAs, the use of the messenger model or by 18 creating qualified risk sharing or clinically integrated 19 joint arrangements. 20 In addition, employers have expressed a desire 21 for less restricted managed care plan designs and access 22 to large provider networks. All of this puts physicians 23 and hospitals and other providers in a position of power 24 in negotiations with health insurance plans because these 25168 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025plans need to contract with large numbers of physicians 1 or with specific physicians and hospitals in order to 2 satisfy customer demands. 3 Finally, Paul Ginsburg from the Center for 4 Studying Health System Change recently testified that one 5 of the factors contributing to the increase in the cost 6 of health insurance is increased consolidation of 7 hospitals and the subsequent increase in their bargaining 8 clout with insurers. 9 In the remaining couple of minutes allotted to 10 me, I'd like to now turn to two areas, two issues. The 11 first one has to do with information exchange activities 12 that are being sponsored by various physician 13 organizations. What I'm talking about is exchanges that 14 include the collection and dissemination of actual 15 reimbursements for specific procedures paid to physicians 16 by named insurers. Both the Department of Justice and 17 the Federal Trade Commission have recently reviewed 18 proposals for such information exchanges and concluded 19 that they fall within one of the safety zones in the 20 statements of antitrust enforcement policy. 21 However, we find it hard to comprehend how such 22 information can be utilized in a truly pro-competitive 23 manner. In fact, one of the sponsoring organizations 24 that recently received approval for such information 25169 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025exchange has described its activities as a \"public 1 relations campaign to educate the general public about 2 the policies and procedures, including depressed 3 reimbursement by third party payers in Dayton.\" 4 We think that the recent decisions depart from 5 previous federal actions. For example, a 1985 FTC 6 advisory opinion states, \"A danger in the dissemination 7 of average price information to physicians who currently 8 charge varying prices and may provide services of varying 9 levels of quality can be that the state average may, 10 through tacit or express agreement, serve as a focal 11 point for artificial price conformity.\" 12 Suffice it to say that HIAA is concerned that 13 the new, more permissive attitude could dramatically 14 increase the number of such informational exchanges. The 15 result could be price inflation, price fixing as 16 physicians compare rates from one city to the next, 17 looking for the highest rates paid by any named insurer. 18 We recommend that both the Department and the 19 FTC reevaluate their recent decisions. At the very 20 least, we believe that they should evaluate the potential 21 anti-competitive effects of allowing physician 22 organizations to disclose payer specific reimbursement 23 data. As many of you know, in terms of collecting data 24 from the physicians, they don't release physician- 25170 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025specific information and it has to be aggregated. On the 1 other hand, the current information exchange proposals 2 will disclose specific insurer payments and not be 3 aggregated in the same way. 4 The last issue I'd like to touch on is one that 5 I addressed when I appeared at a workshop sponsored by 6 the FTC last fall, and I'm referring to the MedSouth 7 decision, which last February there was an FTC advisory 8 opinion that broke new ground by advising MedSouth, a 9 Denver area IPA, that its proposed clinically integrated 10 joint arrangement would be sufficient to allow 11 participating physicians to collectively bargain for 12 fees. 13 During last fall's workshop, I discussed in 14 great detail HIAA's concerns and I won't repeat all of 15 that, but we remain uncertain at this point about how the 16 Commission plans to monitor MedSouth's operations in 17 order to ensure that it will function as proposed and not 18 violate antitrust law. 19 In that regard, I think there are three 20 challenges the Commission will face: Determining what 21 kind of clinical efficiencies have actually taken place; 22 understanding whether the reasons for any price increases 23 in that format and whether those price increases are 24 driven by some kind of an increase in quality or value or 25171 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025simply due to anti-competitive practices; and lastly, 1 determining whether that network remains truly non- 2 exclusive. 3 Morever, by issuing the MedSouth opinion, the 4 FTC staff has basically provided a road map to any other 5 physician organization to basically replicate the same 6 approach and arguably then allow them to collectively 7 negotiate on the basis of fees. 8 We are really concerned about this. We're not 9 sure the FTC has the resources it would need to monitor 10 what is going on, and we really don't think that simply 11 relying on complaints from the field will be adequate to 12 protect the public. 13 In closing, let me say that, again, we 14 appreciate the opportunity to participate in this 15 workshop and we look forward to continuing to work with 16 both the FTC and the Department of Justice, as well as 17 the other stakeholders to ensure that we have a 18 competitive marketplace. Thank you very much. 19 (Applause.) 20 MR. BRENNAN: Thank you. Dr. Doran? 21 DR. DORAN: Good afternoon, everybody. Thank 22 you. The American Academy of Pediatrics is pleased to be 23 able to present its testimony today. I am Tim Doran, as 24 mentioned, a practicing pediatrician and Chairman of the 25172 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Department of Pediatrics at the Greater Baltimore Medical 1 Center in Baltimore. 2 The American Academy of Pediatrics is an 3 organization of 57,000 primary care pediatricians, 4 pediatric medical subspecialists, pediatric surgical 5 specialists dedicated to the health, safety and well- 6 being of infants, children, adolescents and young adults. 7 Today, I speak to you both as a representative of the 8 AAP, but also as a solo pediatrician. 9 In my comments today, I will first describe the 10 health care marketplace for children and then describe 11 market distortions that impact access to care and the 12 ability for pediatricians to provide quality care to 13 children. 14 There are three health insurance markets for 15 children: The commercial market; the public market; and 16 the uninsured. In 2001, 57 million children and young 17 adults through age 21 were insured in the commercial or 18 private market. The public market, primarily Medicaid 19 and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, 20 covered another 18.8 million children, playing a vital 21 role as a health care safety net. Medicaid is, in fact, 22 the largest single insurer of children and while over 50 23 percent of Medicaid enrollees are children, they account 24 for only 22.9 percent of Medicaid spending. 25173 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Finally, 12.5 million children and young adults 1 are estimated to be uninsured and must seek their health 2 care through public health clinics, emergency rooms and 3 other providers of charity or low cost care. 4 Pediatricians play a crucial role in providing 5 health care to children. Pediatricians provide nearly 70 6 percent of children's visits to primary care physicians. 7 Theoretically, pediatricians may have the flexibility to 8 set fees they charge, and I'm glad to know I have all 9 this market power that I didn't know about, but as a 10 practical matter, this often has little or no 11 correspondence to the payment they actually receive. 12 Because of their small size, the vast majority of 13 physician groups do not have the leverage, certainly from 14 my perspective, to negotiate with health plans, and I 15 have been in a large consortium with a few pediatricians 16 and other physicians, multi-specialty physicians before 17 my current job now as a private pediatrician. 18 They're expected to sign contracts as-is. 19 Pediatricians may not always be allowed to see fee 20 schedules before signing contracts. Equally troubling, 21 health plans' coding and bundling practices are usually 22 not made available. In some cases, contract language 23 eliminates a physician's right to appeal such decisions. 24 In others, health plans reserve the right to change the 25174 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025fee schedule. 1 My personal experience is that one insurer 2 provided excellent reimbursement initially then 3 dramatically lowered reimbursement rates after my 4 practice accepted large numbers of their members. A 5 classic bait and switch. 6 Mr. Greaney's comments I appreciated about the 7 sumo wrestlers, but I almost feel like it's the sumo 8 wrestler against the 110-pound weakling, again, from our 9 perspective. 10 Another factor that undermines a pediatrician's 11 ability to negotiate is the very limited information 12 available on the provision of health care for children. 13 Access to information drives allocation of resources, 14 promotes innovation and invention and brings parity to 15 those at the negotiating table. You've heard these 16 themes. 17 While health plans are free to make decisions 18 about coverage and reimbursement, the Medicare Resource 19 Based Relative Value Scale, RBRVS, Fee Schedule, in fact, 20 serves as the national standard. Yet, children are often 21 inadvertently left out of this system since it is 22 primarily Medicare driven. Medicare payment policies 23 mandated by CMS have a significant impact on Medicaid and 24 its reimbursement policies. A new forum has to be 25175 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025developed to discuss key Medicaid payment and operational 1 issues and to advise CMS and Congress on physician coding 2 and payment policies related to state Medicaid programs, 3 especially for children. 4 A quick example of the misfit in fee schedule 5 is the immunization administration fees. I spend 6 literally hours of time explaining to anxious mothers the 7 lack of scientific evidence, for instance, linking MMR 8 and autism. I'm sure you've heard of this. Yet, my 9 administration fee for childhood vaccines is exactly the 10 same as an adult who walks in and receives a flu shot 11 from the nurse in the office. So, there are clear 12 inequities in that kind of a situation. 13 At a time when many pediatricians are unable to 14 negotiate appropriate reimbursement, they're also 15 experiencing factors that increase the cost of providing 16 care, rising medical malpractice premiums, rising costs 17 associated with regulatory compliance. In recent years, 18 physicians have also come under greater scrutiny for 19 fraud and abuse and are anxious about that, yet 20 physicians who are audited for fraud are audited for 21 fraud in an environment where there are no clear 22 guidelines. 23 The up-coding issue that was mentioned before 24 is an issue for me every day. I see children and it's 25176 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025unclear. They could be coded in two different ways and I 1 have that fear in the back of my mind, am I up-coding or 2 is this the appropriate code. There is not really -- 3 there are lots of gray areas in the coding situation. 4 Pediatricians also have a limited ability to 5 leave a market because they're committed to their 6 patients. I'm sure as many of you who have children in 7 this room know, they're very close ties with your 8 pediatricians and the ability to just leave those 9 patients to go elsewhere is difficult for most 10 pediatricians. 11 Medicaid reimbursement rates are, on average, 12 about 64 percent of Medicare rates nationally for the 13 same codes. Yet, more than half of pediatricians accept 14 all Medicaid patients who contract their practices. 15 All of these factors make it difficult to 16 provide high quality care to children. There are a 17 number of things that the AAP recommends to begin to 18 rebalance the relationship between health plans, 19 pediatricians and our children. 20 First, the continued consolidation of the 21 health insurance market poses a risk in our minds. We 22 urge the FTC and the DOJ to bring greater scrutiny to the 23 health insurance industry and its contracting practices. 24 Second, the Academy calls for legislation that 25177 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025would allow physicians to negotiate, as mentioned 1 earlier, on a level playing field with health plans. We 2 ask for the FTC and DOJ to provide clearer guidance on 3 what is currently allowed and to take a leadership role 4 in helping to initiate such discussions between health 5 plans and physician groups. 6 Third, the Academy supports medical liability 7 insurance reform. The professional liability coverage 8 marketplace is undergoing significant stress and strain. 9 Without reform, the increased costs of professional 10 liability insurance will result in increased costs of 11 health care. 12 Fourth, the Academy supports the creation of a 13 national Medicaid database to ensure pediatricians have 14 parity in transaction costs and choice of contractual 15 arrangements. 16 Fifth, the Academy also supports the creation 17 of a national Medicaid payment authority or advisory 18 commission to address the many physician payment issues 19 related to the Medicaid program. 20 Sixth, the Academy is deeply committed to 21 protecting the 18.8 million children who receive health 22 care through Medicaid and SCHIP. Efforts to strengthen 23 these programs through enhanced funding and simplified 24 and continuous enrollment policies will remedy much of 25178 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the problem of un-insurance and under-insurance in 1 children. 2 Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. 3 The American Academy of Pediatrics stands ready to assist 4 you as you're examining these issues in more detail as 5 you go forward. Thank you. 6 (Applause.) 7 MR. BRENNAN: Dr. Opelka? 8 DR. OPELKA: Good afternoon. I appreciate the 9 opportunity to address you today. I am a physician and 10 it is my mission to deliver, what I believe, is the 11 highest quality of health care to every patient. As a 12 surgeon, I'm dedicated to the ethical practice of 13 surgery. The single most important aspect of my practice 14 is my interaction with my patients. I'm Frank Opelka, as 15 you've been told, Vice Chief of Surgery at the Beth- 16 Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. 17 I speak to you today from my own experience as 18 a physician and on behalf of the American College of 19 Surgeons, an organization founded to raise the standards 20 of surgical practice and to improve care for the surgical 21 patients. With more than 64,000 members, the College is 22 the largest organization of surgeons in the world. 23 Our commitment to our patients is unwavering. 24 We believe that the commitment reaches far beyond the 25179 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025operating room. As a surgeon, I must always place the 1 needs of my patient before my own. If nothing more, I am 2 first and foremost an advocate for the health and the 3 welfare of my patients. 4 The College commends the Federal Trade 5 Commission and the Department of Justice for undertaking 6 these hearings. Health care is an evolving market, a 7 complex market. If consumers are to realize the maximum 8 potential for the delivery and financing of health care 9 services, we must all look to the competitiveness of our 10 actions. 11 To that end, let me begin by stressing the 12 importance of competition in the health care system. 13 Competition is the driving force that can lead to 14 innovation, quality improvement and improved access to 15 health care. It will forever play an important role in 16 ensuring free markets. 17 My comment today will focus on a number of 18 issues important to surgeons and the effects of current 19 antitrust laws and enforcement policies on physicians 20 and, importantly, on patients. Of greatest concern is 21 the unyielding power of health insurance, including 22 health plans. 23 In many parts of the country, a small number of 24 companies with significant market power dominate the 25180 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025health insurance market without sufficient leverage. 1 Insurers offer surgeons take-it-or-leave-it medical 2 services agreements. Insurance companies set policies 3 and prices for surgical care with little or no direct 4 relationship to the actual cost for providing that 5 service. In an increasing number of markets, physicians 6 find themselves with little left on the table to 7 negotiate. Yes, insurance plans are widely credited with 8 stabilizing the growth rate of health care expenditures, 9 but at what cost? 10 The primary objective of insurance is not the 11 provision of health care of the highest quality, but the 12 pursuit of profits. As a physician, I am forced to 13 accept lower fees with no relationship to that cost of 14 service. I've waded through stacks of paperwork and 15 managed countless administrative burdens. Frankly, as an 16 individual physician, I feel powerless. I, alone, lack 17 the bargaining power to compel change for the good of the 18 care delivered to my patients. 19 Cost shifting was once the remedy to ensure a 20 stable practice, but this no longer a solution for 21 surgeons. Rising practice expenses, as a result of the 22 medical liability premiums and the regulatory burdens, 23 are too great. We must provide services in a fiscally 24 viable manner. With underpayment, sometimes this results 25181 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025in a decrease in the number and the type of services we 1 can provide. This results in insurers essentially 2 rationing care. 3 For our discussion today, I pose the following 4 questions. First, as discussed previously, we have seen 5 unprecedented consolidation in the health insurance 6 industry over the past decade. According to the SEC 7 filings, the 10 largest health insurers account for 8 almost 50 percent of commercial enrollees. That provides 9 coverage to more than 88.8 million Americans. Have these 10 mergers yielded sufficient market efficiencies? 11 Second, physicians have been left with little, 12 if any, ability to negotiate with insurers. The 13 resulting decrease in fees have made it difficult in many 14 areas to find recruits for new physicians. 15 Simultaneously, older doctors are choosing to retire 16 early in lieu of accepting shrinking fees with rising 17 costs, all of this while the patient demand is 18 increasing. Now, certain markets have fewer specialists, 19 like surgeons, to serve these increased patient demands. 20 Is this a market imperfection? 21 Third, unlike all other actors in the health 22 care marketplace, insurance companies may agree amongst 23 themselves to raise prices and to restrict coverage. In 24 fact, they may engage in a host of anti-competitive 25182 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025activities. In times of economic prosperity, competition 1 works to keep them from vying for greater market share. 2 But in economic downturn, they may collectively raise 3 prices without fear of prosecution due to the protections 4 embodied within the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which harkens 5 back to an era when insurers had less power. 6 Next, physicians remain skeptical of managed 7 care payment policies. Questioning all product clauses, 8 undisclosed fee schedules, unilateral amendments by 9 payers and delayed payments. The insurer has no 10 incentive to meet its contractual obligations with prompt 11 payment in a timely manner. 12 Insurer pre-certification for surgical services 13 does not ensure payment for services rendered. Often, 14 the company may deny a claim, even after the procedure 15 was pre-certified. Are these practices abusive? 16 As a result of the health insurers' increased 17 market power, physicians continue to see greater 18 encroachment into the doctor/patient relationship. Most 19 notably, the restrictive definitions of medical 20 necessity. Aren't doctors, not health plans, best suited 21 to determine the quality of care on an individual basis? 22 Surgery appreciates innovative new care 23 opportunities for our patients. Insurers, however, are 24 not quick to cover these new services, acting as a 25183 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025gatekeeper to improved quality. Even after insurers 1 cover these innovations, there is no reasonable 2 consideration to cost structure or reimbursement 3 frequently prohibiting the urgent implementation. And 4 isn't it the patient who suffers most from the slow 5 acceptance of innovations? Does a market imperfection 6 exist where patients cannot obtain the best care 7 available at any cost? 8 Even as physicians attempt to stabilize their 9 footing in the marketplace by forming physician 10 organizations, insufficient guidance exists during a 11 period of increased enforcement actions. There remains 12 substantial confusion about what constitutes sufficient 13 clinical integration for a fee-for-service network to 14 quality for rule of reason analysis. 15 The greater subjectivity implicit in the 16 analysis of quality and clinical integration rendered 17 definition of this alternative safety zone as 18 unnecessarily vague. After MedSouth, what constitutes 19 sufficient integration? 20 With the emergence of physician-owned specialty 21 hospitals, some general hospitals have been denying 22 privileges to those who participate in these ventures, 23 particularly in geographic areas where there has been 24 significant consolidation of hospital ownership. Does 25184 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the refusal to deal with physicians participating in 1 these ventures raise antitrust concerns? 2 Let me conclude by telling you that the College 3 of Surgeons was pleased to read the advisory opinion 4 issued early this month to PriMed Physicians. As I noted 5 earlier, advocacy is an important part of my 6 responsibility as a physician. The College believes the 7 surgeon's role includes informing patients, other 8 physicians, employers, and payers about the operation of 9 the health care market. 10 Most importantly, we believe that this can be 11 accomplished without injury to competition. We are glad 12 that the FTC agrees. 13 I thank you for the opportunity to participate 14 in the roundtable concerning health care competition and 15 law policy. I look forward to participating. 16 (Applause.) 17 MR. BRENNAN: Thank you. Mr. Sfikas? 18 MR. SFIKAS: The American Dental Association 19 would also like to thank the Federal Trade Commission and 20 the Justice Department for this invitation. You know, 21 when I leave Chicago in February, I seldom go to a place 22 that has worse weather than Chicago. That's not the case 23 today. So, I may be leaving a little early so that I can 24 catch an airplane and go back to Chicago. 25185 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025I'm going to talk about three things. I'm 1 going to talk about applying the competition law to the 2 dental profession, some concerns that we have about 3 quality and also concerns that we have regarding the 4 insurance market. There are difficulties that 5 competition law presents, particularly in the 6 professional context, such as, for example, applying the 7 antitrust laws to professional ethics codes. The pro- 8 competition role of professional ethics codes is 9 especially true for professional advertising. 10 Consumers frequently lack information to 11 adequately evaluate professional services and there is 12 little standardization of these services. The layperson 13 cannot readily evaluate the competence of a dentist, 14 doctor or other health care professional's advertising. 15 Advertising by professionals poses special risks of 16 deception. Thus, professional deception is a proper 17 subject of an ethical code. Indeed, the Supreme Court, 18 in one of its landmark cases, Bates vs. State Bar of 19 Arizona, noted that professional associations have a 20 special role to play in ensuring that professional 21 advertising flows both freely and cleanly. 22 In the same case, the Supreme Court stated that 23 advertising claims as to quality of services are not 24 susceptible of measurement or verification. Accordingly, 25186 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025such claims may be likely to be misleading and, 1 therefore, warrant restrictions. 2 A dental association's ethical codes, which 3 preclude false and deceptive advertising, are pro- 4 competitive because they prevent deceptive advertising. 5 In the competitive context, eliminating non-truthful 6 advertising reduces transaction costs. In the dental 7 profession, ethics codes are enforced by the local and/or 8 state dental associations with the right of appeal to the 9 American Dental Association. 10 However, the prolonged involvement of the 11 Federal Trade Commission in filing complaints against 12 health care associations involving advertising has 13 completely discouraged the state and local dental 14 associations from policing false and misleading 15 advertising in the dental profession. The fear is that 16 if the FTC were to file a complaint, the state dental 17 association or local association might have to litigate 18 this case before the ALJ, in front of the full commission 19 and one of the Courts of Appeals and ultimately in the 20 United States Supreme Court. Although one of the state 21 dental associations was successful in pursuing that 22 route, the other dental associations still stand back and 23 determine that if they were to have to face that same 24 sort of litigation with the federal government, the costs 25187 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025would be overwhelming. 1 So, at the present time, most false and 2 misleading advertising dealing with dentists is going 3 completely unregulated. The states do not have the 4 resources with which to police false and misleading 5 advertising, so that we would request that the FTC either 6 make it abundantly clear that false and misleading 7 advertising can be prosecuted by the state dental 8 associations, or alternatively take a case itself, one 9 involving false and deceptive advertising, involving a 10 dentist and prosecute that case. 11 On the subject of quality, the dental 12 profession has grave concerns with reference to the FTC 13 determining antitrust cases which require quality 14 judgments. The dental profession has no problem in 15 applying the antitrust laws to the business side of the 16 profession, but when it comes to quality, the dental 17 profession believes that it is the dentists who 18 understand quality and not the Federal Trade Commission. 19 Finally, the dental association is also 20 troubled by the concentration in the insurance industry. 21 The profession believes that -- we've heard this already 22 and I'll repeat it, that there is not a level playing 23 field with the insurance companies when it comes to 24 enforcing the antitrust laws. There are certain markets 25188 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025in the United States where it appears that certain 1 insurers have monopsony power. To avoid the 2 professionals from undertaking self help, which is 3 something we in the profession would discourage, would 4 not like, and I'm sure that the FTC and the Justice 5 Department would not tolerate that either. 6 In any event, we would encourage the Federal 7 Trade Commission and the Justice Department to scrutinize 8 the insurance market because of the concerns that we have 9 over monopsony power in certain markets in the United 10 States. Again, thank you very much for this invitation. 11 (Applause.) 12 MR. BRENNAN: Thank you. Next is Ms. Carson- 13 Smith. 14 MS. CARSON-SMITH: Good afternoon. I'm 15 Winifred Carson-Smith and I am Nurse Practice Counsel for 16 the American Nurses Association, and I am here 17 representing them and I want to, first of all, thank you 18 for the opportunity to testify today. 19 ANA represents the interests of the nation's 20 2.7 million registered nurses throughout 54 constituent 21 member state and territorial associations and over 22 150,000 members. ANA also has 13 nursing organizational 23 affiliates, collectively representing another several 24 hundred thousand additional nurses. On behalf of these 25189 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025nurses and specifically advanced practice registered 1 nurses, APRNs, I am presenting this testimony. 2 I would like for you to keep in mind that the 3 people I represent, the nurses I represent, the 4 individuals I represent are scared to come forward and 5 testify. In many instances, the individual nurse 6 practitioner faces certain challenges in the marketplace 7 that compel him or her not to come forward and testify 8 because they fear having employment and those are the 9 people that my association authorized me to represent 10 today. 11 Evolving over 35 years ago, the category of 12 practitioners that I am discussing includes nurse 13 practitioners, nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists and 14 clinical nurse specialists who have been prepared at the 15 Master's level to provide various levels of primary and 16 specialized care. In lieu of making references to all 17 these sub-categories every time I speak of them, I will 18 refer to them with the terms APRN or nurse practitioner, 19 NP. 20 Those who envisioned this role 35 years ago 21 envisioned the evolution of a clinician who would work 22 independently or in collaboration with physicians and 23 other providers. Early definitions characterized NP 24 roles as providing primary care in a variety of settings. 25190 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025Early on, many NPs were denied hospital nursing 1 privileges and the evolution of the nursing role was not 2 consistently welcomed within nursing. Since that 3 development, NPs have sought recognition both inside and 4 outside of nursing. However, the definition and scope of 5 NP practice has evolved with more independent clinical 6 decision making. 7 Think now of a new paradigm, one where nurses 8 or nurse practitioners could enter an equitable market in 9 all aspects, a market where they could actually compete. 10 What would health care be like? What would the costing 11 and valuation of health care be like? We constantly 12 question that and we have considerations, and that is why 13 we push for change. 14 Does this market exist? No, it does not. We 15 want to change that market and we need doing so. Nurse 16 practitioners or APRNs are looked upon very highly and 17 very favorably by docs when they're employees, but when 18 they attempt to be independent practitioners, that's when 19 the rubber hits the road and the competition truly 20 begins, and it begins in such a fashion that we're 21 working in an inequitable marketplace. 22 With statutory and licensure recognition of 23 nurse practitioner practice, many in nursing believe that 24 the new profession would gain acceptance and the ability 25191 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025to practice as primary care providers. Today, all states 1 recognize nurse practitioners through legislation or 2 regulation and all but 50 states have authorized nurse 3 practitioners to prescribe. Thirteen states allow nurse 4 practitioners to prescribe controlled substances without 5 physician involvement. An additional 32 states allow 6 nurse practitioners to prescribe controlled substances 7 with physician involvement. At least 12 states recognize 8 nurses as primary care providers for their public 9 programs and another 12 states have anti-discrimination 10 laws to protect nurse practitioner practice and mandate 11 non-discrimination in privileging and credentialing. 12 With all these protections then, why is it such 13 a problem for an advanced practice nurse to practice 14 independently or alternatively bill independently? 15 Concern about the perceptions of physicians, 16 the nursing community, when creating the nurse 17 practitioner role debated potential structures for 18 advanced practice legislation and decided to advocate for 19 a structure that would statutorily mandate collaborative 20 practice. As most health care providers know, 21 collaborative practice is expected and anticipated 22 because when you provide health care, you provide it as a 23 team member. However, the nurse practitioners took the 24 usual step to get their role acknowledged, of mandating 25192 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025it within statute. 1 Unfortunately, docs jumped on this and turned 2 it around. In lieu of us having a role where we actually 3 collaborate, there was a use of this term to create 4 mandated supervision, practice agreements or other 5 impediments to practice. In short, it was used as an 6 effort to control the collaborative process and to 7 mandate employment of nurse practitioners. 8 The catch-22 between mandated legislative 9 collaboration and physician support has created an 10 infrastructure which makes independent practice for APRNs 11 extremely cumbersome and economically unfeasible. 12 Nurses can and initially could -- nurse 13 practitioners could practice independently without 14 physician supervision in economically under-served areas. 15 However, in urban areas, they must be supervised or in 16 collaborative relationships, and we believe that that is 17 a market imperfection. 18 Other laws have been structured to counteract 19 the provision of nursing licensure laws. A classic 20 example of changes in law designed to undermine the 21 ability of nurses to practice independently have been 22 provisions added into medical licensure laws to limit the 23 number of arrangements between nurses and physicians. 24 For example, a physician cannot collaborate with any more 25193 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025than four nurses under certain laws, and if he or she 1 chooses to collaborate with more, than that physician is 2 disciplined. 3 Also, provisions have been added to medical 4 practice acts to discipline physicians for failure to 5 properly supervise APRNs and provisions have been added 6 to medical and nursing practice acts to create advisory 7 boards or committees to oversee advanced practice 8 regulation. 9 I, personally, in my 12 years of working with 10 the American Nurses Associations, have seen five 11 instances where the multi-disciplinary boards have been 12 used to limit or impede prescriptive authority or to 13 limit or impede the rules that are developed related to 14 collaboration. 15 Some laws have been enacted to promote 16 alternative arrangements to increase the market strength 17 of physicians. Physician collective bargaining bills 18 fall into that category. The ANA has worked with states 19 to oppose this legislation in part because allowing 20 physicians to collective bargain typically minimizes the 21 ability of nurse practitioners and advance practice 22 nurses to obtain arrangements to practice independently. 23 Also, with physician collective bargaining, 24 APRNs are usually blocked out of the collective 25194 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025bargaining group and have no protections against the 1 activities of the larger physician-dominated unit. This 2 legislation ultimately undermines competition between 3 nurse practitioners and physicians. Any willing 4 providers laws have been passed to equalize the market, 5 then challenged or interpreted to give disproportionate 6 power to existing market forces. 7 Originally designed to ensure that any licensed 8 health care provider authorized to provide the service 9 would be allowed to contract with managed care providers, 10 the any willing providers laws have been interpreted, 11 restructured and interpreted over again to, one, cover 12 only physician practice; two, allow the managed care 13 company to choose the provider, as to do otherwise would 14 grant inappropriate interference into business decision 15 making; or three, negate the provisions as the state laws 16 have been held to violate ERISA. 17 A case is currently before the Supreme Court to 18 address concerns created by these types of laws. That 19 case is Kentucky Association of Health Plans, and because 20 I don't want to run over my time, I'm not going to go 21 into the details of it. 22 Additionally, the environment around health 23 care reimbursement has created serious impediments to 24 NP/APRN practice. Insurance companies and the government 25195 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025use payment codes based on a medical model of care and 1 designed by non-governmental organizations who continue 2 to own and control the coding process. Such ownership 3 and control of the existing reimbursement codes by non- 4 governmental entities, combined with the widespread 5 health care infrastructure that supports such use of the 6 codes, creates an unfair disadvantage for non-physician 7 practitioners. 8 The payment and coding process is the backbone 9 of any health care organization or entity. One is paid 10 based solely on the codes. Originally, the coding was 11 designed to address physician practice only and was later 12 expanded to cover non-physician practice. Fiscal 13 intermediaries that contract with the government, review 14 and process claims and often have problems determining 15 appropriate application of reimbursement codes for NPs 16 and APRNs. Thus, the fiscal intermediary determines if 17 the skill sets of the nurse practitioners allow him or 18 her to take the proper steps related to the diagnostic 19 codes used. If the fiscal intermediary does not believe 20 the nurse is competent to work at the skill level 21 required by the code, that coding is denied. The nurse 22 must code at a lesser code for a lower reimbursement. 23 Coding challenges are cumbersome, complex and 24 time-consuming and decisions tend to favor the fiscal 25196 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025intermediary. In the past, the fiscal intermediary could 1 create an additional set of codes specific to 2 reimbursement responsibilities, which was applicable only 3 to the care process through that fiscal intermediary. In 4 doing so, inconsistencies occurred in the interpretation 5 of the primary and the extrapolated code. Nurse 6 practitioners with businesses have to gingerly address 7 the mine field of coding without comprehensive direction 8 or guidance from coding manuals or the government. 9 Although nursing codes and coding exist, one 10 often gets conflicting advice from the experts. This is 11 an important concern in the existing health care 12 environment where all health care practitioners and 13 providers fear inappropriate coding, government audit and 14 potential assessments or fines. 15 Further, with the enforcement of the HIPAA 16 regulations and the standardization of reimbursement and 17 other electronic transactions, the additional 18 intermediary specific codes that were designed to address 19 perceived deficits or inconsistencies in the 20 reimbursement codes have been eliminated. Thus, the 21 reimbursement infrastructure for nurse practitioners have 22 little uniformity. Only those who are willing to tread 23 on unknown territory, knowing that they might not get any 24 reimbursement strike out at independent practice or bill 25197 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025independently. There are some uncertainties and support 1 for uniformity and reimbursement policies in physician 2 practice. There isn't any certainly within nurse 3 practitioner/APRN practice. 4 Additionally, the process for development and 5 evaluation of codes begs for change. Nurses and other 6 non-physician providers sit on advisory committees and 7 make recommendations to a full committee of physicians. 8 However, the advisory committee does not have full 9 participation in the coding process. They have one vote 10 for all of the non-physician providers. 11 In short, the process limits the ability of 12 non-physician providers to have full participation in the 13 coding process. Again, we believe that this is a market 14 imperfection. Likewise, we believe there are 15 imperfections in the medication certification process. 16 The primary Medicare certification organization, the 17 Joint Commission, treats nurse practitioners and other 18 non-physician providers as licensed independent 19 practitioners. 20 Although nurse practitioners are allowed to 21 practice and prescribe independently in many states, this 22 group of practitioners is lumped with other practitioners 23 who are required by law and certification to practice in 24 a supervised structure. The JCAHO standards mandate 25198 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025physician review of care and treatment plans of licensed 1 independent providers and further require physician 2 supervision of complex care. This standard obviates the 3 nurse practitioner patient relationship by forcing the 4 nurse practitioner to introduce another practitioner into 5 the relationship, regardless of the need for additional 6 review or the patient's desires. It also increases the 7 cost of care. 8 The patient is required to pay for his or her 9 practitioners and the additional services of a physician. 10 Moreover, the nurse practitioner has to explain why this 11 third party is mandated to intervene in the hospital 12 setting, when such interventions may not be required 13 clinically. In short, the requirement creates a market 14 balance toward protecting the status quo, and once again, 15 we believe that is a market imperfection. 16 I could go on and on and on, but my testimony 17 has been written. It will be available hopefully 18 tomorrow. I provided you with attachments, and I'm sure 19 that some questions will arise as a result of this 20 testimony. I thank you once again for the opportunity to 21 testify. 22 (Applause.) 23 MR. BRENNAN: Thank you. Ms. Varney? 24 MS. VARNEY: Thank you. As you've heard, my 25199 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025name is Christine Varney and I'm here today representing 1 the American Hospital Association and its nearly 5,000 2 members. We're pleased to participate in the hearings. 3 Let me take a moment on my own first and 4 apologize to pediatricians worldwide. I am one of the 5 mothers who comes in with the French study translated 6 into English in alternative management of asthma, or the 7 Canadian study on prophylactic administration of 8 antibiotics before it's been published in the U.S. So, I 9 know what you're talking about and we all apologize. 10 (Laughter.) 11 MS. VARNEY: But that's part of why health care 12 today is quite different than it was five or 10 years 13 ago. I think we have, with the advent of the Internet, 14 as someone mentioned, and a new class of consumers who 15 are much more aggressive. Maybe not always so good for 16 the doctors who are trying to manage efficiently. 17 But the antitrust agencies need to understand 18 the complexity and the recent trends in both the payment 19 for and the delivery of health care services. Health 20 care is not provided or paid for in a vacuum. We need to 21 look at the financial, regulatory and community pressures 22 in the system. At the same time, we must be aware that 23 consumers, or in our world, patients, who have health 24 insurance are struggling with rising health insurance 25200 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025premiums. To understand rising health care costs, we 1 must examine not only the delivery of service, but how 2 those services are paid for, or as importantly, not 3 paid for. 4 Spending on hospital services reflects the 5 price that is paid and the quantity or volume of services 6 that are delivered. If we look at the price side, the 7 price paid by the majority of patients is fixed by the 8 government, and in many cases, the price paid is less 9 than the cost of the service delivered. For other 10 patients, the hospital may never be reimbursed for 11 services provided. 12 According to a Price Waterhouse Coopers report 13 released last week and submitted with our written 14 comments, the rise in health care spending is due 15 primarily to the provision of more health care services. 16 Since 1997, the largest source of hospital 17 spending growth has been increased volume. Simply put, 18 more services are being demanded by more patients. This 19 increase can be understood by looking at four principal 20 factors. The first is the aging of the American 21 population. As Americans grow older, they use more 22 hospital services. 23 Second, lack of access to primary care and 24 inadequate management of chronic diseases, such as asthma 25201 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025and diabetes, continue to lead to expensive emergency 1 room treatment. Every parent in this room has been in an 2 emergency room with their kids, and you know what I'm 3 talking about. 4 Third, patients are moving to less restrictive 5 managed care plans and insurers are relaxing utilization 6 controls so that now patients finally have access to more 7 services. 8 Fourth, and finally, patients are being treated 9 earlier with more aggressive and new, very expensive 10 technologies, technologies that save lives. While the 11 demand for and the provision of hospital services are 12 rising dramatically, payment is not keeping pace. 13 Together, Medicare and Medicaid account for more than 14 half of all hospital volume. Payment rates for those 15 programs are fixed. In aggregate, these payments are 16 below the cost of providing hospital care. 17 At the same time, more people are demanding 18 more hospital services. The costs of providing these 19 services are rising while payment fails to keep pace. 20 What this means is that the aggregate total margins for 21 hospitals continue to fall. Contributing to falling 22 margins is the skyrocketing growth of labor costs. In 23 the face of a severe nursing shortage and shortages of 24 pharmacists and technicians, hospital labor costs have 25202 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025risen dramatically. In order to attract and retain 1 qualified workers, hospitals increased hourly pay far 2 more than other employers. Today, wages and benefits 3 accounts for nearly 57 percent of all hospital costs. 4 As input costs go up, it is not surprising that 5 price will also rise. Other cost pressures include a 6 staggering growth in the profusion of professional 7 liability premiums, a phenomena that seems to be 8 spreading. The PWC report found that premiums increased 9 by 30 to more than 100 percent in 2002 alone. Although 10 not a new development, a persistent financial pressure 11 unique to hospitals is non-compensated care. Hospitals 12 must provide emergency care regardless of the patient's 13 ability to pay. In America today, there are 40 million 14 uninsured. 15 Judy, that was the number when we started the 16 health care reform and it went down and it's back to what 17 it was. 18 DR. FEDER: I knew it was bigger than when we 19 started. 20 MS. VARNEY: In 2001, uncompensated care 21 amounted to $21.5 billion. We believe the cost of 22 uncompensated care will continue to rise, putting more 23 pressure on hospitals. 24 As is apparent, the key drivers for growth in 25203 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025spending on hospital care are unrelated to antitrust 1 enforcement in the hospital sector. Rather, spending 2 growth is due to increased volume, increased costs and 3 the unique characteristics of hospitals. Although 4 spending on hospital care account for 32 percent of total 5 health expenditures in 2001, hospital spending is rising 6 more slowly than spending on pharmaceuticals, payer 7 overhead and profit, professional services and nursing 8 homes. The PWC report contains more in-depth data and 9 analysis on important hospital spending issues and I 10 commend it to you. 11 Hospital consolidation, we've heard a lot about 12 hospital consolidation yesterday and today and it's been 13 blamed, by several, for driving up the cost of hospital 14 care, and consequently, health care premiums. In 15 response to these allegations outlined in the Blue Cross- 16 Blue Shield Association report, we released a report 17 today that clearly demonstrates such claims are 18 unsubstantiated. The new report, authored by the 19 respected health care economist, Margaret Guerin-Calvert 20 from Competition Policy Associates, concludes that 21 hospital merger activity does not explain the increases 22 in spending for hospital services. 23 The report demonstrates that hospital 24 consolidations cannot possibly account for the increased 25204 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025spending on hospital care, but rather, such increases are 1 explained by many factors. Not surprisingly, first among 2 those factors are increased patient volume and increased 3 costs of providing care. 4 The Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association report 5 conclusions cannot be substantiated by the facts. For 6 example, the number of hospital mergers has fallen 7 steadily since 1998. In the last few years, less than 6 8 percent of hospital facilities were involved in such 9 transactions. During the same time frame, total 10 aggregate margins for hospitals declined. This trend 11 supports the findings that increased expenses and not 12 revenues have driven up hospital spending. Increased 13 spending on hospital care does not warrant a conclusion 14 that greater antitrust enforcement is required in the 15 hospital sector or that past mergers and changes in the 16 market structure have generated price increases. In 17 fact, in many cases, hospital mergers have yielded 18 significant efficiencies and savings that have helped to 19 control costs. 20 As a commissioner, I took the position that 21 antitrust agencies should expand efficiency analysis in 22 hospital mergers and that in the absence of severe 23 competitive threats, efficiencies should be presumed to 24 flow to the benefit of consumers. I never advocated that 25205 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025we should not review hospital mergers, contrary to some 1 popular belief. Although after losing seven or nine 2 cases, you begin to wonder. 3 Recent years have been marked by both dramatic 4 increases in input costs and increased pressure on most 5 hospitals to spend on plant maintenance and improvement. 6 Trends in managed care, government reimbursement and 7 uncompensated care have also been significant factors 8 affecting hospitals. As a result, many hospitals are 9 grappling with very poor to moderate financial 10 performance. These trends and related data provide 11 useful background and valuable context for evaluating the 12 hospital sector, including assessing the rationale for 13 and the potential gains from mergers and consolidations. 14 These trends do not, however, indicate that either past 15 hospital mergers or consolidation hospital markets have 16 caused price increases. 17 If the antitrust agencies are serious about 18 determining whether competition policies or antitrust 19 enforcement have a constructive role to play in 20 understanding the cost of health insurance premiums, they 21 must have a broader horizon than simply hospital 22 consolidation. The FTC announced last fall that it would 23 undertake significant economic research directed at 24 hospitals. There appears to be no similar initiative at 25206 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025either agency directed at HMOs, pharmaceuticals, medical 1 device firms, or indeed any other sector of the health 2 care economy, despite increasing levels of concentration. 3 A retrospective analysis of hospital mergers is 4 meaningless if not undertaken in the context of all the 5 changing market factors. We were heartened to hear Hew 6 Pate yesterday outline his concern regarding the payer's 7 role in rising health care costs. If the federal 8 antitrust agencies truly seek to contribute in a positive 9 way to understanding rising health care costs, we believe 10 equal time and resources need to be dedicated to all 11 sectors of health care, not just hospitals. 12 Hospitals are extremely complex organizations, 13 operating in a highly regulated environment, where supply 14 and demand are not always easily understood. The types 15 of bricks and mortars industries with which the agencies 16 are well-acquainted, such as grocery stores and car 17 dealers, simply do not provide an apt comparison for 18 analyzing hospital mergers. 19 These hearings are the opportunity for the 20 federal antitrust agencies to broaden and improve 21 government's understanding of how hospitals operate in 22 today's health care environment. Specifically, these 23 hearings provide a forum to fully examine all the factors 24 that contribute to spending on hospital care. Thank you 25207 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025very much. 1 (Applause.) 2 MR. BOTTI: Let me thank all of our panelists 3 for their prepared remarks. What Jeff and I thought we 4 would do today, if we may, is somewhat manage the 5 competition and the marketplace of ideas we have going on 6 here today. What we'd like to do is take a topic and one 7 of us ask a few questions to a few of you and move 8 through it that way rather than just have a free-for-all. 9 One thing that's coming up again and again this 10 morning, this afternoon, in other conversations, is the 11 question of whether payers are exercising some form of 12 monopsony power due to increased concentration or some 13 other factors. What I'd like to do is maybe start off 14 with Dr. Opelka, if I can, because I think you expressed 15 some concern over this concentration and how it's 16 affecting surgeons, and ask you to expand on your 17 experience. 18 Is it your view that we're seeing a reduction 19 in the number of surgeons, the quality of surgical care 20 due to the exercise of monopsony power? If I can, just 21 to sharpen the question a little bit, should we not let 22 payers negotiate for better rates? Is that always 23 monopsony power? 24 DR. OPELKA: Okay. Are we seeing a reduction 25208 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025in the number of surgeons to meet the demand? You might 1 see more surgeons come out of the barn, but if you look 2 at the patients' demand, the patients' demand is 3 increasing. So, the way you might best measure whether 4 we're meeting the demand is what's happening in the wait 5 time, the time to get an appointment in the surgeon's 6 office. It's not just a simple game of numbers. That's 7 one. 8 And you may see that the wait times, in my 9 practice, have gone from four weeks, which I find rather 10 acceptable, to I'm now approaching three months. And to 11 get someone in that office who's got an urgent issue 12 means somebody's got a back door phone call and I've got 13 to make arrangements to squeeze someone in between an 14 operation or around lunch or some other example, just 15 because the demand of the patients is increasing and the 16 amount that they need, the time they need, the 17 sophistication of the market that's coming in demands a 18 lot more from a surgeon. It's becoming increasingly more 19 difficult to meet that. 20 Secondly, you can look at what we termed the 21 match, the number of people applying for residencies and 22 how many of those places are filled. Even though there 23 is demand for these services, the fact is that the 24 medical students who see the rewards of the profession 25209 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025diminishing and the work that's required and demanded of 1 them increasing, they're moving away from surgery. 2 They're floating off to something else saying, it just 3 isn't worth this. The burden that's been put on me by 4 the payers, the burden that's been put on me by the 5 government to meet regulatory issues, they look and see 6 the life of a surgeon who's sitting there at a 12-hour 7 day and he's still got a long list of callbacks to try 8 and manage, that's an issue. 9 In terms of the quality of the surgeon that's 10 out there, I think that's only improved, and it's 11 improved for a lot of reasons. The educational tools, 12 the teaching of surgeons has improved, the technology has 13 improved, the medications have improved. A lot of the 14 integration and care and the IT technology has improved. 15 So, those are all good things. 16 The down-side is that we work closely -- 17 surgeons can't live without a hospital. We work closely 18 with that hospital, and if we don't have coverage, 19 nursing coverage, if we don't have the ability to get 20 into an operating room, if the latest technology has come 21 out there or the latest device has come out there or the 22 latest pharmaceutical has come out there, but it is so 23 prohibitively expensive that we can't carve it out with 24 the insurance company to get this thing taken care of, 25210 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025that patient can't be offered that service. We can't get 1 into that market. 2 So, the hospital has to pick and choose which 3 loss leaders they can tolerate to actually accommodate 4 their business. We're in the business of taking care of 5 patients and we're going to do whatever we can to survive 6 to take care of those patients. If I took all the loss 7 leaders on in that hospital and I drove that hospital 8 into the ground, I lose, the hospital loses, and worst of 9 all, I've got no place for those patients. 10 When we bring that to an insurer's attention, 11 you're met with very courteous, appropriate, we're more 12 than willing to discuss this, and sometime within the 13 next five years, doggone it, we'll get to the bottom of 14 this. That's way too late. That's unacceptable, and 15 that's the situation that the surgeons feel today. 16 MR. BOTTI: Thank you. Dr. Desmarais, let me 17 ask you if you would pick up on this topic, because 18 obviously the focus of a lot of these discussions is on 19 health plans and their bargaining, aggressive or not, to 20 control medical costs. How do you view our task in 21 distinguishing between monopsony power or what might be 22 legitimate bargaining? 23 DR. DESMARAIS: Well, first, let me start by 24 saying that it wasn't all that long ago that I was 25211 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025employed by the American College of Surgeons and got to 1 work with Dr. Opelka quite closely, and I have a great 2 deal of respect for him. But obviously my current 3 employer is the Health Insurance Association of America, 4 so let me try to look at that. 5 First, the whole premise about monopsony 6 implies that we're not paying enough. And yet when our 7 member companies are meeting with their customers -- the 8 employers and the individuals who buy their own policies 9 -- very few of them are saying the costs are too low. 10 And, in fact, as we know, the Census Bureau tells us that 11 there is a falloff in the amount of private insurance 12 coverage today, and in particular in the small employer 13 community. 14 So I guess, you know, if we talk about 15 monopsony, the implication is the end result here is 16 we're going to have to pay more than we're paying now. 17 And if that's the case, then all other things being equal 18 -- and perhaps they aren't. But all other things being 19 equal, we're going to see rising -- continued rising 20 costs. And so that's not a free lunch. In other words, 21 there is a lot of implications here for society. 22 I also think in terms of monopsony it is very 23 difficult -- I mean, if you go back historically, if you 24 talk about, you know, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans 25212 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025and the percentage of the private market they have had 1 historically, I'm not sure what we're looking at today is 2 all that different. And quite frankly, when people talk 3 about mergers and acquisitions in the insurance industry, 4 they tend to want to mix everything up as if it is all 5 the same. If one of my member companies, Well Point, 6 wants to acquire Care First here in the Maryland suburbs, 7 that's controversial, yes, I know. But that mere 8 acquisition doesn't consolidate the market power of that 9 company in Maryland necessarily. 10 So I think there are a lot of things going on 11 in the marketplace. We also should remember when we talk 12 about profitability, well, a lot of people are in self 13 insured plans. Profit is not relevant. So when the GE 14 is having the problems it is having, it is not as a 15 result of the profitability of the industry. So there is 16 a lot going on here, and I think it -- and a lot of the 17 things that we have talked about have nothing to do with 18 the private sector directly, because we're talking about 19 Medicare and Medicaid. 20 And quite frankly, our member companies are 21 concerned about cost shifting, in that the public payers 22 are not paying the cost of the care for their recipients 23 and beneficiaries, and as a result it just tends to add 24 more pressure on the remainder of the marketplace to try 25213 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025to \"make up the difference,\" which quite frankly, they're 1 less and less willing to do as certainly compared to 2 where we were, say, 10 or 15 or 20 years ago. I think 3 every buyer, every employer, wants to only pay the cost 4 of caring for their own workforce and dependents and not 5 anybody else. 6 So I think there are a lot of problems. Let me 7 stop there, because I could go on and on. 8 MR. BOTTI: Okay, thank you. I'll ask one more 9 question. And, Ms. Varney, I want to follow up with you 10 on this topic, because a lot of the discussion has 11 focused on, I think, physicians and health plans and the 12 question of whether monopsony power is being exercised 13 against physicians. And yet, I guess to me, if health 14 plans have this type of monopsony power, why would we be 15 hearing about increased costs of hospital care? Even if 16 justified by their input, increased demand for hospital 17 services? Why aren't they exercising the monopsony power 18 against hospitals, I guess is what I'm asking. 19 MS. VARNEY: Well, I think that what you heard 20 about it -- I mean, you know, I'm really glad that you 21 had our two framers, because I think you have to remember 22 the overall context that we're working in here, where 23 we've gotten an extremely complex situation that has 24 political drivers. It has ideological drivers. It has 25214 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025market drivers and failure of market drivers. So, you 1 know, if you put that on top, hospitals are obviously a 2 key part of the equation, and they are subject to a lot 3 of the same pressures that insurers, doctors and nurses 4 are subject to. 5 We've got an increasingly aging population that 6 is demanding more and more services. The services are 7 more and more expensive and more and more effective at 8 extending life. And we haven't balanced yet how we -- 9 the mechanism that we use to allocate those services are 10 insurers, whether or not they're private insurers or 11 government insurers. And what we're struggling with 12 right now, is the system breaking. There is too much 13 cost that has been pushed into the system and it hasn't 14 been allocated. And the private insurers, in my view, 15 anyway, are saying, wait a second. We can't continue to 16 support the breakdown in the system. We can't continue 17 to support what Medicare and Medicaid does not fund. 18 At the same time, there was a violent reaction 19 to the insurers being the gatekeepers. So we don't want 20 to be the gatekeepers anymore, either. So what we're 21 going to do, is we're going to open the gates slightly. 22 That's going to lead to more demand. Hospitals and 23 doctors are going to continue to try and meet the demand. 24 That's their mission. That is what they do. So when the 25215 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025hospitals are subject to all of the same market pressures 1 that you're seeing everyone else experience, what we're 2 trying to articulate to you is, look, we know spending on 3 hospital care has gone up. We can identify the discrete 4 areas that are driving the hospital's care spending going 5 up, but it's a misnomer to try and think that 6 consolidation that occurred in '90s in the hospital 7 sector is driving up hospital spending today. 8 You also have to go back and look in the '90s. 9 There was a tremendous overcapacity in the system. You 10 look at all of the hospital cases in the litigation that 11 you reviewed. I mean, you're looking at areas that had 12 four, fix, six, seven hospitals, all of whom were running 13 at 20, 30, 40 and in the best cases, 60 percent capacity. 14 So we took the excess capacity out of the system, which 15 was a good thing, but what does that do? It drives up 16 the demand on the existing capacity when you have all of 17 the other factors that are driving the demand. 18 So I guess, you know, it's a long way of 19 answering your question. Yes, we are experiencing the 20 factors that have been identified here in the room. What 21 our concern is, is that as the antitrust agencies examine 22 these issues, first of all, think about what it is that 23 competition or lack of competition contributes to and 24 what doesn't. And I think that was part of what you 25216 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025heard Judy saying, part of what you heard Tim saying, and 1 certainly your speakers this morning I think drove that 2 home very clearly. 3 When you peel that back and you look at, okay, 4 what competition -- what can and can't competition policy 5 do, yeah, there are some areas in the hospital arena 6 where I think competition policy could help us focus and 7 be a little bit sharper and perhaps provide services a 8 little bit more efficiently. But at the same time, I 9 think it's a mistake to think that consolidation in 10 hospitals is what's driving the increased costs. We see 11 monopsony power, and we're responding to it the best we 12 can. 13 MR. BOTTI: Okay, thank you. Before, Jeff, I 14 let you take us to another topic, do any of the other 15 panelists want to pick up on this one? Jeff? 16 MR. BRENNAN: Thanks. I thought I would maybe 17 switch gears a little bit, but not a whole lot. I heard 18 a few remarks this afternoon about physician collective 19 bargaining. And there were advocates and opponents, I 20 think, on the panel about that, and I would like to turn 21 to that for a second. Dr. Doran, you were -- you 22 mentioned that in your view -- I think you said that 23 physicians should have the right to bargain collectively 24 even with competitors in the market in which the 25217 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025physicians compete. 1 And as a -- in light of that view, how should 2 an antitrust agency assessing that conduct interpret the 3 conduct in light of the mission of an antitrust agency to 4 prevent consumers from paying higher prices for goods or 5 services? 6 DR. DORAN: Right. Yeah, I think that's a very 7 fair question, and the issue of whether it's collusive or 8 not is obviously central to your mission. It is just 9 experientially, as a pediatrician and as a provider, and 10 having even been in, as I said, a large multi-specialty 11 group, the power that you bring to the table as opposed 12 to what I've heard today is pretty minimal. The 13 influence and the ability to really -- even in a 14 coalition of larger groups of physicians, has not -- was 15 not really effective. 16 But to bargain alone, as a private pediatrician 17 or as a private physician or surgeon, you really have no 18 power at all. And you don't have the data, and you don't 19 have the information, and you don't have the ability to 20 look at -- physicians are scared to even talk to each 21 other. I mean, they don't know the framework. They 22 don't know the borders of what is allowable or not 23 allowable in terms of changing the format of what has 24 gone on historically. 25218 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025And the marketplace has changed dramatically. 1 I mean, it used to be you would set a fee and, you know, 2 patients would submit that to their own insurer and that 3 was sort of it. But that's -- those days are long gone, 4 and we really all work -- you know, we don't work in a -- 5 like lawyers who set their own fees and clients come in. 6 If they go to the best lawyer at Hogan & Hartson, it's 7 not going to be the same fee as when they go to a lawyer 8 on the other side of town who is not the same quality as 9 somebody at Hogan. That's not the case in medicine. 10 That's not the case for physicians at all. 11 So there are all these distortions we feel that 12 occur because there are payers and then there are 13 insurers and then there are physicians. So what's 14 driving this whole process is complicated, and it's not 15 straightforward, and it's not market-driven in a way we 16 usually think of it, and I think that physicians are at a 17 real disadvantage in those situations. 18 So that's why I raise that here. And obviously 19 on the other side of that, you can't have huge numbers of 20 physicians colluding to raise prices inordinately. So I 21 understand both sides of that issue. But right now it's 22 -- instead of, I guess, a sumo wrestler, I see the 23 hundred-pound gorilla there and it's not a pretty sight 24 when I sit down with a big large insurer as a private 25219 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025pediatrician. 1 MR. BRENNAN: If I could just ask a follow-up 2 question, and ask Mr. Sfikas to respond to the same 3 question. Following up on, I think, your final point, 4 Dr. Doran, is there any limit that you see on the number 5 of physicians in a given market that you think should 6 have an exemption from the antitrust law? And by number, 7 I mean a concentration or percentage of physicians in a 8 market. Do you think 100 percent should be able to -- 9 DR. DORAN: Well, no. Obviously, 100 percent 10 would be unacceptable. But, I mean, I would have to look 11 to staff for that in terms of what percent. I know there 12 are percentages in other fields and other businesses. 13 And I don't know -- I don't have a number for you here 14 today. 15 MR. BRENNAN: Okay. Mr. Sfikas? 16 MR. SFIKAS: True collective bargaining is not 17 applicable to dentists, because in dentistry there is a 18 very small percentage of the dentists who practice as 19 employees. To have true collective bargaining, the 20 physicians -- what, about 50 percent of the physicians 21 now are true employees? You could have collective 22 bargaining with physicians. But in dentistry, it would 23 simply be looked upon as being collusive if the 24 entrepreneurs, the owners of the businesses, tried to 25220 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025collectively bargain. So under the labor laws, it simply 1 would not be tolerated. 2 MR. BRENNAN: Ms. Carson-Smith, I know in your 3 remarks you had a view opposing physician bargaining. 4 MS. CARSON-SMITH: Yes. 5 MR. BRENNAN: And I would like you, if you 6 would, to respond to that, and then maybe we can wrap up 7 this topic with Professor Greaney. It would be helpful 8 to hear his views. 9 MS. CARSON-SMITH: None of the bills that have 10 been either passed or are being considered include nurses 11 in that entity that can collectively bargain. The 12 physicians have the option of selecting them, or any 13 other non-physician provider, to actually negotiate. And 14 that has been one of our primary concerns. Another is 15 the provisions related to market saturation. In the AMA 16 model -- and I'm sorry I didn't look at it before I left 17 the office, because I've been looking back and forth at 18 these issues over the past year. 19 The actual market saturation that is allowed of 20 collective bargaining entities -- physician collective 21 bargaining entities -- is oppressive to us. Our concern 22 is that if 60 percent of the market has collectively 23 bargained, then that other 40 percent of the physicians 24 who are out there are naturally going to be clamoring to 25221 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025get into a collective bargaining unit or they will have 1 lower rates. And what if -- you know, the if out 2 there -- someone says we don't want any nurses on the 3 panel, because in many instances, nurses are either not 4 empaneled or they have been empaneled and they are being 5 removed from panels so they cannot compete as individual 6 practitioners. 7 So it would be good for the nurse who is the 8 employee. It would be bad for the nurse who is trying to 9 practice independently. 10 MR. BRENNAN: Okay, thank you. Professor 11 Greaney, just if you could respond to the same issue. 12 And going back to your sumo wrestler analogy, from the 13 consumer's point of view, having the two sumo wrestlers 14 up there fighting it out, does that lead to benefits for 15 consumers? Or if it's a sumo wrestler and a half a sumo 16 wrestler, does that help consumers? 17 DR. GREANEY: The image is too unpleasant to 18 think about. Let me try to switch analogies here. I 19 have written about this. I think this is one of the 20 truly awful ideas to come down the pike in some time. 21 There has been a lot of writing about it in literature 22 estimating what the potential spike in costs could be of 23 the ripple effect of collective bargaining into other 24 areas. Truly enormous costs could be generated by it. 25222 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025And you know what we might be losing sight of is the fact 1 that stable or even declining wages might be a sign of a 2 well-functioning market. And some of the things we hear 3 complaints about, when we put them side by side with the 4 fact that the cost drivers -- a cost driver is labor 5 cost, because labor is such a big part of the cost 6 equation, we're not seeing physician shortages. We are 7 seeing nursing shortages, but we're not seeing physician 8 shortages. 9 And just to go back to the monopsony 10 discussion, it is hard to very clearly show monopsony, 11 precisely because sometimes an exit from the market and 12 fewer physicians means you're moving, you know, along the 13 supply curve as price declines. So I really don't see -- 14 you don't really -- you're hard pressed to find an 15 economic justification for this. 16 And just as an aside, let me mention. Just 17 last week yet another study came out the Wennberg Group 18 about the delivery of care in the United States, showing 19 vast variations in care without variations in outcome. 20 And there is a real question about whether we have the 21 mechanisms to squeeze out the unnecessary care. Not 22 every new machine is a good development. Monty Python 23 calls it the machine that goes ping. It doesn't 24 necessary mean we've made an improvement in terms of cost 25223 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025benefit. 1 And the question is, if we have no collective 2 bargaining, if we have a debilitated managed care 3 industry, who is going to exercise the pressure to get 4 rid of the machine that goes ping and make sure only the 5 machines that really add effective benefits are going to 6 be the ones that are added. 7 MR. BRENNAN: Yes? 8 DR. FEDER: I have a question. I would like to 9 add to the perspective, to broaden the perspective beyond 10 the two sumo wrestlers, or that provider sumo and the 11 insurer sumo, and bring in the perspective of consumers 12 and what they are asked to pay. And ask about the 13 implications of -- or ask about the way in which out-of- 14 plan service is handled or out-of-network service is 15 handled. Because speaking -- not based on a reading of 16 the literature, but anecdotally it seems to me an area 17 that consumers have great difficulty -- just as providers 18 have difficulty in knowing what charge structures are, 19 consumers have great difficulty in judging what it means 20 when they select an insurance plan to go out-of-network 21 in that plan and what they will actually have to pay. 22 It seems to me it's an area in which insurers 23 may have discretion as to how they set what they will pay 24 on the beneficiary's behalf, perhaps independent of the 25224 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025charges. So it seems to me it's something of a safety 1 valve in which providers who have -- who can attract 2 consumers may be able to -- can charge what the market 3 will bear, and some can do quite well. And it's in a way 4 in which obviously the insurers can keep their premiums 5 down as well, but it is the consumer to whom it is stuck. 6 So I wonder if people could comment on that 7 phenomenon as part of this picture. 8 DR. DESMARAIS: Well, stuck, I don't know. 9 Stuck? I mean, obviously part of the reason for allowing 10 out-of-network is to give people more choices than they 11 might otherwise have because they've not always liked 12 being forced to deal in-network only. 13 DR. FEDER: Yeah, Henry, but if they don't know 14 -- if they don't know in advance what they're paying. 15 DR. DESMARAIS: Well, let me get to that. If 16 we don't have a contractual relationship with an out-of- 17 network provider, what can we tell the beneficiary about 18 what they're going to be charged? We can tell them what 19 their cost sharing is, and quite frequently, as you know, 20 it is higher cost sharing than if you had stayed within 21 that work part of the financial incentive to remain 22 within the network. But it may not be possible to tell 23 the beneficiary the total cost of going out-of-network, 24 in part because there is no control on what they might be 25225 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025charged by that out-of-network provider. 1 So I'm not sure -- I agree with you that plans 2 should take every step to disclose as carefully as they 3 can. This is not easy because of the different levels of 4 understanding. I mean, the total amount of information 5 you get. I mean, I used to be part of the FEHBP, and we 6 used to get such a volume of information that you really 7 didn't digest it all. Fortunately, there were people 8 who, you know, tried to make sense of it all for us. But 9 nevertheless, I think there is only so far you can go, 10 and really the trade-off here is, they do have that 11 option, at least. They have more choices than they would 12 otherwise have. 13 DR. FEDER: I guess I just -- I would argue 14 that it bears examination, because I think that the steps 15 -- I'm not at all clear that as many steps have been 16 taken as it is possible to take in terms of providing 17 that information. And it is a part of this picture. 18 Ignoring it means that you're missing much of the ball 19 game. 20 MR. BOTTI: Let me pick up a somewhat different 21 point, although it certainly deals with consumers' 22 choices and the impact on them. Professor Greaney, I 23 think, raised the question of what implications does the 24 care person have for health plans? And to get at that 25226 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025question, I would just, if I can, pick Professor Feder's 1 brain for one moment. In your remarks, you talked about 2 community rating as an idea at the time of the Clinton 3 health plan. 4 Could you give us any insights as to whether 5 community rating exists in any markets today? Is this 6 something that is prevalent? Do Insurance Commissioners 7 do any of that? 8 DR. FEDER: My sense, and it is somewhat 9 limited, is that we're talking now about the non-group 10 market, and in the non-group market there is not much 11 community rating at all. There are a handful of states, 12 or perhaps even smaller than a handful, I think, of 13 states, who have done community rating and a range of 14 other regulations in the non-group market. But it is 15 only a tiny handful. 16 More common, I think, are some bounds on -- 17 perhaps on rating or on rates of increase. But I think 18 that that is a direction in which -- from which people 19 have run as opposed to toward which they are moving. 20 MR. BOTTI: Thank you. Sure, Doctor. 21 DR. DORAN: Just to comment on that. I'm not 22 sure -- severity rating is something that we implemented 23 in Maryland when the Medicaid waiver went through. I'm 24 not sure where we are now with the severity rating. But 25227 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the experience to the providers in Maryland, was this was 1 a situation that Medicaid, when it went to managed care, 2 the state was going to provide insurers different amounts 3 of money based on the severity of illness of the child in 4 Medicaid. But what we found is that money never got down 5 to the provider. 6 DR. FEDER: Right. But that's -- I think what 7 you're -- 8 DR. DORAN: Not community rating, but severity 9 rating. 10 DR. FEDER: No. But that's -- I think you want 11 to distinguish. With the term community rating, we're 12 really thinking about the premium that an individual pays 13 as opposed as to your severity rating. I think you're 14 thinking of in rates paid to providers, which is more 15 commonly referred to as a -- 16 DR. DORAN: Well, to the insurers from the 17 state. 18 DR. FEDER: Oh, to -- aha. Okay, that's right. 19 A risk adjustment to the insurer. 20 DR. DORAN: It was from the state to the 21 insurer. 22 DR. FEDER: But that -- but I think your bigger 23 point is that that didn't take place. 24 MR. BOTTI: Let me keep on this just for a 25228 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025minute, because I'm curious, Dr. Desmarais. You may be 1 in the best position on this panel to give us some 2 insights as to whether McCarran-Ferguson is an important 3 community for -- or an exemption for health plans, or is 4 it irrelevant to health plan activities? Do you have any 5 sense of what role it plays? 6 DR. DESMARAIS: Well, let me touch on it at 7 least for a start. First, we're talking about an act 8 that affects much more than just health insurance. 9 DR. FEDER: Exactly. 10 DR. DESMARAIS: And I do not represent property 11 and casualty insurers or a host of other insurers who 12 clearly are affected. I think that the implications of 13 the Act do vary based on the type of insurance products 14 we're talking about. 15 Secondly, I'm happy to say McCarran-Ferguson 16 was before my time. And I'm finding it harder and harder 17 to say those sorts of things these days. No. McCarran- 18 Ferguson, first of all, I think the most important thing 19 to remember is that Act is really what has set up our 20 whole regulatory structure for insurance at the state 21 level, and we've now had decades of experience with state 22 regulation of insurance products. An insurer typically, 23 in order to increase their rates, has to present that to 24 the insurance department in their state. It's not as if 25229 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025they have, again, unlimited powers as to what they're 1 going to do. 2 So I think the one danger as we talk about 3 making a change to that Act, or repealing it, is what 4 implications does that have for the entire insurance 5 regulatory structure in this country which is state- 6 based. So I think that's one very large implication of 7 McCarran-Ferguson. As I said in my own presentation, the 8 premise there of that so-called exemption was that 9 instead of the federal government regulating this area, 10 it would be regulated by the states. And states do have 11 antitrust laws and are quite vigorous at looking at them. 12 Secondly, McCarran-Ferguson does not really 13 provide an overarching exemption to federal antitrust 14 laws, and in fact as was said, I think, by one of the 15 other speakers at one point, you know, the whole 16 Prudential/Aetna merger that was challenged, I think, is 17 a clear indication that the whole insurance sector is not 18 free from federal oversight. And I know there have been 19 a number of testimonies presented about that very fact, 20 that there is still federal oversight in this area. 21 To get more specific to your question, it's my 22 understanding, for example, that one of the things 23 McCarran-Ferguson permits is the use of state -- of 24 rating bureaus by the property and casualty insurance 25230 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025sector, where they're able to essentially collect claims 1 experience and information about reserving practices, and 2 that is viewed as allowing collection of information in 3 one place that might not be efficiently replicated by 4 every individual property and casualty company. And 5 these rating bureaus are state-regulated. So again, that 6 is perhaps one example -- a specific example -- of where 7 you might get into trouble with respect to a repeal of 8 McCarran-Ferguson. 9 MR. BOTTI: Okay. Can I just ask you one quick 10 follow up just to focus it for a minute. Are there any 11 collective practices by health plans, vis-a-vis insurance 12 regulators, that are protected by McCarran-Ferguson, 13 similar to -- 14 DR. DESMARAIS: I am not an attorney, so I'm 15 not aware. Again, it is really a question of deferring 16 to state regulation rather than federal regulation for a 17 large body of what's going on. I would add, you know, 18 when we start every meeting in our place, the one thing 19 that starts every single meeting is the chair's 20 instructions, which are, in part, intended to protect 21 from violations of antitrust law. And the operative 22 clause is no agreement with regard to pricing of products 23 or the design of products shall be discussed during any 24 meeting of any committee of the Association, except 25231 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025within a legislative or regulatory context as allowed by 1 law. 2 So again, we don't see ourselves as being 3 exempt from antitrust control. 4 MR. BOTTI: Thank you. 5 MR. BRENNAN: I think Ms. Carson-Smith wanted 6 to follow up. 7 MS. CARSON-SMITH: Yes, I would like to follow 8 up. My Association has not taken a position on repeal of 9 McCarran-Ferguson, but we do have some concerns that we 10 think need to be flushed out. And one of them is, when 11 is the activity truly anti-competitive, or alternatively 12 unrelated to the business of insurance, or when is it 13 related to business of insurance. For example, one 14 particular insurer that we know systematically does not 15 allow nurses on panels. We have been told by the New 16 York State Attorney General that we can't go beyond the 17 boundaries of McCarran-Ferguson to get at whether or not 18 that action is antitrust related. 19 In another instance which we find very 20 troublesome, nurses who are required to collaborate are 21 then asked by state regulation to buy insurance from the 22 same entity as the physician. So you have someone who 23 has a low insurance rate, a very low insurance rate -- 24 some are very low malpractice insurance rates -- going in 25232 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025with someone with a very high malpractice insurance rate, 1 and it's almost like you're forcing them in that market 2 to bring down the risk within that particular market for 3 that malpractice provider. Whereas, if they could buy it 4 from the nursing insurer who provides that malpractice 5 base that covers all nursing insurance, then, you know, 6 that insurance for that nurse would be considerably 7 lower. 8 There are instances of where nurses are 9 required -- nurse practitioners are required to buy 10 minimum coverages of malpractice insurance in a state, 11 and the physicians in that state are not required to buy 12 minimum coverages. The presumption is that the market 13 will take care of itself for the physicians, but not for 14 the nurse. But in reality, what you're creating is a 15 market for making that nurse an attractive plaintiff. 16 So those kinds of issues beg us to ask the 17 question of is there a need for further refinement of the 18 anti -- well, the antitrust prohibitions related to 19 McCarran-Ferguson. 20 MR. BRENNAN: Thank you. We're bouncing around 21 on issues here, but let me bounce one more time. I would 22 like to ask Christine Varney. I would like to follow up 23 on your remarks. First of all, as a former FTC 24 Commissioner, I'm particularly interested in your 25233 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025observation. 1 Do you think it's an incorrect premise for an 2 antitrust agency to be concerned that a contributing 3 factor to rising hospital costs is market power? 4 MS. VARNEY: No, I don't think it's incorrect. 5 MR. BRENNAN: Okay. So if it is a correct 6 premise, or a correct basis on which an antitrust agency 7 -- or a correct reason to be concerned -- 8 MS. VARNEY: It's within the purview of the 9 agencies. 10 MR. BRENNAN: Okay. 11 MS. VARNEY: Every inquiry is going to 12 obviously be fact specific. 13 MR. BRENNAN: Okay. And would those fact -- 14 would those fact specific circumstances necessarily then 15 require the agency to look at local market conditions, 16 and if so, where would you draw the line between 17 analyzing those local market conditions, pre-merger and 18 post-merger on the one hand versus the national trends 19 that you identified in your remarks. 20 MS. VARNEY: Right. A couple of things. As 21 you may recall, I was fairly outspoken about these issues 22 while I was here. And in part that was due to the fact 23 that we lost, what was it, seven or nine cases between 24 the two of us as we kept going up on mergers. Yeah, it 25234 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025may have been bad law, and I heard a lot of talk this 1 morning about what we need to do is educate judges. 2 Well, I know one or two judges who think they need to 3 educate us, because we kept bringing the cases. 4 A couple of things. I think that some of the 5 best work that we did in the '90s on mergers was on the 6 big mega mergers, the Columbia HCA. The large regional 7 consolidations, where you were looking at multiple 8 hospitals coming together and what was the effect of that 9 on competition. I think we did a good job on that. 10 I think we did a less good job on small local 11 markets in understanding what were the product markets, 12 what were the geographic markets and what were the 13 relevant factors in trying to assess competition. In 14 particular, as you know, I had a very hard time 15 understanding why we set an efficiency bar so high when 16 we were importing, in my view, the markers for antitrust 17 analysis that I think you said, Tim, didn't make a lot of 18 sense when you were looking at the hospital market. I 19 mean, to think you could take the HHIs and throw them 20 into the hospital basket and come out with a result that 21 was going to make sense, to me was ludicrous at the time. 22 So my concerns have always been, look, when 23 you're looking at the health care marketplace, it's not 24 cars. It's not grocery stores. You've got a role for 25235 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025the federal antitrust agencies to play in hospital 1 consolidation, particularly at the large regional level 2 that crosses many jurisdictions, that we in the federal 3 agencies may be more equipped to take a broad look at 4 than in small regional markets. I have always believed 5 that in small regional markets, number one, a state 6 attorney general, if there is going to be an antitrust 7 review, ought to be very involved in. Number two, there 8 are tremendous efficiencies in the '90s, I believe, that 9 came out of hospital mergers. 10 To go back now and try and assess what was the 11 result of those mergers -- you know, I was joking to some 12 of my colleagues the other day. You want to know if 13 prices went up? Pay me the money. I'll tell you. 14 Prices went up. There is no question, prices have gone 15 up. But how are you going to isolate in a retrospective 16 what the price increases were due to? You know, we've 17 got a lot of data -- most of it has been referenced and 18 mentioned by many of the panel -- that will continue to 19 point you to three basic baskets of price increases. 20 There is increased volume. Whether or not we 21 think that's a good thing, there is increased volume. 22 There is increased costs. Okay. We've talked about the 23 labor, the technology and the pharmaceuticals. There is 24 clearly increased costs. And then the third basket that 25236 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025I refer to is the unique characteristics of hospitals. 1 The under compensated, the un-compensated care and the 2 obligations of the hospitals to deliver care. 3 It's not clear to me that we have the tools to 4 tease out what price increases are due where. What 5 synergies and efficiencies can you isolate in the mid- 6 '90s and carry forward to 2003 when technology today is 7 completely different than it was back then. I mean, I 8 have a short personal anecdote. My dad, who is 74 now, 9 three years ago had emergency quadruple bypass surgery 10 off the pump. Something unheard of. It was only done at 11 two or three hospitals. You probably know far better 12 than I. He was in intensive care for one night. He was 13 in the hospital for three days. He was out and he was 14 hiking in Norway with my kids a month later. 15 That surgery was astronomically expensive. It 16 was not reimbursed fully by the variety of insurance 17 products that he relies on. And the efficiencies that we 18 may have seen from hospitals combining in the '90s, how 19 are you going to pull out those efficiencies when you 20 have to factor in the more expensive technologies and the 21 higher demand for services that you've got today? 22 So a long way of saying, yes, there is a role 23 for antitrust review of hospital mergers. That role has 24 to encompass increased efficiencies, has to recognize 25237 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025we're not talking about cars and groceries, and has to 1 understand that we're operating in a complex, highly 2 regulated environment where some care is paid for, and 3 some care is not paid for, and some care is under- 4 compensated, yet there is an obligation to provide care 5 to all. 6 MR. BRENNAN: Professor Greaney? 7 DR. GREANEY: Well, here is how I read what we 8 learned from the '90s and what the economics teach us. 9 First of all, health care, God bless it, is well studied. 10 Economists have done a lot of studies here. And it is 11 one industry where antitrust really seems to matter, 12 i.e., there is a strong relation between concentration 13 and price, and the gaggles of economists have shown that. 14 And it is an intensely local industry. So I think it is 15 important to preserve market structures, and I think 16 there is good healthy empirical support for it, would 17 that there were for a lot of other antitrust, but we 18 happen to have it here. 19 Secondly, on the efficiency side, I think the 20 picture is much grayer. This cat is a lot grayer than 21 Commissioner Varney indicated. I think there are a 22 number of studies that question whether efficiencies -- 23 promised efficiencies -- were realized. A big problem of 24 combined hospitals is \"herding cats.\" No offense to 25238 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025doctors, but that's the phrase used, because they don't 1 get the cooperation of the doctors. They can't 2 consolidate the way they planned to. So that's -- the 3 benefits are very speculative, and I think the picture is 4 a lot clearer on the risk side. 5 Finally, let me mention something that I think 6 is an opportunity for the Commission to take the lead on 7 and an important issue that is coming up now, which are 8 the carve-out, specialty hospitals and the fights with 9 doctors doing that. It is a very -- it's a tricky and 10 thorny issue. In some cases, you have clear anti- 11 competitive problems, where the hospital is trying to 12 stop a rival surgical center from coming up. In other 13 cases not so clear, because the physicians have such 14 control over the patient. You may just be substituting 15 one set of market power for another. 16 But a very interesting problem, and in fact one 17 that the OIG at HHS is getting involved in now with the 18 comments on whether staff privileges constitute 19 remuneration. But that's an important issue, I think, 20 that competition advocacy and perhaps policy statements 21 can be out front on. Critical as I've been from time to 22 time, let me just say, I think what the Commission has 23 done in some areas, like pharmaceuticals, or, you know, 24 if you need an advertisement for why the FTC earns its 25239 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025money, there it is, because not only did they bring 1 timely important up front cases. They alerted 2 legislatures. They raised an issue to prominence. And, 3 you know, I think that's a role they can regain here. 4 MS. VARNEY: Let me just respond to one thing. 5 It's former Commissioner Varney, but Christine is 6 preferable. I think that the efficiency cat may be gray, 7 but the concentration and price increase is equally gray. 8 I mean, there was concentration in the '90s, or merger 9 activity in the '90s across virtually all markets. So 10 how we isolate price increases due to market structure 11 changes and the other factors we've talked about is not 12 at all clear to me out of the economic literature. 13 Specialty hospitals are interesting, and I 14 think it is an area where we do need some dialogue. The 15 problem -- one of the problems that faces hospitals -- 16 and I'm sure, you know, you've encountered this, and it's 17 not what you're talking about. The obligation of 18 hospitals to provide care for the uninsured can lead to 19 some cherry picking. And that is something that, you 20 know, a rational economic actor is going to look at to 21 maximize the efficiency of their specialty hospital. And 22 there is a challenge here, and I think we've all got to 23 overcome it. You know, how do we deal with this issue. 24 And it's something that we're interested in looking at 25240 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025and working on. 1 MR. BOTTI: Maybe we can pick up a slightly 2 different topic. There has been a lot of talk about 3 information flow, and some people seem to say that it is 4 damaging competition, or potentially damaging to 5 competition. Some people seem to say that it is really 6 important to have effective markets. And I want to talk 7 about the business review letters that Dr. Desmarais 8 raised, because I think those letters do acknowledge the 9 concerns that you expressed, that fee surveys could give 10 rise to problematic behavior. But they also raise a 11 question that I think Drs. Opelka and Doran raised, which 12 you didn't address and I would like to get to the facts 13 of this. 14 And that is, physicians perceive themselves not 15 to have appropriate information in order to make 16 contracting decisions with managed care plans. And the 17 proposition in these fee surveys is that they will 18 correct this failure of information. And I'm wondering. 19 I mean, do the health plans concede that, that the 20 information physicians might appropriately want is not 21 available to them, or do you think it is already 22 available to them, in which case why are these surveys a 23 problem? 24 Maybe you could expand on this. Thank you. 25241 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025DR. DESMARAIS: Well, I think the surveys are a 1 problem because, you know, there seems to be an intent to 2 use them to simply raise prices and raise fees. And so, 3 I think it's not sure to us exactly what the value to the 4 consumers is going to be. I mean, it's not quality 5 information we're talking about here. And when I hear a 6 former Commissioner of the FTC tell me, well, it's so 7 complicated, you'll never be able to figure out, you 8 know, what's due to what, it makes us worried about the 9 implications of, you know, can you do a rule of reason 10 analysis in health care, or is it so complicated that it 11 is impossible. And so, when you have MedSouth or 12 information exchange, you really won't know what's going 13 on or what is valuable or not valuable. 14 I do think it's probably -- it varies from 15 payer to payer what kind of information is available. 16 You know, we're talking about a contract. I haven't 17 encountered a lot of sympathy out there if I sign a 18 contract and I don't know what its terms are, or I'm not 19 satisfied I know what its terms and conditions are. So I 20 don't know what to do with that, but I suspect there are 21 variations in business practices out there from insurer 22 to insurer. I'm not sure I can do personally anything 23 about that, given the antitrust laws, but at any rate. 24 MR. BOTTI: Maybe Drs. Opelka or Doran would 25242 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025like to pick up on the notion of do physicians have 1 appropriate information to make individual choices in 2 terms of which managed care plans they might contract 3 with or not. 4 DR. DORAN: Well, one of the issues -- and I 5 certainly don't hold myself an expert in this area. But 6 I believe that the Medicare Program provides a national 7 database of utilization services for adults. And there 8 is really no comparable -- speaking as a pediatrician, 9 there is no comparable database for children. So in that 10 respect, pediatricians are at a particular disadvantage. 11 I don't know if that -- was that -- 12 MR. BOTTI: That's helpful. 13 DR. DORAN: Okay. 14 DR. OPELKA: From a surgeon's perspective, 15 these are -- these tend to be very complicated medical 16 service agreements. They are not straightforward. There 17 are 9,000 plus codes that the surgeons are dealing with 18 in trying to put this together. So if you are a large 19 group and you're going to an insurer, and you're trying 20 to sort out how these codes are dealt with, you're just 21 given a set of general broad guidelines -- this is how we 22 do this -- and you don't really get down to the point 23 where you understand the actual fee for the service 24 rendered. 25243 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025When you do come to understand it, usually in 1 the course of that year, you are put on notice that there 2 has been a change and the rules are now new or different. 3 So just when you thought you had your arms around it, the 4 game is changed. And in the middle of that, they throw 5 in a whole new set of rules on payment policy and what 6 we're now going to cover and what we're not going to 7 cover. Right in the middle of where you really finally 8 thought you had, boy, we're looking forward to the next 9 contract cycle. When you bring these forward at the end 10 of that contract and move into the next contract, they 11 are typically recognized as great points of discussion 12 and it ends there. 13 And the average surgeon doesn't have time for 14 that, and they've got to get back to doing what they are 15 supposed to do. We are spending an enormous amount of 16 time trying to figure out what we should not have to 17 figure out. What should be much more understood by all 18 parties involved and get us focused on the patient. And 19 it's sad to say that we're not, because we're chasing 20 down very slim margins, rising costs and difficult 21 malpractice issues. And it ends up where -- when it is 22 finally understood, you start to have to ask yourself, 23 what particular lines of service can I afford to continue 24 to deliver, and that, to me, is where it really gets 25244 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025criminal. 1 MR. BOTTI: Thank you. 2 DR. GREANEY: Just on that point, I want to 3 thank the Commission for coming out with this letter, 4 because when I go back to St. Louis, I have to revise my 5 health law casebook. And this is -- I think this was 6 written by a law professor. It is just full of great 7 issues. 8 But one of the ironies here is that what the 9 physicians decided to do is exactly what I think Joel 10 Klein and Bob Pitofsky told them to do during the debate 11 over the Campbell Bill, which was to say you don't need 12 collective bargaining. Go out there and lobby. Get the 13 information out. Throw it out there and let the market 14 and everybody decide. And they're doing exactly that. 15 I can certainly understand why it is 16 troublesome, and the context in which it is troublesome, 17 I suppose, is because as the letter points out, it seems 18 bizarre to set it up so the two -- the duopolists can 19 more effectively collude. Get the information right out 20 in front of them. It is a fascinating problem, but one I 21 think if you have to err on one side, I guess you err on 22 the side of information. But certainly there are 23 situations where markets work better with secret bids and 24 less information. But I guess -- I think in this case 25245 For The Record, Inc. Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025you reached the right decision, but it is full of twists 1 and turns, I think, analytically. 2 MR. BOTTI: Should we wrap up? 3 MR. BRENNAN: Yeah. 4 MR. BOTTI: Well, unless any of our panelists 5 want a last word -- going once, twice, three times. No. 6 Why don't we wrap up for the day. Thank you all. 7 (Whereupon, at 5:00 p.m., the workshop was 8 concluded.) 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25246 For The Record, Inc.
