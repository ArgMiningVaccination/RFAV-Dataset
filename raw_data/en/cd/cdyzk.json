TheNational Institute of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cosponsored the survey through a grant to the Center for Policy Research. The survey con- sists of telephone interviews with a nationally representative sample of 8,000 U.S. women and 8,000 U.S. men about their experiences as victims of various forms of violence, including intimate partner violence. The survey compares intimate partner victim- ization rates among women and men, specific racial groups, Hispanics and non-Hispanics, and same-sex and opposite-sex cohabitants. It also examines risk factors associated with intimate partner violence, the rate of injury among rape and physical assault victims, injured victims' use of medical services, and victims' involvement with the justice system. Analysis of the survey data produced the following results: lIntimate partner violence is pervasive in U.S. society. Nearly 25 percent of surveyed women and 7.6 percent of surveyed men said they were raped and/or physicallyassaulted by a current or former spouse, cohabiting partner, or date at some time in their lifetime; 1.5 percent of surveyedwomen and 0.9 percent of surveyed men said they were raped and/or physically assaulted by a partner in the previous 12months. According to these estimates, ap- proximately 1.5 million women and 834,732 men are raped and/or physically assaultedby an intimate partner annually in the United States. Because many victims arevictimized more than once, the number of intimate partner victimizations exceeds thenumber of intimate partner victims annually. Thus, approximately 4.8 million intimate partner rapes and physical assaults are per-petrated against U.S. women annually, and approximately 2.9 million intimate partner physical assaults are committed against U.S.men annually. These findings suggest that intimate partner violence is a serious crimi- nal justice and public health concern. lStalking by intimates is more prevalent than previously thought. Almost 5 percent of sur- veyed women and 0.6 percent of surveyedmen reported being stalked by a current or former spouse, cohabiting partner, or date at some time in their lifetime; 0.5 percent ofsurveyed women and 0.2 percent of sur- veyed men reported being stalked by such a partner in the previous 12 months. Accord-ing to these estimates, 503,485 women and 185,496 men are stalked by an intimate partner annually in the United States. Theseestimates exceed previous nonscientific \"guesstimates\" of stalking prevalence in the general population. These findings suggestthat intimate partner stalking is a serious criminal justice problem, and States should continue to develop constitutionally soundand effective antistalking statutes and inter- vention strategies. lWomen experience more intimate partner violence than do men. The NVAW survey found that women are significantly more likely than men to report being victims ofintimate partner violence whether it is rape, physical assault, or stalking and whether the timeframe is the person's lifetime or theiv previous 12 months. These findings support data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey, which consistently show women are at sig-nificantly greater risk of intimate partner violence than are men. However, they con- tradict data from the National Family Vio-lence Survey, which consistently show men and women are equally likely to be physi- cally assaulted by an intimate partner. Stud-ies are needed to determine how different survey methodologies affect women's and men's responses to questions about intimatepartner violence. lRates of intimate partner violence vary sig-nificantly among women of diverse racialbackgrounds. The survey found that Asian/ Pacific Islander women and men tend to re- port lower rates of intimate partner violencethan do women and men from other minor- ity backgrounds, and African-American and American Indian/Alaska Native women andmen report higher rates. However, differ- ences among minority groups diminish when other sociodemographic and relation-ship variables are controlled. More research is needed to determine how much of the dif- ference in intimate partner prevalence ratesamong women and men of different racial and ethnic backgrounds can be explained by the respondent's willingness to discloseintimate partner violence and how much by social, demographic, and environmental factors. Research is also needed to deter-mine how prevalence rates vary among women and men of diverse American Indian/Alaska Native and Asian/PacificIslander groups. lViolence perpetrated against women by inti-mates is often accompanied by emotionallyabusive and controlling behavior. The sur- vey found that women whose partners were jealous, controlling, or verbally abusivewere significantly more likely to report being raped, physically assaulted, and/orstalked by their partners, even when other sociodemographic and relationship character- istics were controlled. Indeed, having a ver- bally abusive partner was the variable mostlikely to predict that a woman would be victimized by an intimate partner. These findings support the theory that violenceperpetrated against women by intimates is often part of a systematic pattern of domi- nance and control. lWomen experience more chronic and injuri- ous physical assaults at the hands of intimate partners than do men. The survey found thatwomen who were physically assaulted by an intimate partner averaged 6.9 physical as- saults by the same partner, but men averaged4.4 assaults. The survey also found that 41.5 percent of the women who were physically assaulted by an intimate partner were injuredduring their most recent assault, compared with 19.9 percent of the men. These findings suggest that research aimed at understandingand preventing intimate partner violence against women should be stressed. lWomen living with female intimate partners experience less intimate partner violence than women living with male intimate part- ners. Slightly more than 11 percent of thewomen who had lived with a woman as part of a couple reported being raped, physically assaulted, and/or stalked by a female cohabi-tant, but 30.4 percent of the women who had married or lived with a man as part of a couple reported such violence by a husbandor male cohabitant. These findings suggest that lesbian couples experience less intimate partner violence than do heterosexualcouples; however, more research is needed to support or refute this conclusion. lMen living with male intimate partners expe- rience more intimate partner violence than do men who live with female intimate partners. Approximately 15 percent of the men whohad lived with a man as a couple reportedv being raped, physically assaulted, and/or stalked by a male cohabitant, while 7.7 per- cent of the men who had married or lived with a woman as a couple reported such vio-lence by a wife or female cohabitant. These findings, combined with those presented in the previous bullet, provide further evidencethat intimate partner violence is perpetrated primarily by men, whether against male or female intimates. Thus, strategies for pre-venting intimate partner violence should focus on risks posed by men. lThe U.S. medical community treats millions of intimate partner rapes and physical as- saults annually. Of the estimated 4.8 million intimate partner rapes and physical assaultsperpetrated against women annually, ap- proximately 2 million will result in an injury to the victim, and 552,192 will result in sometype of medical treatment to the victim. Of the estimated 2.9 million intimate partner physical assaults perpetrated against men an-nually, 581,391 will result in an injury to the victim, and 124,999 will result in some type of medical treatment to the victim. Manymedically treated victims receive multiple forms of care (e.g., ambulance services,emergency room care, or physical therapy) and multiple treatments (e.g., several days in the hospital) for the same victimization. Therefore, the number of medical personneltreating injuries annually is in the millions. To better meet the needs of intimate partner violence victims, medical professionalsshould receive training on the physical con- sequences of intimate partner violence and appropriate medical intervention strategies. lMost intimate partner victimizations are not reported to the police. Approximately one- fifth of all rapes, one-quarter of all physical assaults, and one-half of all stalkings perpe- trated against female respondents by inti- mates were reported to the police. Evenfewer rapes, physical assaults, and stalkings perpetrated against male respondents by inti- mates were reported. The majority of victimswho did not report their victimization to the police thought the police would not or could not do anything on their behalf. These find-ings suggest that most victims of intimate partner violence do not consider the justice system an appropriate vehicle for resolvingconflicts with intimates.vii Acknowledgments The authors thank staff at both the National Instituteof Justice (NIJ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in particular Lois Mock at NIJ and Linda Saltzman at CDC, for their advice and support in conducting the research.The authors also thank Marcie-jo Kresnow, mathematical statistician at CDC, and anony- mous NIJ peer reviewers for their thorough review and helpful comments on drafts of this report.

While greatly enhancing public awareness andunderstanding of this serious social problem, this research has also created much controversy and confusion. Findings of intimate partner vic-timization vary widely from study to study. 1 Some studies conclude that women and men areequally likely to be victimized by their partners, 2 but others conclude that women are more likely to be victimized.3 Some studies conclude that minorities and whites suffer equal rates of inti-mate partner violence, 4 and others conclude that minorities suffer higher rates.5 In addition, there are many gaps in the scientific literature on intimate partner violence, such as the level of violence committed against men and women by same-sex intimates.6 Little empirical data exist on the relationship between different forms of intimate partner violence, such as emo- tional abuse and physical assault.7 Finally, little is known of the consequences of intimate partner violence, including rate of injury and victims' use of medical and justice system services.8 This Research Report addresses these and other issues related to intimate partner violence. The information presented in this report is based onfindings from the National Violence Against Women (NVAW) Survey, a national telephone survey jointly sponsored by the National Insti-tute of Justice (NIJ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The survey, which was conducted from November 1995 toMay 1996, consists of telephone interviews with a representative sample of 8,000 U.S. women and 8,000 U.S. men. Survey respondents werequeried about their experiences as victims of various forms of violence, including rape,physical assault, and stalking by intimate partners. Victimized respondents were asked detailed questions about the characteristics andconsequences of their victimization, including the extent and nature of any injuries they sus- tained, their use of medical services, and theirinvolvement with the justice system. This Research Report also summarizes the survey's findings on victimization rates amongwomen and men, specific racial groups, Hispan- ics and non-Hispanics, and opposite-sex and same-sex cohabitants. It examines risk factorsassociated with intimate partner violence, rates of injury among rape and physical assault vic- tims, injured victims' use of medical services,and victims' involvement with the justice sys- tem. Although this report focuses on women's and men's experiences as victims of intimatepartner violence, complete details about men's and women's experiences as victims of rape, physical assault, and stalking by all types ofassailants are contained in earlier NIJ and CDC reports (see sidebar, \"Other Publications in the Series\"). Because of the sensitive nature of the survey, state-of-the-art techniques were used to protect the confidentiality of the information beingsought and to minimize the potential for retraumatizing victims of violence and jeopardizing the safety of respondents. lThe sample was generated through random- digit dialing, thereby ensuring that only a 10- digit telephone number linked the respondentto the survey. The area code and telephone exchanges were included as part of the com- pleted interview for each case in the datasetfor analysis purposes, but the last four digits of the telephone number were eliminated.2 lThe survey introduction informed respondents that their answers would be kept confidential and that participation in the survey was voluntary. lRespondents were given a toll-free number to call to verify the authenticity of the survey or to respond to the survey at a later date. Re-spondents also were told to use this number should they need to hang up suddenly during the interview. lOnly female interviewers interviewed female respondents. (To measure the possible effects of interviewer gender on male responses tosurvey questions, half of the male respondents were interviewed by male interviewers and half by female interviewers.)lInterviewers were instructed to schedule acallback interview if they thought someone was listening to the interview on another line or was in the room with the respondent. lInterviewers, out of concern that the interview might cause some victims of violence to expe- rience emotional trauma, were provided withrape crisis and domestic violence hotline tele- phone numbers from around the country. If a respondent showed signs of distress, he orshewas provided with an appropriate hotline referral. In addition to lessening the possibility that re- spondents might be harmed due to their partici- pation in the survey, these techniques improved the quality of the information gathered.Other Publications in the Series Other publications related to the National Violence Against Women Survey include: lStalking in America: Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey, Research in Brief, by Patricia Tjaden and Nancy Thoennes, Washington, D.C.: U.S.Department of Justice, National Institute ofJustice, 1998, NCJ 169592. lPrevalence, Incidence, and Consequences of Violence Against Women: Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey, Research in Brief, by Patricia Tjaden and Nancy Thoennes, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice, 1998, NCJ 172837. lPrevalence, Incidence, and Consequences of Violence Against Women, Research Report, by Patricia Tjaden and NancyThoennes, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Depart- ment of Justice, National Institute of Justice, forthcoming.To obtain copies of these documents, visit NIJ's Web site at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nijor contact the National Criminal Justice Service at P.O.

Ibid.5 Defining Intimate Partner Violence There is currently little consensus among re- searchers on exactly how to define the term \"intimate partner violence.\"1 As a result, defini- tions of the term vary widely from study to study, making comparisons difficult. One source of controversy revolves around whether to limitthedefinition of the term to acts carried out with theintention of, or perceived intention of, caus- ing physical pain or injury to another person.Although this approach presents a narrow defini- tion of intimate partner violence that can be readily operationalized, it ignores the myriadbehaviors that persons may use to control, in- timidate, and otherwise dominate another person in the context of an intimate relationship. Thesebehaviors may include acts such as verbal abuse, imprisonment, humiliation, stalking, and denial of access to financial resources, shelter, orservices. Another source of controversy revolves around whether to limit the definition of the term toviolence occurring between persons who are married or living together as a couple or to in- clude persons who are dating or who considerthemselves a couple but live in separate domi- ciles. At present the research literature is bifur- cated, with some studies focusing on violenceoccurring in marital or heterosexual cohabiting relationships and others focusing on violence occurring in heterosexual dating relationships.Only a handful of studies examine violence in same-sex cohabiting or dating relationships. The definition of intimate partner violence used in the NVAW Survey includes rape, physical assault, and stalking perpetrated by current and former dates, spouses, and cohabiting partners,with cohabiting meaning living together at leastsome of the time as a couple. Both same-sex and opposite-sex cohabitants are included in the definition. The survey's definition of intimatepartner violence resembles the one developed by CDC 2 because it includes violence occurring between persons who have a current or formerdating, marital, or cohabiting relationship and same-sex and opposite-sex cohabitants. However, it deviates from CDC's definition because it in-cludes stalking as well as rape and physical assault. For purposes of the survey, \"rape\" is defined as an event that occurs without the victim's consentand involves the use of threat or force to pen- etrate the victim's vagina or anus by penis, tongue, fingers, or object or the victim's mouthby penis. The definition includes both attempted and completed rape. \"Physical assault\" is defined as behaviors that threaten, attempt, or actuallyinflict physical harm. The definition includes awide range of behaviors, from slapping, push- ing, and shoving to using a gun. \"Stalking\" isdefined as a course of conduct directed at a specific person involving repeated visual or physical proximity; nonconsensual communica-tion; verbal, written, or implied threats; or a combination thereof that would cause fear in a reasonable person, with \"repeated\" meaning ontwo or more occasions. The definition of stalk- ing used in the survey does not require stalkers to make a credible threat against victims, but itdoes require victims to feel a high level of fear. The specific questions used to screen respon- dents for rape, physical assault, and stalkingvictimization are behaviorally specific and are designed to leave little doubt in the respondent's mind as to what is being measured (see sidebar,\"Survey Screening Questions\").6 Survey Screening Questions Rape: Five questions were used to screen respondents for completed and attempted rape victimization:a l[Female respondents only] Has a man or boy ever made you have sex by using force or threatening to harm you or someone close to you? Just so there is no mistake, by sex we mean putting his penis in your vagina. lHas anyone, male or female, ever made you have oral sex by using force or threat of force? Just so there is no mistake, by oral sex we mean that a man or boy put his penisin your mouth or someone, male or female, penetrated your vagina or anus with their mouth. lHas anyone ever made you have anal sex by using force or threat of force? Just so there is no mistake, by anal sex we mean that aman or boy put his penis in your anus. lHas anyone, male or female, ever putfingers or objects in your vagina or anusagainst your will or by using force or threats? lHas anyone, male or female, ever attempted to make you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex against your will but intercourse or penetra- tion did not occur? Physical assault: A modified version of the original Conflict Tactics Scale was used to screen respondents for physical assault they experienced as an adult at the hands ofanother adult: b lNot counting any incidents you have alreadymentioned, after you became an adult, did any other adult, male or female, ever: \u2014 Throw something at you that could hurt? \u2014 Push, grab, or shove you?\u2014 Pull your hair? \u2014 Slap or hit you? \u2014 Kick or bite you? \u2014 Choke or attempt to drown you?\u2014 Hit you with some object? \u2014 Beat you up? \u2014 Threaten you with a gun? \u2014 Threaten you with a knife or other weapon? \u2014 Use a gun on you?\u2014 Use a knife or other weapon on you ? Stalking: The following questions were usedto screen respondents for stalking victimization: lNot including bill collectors, telephone solicitors, or other salespeople, has anyone, male or female, ever: \u2014 Followed or spied on you? \u2014 Sent you unsolicited letters or written correspondence? \u2014 Made unsolicited phone calls to you? \u2014 Stood outside your home, school, or workplace? \u2014 Showed up at places you were even though he or she had no business being there? \u2014 Left unwanted items for you to find? \u2014 Tried to communicate in other ways against your will? \u2014 Vandalized your property or destroyed something you loved? Respondents who answered yes to one or more of these questions were asked whetheranyone had ever done any of these things on7 Notes 1.

Only respondents who re- ported being victimized on more than one oc-casion and who were very frightened or feared bodily harm were counted as stalking victims. Victim-perpetrator relationship: Respon- dents who answered affirmatively to the rape, physical assault, and/or stalking screening questions were asked whether their attackerwas a current or ex-spouse, a male live-in partner, a female live-in partner, a relative, someone else they knew, or a stranger. Re-spondents disclosing victimization by an ex- spouse or cohabiting partner were asked to further identify which spouse/partner victim-ized them (e.g., first ex-husband, current male live-in partner). Respondents disclosing vic- timization by a relative were asked to furtherspecify which relative victimized them (e.g., father, brother, uncle, cousin). Finally, respon- dents disclosing victimization by someone else they knew were asked to further specifythe relationship they had with this person (e.g., date, boss, teacher, neighbor). Only victimizations perpetrated by current andformer spouses, same-sex and opposite-sex cohabiting partners, and dates are included in the analyses discussed in this report. a.

Straus, M., \"Measuring Intrafamily Conflict and Violence: The Conflict Tactics (CT) Scale,\" Journal of Marriage and the Family 41(1979): 75-88.9 Prevalence and Incidence of Intimate Partner Violence The NVAW Survey generated information on both the prevalence and incidence of intimate partner violence. \"Prevalence\" refers to the per-centage of persons within a demographic group (e.g., female or male) who are victimized during a specific period, such as the person's lifetime orthe previous 12 months. \"Incidence\" refers to the number of separate victimizations or incidents of violence committed against persons within a demo-graphic group during a specific period. Incidence can also be expressed as a victimization rate ,which is obtained by dividing the number of vic- timizations committed against persons in a de- mographic group by the number of persons inthat demographic group and setting the rate to a standard population base, such as 1,000 persons. 1 Intimate partner rape Using a definition of rape that includes com- pleted or attempted forced vaginal, oral, and anal sex, the survey found 7.7 percent of Exhibit 1.

Based on U.S. Census esti- mates of the number of women aged 18 yearsand older in the country, an estimated 201,394 women were forcibly raped by an intimate partner in the 12 months preceding the survey(exhibit 1). [The number of male rape victims (n < 5) was insufficient to reliably calculate annual prevalence estimates for men.] Because women raped by an intimate partner in the previous 12 months averaged 1.6 rapes, the incidence of intimate partner rape (number ofseparate victimizations) exceeded the prevalence of intimate partner rape (number of victims). Thus, there were an estimated 322,230 intimatepartner rapes committed against U.S. women dur- ing the 12 months preceding the survey. (This na- tional estimate is based on only 16 women whoreported being raped by an intimate partner in the previous 12 months and should be viewed with caution.) This figure equates to an annual victim-ization rate of 3.2 intimate partner rapes per 1,000 U.S. women aged 18 years and older (322,230 \u00f7 100,697,000 = 0.0032 x 1,000 = 3.2) (exhibit 2).Intimate partner physical assault Using a definition of physical assault that in-cludes a range of behaviors, from slapping andhitting to using a gun, the survey found that 22.1 percent of surveyed women and 7.4 percent of surveyed men reported being physically assaultedby a current or former intimate partner at some time in their lifetime, whereas 1.3 percent of all surveyed women and 0.9 percent of all surveyedmen reported being physically assaulted by such a partner in the previous 12 months. Thus, approxi- mately 1.3 million women and 834,732 men werephysically assaulted by an intimate partner in the 12 months preceding the survey (exhibit 1). Because women and men who were physically assaulted by an intimate partner in the previous 12 months averaged 3.4 and 3.5 physical as- saults, respectively, there were approximately4.5 million intimate partner physical assaults perpetrated against women and approximately 2.9 million intimate partner physical assaultsperpetrated against men in the 12 months pre- ceding the survey. These figures equate to an annualvictimization rate of 44.2 intimate part-ner physical assaults per 1,000 U.S. women aged 18 years andolder (4,450,807 \u00f7 100,697,000 = 0.0442 x 1,000 = 44.2) and 31.5 intimate partnerExhibit 2.

Because stalking by definition means repeated acts and because no victim was stalked by more thanone perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey, the number of stalking victimizations was imputed to be the same as the number of stalking victims. Thus, the average number of stalking victimizations per victim is 1.0. bRelative standard error exceeds 30 percent. cEstimates not calculated on fewer than five victims.11 physical assaults per 1,000 U.S. men aged 18 years and older (2,921,562 \u00f7 92,748,000 = 0.0315 x 1,000 = 31.5) (exhibit 2). Results from the survey show that most physical assaults committed against women and men by intimates are relatively minor and consist of pushing, grabbing, shoving, slapping, and hit-ting. Fewer women and men reported that an intimate threw something that could hurt them, pulled their hair, kicked or beat them, or threat-ened them with a knife or gun. Only a negligible number reported that an intimate actually used a knife or gun on them (exhibit 3). Intimate partner stalking Using a definition of stalking that requires vic- tims to feel a high level of fear, the survey found that 4.8 percent of surveyed women and 0.6 per-cent of surveyed men reported being stalked by a current or former intimate partner at some time in their lifetime; 0.5 percent of surveyed womenand 0.2 percent of surveyed men reported being stalked by such a partner in the 12 months pre- ceding the survey. These figures equate to anestimated 503,485 women and 185,496 menwho were stalked by an intimate partner in the 12 months preceding the survey (exhibit 1). Because stalking by definition involves repeated acts of harassment and intimidation and becauseno respondent reported being stalked by more than one intimate in the 12 months preceding the survey, the incidence of intimate partnerstalking is equivalent to the prevalence of intimate partner stalking. Thus, there were an estimated 503,485 stalking victimizations per-petrated against women and 185,496 stalking victimizations perpetrated against men by intimates in the year preceding the survey(exhibit 2). These figures equate to an annual victimization rate of 5 intimate partner stalkings per 1,000 U.S. women aged 18 years and older(503,485 \u00f7 100,697,000 = 0.005 x 1,000 = 5.0) and 1.8 intimate partner stalkings per 1,000 U.S. men aged 18 years and older (185,496 \u00f7 97,748,000 = 0.0018 x 1,000 = 1.8) (exhibit 2).

The Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which is admin- istered yearly, generates annual rape and sexualassault victimization estimates for women and men. One study based on 1992-93 NCVS data found that the average annual rate of rape andsexual assault by an intimate was 1.0 per 1,000 women aged 12 years and older. 4 This estimate is lower than the average annual rate of intimatepartner rape for women generated by the NVAW Survey, which is 3.2 per 1,000 women aged 18 years and older (exhibit 2). However, directcomparisons between the findings of the two surveys are difficult to make because estimates reported by the two surveys refer to somewhatdifferent populations and sexual victimizations, and the two surveys differ substantially method- ologically (see \"Deciphering Disparities in Sur-vey Findings\"). Intimate partner physical assault Several community-based studies have gener-ated estimates of the lifetime prevalence of physical assault by an intimate. Estimates from these surveys range from 9 to 30 percent for women and from 13 to 16 percent for men (seenote 1 in \"Introduction\"). In addition, a 1997 Gallup poll, which surveyed a nationally repre- sentative sample of 434 women and 438 men,found that 22 percent of women and 8 percent of men have been physically abused by a spouse or companion. 5 NVAW Survey estimates that 22.1 percent of women and 7.4 percent of men have been physically assaulted by an intimate at some time in their lifetime are nearly identical to theGallup estimates. National estimates of the annual rate of physical assault by an intimate come from two primarysources\u2014the previously mentioned NCVS and the National Family Violence Survey (NFVS), which was first conducted in 1975 and then re-peated in 1985. Portions of the NFVS were also included in the 1992 National Alcohol and Fam- ily Violence Survey and a special component ofthe 1995 National Alcohol Survey. Annual rates of physical assault by an intimate generated from the NVAW Survey are substan-tially higher than those generated by the NCVS. One study based on 1992-93 NCVS data found that the average annual rate of simple and aggra-vated assault by an intimate was 7.6 per 1,000 women aged 12 years and older and 1.3 per 1,000 men aged 12 years and older. 6 A more recent study that used 1996 NCVS data and Federal Bureauof Investigation Uniform Crime Report homicide data\u2014and combined data on intimatepartner murder, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault\u2014found the annual rate of violent victimization by an intimatewas 7.5 per 1,000 women aged 12 years and older and 1.4 per 1,000 men aged 12 years and older. 7 In comparison, the NVAW Survey annual rate of physical assault by an intimate was 44.2 per 1,000 women aged 18years and older and 31.5 per 1,000 men aged 18years and older. Thus, the14 NVAW Survey annual rate of physical assault by an intimate far exceeds the NCVS annual rate of violent victimization by an intimate. On the other hand, annual rates of physical assault generated from the NVAW Survey are substantially lower than those generated by the NFVS. The 1975 and 1985 NFVS found that11 to 12 percent of married/cohabiting women and 12 percent of married/cohabiting men were physically assaulted by their intimate partner an-nually. 8 The 1992 National Alcohol and Family Violence Survey found that approximately 1.9 percent of married/cohabiting women were se-verely assaulted by a male partner annually, and approximately 4.5 percent of married/cohabiting men were severely assaulted by a female partnerannually. 9 The 1995 National Alcohol Survey found that 5.2 to 13.6 percent of married/cohab- iting couples experienced male-to-female part-ner violence, and 6.2 to 18.2 percent of married/ cohabiting couples experienced female-to-male intimate partner violence. 10 In comparison, theNVAW Survey found that only 1.3 percent ofsurveyed women and 0.9 percent of surveyed men were physically assaulted by a current orformer intimate partner annually. The disparity in NFVS and NVAW findings is particularly striking because both surveys used similarbehaviorally specific questions to screen respondents for physical assault victimization. As discussed in this report (see \"Deciphering Disparities in Survey Findings\"), studies are needed to determine why the NCVS, NFVS, and NVAW Survey produced such disparate findingson the prevalence and incidence of intimate part- ner violence in the United States. Intimate partner stalking Prior to the NVAW Survey, information on stalk- ing prevalence was limited to guesses provided by mental health professionals based on their work with known stalkers. The most frequentlycited \"guesstimate\" was made by forensic psy- chiatrist Dr. Park Dietz, who reported in 1992that 5 percent of U.S. women are stalked at sometime in their lifetime, and 500,000 are stalked annually. 11 Because these figures pertain to stalking by all types of perpetrators, not justintimates, it is fair to say the NVAW Survey estimates\u2014that 4.8 percent of women have beenstalked by an intimate in their lifetimeand 503,485 women are stalked by an intimate each year\u2014are higher than previous stalking estimates.

Moreover, the sur- vey found that differences between women's and men's rates of physical assault by an intimatepartner become greater as the seriousness of the assault increases. For example, women were two or three times more likely than men to report thatan intimate partner threw something that could hurt them or pushed, grabbed, or shoved them. However, they were 7 to 14 times more likely toreport that an intimate partner beat them up, choked or tried to drown them, or threatened them with a gun or knife (exhibit 3). The NVAW Survey finding that women are sig- nificantly more likely than men to report being victimized by an intimate partner supports re-sults from the NCVS, which have consistently shown that women are at significantly greater risk of intimate partner violence (see note 3 in\"Introduction\"). However, it contradicts results from the NFVS, which have consistently shown that men and women are nearly equally likely tobe physically assaulted by marital or cohabiting partners (see note 2 in \"Introduction\").19 It is difficult to explain why the NCVS, NFVS, and NVAW Survey generated such disparate estimates of intimate partner violence or whythe NCVS and NVAW Survey produced evi- dence of asymmetry in women's and men's risk of intimate partner violence while the NFVSproduced evidence of symmetry. For years, re- searchers have attributed the low rate of intimate partner violence uncovered by the NCVS to thefact that it is administered in the context of a crime survey. Because they reflect only violence perpetrated by intimates that victims are willingto label as criminal and report to interviewers, estimates of intimate partner violence generated from the NCVS are thought to underestimatethe true amount of intimate partner violence. 1 At first glance, results from the NVAW Survey ap-pear to support this theory. The NVAW Survey\u2014which was administered in the context of a survey on personal safety rather than crime\u2014generated substantially higher intimate partner victimizationrates than those generated by the NCVS. It is likely, however, that methodological factors other than the overall context in which the two surveyswere administered account for some of the differ- ences in the findings. For example, the two surveys differ substantially with respect to sample design and survey admin- istration. The NVAW Survey sample was drawn by random-digit dialing from a database ofhouseholds with a telephone (see sidebar, \"Sur- vey Survey interviewers used state-of-the-art techniquesto protect theconfidentiality of the respondents and minimize the potential for retraumatizing victims of violence. In comparison, the NCVSsample consists of housing units (e.g., ad- dresses) selected from a stratified multistage cluster sample. When a sample unit isselected for inclusion in the NCVS, U.S. Census workers interview all individuals in the house- hold 12 years of age and older every 6 monthsfor 3 years. Thus, after the first interview, re- spondents know the contents of the survey. This may pose a problem for victims of domestic vio-lence who may be afraid that disclosing abuse by a family member may put them in danger of further abuse. Although census interviewersdocument whether others were present during the interview, time and budget constraints prevent them from ensuring privacy during an interview. In addition, screening questions used by the NVAW Survey and the NCVS differ substantially. For example, the NVAW Survey uses 5 ques-tions to screen respondents for rapes they may have sustained over their lifetime and 12 ques- tions to screen respondents for physical assaultsthey may have sustained as adults (see sidebar, \"Survey Screening Questions\"). Respondents disclosing victimization are asked additionalquestions about the victim-perpetrator relation- ship and the frequency, duration, and consequences of their victimization. In comparison, the NCVSuses four questions\u2014each with multiple compo- nents\u2014to screen respondents for threats, physi- cal and sexual attacks, and property crimes theymay have experienced in different locations and by different offenders. 2 Although empirical data on this issue are lacking, researchers assume thatboth the number of screening questions used and the manner in which they are asked affect disclosure rates. 3 Another possible reason for the difference in the NVAW Survey and NCVS findings is that published NCVS estimates count series victimization\u2014reportsof six or more crimes within a 6-month period for which the respondent cannot recall details of each crime\u2014as a single victimization. Thus, publishedDeciphering Disparities in Survey Findings20 Survey Methodology The National Violence Against Women (NVAW) Survey was conducted from No- vember 1995 to May 1996 by interviewers atSchulman, Ronca, Bucuvalas, Inc. (SRBI)under the direction of John Boyle. a The au- thors of this report designed the survey and conducted the analysis. The sample was drawn by random-digit dialing from a database of households with a telephone in the 50 States and the DistrictofColumbia. The sample was administered by U.S. Census region. Within each region, a simple random sample of working residential\"hundreds banks\" of phone numbers was drawn. (A hundreds bank is the first 8 digits of any 10-digit telephone number.) A ran-domly generated 2-digit number was ap- pended to each randomly sampled hundreds bank to produce the full 10-digit, random-digit number. Separate banks of numbers were generated for male and female respon- dents. These random-digit numbers werecalled by SRBI interviewers from their cen- tral telephone facility, where nonworking and nonresidential numbers were screenedout. Once a residential household was reached, eligible adults were identified. In households with more than one eligible adult,the adult with the most recent birthday was selected as the designated respondent. A total of 8,000 women and 8,005 men 18 years of age and older were interviewed using a computer-assisted telephone inter- viewing (CATI) system. (Five completed in-terviews with men were subsequently elimi- nated from the sample during data editing due to an excessive amount of inconsistentand missing data.) Only female interviewers surveyed female respondents. To test for pos- sible bias introduced by the gender of the in-terviewer, a split-sample approach was usedin the male sample whereby half of the inter- views were conducted by female interviewersand half by male interviewers. A Spanish- language translation was administered by bilingual interviewers to Spanish-speakingrespondents. To determine how representative the sample was, select demographic characteristics of theNVAW Survey sample were compared with demographic characteristics of the general population as measured by the U.S. CensusBureau's 1995 Current Population Survey of adult men and women. Sample weighting was considered to correct for possible biasesintroduced by the fact that some households had multiple phone lines and multiple eli- gibles and for over- and underrepresentationof selected subgroups. Although there were some instances of over- and underrepresenta- tion, the overall unweighted prevalence ratesfor rape, physical assault, and stalking were not significantly different from their respec- tive weighted rates. As a result, sampleweighting was not used in the analysis of thesurvey data. b Data were analyzed using SPSS Base 7.0 for Windows software. Measures of association were calculated between nominal-level independent and dependent variables. Thechi-square statistic was used to test for statis- tically significant differences between two groups (e.g., men and women), and theTukey's B statistic was used to test for statis- tically significant differences among two or more groups (e.g., whites, African-Americans,Asian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/ Alaska Natives, and mixed-race persons). Any estimates based on fewer than five responseswere deemed unreliable and, therefore, were not tested for statistically significant differ- ences between or among groups and were notpresented in the tables. Because estimates pre-21 sented in this report generally exclude \"don't know,\" \"refused,\" and other invalid responses, sample and subsample sizes ( n's) vary from table to table. Because the actual number of victims that is insufficient to reliably calculate estimatesvaries depending on the rarity of the exposure and the denominator of the subgroup being analyzed, the relative standard error (RSE)was calculated for each estimate presented. (RSE is the ratio of the standard error divided by the actual point estimate.) Estimates withRSEs that exceed 30 percent were deemed un- stable and were not tested for statistically sig- nificant differences between or among groups.These estimates have been identified in the tables and should be viewed with caution. The estimates from this survey, as from any sample survey, are subject to random sam- pling error. Exhibit 4 presents the estimated standard errors multiplied by the z-score (1.96) for specified sample and subsample sizes of 16,000 or less at different response distributions of dichotomous variables (e.g.,raped/not raped, injured/not injured). Theseestimated standard errors can be used to determine the extent to which sample esti- mates will be distributed (bounded) aroundthe population parameter (i.e., the true pop- ulation distribution). As exhibit 4 shows, larger sample and subsample sizes producesmaller estimated bounds. Thus, the esti- mated bound at the 95-percent confidence level for a sample or subsample of 8,000 is1.1 percentage points if the response distri- bution is a 50/50 split, whereas the estimated bound at the 95-percent confidence level fora sample or subsample of 50 is 14 percentage points if the response distribution is a 50/50 split. a.

A technical report describing the survey methods in more detail and recording sample characteristics andprevalence rates using weighted and unweighted datawill be available from the Centers \"Other Publications inthe Series\"). NCVS estimates of the number of intimate partner rapes, sexual assaults, and physical assaults are lower than would be obtained by including all inci- dents reported to its survey interviewers. To produceNCVS estimates more directly comparable to those generated by the NVAW Survey, each crime in a se- ries of victimizations reported to NCVS interviewerswould have to be counted. Finally, the sampling errors associated with theestimates from the NVAW Survey and theNCVS would have to be compared to determine whether estimates generated by the two surveys actually differ or whether apparent differencesare not statistically significant.Differences between the NVAW Survey and the NFVS estimates are somewhat harder to explain because the two surveys used similar sampling strategies and the Conflict Tactics Scale toscreen respondents for physical assaults by intimates (see sidebar, Ques- tions\"). Straus argues the NVAW Survey gener-ated annual rates of physical assault by an intimate partner that were substantially lower than those generated by the NFVS because itwas presented to respondents as a survey on personal safety. 4 According to Straus, the term \"personal safety\" led many respondents to perceive the NVAW Survey as a crime study and, therefore, to restrict their reports to \"real crimes.\"22 Aside from being inherently safety\" conjure very different images\u2014this fails to explain why the NVAW Survey generated highlifetime intimate partner victimization rates that are generally consistent with findings from other surveys or why the NVAW Survey uncoveredhigh rates of other forms of family violence, such as incest and physical abuse of children by adult caretakers. 5 It is unlikely that using the term \"per- sonal safety\" in the NVAW Survey introduction would have set up a perceptual screen for intimate partner violence experienced in the previous 12months but not for intimate partner violence expe- rienced over the course of the respondent's life- time. Similarly, it is unlikely that using the term\"personal safety\" in the NVAW Survey introduc- tion would have set up a perceptual screen for one type of family violence (e.g., physical assaultsbymarital/cohabiting partners) but not for other types of family violence (e.g., incest and physical assault by caretakers in childhood). A more plausible explanation for the disparity in the NFVS and NVAW Survey findings is the dif- ferent ways the two surveys frame and introduce screening questions about intimate partner vio-lence. In the NFVS, respondents are queried about specific acts of intimate partner violence they may have committed or sustained againsttheir current partner. Published NFVS estimates of the number of women and men who experi- ence intimate partner violence annually countreports of both perpetration and victimization. Inother words, if a woman reports that she as- saulted her husband, her report is counted as amale victimization. Similarly, if a man reports that he assaulted his wife, his report is countedExhibit 4.

To produce NFVS estimates directly comparable with NVAW Sur- vey estimates, perpetrations reported to NFVS interviewers would have to be excluded. In addition, the NFVS introduces screening questions about intimate partner violence perpe- tration and victimization with an exculpatorystatement that acknowledges the pervasiveness of marital/partner conflict. Although this ap- proach may seem more accepting of intimatepartner violence and, therefore, more likely to result in disclosure of intimate partner violence, it may also be considered more leading. Finally, the NFVS frames its screening ques- tions in terms of how many times in the past 12 months respondents have committed or sustainedthese violent acts rather than whether they have ever committed or sustained these violent acts. This approach assumes intimate partner violenceis the norm and requires respondents who nei- ther committed nor sustained such violence to provide an answer to the contrary. By contrast, the NVAW Survey queries respon- dents only about their experiences with victim- ization. Furthermore, the NVAW Survey doesnot use an exculpatory statement to introduce screening questions. Rather than asking respon- dents how many times they have sustained actsof intimate partner violence in the past 12 months, the NVAW Survey asks respondents whether they ever sustained violent acts at thehands of any type of perpetrator and, if so, whether their perpetrator was a current or past intimate partner. Only respondents who reportthey have ever experienced such acts are asked whether these acts were perpetrated in the past 12 months. While this approach may be consid-ered less accepting of intimate partner violence and therefore less likely to result in disclosure, itmay also be considered less leading. In summary, it is likely that the manner in which screening questions are introduced and framed has more of an effect on intimate partner victim-ization rates than does the overall context in which the survey is administered. Clearly, more research is needed to fully understand how methodological factors such as sample design,survey administration, survey introduction, and question wording affect research findings on intimate partner violence.

For example, 40 percent of surveyed women and 54 percent of surveyed men said they were physi-cally assaulted as a child by an adult caretaker. Inaddition, 9 percent of surveyed women said theywere raped before age 18. Of these rape victims, 76percent were raped by a relative. See Tjaden, P., andN.

Please mention it even if you are not certain it was a crime. 3) People often don't think of incidents committed by someone they know. Did you have something stolen from you, OR were you attacked orthreatened by: a) Someone at work or school? b) A neighbor or friend?c) A relative or family member?d) Any other person you've met or known? 4) Incidents involving forced or unwanted sexual acts are often difficult to talk about.Have you been forced or coerced to engagein unwanted sexual activity by: a) Someone you didn't know before? b) A casual acquaintance?c) Someone you know well? 3. For example, see Helton, A.M., \"The Pregnant Battered Women,\" Responses to Victimization of25 Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Among Racial Minorities and Hispanics As noted, previous studies have produced contradictory findings as to whether race and ethnicity affect one's risk for involvement inintimate partner violence (see notes 4 and 5 in \"Introduction\"). Most of these studies compare victimization rates of only one minority groupwith those of whites, and others compare victim- ization rates of all minority groups with those of whites. None compare victimization rates ofseveral diverse racial groups. To determine victimization rates for women and men of diverse racial backgrounds, respondentsto the NVAW Survey were asked whether they would best classify themselves as white, black or African-American, Asian or Pacific Islander,American Indian or Alaska Native, or of mixed race. They were also asked whether they were of Hispanic origin. The response rate on both thesequestions was very high (98 and 99 percent, respectively).When data on African-American, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and mixed-race respondents are combined, nonwhitewomen and men report significantly more inti- mate partner violence than do their white coun- terparts (exhibit 5). These findings suggest thatall racial minorities experience more intimate partner violence than do whites. However, a comparison of intimate partner vic- timization rates among persons of specific racial backgrounds shows that different types of minori- ties report significantly different rates of intimatepartner violence. In general, American Indian/ Alaska Native women report significantly higher rates of intimate partner violence than do womenof other racial backgrounds, and Asian/Pacific Islander women and men report significantly lower rates (exhibit 6). T hese findings underscore the need for research on intimate partner violence among specific racial and ethnic groups. As the Exhibit 5.

The finding that American Indians/Alaska Na- tive women report significantly higher rates ofintimate partner violence is consistent with previous research that shows American Indian couples are significantly more violent than theirwhite counterparts. 1 However, a paucity of infor- mation on violence against American Indians makes it difficult to explain why they reportmore intimate partner violence. How much of the difference in intimate partner victimization rates among American Indian/Alaska Nativewomen and those of other racial backgrounds may be explained by differences in willingness to report victimization to interviewers and howmuch by actual victimization experiences is un- clear and requires further study. Moreover, theremay be significant differences in intimate part- ner victimization rates among women (and men) of diverse American Indian tribes and Alaska Native communities that cannot be discernedfrom the survey. Finally, research is needed to ascertain how much of the difference in intimate partner victimization rates among Native Ameri-cans and persons of different racial backgrounds may be explained by demographic, social, and environmental factors. Because information on violence against Asian/ Pacific Islander women and men is also limited, it is difficult to explain why they reported sig-nificantly less intimate partner violence than did women and men of other racial backgrounds. It has been suggested that traditional Asian valuesemphasizing close family ties and harmony may discourage Asian women from disclosing physi- cal and emotional abuse by intimates. 2 Thus, the lower intimate partner victimization rates found among Asian/Pacific Islander women may be, atExhibit 6.

There may also be significant differences in rates of intimate partner violence between Asian and Pacific Islander women that cannot be discernedfrom the survey because data on these two groups are combined. Finally, there may be significant differences between Asian/PacificIslander women born in this country and those who immigrated. A recent nonrepresentative study of immigrant Korean women found that60 percent had been battered by their husbands. 3 Clearly, more research is recommended on vio-lence committed by intimates against Asian andPacific Islander women. The survey found little difference in Hispanic and non-Hispanic women's reports of intimatepartner physical assault and intimate partner stalking. However, Hispanic women were sig- nificantly more likely than non-Hispanic womento report that they were raped by a current or former intimate partner at some time in their lifetime (exhibit 7). These findings are notewor-thy because previously published NVAW Survey findings show that Hispanic women report sig-nificantly less rape victimization than do non- Hispanic women when all types of perpetrators are considered. 4 Future research should focus on why Hispanic women are less likely to be rapedby a nonintimate but more likely to be raped by an intimate. The survey found no significant difference in reports of intimate partner violence among Hispanic and non-Hispanic men (exhibit 7). However, this finding must be viewed withcaution, given the small number of Hispanic male victims. Notes 1.

Song, Y.I., \"Battered Korean Women in Urban America: The Relationship of Cultural Conflict toWife Abuse,\" unpublished doctoral dissertation,Ohio State University, Columbus, 1986.29 Research on violence in same-sex relationships has been limited to studies of small, unrepresen- tative samples of gay and lesbian couples. Re-sults from these studies suggest that same-sex couples are about as violent as heterosexual couples. 1 Although the NVAW Survey did not ask respon- dents about their sexual orientation, it did ask them whether they had ever lived with a same-sex partner as part of a couple. As such, it is pos- sible to compare intimate partner victimization rates among women and men who have a historyof same-sex cohabitation with women and men who have a history of marital/opposite-sex cohabitation only.The survey found that 1 percent of surveyed women (n = 79) and 0.8 percent of surveyed men (n = 65) reported living with a same-sex intimate partner at least once in their lifetime, and 90 percent of surveyed women ( n = 7,193) and 86 percent of surveyed men ( n = 6,879) reported marrying/ living with an opposite-sex partner but never with a same-sex partner. For brevity's sake, the former will be referred to as same-sexcohabitants and the latter will be referred to as opposite-sex cohabitants. It is unknown how many same-sex or opposite-sex cohabitantsidentified themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual at the time of the interview.Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Among Same-Sex Cohabitants Exhibit 8.

Thus, same-sex cohabiting women were nearly three times more likely to report beingvictimized by a male partner than by a female partner. Moreover, opposite-sex cohabiting women were nearly twice as likely to reportbeing victimized by a male partner than were same-sex cohabiting women by a female partner (20.3 percent and 11.4 percent) (exhibit 9).The survey found that same-sex cohabitants reported significantly more intimate partner violence than did opposite-sex cohabitants.Among women, 39.2 percent of the same-sex cohabitants and 21.7 percent of the opposite- sex cohabitants reported being raped, physicallyassaulted, and/or stalked by a marital/cohabiting partner at some time in their lifetime. Among men, the comparable figures are 23.1 percentand 7.4 percent (exhibit 8). At first glance, these findings suggest that both male and female same-sex couples experiencemore intimate partner violence than do opposite- sex couples. However, a comparison of intimateExhibit 9.

Like their female counterparts, same-sex cohabiting men were more likely to report being victimized by a male partner than by a femalepartner. Specifically, 15.4 percent of same-sex cohabiting men reported being raped, physically assaulted, and/or stalked by a male partner, but10.8 percent reported such violence by a female partner. However, same-sex cohabiting men were nearly twice as likely to report being vic-timized by a male partner than were opposite- sex cohabiting men by a female partner (15.4 percent and 7.7 percent). These findings suggestthat intimate partner violence is perpetrated pri- marily by men, whether against male or female partners. Note 1. Brand, P., and A.

It is important to note that the pres-ence of a risk factor does not mean that the be- havior will necessarily occur, only that the odds of it occurring are greater. Numerous studies have examined risk factors associated with intimate partner violence. Re- sults from these studies show that unmarried,cohabiting couples have higher rates of intimate partner violence than do married couples 1; mi- norities have higher rates of intimate partnerviolence than do whites (see note 5 in \"Introduc- tion\"); lower income women have higher rates of intimate partner violence than do higher incomewomen 2; less educated women have higher rates of intimate partner violence than do more edu- cated women3; and couples with income, educa- tional, or occupational status disparities have higher rates of intimate partner violence than do couples with no status disparity.4 Research also shows that experiencing and/or witnessing violence in one's family of origin increases one's chances of being a perpetrator or victim of inti-mate partner violence. 5 In addition, research shows that wife assault is more common in families where power is concentrated in thehands of the husband or male partner and the husband makes most of the decisions regarding family finances and strictly controls when andwhere his wife or female partner goes. 6 Finally, research suggests that persons with a disability are at greater risk of violence,7 although there is no empirical evidence that having a disability increases one's risk of intimate partner violence. To increase understanding of risk factors associ- ated with intimate partner violence, logistic regressions were conducted using a backward stepwise procedure on respondents married orcohabiting with a partner at the time of the inter- view to determine what characteristics of the re- lationship, respondent, or partner differentiatedthose who reported being victimized by their current partner from those who didnot. Separate analyses were conducted for women ( n = 4,896) and men ( n = 5,056). In each of the logistic regressions, the dependent variable was whether the respondent reportedbeing raped, physically assaulted, or stalked by his or her current spouse or cohabiting partner. The independent variables were as follows: lWhether the respondent was cohabiting versus married. lWhether the respondent was white, African- American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, or mixed race. lWhether the respondent was Hispanic. lWhether the respondent's race and/or His-panic origin was different from the partner's. lWhether the respondent's education level was a high school diploma or less. lWhether the respondent's education level washigher than the partner's. lWhether the respondent was physically assaulted as a child by an adult caretaker. lWhether the partner was jealous or possessive. lWhether the partner denied the respondentaccess to family, friends, or family income. lWhether the partner called the respondent names or shouted or swore at the respondent in front of other people. lWhether the respondent was physically disabled when the relationship started.Risk Factors Associated With Intimate Partner Violence34 violence perpetrated against women by male partners is part of a systematic pattern of domi- nance and control, or what some researchers have called \"patriarchal terrorism.\"8 Results of the logistic regressions for both women and men support the theory that couples with status disparities experience more intimatepartner violence than do couples with no status disparities. Women were significantly more likely to report violence by a current partnerif their education level was greater than their partner's, and men were significantly more likely to report being victimized by their currentpartner if their race and/or Hispanic origin was different from their partner's (see tables I and II in sidebar, \"Results of the Logistic Regressions\").

Income variables were not included in the analyses because of thelarge number of respondents who refused to provide information about their or their partner's income. The results of the logistic regression reveal a strong link between child maltreatment and subsequent victimization by an intimate partner.Women and men who were physically assaulted as children by adult caretakers were signifi- cantly more likely to report being victimized bytheir current partner, even when the effects of other independent variables were controlled (see tables I and II in sidebar, \"Results of theLogistic Regressions\"). It is possible that per- sons victimized aschildren by adult caretakers were more tolerant of persons who engaged inviolent and threatening behaviors as adults and, therefore, more likely to get involved with abu- sive partners. However, it is also possible thatrespondents who reported one type of victimiza- tion (e.g., child maltreatment) were simply more willing to report other types of victimization(e.g., intimate partner violence). Clearly, more research is recommended on the possible link between childhood victimization and intimatepartner victimization. Results of the logistic regression for women, but not men, support previous research thatshows unmarried couples are at greater risk of intimate partner violence than married couples, and African-American couples are at greaterrisk than white couples. They also show a strong link between violence and emotionally abusive and controlling behavior in intimaterelationships. Indeed, having a verbally abusive partner was associated with the largest change in the odds that a woman would be victimizedby an intimate partner (see table I in sidebar, \"Results of the Logistic Regressions\").

This as-sumption is based on two types of evidence: Divorced or separated women report more inti- mate partner violence than do married women. 1 Also, interviews with men who have killed their wives indicate that either threats of separation by their partner or actual separation are most oftenthe precipitating events that lead to the murder. 2 The NVAW Survey found that married womenwho lived apart from their husbands were nearlyfour times more likely to report that their hus- bands had raped, physically assaulted, and/or stalked them than were women who lived withtheir husbands (20 percent and 5.4 percent). Similarly, married men who lived apart from their wives were nearly three times more likelyto report that their wives had victimized them than were men who lived with their wives (7.0 percent and 2.4 percent). These findings suggestthat termination of a relationship poses an in- creased risk of intimate partner violence for both women and men. However, it should be notedthat the survey data do not indicate whether the violence happened before, after, orat the time the couple separated. Thus, it is unclear whetherthe separation triggered the violence or the vio- lence triggered the separation. To test the assumption that the termination of a relationship leads to an increased risk of inti- mate partner violence, the NVAW Survey asked women victimized by a former spouse or cohab-iting partner whether their victimization oc- curred before , after, or both before and after the relationship ended. Only 6.3 percent of the rapevictims and 4.2 percent of the physical assault victims said their victimization started after the relationship ended (exhibit 10). These findingssuggest most rapes and physical assaults perpe- trated against women by intimates occur in the context of an ongoing rather than terminated Exhibit 10. Distribution of Female Victims of Intimate Partner Rape, Physical Assault, and Stalking, by Point in Relationship When the Violence Occurred Rape victims (n = 288)Physical assault victims (n = 1,061)Stalking victims (n = 263) 69.1% 24.7% 6.3%18.2%36.4%20.8%42.8% 4.2%77.6% Before relationship ended Both before and after relationship endedAfter relationship ended Note: Estimates are based on responses from women who were victimized by a former spouse or cohabiting partner since age 18.38 relationship. In comparison, 42.8 percent of thestalking victims said their victimization started after the relationship ended. Thus, stalk- ing is more likely to occur in the context of aterminated relationship than is rape or physical assault. It is not possible to ascertain from the data whether violence occurring before the relation- ship ended was linked to threats about leaving the relationship. It is also unclear whetherwomen who said they were victimized before and after the relationship ended experienced more severe violence at the time of separation.Finally, it is important to note that when a rela- tionship ends is a matter of interpretation rather than objective reality. Some women may haveequated the end of the relationship with when they or their partner first started talking about leaving the relationship, whereas others mayhave equated it with the formal dissolution ofa marriage. Clearly, more research is needed on how terminating a relationship increases the risk of intimate partner violence for women and men. Notes 1. Klaus, P., and M.

(Stalking victims were not asked how many times they were stalked by the samepartner because stalking by definition means re- peated acts of threat and harassment.) Overall, fe- male rape victims averaged 4.5 rapes by the samepartner, and female physical assault victims aver- aged 6.9 assaults. Among women who were vic- timized multiple times by the same partner, 62.6percent of the rape victims and 69.5 percent of theassault victims said their victimization lasted a year or more. On average, women who were raped multiple times said their victimizationoccurredover 3.8 years, and women who were physically assaulted multiple times said their vic- timization occurred over 4.5 years (exhibit 11). The survey also found that much of the violence perpetrated against men by intimates is chronic in nature. Two-thirds (66.2 percent) of the physi-cally assaulted men said they were assaulted more than once by the same intimate partner. Of these, 66.2 percent said their victimizationlasted a year or more. On average, male victims of intimate partner physical assault reported 4.4 assaults by the same partner. On average, men Exhibit 11.

Although much of the physical assault perpetrated against men by intimates is chronic, it is important to notethat both the average frequency and the average duration of physical assaults perpetrated against women by intimates are significantly higher thanthe average frequency/duration of physical as- saults perpetrated against men by intimates.41 Rate of Injury Among Victims of Intimate Partner Rape and Physical Assault To generate information on the extent and nature of injuries associated with violent victimization, respondents disclosing rape and physical assaultwere asked whether they were injured during their most recent victimization and, if so, the types of injuries they sustained. (Respondentsdisclosing stalking victimization were not asked these questions because the definition of stalking used in the survey does not include behaviorsthat inflict physical harm.) Exhibit 12.

(Estimates were not calcu- lated for male rape victims because there were fewer than five victims when stratified by vari-ables.) The survey also found that women physi- cally assaulted by an intimate were more than twice as likely as their male counterparts (41.5percent and 19.9 percent, respectively) to be42 joints, head or spinal cord injuries, chipped or broken teeth, or internal injuries (exhibit 13). Risk factors associated with injury Logistic regression was used to determine whatcharacteristics of the victim, perpetrator, andincident may increase the risk of injury during intimate partner rapes and physical assaults. Separate regressions, using a backward stepwiseprocedure, were conducted for female victims of intimate partner rape ( n = 374), female victims of intimate partner physical assault ( n = 1,254), and male victims of intimate partner physical assault (n = 479). In each of the regressions, the dependent vari- able was whether the victim was injured during her or his most recent victimization by an intimate. The independent variables were asfollows: lWhether the perpetrator was a spouse, cohab-iting partner, or date.injuredduring their most recent victimization (ex- hibit 12). This finding supports previous research that shows women are more likely than men to be injured during an assault by an intimate. 1 Injury estimates for female victims of intimate partner violence generated by the NVAW Survey are somewhat lower than injury estimates gener-ated by the NCVS. A recent study conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 51 percent of the assaults perpetrated against women by intimatesduring 1992-96 resulted in some type of injury to the victim. 2 The higher rate of injury uncovered by the NCVS suggests that the context in which that study is administered and the type of screening questions used leads respondents to report more serious types of assaults to interviewers. Most of the women who were injured during their most recent intimate partner rape or physical as- sault sustained relatively minor injuries, such asscratches, bruises, and welts. Relatively few women sustained more serious types of injuries, such as lacerations, broken bones, dislocated Exhibit 13.

Results of the logistic regression show that women raped by an intimate partner were signifi-cantly more likely to be injured if they were Hispanic, if their perpetrator was a spouse or cohabiting partner (rather than a date), if theirperpetrator threatened to harm or kill them or someone close to them, and if their perpetrator was using drugs or alcohol at the time of theincident (see table III in sidebar, \"Results of the Logistic Regressions\" in \"Risk Factors Associated With Intimate Partner Violence\"). In comparison, women who were physically as- saulted by an intimate partner were significantly more likely to be injured if their perpetrator threat-ened to harm or kill them or someone close to them and if the perpetrator was using drugs or alcohol at the time of the incident (see table IV in sidebar, \"Results of the Logistic Regressions\" in \"Risk Fac- tors Associated With Intimate Partner Violence\"). Finally, results of the logistic regression show that men who were physically assaulted by an intimate partner were significantly more likely to be injured if their perpetrator threatened to harm or kill themor someone close to them and if their perpetrator used a weapon (see table V in sidebar, \"Results of the Logistic Regressions\" in \"Risk Factors Associ-ated With Intimate Partner Violence\").Results of the logistic regressions show a strong link between threats of bodily injury and actual occurrences of injury. These findings imply that threats of violence should be taken seriously,and violence prevention strategies should em- phasize this fact. Results also show a strong link between drug and alcohol use on the part of theperpetrator and victim injury. These findings suggest that some of the inhibitors that may prevent persons from hurting others under ordi-nary circumstances are relaxed when persons are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Somewhat fewer women and men who wereinjured during their most recent physical assault received some type of medical care (28.1 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively) (exhibit 12). Injuredwomen and men had similar rates and types of medical care. This indicates that injuries sustained by women and men were similar in severity. Some victims received more than one type of medical care (e.g., hospitalization as well as outpatient physical therapy), whereas others re-ceived a specific type of medical care more than once (e.g., 13 physical therapy sessions). Thus, the annual number of medical treatments pro-vided to intimate partner rape and physical assaultvictims exceeds the annual number ofintimate partner victimizations that resulted in treatment. Estimates of medical services utilization Exhibit 14 provides estimates of the average number of nights spent in the hospital and the average number of visits made to specific medi- cal providers by adult victims of intimate partnerrape and physical assault. These estimates are based on responses from victims who received the specific type of medical care considered. Forexample, the estimate of the average number of nights spent in the hospital by female intimate partner rape victims (3.9) is based only on re-sponses by female intimate partner rape victims treated in a hospital on an inpatient basis. Some of the average frequency estimates are based ona very small number of responses and, therefore, have a relatively high margin of error (see foot- notes c through f in exhibit 14). Exhibit 14.

The remaining esti-mates are based on the most recent intimate part- ner victimization since age 18 (see exhibits 12 and 14). As these estimates show, women andmen made 557,929 visits to hospital emergency rooms for injuries sustained during rapes and physical assaults perpetrated by intimate part-ners in the year preceding the survey. Fully 87 percent (486,151) of these visits were made bywomen. These findings support results from pre- vious studies that show a significant number ofwomen who have experienced intimate partner violence are seen in hospital emergency rooms. 1 The NVAW Survey estimate of women and men treated by hospital emergency department per- sonnel is substantially higher than an estimate generated from the Study of Injured Victims ofViolence (SIVV), a hospital record-extraction study conducted for the Bureau of Justice Statis- tics by the Consumer Product Safety Commis-sion. The SIVV found that, during 1994, hospi- tal emergency department personnel treated an estimated 243,400 women and men for injuriessustained at the hands of spouses, ex-spouses,Exhibit 15.

However, the SIVV could not identify the patient/offender relationship in 28.8 percent (407,600) of the hospital emergencydepartment visits identified by the study. If just half of these visits were to victims of intimate partner violence, NVAW Survey and SIVVestimateswould be more similar.Notes 1. Abbott, J., R. Johnson, J. Koziol-McLain, and S.R.

Thus, of the esti-mated 322,230 intimate partner rapes perpe- trated against U.S. women in the 12 months preceding the survey, only 55,424 were reportedto law enforcement. (The 322,230 estimate is based on responses from 16 women and shouldtherefore be viewed with caution.) The vast ma- jority of the reported rapes were reported within 24 hours. Most of the reports were made by thevictim, rather than a friend, relative, or other third party (exhibit 16). The survey found that women who were physi- cally assaulted by an intimate were significantly more likely than their male counterparts to report their victimization to the police (26.7 percent and Exhibit 16.

Similarly, female victims of intimate partner stalking were signifi-cantly more likely than their male counterparts to report their victimization to the police (51.9 per- cent and 36.2 percent, respectively) (exhibit 16).As with reports of intimate partner rape, most of the physical assault and stalking reports were made within 24 hours of the incident, and mostwere made by the victim. Police response to reports of intimate partner violence Survey findings confirm that the majority of reports of intimate partner violence made to thepolice result in an officer taking a statement , that is, conducting a face-to-face interview with the victim (exhibit 16). The survey found no evi-dence that police respond differently to womenthan men stalked by an intimate. However, there is some evidence that police respond differentlyto women than men who are physically assaulted by an intimate. A comparison of police responses to reports of physical assault committed againstwomen and men by intimates showed that police were significantly more likely to take a report and to arrest or detain the perpetrator if the victimwas female (exhibit 16). Although it is unclear from the survey data why police respond differently to reports of physical assaults involving femalethan male victims, it is possible they do so be- cause physical assaults committed against women tend to be more chronic and more injurious.

In addition, 16 percent reported they were too ashamed orwanted to keep the incident private, and 13 percent said the police could not do anything (exhibit 17). When asked why they chose not to report their victimization to the police, nearly all of the physical assault victims said they did not thinkthe police could do anything about their victim- ization, whereas 61.5 percent of the women and 45 percent of the men said the police would nothave believed them. In addition, approximately one-third of the women and one-quarter of the men said they did not want the police or courtsinvolved (exhibit 17). These findings suggest that many victims of intimate partner violence\u2014 men and women alike\u2014do not consider the jus- tice system a viable or appropriate interventionat the time of their victimization. Note that significantly more women than men chose not to report their physical assault tothepolice because they were afraid of their attacker, whereas significantly more men than women chose not to report their physical assault to thepolice because they considered it a minor or one-time incident. These findings underscore the fact that violence committed against women byintimates tends to be more threatening and se- vere than violence committed against men by intimates. The survey found no significant differences between women's and men's reasons for not re- porting their stalking to the police. However, thesefindings should be viewed with caution given the small number of male victims (exhibit 17). Exhibit 18.

Only 7.5 percent of the women who were raped by an intimate, 7.3percent of the women who were physically as- saulted by an intimate, and 14.6 percent of the women who were stalked by an intimate saidtheir attacker was criminally prosecuted (exhibit 18). These figures increase to 31.1 percent, 24.7 percent, and 25.4 percent, respectively (notshown in exhibit 18), when only victims whose stalking was reported to the police are consid- ered. According to women's perceptions of theoutcome of the prosecution, less than one-half ofthe intimate partner perpetrators who had criminal charges filed against them wereconvicted of a crime (exhibit 18). The number of victims ( n < 5) was insufficient to reliably calculate prosecution estimates formalevictims of intimate partner rape or stalking. However, prosecution estimates for male victims of physical assault show that violence commit-ted against men by intimates is even less likely to be criminally prosecuted than violence com- mitted against women by intimates. Only 1.1percent of the men who were physically as- saulted by an intimate since the age of 18 said their attacker was criminally prosecuted (exhibit 18). This figure increases to 4.1 percent whenonly victims whose physical assault was reported to the police are considered. Temporary restraining orders The survey found that female victims of intimate partner violence were significantly more likely than their male counterparts to obtain a protec- tive or restraining order against their assailant.Specifically, 17.1 percent of the women but only 3.5 percent of the men who were physically assaulted by an intimate obtained a restrainingorder against their assailant after their most recent victimization. Similarly, 36.6 percent ofthewomen but only 17 percent of the menwho were stalked by an intimate obtained a re- straining order against their assailant (exhibit 19). These findings suggest that women aremore frightened by intimates who victimize them. They also underscore the fact that violence committed against women by intimates is morechronic and severe than violence committed against men by intimates. Exhibit 19.

Similarly,menwho were stalked by an intimate were sig- nificantly more likely to obtain a restraining order than were men who were physically as-saulted. A recent study by the American Bar Association may help explain these findings. The study found that victims of violence rarelyseek restraining orders as a form of early inter- vention but rather as an act of desperation after they have experienced extensive problems. 1 Because stalking by definition involves repeated acts of harassment and threats, stalking victims were more likely than rape or physical assaultvictims to have experienced extensive problems and to have felt a sense of desperation. Information from the survey confirms previous reports that most temporary restraining orders are violated. 2 More than two-thirds of the re- straining orders obtained by women against inti-mates who raped or stalked them were violated, and approximately one-half of the orders ob- tained by women against intimates who physi-cally assaulted them were violated. Similarly, more than two-thirds of the restraining ordersobtained by men against intimates who physi- cally assaulted them and nearly nine-tenths of the orders obtained by men against intimateswho stalked them were violated (exhibit 19). Estimates of justice system utilization Exhibit 20 presents estimates of the number of inti-mate partner rape, physical assault, and stalkingvictimizations that result in a report to the police, an arrest, a criminal filing, a conviction, and a tem- porary restraining order annually. The first row ofestimates is based on reported incidents of intimate partner violence in the past 12 months (see exhibit 2). The remaining estimates are based on the mostrecent intimate partner victimization since age 18 (see exhibits 16, 18, and 19). According to these estimates,law enforcement personnel receive1,966,659 reports of intimate partner rape, physical assault, and stalking annually. It is unclear from the data how police personnel classify these reports.For example, police may classify some physical assault reports as threats or intimidation, and they may classify some stalking cases as trespassing orvandalism.Exhibit 20.

It is unclear how many of these suspects are charged with misdemeanor versus felony crimes. It is alsounclear what specific types of charges are filed against these suspects (e.g., simple versus aggra- vated assault, stalking, harassment). Survey estimates show that 1,131,999 victims ofintimate partner rape, physical assault, and stalking obtain protective or restraining ordersagainst their attackers annually. Approximately 60 percent (646,809) of these orders are violated. Notes 1.

Information generated from the survey and presented in this report also ad- dresses many controversial issues surroundingintimate partner violence research, such as whether women and men suffer equal rates of violence at the hands of intimate partners,whether race and Hispanic origin affect one's risk of intimate partner violence, and whether violence is more prevalent among same-sexcohabitants compared with heterosexual cohabi- tants. Thus, information presented in this report can help inform policy and intervention directedat violence perpetrated against women and men by intimate partners. Based on findings from the survey, the following conclusions can be drawn. 1. Intimate partner violence should be treated as a significant social problem. Analysis of the survey data validates previous research thatshows intimate partner violence is a pervasive and serious social problem in the United States. According to survey estimates, approximately1.5 million U.S. women and 834,732 U.S. men are raped and/or physically assaulted by an inti- mate partner annually. Because many of thesevictims suffer multiple victimizations, the num- ber of intimate partner rapes and physical as- saults perpetrated annually exceeds the numberof intimate partner victims annually. Thus, an estimated 322,230 rapes and 4.5 million physical assaults are committed against U.S. women byintimate partners annually, and an estimated 2.9 million physical assaults are committed against U.S. men by intimate partners annually. [The es-timated number of rapes perpetrated against U.S. women annually is based on 16 women who re- ported being raped by an intimate partner in the12 months preceding the survey and should be viewed with caution. Furthermore, the number of male victims was insufficient ( n < 5) to calculate the number of intimate partner rapes committed against men annually.] In addition, 503,485 U.S. women and 185,496 U.S. men arestalked by intimates annually. Given the perva- siveness of intimate partner rapes, physical as- saults, and stalkings committed against womenand men annually, it is imperative that intimate partner violence be treated as a major criminal justice and public health concern. 2. Women report significantly more intimate partner violence than do men. The survey found that women were significantly more likelythan men to report being victimized by an inti- mate partner whether the type of violence was rape, physical assault, or stalking and whetherthe period was the victim's lifetime or the 12 months preceding the survey. Moreover, women who were physically assaulted by an intimatepartner averaged significantly more assaults and suffered significantly more injuries than did their male counterparts. Given these findings, intimatepartner violence should be considered first and foremost a crime against women, and prevention strategies should reflect this fact. 3. Studies are needed to determine why different national surveys have produced such disparate findings with respect to women'sand men's experiences with intimate partner violence. Prior to the NVAW Survey, national information on women's and men's annual expe-riences with physical assault by an intimate came primarily from the Bureau of Justice Sta- tistics' NCVS and the NFVS. The NVAW Sur-vey finding that women report significantly more intimate partner violence than do men is consistent with findings from the NCVS but56 inconsistent with findings from the NFVS. Al- though the NVAW Survey and the NFVS used similarbehaviorally specific questions to screen respondents for physical assault, victimizationestimates generated from the NVAW Survey are substantially lower than those generated from the NFVS. Conversely, NVAW Survey victimiza-tion estimates are substantially higher than those generated from the NCVS. Studies are needed to determine how methodological differences, suchas the context in which the survey is administered and question wording, affect women's and men's reporting of intimate partner violence. 4. Studies are needed to determine why the prevalence of intimate partner violence varies significantly among women of different racialand ethnic backgrounds. The survey found that American Indian/Alaska Native women report significantly more intimate partner rapes thandowomen from other racial backgrounds, and Asian/Pacific Islander women report significantly fewer intimate partner physical assaults. In addi-tion, Hispanic women report significantly more intimate partner rapes than do non-Hispanic women. However, differences between minoritygroups diminish when certain demographic and relationship variables are controlled. It is unclear from the survey data whether dif- ferences in intimate partner victimization rates among women of different racial and ethnic groups are caused by differences in reportingpractices. It is also unclear how social, environ- mental, and demographic factors intersect with race and ethnicity to produce differences in inti-mate partner victimization rates among women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Thus, more research is needed to establish the degree ofvariance in the prevalence of intimate partner vio- lence among women (and men) of diverse racial and ethnic groups and to determine how much ofthe variance may be explained by differences in such factors as cultural attitudes, community ser- vices, and income. Research is also needed todetermine whether differences exist in intimate partner victimization rates for women of diverseAsian/Pacific Islander groups, American Indian tribes, and Alaska Native communities. Finally, research is needed to determine whether differ- ences exist in intimate partner victimization ratesamong minority women born in the United States and those who have recently immigrated. 5. Intimate partner violence is more prevalent among male same-sex couples than female same-sex couples. Findings from the NVAW Survey refute earlier findings that same-sexcouples are about as violent as heterosexual couples. Male same-sex cohabitants were more likely to report victimization by a male partnerthan were male opposite-sex cohabitants by a female partner. In comparison, female same-sex cohabitants reported less violence by a femalepartner than didfemale heterosexual cohabitants by a male partner. These findings suggest that gay male couples are more violent than lesbiancouples, whereas lesbian couples are less violent than heterosexual couples. These findings also indicate that intimate partner violence is perpe-trated primarily by men, whether against same-sex oropposite-sex partners. 6. Violence and emotionally abusive and controlling behavior in intimate relationships are interrelated. The NVAW Survey provides compelling evidence of the link between vio-lence and emotionally abusive and controlling behavior in intimate relationships. Women whose partners verbally abused them, werejealous or possessive, or denied them access to family, friends, and family income were signifi- cantly more likely to report being raped, physi-cally assaulted, and/or stalked by their partners, even when sociodemographic factors such as race and education were controlled. These find-ings suggest that many women in violent rela- tionships are victims of systematic terrorism; that is, they experience multiple forms of abuseand control at the hands of their partners. Future research should focus on the extent to which violence perpetrated against women by intimatepartners consists of systematic terrorism and theconsequences of this type of victimization.57 7. America's medical community should receive comprehensive training about the medical needs of victims of intimate partner rape and physical assault. The injury and medical utilization data generated from the NVAW Survey provide persuasive evidence of the physical and social costs associated with in-timate partner violence. The survey found that in more than one-third of all rapes and physical assaults committed against women by intimates,the victim sustains an injury. Furthermore, in approximately one-third of all such injury vic- timizations, the victim receives some type ofmedical care (e.g., paramedic care, treatment in a hospital emergency facility, dental care, or physical therapy). The survey also found thatapproximately one-fifth of all physical assaults committed against men by intimates result in an injury to the victim, and in one-fifth of all suchinjury victimizations, the victim receives some type of medical treatment. Thus, of the estimated 7.7 million rapes and physical assaults commit-ted against women and men annually by intimate partners, approximately 2.5 million will result in an injury to the victim, and approximately680,000 will require some type of medical treat- ment to the victim. Because many female and male victims of inti- mate partner rape and physical assault receive multiple forms of care for the same injury vic-timization, medical personnel in the United States treat millions of intimate partner injury victims annually. Given the large number of in- jury victimizations committed against womenand men by intimate partners annually and the extensive nature of medical treatment to victims of intimate partner rape and physical assault, itis imperative that medical professionals receive information about the prevalence and physical consequences of intimate partner violence andthe medical needs of victims and training on how to make appropriate referrals for victims with these needs. 8. The U.S. justice system community should receive comprehensive training about the safety needs of victims of intimate partnerviolence. As previously noted, the NVAW Survey produced dramatic confirmation of the pervasive nature and injurious consequences ofintimate partner violence. Information from the survey also shows that most intimate partner rapes, physical assaults, and stalkings go unre-ported to law enforcement. Given these findings, criminal justice practitioners should receive comprehensive training about the safety needsof victims and the need to conduct community outreach to encourage victims of intimate part- ner violence to report their victimizations tothe police.About the National Institute of Justice The National Institute of Justice (NIJ), a component of the Office of Justice Programs, is the research agency of the U.S. Department of Justice.
