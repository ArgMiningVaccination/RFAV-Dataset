This is important because the lymph system is responsible for transporting white blood cells throughout the body, which are essential for fighting infection. Inflammation: Massage therapy can also help to reduce inflammation. Inflammation is a natural response of the body to injury or illness, but chronic inflammation can lead to health problems.

Lymph fluid carries white blood cells throughout the body and helps to fight infection. Aromatherapy: Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils to promote relaxation and healing. Some essential oils, such as lavender, tea tree, and lemon, have been shown to have antimicrobial properties. Reflexology: Reflexology is a form of massage that focuses on pressure points in the hands and feet that are thought to correspond to specific organs and systems in the body. Stimulating these points can help to improve overall health and well-being. Massage therapy can be an effective complement to other forms of medical treatment. It can help to relieve pain, reduce stress and anxiety, and promote relaxation. In addition, massage therapy can also boost the immune system by increasing the flow of lymph fluid.
