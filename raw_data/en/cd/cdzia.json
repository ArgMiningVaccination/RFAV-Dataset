{"title": "Ayurvedic Treatment Protocol for Hereditary Pancreatitis: A Case Report Demonstrating Disease Arrestation", "author": "Vaidya B Prakash; Shikha Prakash; Neha Negi; Sneha T Sati", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "The case report presented here highlights the use of an Ayurvedic treatment protocol (ATP) in managing hereditary pancreatitis (HP) in a 14-year-old boy. HP is a rare form of pancreatitis caused by specific gene mutations that are inherited within families. It is known to be aggressive and can lead to pancreatic cancer in later stages. The boy, in this case, experienced multiple episodes of pancreatitis and required several hospitalizations despite following a conventional treatment approach, which included a dairy-free, protein and fat-restricted diet, and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. However, after starting the ATP in February 2022, which involved a modified diet and the use of herbo-mineral Ayurvedic formulations, the boy reported significant improvement in his general well-being and was able to lead a normal life without experiencing any discomfort. The ATP included a customized diet comprising dairy products with moderate amounts of fat and protein, along with specific herbo-mineral formulations and the withdrawal of pancreatic enzymes. The boy also received vitamin D3 supplementation. After approximately one year of following the ATP, the disease progression was arrested, as indicated by follow-up images and investigations. The size of the pancreatic duct decreased from 8 mm to 2.8 mm. This case report suggests that the ATP may have potential efficacy in managing hereditary pancreatitis and halting disease progression. However, it is important to note that this is a single case report, and further research and clinical studies are needed to validate the long-term benefits and understand the underlying mechanisms of Ayurvedic interventions in hereditary pancreatitis.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-08-02", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
