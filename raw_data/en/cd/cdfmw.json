BodyTalk is an astonishingly simple and effective form of therapy that allows the body's energy systems to be resynchronized so that they can operate as nature intended. When a body is operating at its optimal level, each system, cell and atom is in constant communication with each other at all times. Through exposure to the stresses of day-to-day life and to chemicals in our food and environment, these lines of communication can become compromised, which can lead to decline in physical, emotional and mental health. Reconnecting these lines of communication then enables the body's mechanisms to function at optimal levels, thus preventing disease and rapidly accelerating the healing process. BodyTalk's major assets are its simplicity, safety, and the speed of its results. It is non-invasive, objective in application, and works effectively on humans and animals alike. No diagnosis is made and no medication prescribed. BodyTalk can be used as a stand-alone system to treat many health problems, or seamlessly integrated into any health care system to increase its effectiveness and promote faster healing. The BodyTalk treatment protocol is very straightforward and does not require any diagnosis. The practitioner relies on the guidance of the body's innate wisdom, through muscle testing, to not only locate the weakened lines of communication in the body but also to find the proper order in which they are to be addressed. Just as the body heals a wound with a particular sequencing of chemical reactions, the body wants to address all healing in a certain order. This priority is paramount in the balancing process to initiate the body's ability to heal itself. The healing process usually follows rather quickly. For every malfunctioning energy circuit that is found, the practitioner or client contacts the corresponding 'points' with their hands. The practitioner then lightly taps the client on the top of the head, which stimulates the brain centres and causes the brain to re-evaluate the state of the body's health. The result is that the general energy balance of the body is greatly improved. The practitioner then taps the client on the sternum to 'announce' the corrected energy flows to the rest of the body. This is beneficial because the heart is responsible for communicating the state of the body's health to the rest of the body. Stimulating the heart by tapping the sternum enables the heart to store the corrected energy patterns in the body's cellular memory. This means that the body will remember these changes after the treatment. BodyTalk has proven to be very effective in addressing many common health issues such as dyslexia, chronic viruses and infections, allergies, stress, digestive disorders, sports injuries and performance, poor immune system functioning, sugar metabolism disorders, arthritis and general musculo-skeletal disorders, emotional and psychological problems, to name but a few. Even if a BodyTalk technique is performed incorrectly, it simply means that there will be no result or change. It will not make things worse. It follows therefore, that anyone who receives BodyTalk has nothing to lose and everything to gain as far as their health is concerned.
