Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune human skin disorder that is characterized by excessive prolif-eration of keratinocytes, scaly plaques, severe in-flammation, and erythema [1]. A wide range ofconventional medical therapies to treat psoriasisis established, from topical therapies However, most of thesetherapies cause a number of side effects, and lim-ited in inconvenience, [3,4]. In turn, a short-termtreatment of psoriasis causes its remission after finishing the treatment or only relieves the pa-tient s condition. Moreover, psoriasis is often ac- companied by other diseases, such as depressiveillness, cardiovascular disease, and a seronegativearthritis known as psoriatic arthritis [5]. There-fore, the invention of new alternative treatmentsfor psoriasis causing fewer side effects would bedesirable. It seems that several herbal drugs canmeet these requirements and have to be seen aspromising new agents for psoriasis treatment [6].Herbal products are greatly accepted by patientsbecause they are believed to be safer than conven-tional therapeutics. Moreover, herbal productspresent a great structural diversity and multi-directional mechanisms of action, which is notcommonly seen in synthetic compounds. Herbaldrugs may become an effective treatment forpsoriasis, causing lower costs and less side- ortoxic effects in comparison to other therapies.Therefore, researchers are still looking for novelherbal products and/or their active constituents,Abstract ! Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin diseasecharacterized histologically by hyperproliferationand aberrant differentiation of epidermal kerati-nocytes. A wide range of conventional medicaltherapies to treat psoriasis is established, fromtopical therapies and systemic medicationsthrough to phototherapy or combinations ofthose. However, most of these therapies have alimited efficacy and may cause a number of sideeffects, including cutaneous atrophy, organ toxic-ity, carcinogenicity, and broadband immunosup-pression, which are restricting their long-termuse. Therefore, it would be desirable to use herbalproducts as an alternative treatment for psoriasisthat causes fewer side effects. For this purpose,several electronic databases and literature refer- ences were used to summarize the currentknowledge acquired on the basis of animal stud-ies and clinical trials regarding herbal productsused to treat psoriasis topically. This review dis-cusses the mechanisms of herbal products activ-ities through (1) inhibition of the keratinocyte hy-perproliferation and pathway. Moreover, the penetration ofherbal products through the psoriatic skin barrier,novel herbal drug delivery systems in psoriasistreatment, and possible adverse effects of herbaltherapy are discussed.Topically Used Herbal Products for the Treatment of Psoriasis -Mechanism of Action, Drug Delivery, Clinical Studies Authors Anna Herman1, Andrzej P.

Penetration of herbal products throughthe psoriatic skin barrier, novel herbal drug delivery systems inpsoriasis treatment, and possible adverse effects of herbal ther-apy are also discussed.

Search terms included\"herbal products and psoriasis \",\"herbal treatments for psoriasis \", \"topical medication for psoriasis \",a n d \"herbal drug deliv- ery systems in psoriasis treatment \". References from reviews about herbal products and psoriasis were examined for addition-al articles and case reports. A manual search was also conducted,based on citations in scientific literature. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Selection criteria included articles which are examining herbalproducts used for the topical treatment of psoriasis by means ofanimal studies and clinical trials, and are comparing herbal prod-ucts treatment vs. control treatments (placebo or active therapy).Other forms of psoriasis treatment than topical administration ofherbal products (e.g. oral, systemic) were excluded from thestudy. Also publications in languages other than English were ex-cluded. Pathology of Psoriasis The pathophysiology of psoriasis involves both skin cells and im-mune cells. Psoriasis is typically characterized as inflamed skinwith surface scales, thickening of the epidermis (acanthosis;granular layer is reduced or absent) caused by parakeratosis,which is a consequence of nuclei retention in SC keratinocytescaused by abnormal differentiation and hyperproliferation of epi-dermal keratinocytes [1,7]. Some scientific reports consider ni-tric oxide (NO), released from keratinocytes at high concentra-tions, as a key inhibitor of cellular proliferation and inducer of celldifferentiation in vitro . Although a high-output NO synthesis is suggested by the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS),mRNA, and proteins in psoriasis lesions, the hyper-proliferation of psoriatic keratinocytes may indicate that iNOS ac-tivity is too low to effectively deliver antiproliferative NO concen-trations [8]. As a consequence, the impairment of corneocyte dif-ferentiation, including an impaired formation and secretion oflamellar body contents and the processing of lamellar body con-tents into lamellar bilayers, causes a reduction in the psoriaticskin barrier function [9]. Moreover, skin barrier problems inpsoriasis are not only the excessive growth and aberrant differen-tiation of corneocytes but also almost absent normal moisturiz-ing factors (NMFs) like water, an imbalance of skin lipids (rise inthe levels of cholesterol and fall in the levels of ceramides), anddry and sensitive skin [10].The role of the immune system and its interactive network of leu-kocytes and cytokines in disease pathogenesis was also described[11,12]. Psoriatic lesions are highly infiltrated with immune cells,most notably CD3 +T cells and CD11c+dendritic cells [13,14].Proinflammatory cytokines produced by causing [7]. and IL-15 seem apoptotic resistance of the keratinocytes [15,16]. Alsogrowth factors genetic like toll-like acute regulatory protein (StAR),and vitamin D receptor (VDR) are suggested to be the most crit-ical factors governing the exacerbation of psoriasis [17,18]. Theessential transcription factor in psoriasis, nuclear factor kappa B(NF-B), has been shown to be a key regulatory element occur- ring in a variety of immune and inflammatory pathways, in cellu-lar proliferation and differentiation, and in apoptosis [19]. An im-balance between the proapoptotic and antiapoptotic activities ofNF-B proteins has been demonstrated to cause differentiation and hyperproliferation in psoriatic lesions rather than in normalcells [20]. Topically Used Herbal Products for the Treatment of Psoriasis Many herbal topical formulations have been marketed world- wide to prevent psoriasis [21]. There are many advantages of us-ing natural drugs, including patient compliance, less side-effects,easy availability, low-costs, and more than one mode of biochem-ical action for psoriasis treatment. Therefore, researchers aresearching for new herbal products, which have the potential tobe an alternative for synthetic drugs in psoriasis therapy. Animal-based studies Herbal products with an anti-psoriasis potential tested in animal-based studies are summarized in l \"Table 1 . Most of the in vivo studies performed in animals are based on a mouse tail model ofpsoriasis, introduced by Jarrett and Spearman [22]. The model isbased on the induction of orthokeratosis in those parts of theadult mouse tail, which have normally a parakeratotic differenti-ation. Antipsoriatic drug activity is defined by the percentage in-crease of orthokeratotic regions after topical drug treatment of amouse tail. Ethanolic extract of Aloe vera quercetin [26], Thespesia isolated were assessed for their antipsoriatic activity using the mouse tail model. All of them exhibited a significantpercentage reduction of relative epidermal thickness, promotedepidermal differentiation and normal keratization of keratino-cyte, produced significant orthokeratosis, and exhibited a higherantipsoriatic significant and dose-dependent in- crease in orthokeratosis in parakeratotic areas of albino mousetails, with significant effects on the epidermal thickness com-pared to the vehicle control [30].Only two studies were based on an UVB-induced model of psori-asis. UVB-induced photodermatitis in rats has been proposed asan experimental model for Psoriasis vulgaris by Nagakuma et al. [32]. The model is on the induction of dark-brown scale onthe erythematous lesion after UVB irradiation.

Both of them ex-hibited a significant percentage reduction of relative epidermalthickness and spleen index as compared to 0.05% tretinoin aspositive control. Also irradiated rat skin treated with SUEX GELcontaining aqueous extract of the bark of Pongamia pinnata showed a significant reduction in the total epidermal thicknessand retention of the Stratum granulosum compared to ointment base and placebo group [33]. However, there is no animal modelthat could replace clinical studies. Moreover, positive results ofanimal-based studies are not always proved in clinical trials. Theycan only help in the initial determination of new herbal products,which may proceed to further stages of clinical trials and becomeuseful drugs for the treatment of psoriasis in the future. Clinical studies Herbal products with anti-psoriasis potential tested in clinicalstudies are listed in l \"Table 2 . Topical application americanaoil [38] showed significantly greater improvements in and fluticasone propionatemixture, hydrocortisone, Capsicum frutescens [49] were found to be significantly more effective than the vehicle control group. There are also liter-ature data showing no significant difference between herbalproducts and drug/placebo treatment. The effect of Mahonia aquifolium ointment appears to be less potent than that of dithra- nol [50]. Aleurites moluccana (Kukui nut) oil [51], Aloe vera gel well as ointment and lotion containing 20% kunzea oil[53] showed no significant difference compared to a placebopsoriasis treatment.The clinical studies presented in l \"Table 2 contain some short- comings, which ultimately do not diminish the value of theselimited research works. l \"Table 2 reports 10 clinical trials, whichTable 1 Herbal products used for the topical treatment of psoriasis -animal studies.

In practice, the first phase of clinical trials in-volved usually 100 -500 participants, because only studies car- ried out with more than 100 patients provide the opportunityfor statistical analyses. Only one of the above described clinicaltrials was performed on 200 subjects. The participants in thisrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study used eitherthe topical cream Reli\u00e9va (a homeopathic product containing aproprietary M. aquifolium extract) or control (placebo) [46].

Unfortunately, the most of the above-men-tioned factors can be related to the clinical trials described inl \"Table 2 . Herbal Products Penetration Through Psoriasis Skin Novel drug delivery systems such as liposome, niosome, etho- some, microemulsion, nanoemulsion, lipid carrier systems (NLCs) presentdesirable attributes for the use in extremely dehydrated andthickened psoriatic skin that has a lipid imbalance and is sensi-tive to irritants [54,55]. They offer an enhanced penetrationthrough skin with less toxic effects compared to free drugs (lipo-somes), slow down drug release and reduce systemic toxicity(niosomes), enable drugs to reach the deep skin layers and/orthe systemic circulation (ethosomes), provide long-term stabilityand high solubilization capacity for hydrophilic and lipophilicdrugs (microemulsions), prolonge action on the skin and protectthe drug from instability (nanoemulsions), cause only negligibleskin irritation, and ensure the compatibility of the drugs (NLCs)[54]. Moreover, topical drug delivery systems with herbal formu-lations enhance the therapeutic effects of herbal drugs and facili-tate their penetration through the skin [56,57].Studies performed on liposomal vesicles (combination of metho-trexate and menthol) in vesicular base [58],elastic liposomal of isolated emulsomes confirmed theirpotential to enhance skin accumulation, prolong drug release,and improve the site-specificity of active constituents as effectivedrugs in the treatment of psoriasis. Niosomes loaded tox- icity, tolerability and improved the drug s anti-inflam- matory activity in mice and human [61]. Psoralen from Fructus psoraleae loaded in ethosomes increased the lipid fluidity and cell membrane penetrability, which made it possible to enhancethe skin deposition in vitro and in vivo and can be used to cure microemulsions are a potential vehicle for the topical delivery of psoralen andmethoxypsoralen (extracted from Ammi majus ) [63,64]. 5% tea tree oil dis-tilled from Melaleuca alternifolia are promising vehicles for a transdermal drug delivery [65]. Skin delivery of Glycyrrhiza permeability of these compounds,showed anti-inflammatory activities and a low irritation poten-tial, and so can be used for psoriasis treatment. NLCs and SLNsshowed a good ability to increase the drug accumulation in vari-ous skin layers. NLCs may as well be a more potent carrier for thetopical delivery of capsaicin, to allow for an effective therapy of psoriasis [69]. Mechanisms of Action of Herbal Products Used in Psoriasis Treatment In general, herbal products used in the treatment of psoriasis work by (1) inhibition of the keratinocyte hyperproliferationand induction of apoptosis, induction of apoptosis, and modulation of kera-tinocyte differentiation have been considered as targets of anti-psoriatic strategies. Animal-based studies support the efficacy ofthe herbal products for the treatment of psoriasis via inhibition ofkeratinocyte hyperproliferation. The ethanolic extract of Aloe ve- raleaf gel showed antipsoriatic activity by a significant differen- tiation of the epidermis, seen as orthokeratosis as well as an in-crease in the relative epidermal thickness when compared withthe control group in mice [23]. The ethanolic extract of Nigella sativa seeds extract produced a significant epidermal differentia- tion from its degree of orthokeratosis comparable to tazarotenegel (0.1%) in albino mice [24]. However, most desired for thetreatment of psoriasis are herbal products that inhibit epidermalhyperplasia and inflammation simultaneously. Tuhuai extract re-duced epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation in normal hair-less mice, which makes it a valuable drug for treatment of psoria-sis [70]. Baicalin isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis acts by in- hibiting inflammatory reactions and inducing the differentiationof keratinocytes at the same time [29]. Moreover, baicalin cream(5%) promotes epidermal differentiation and normal keratizationof skin similar to tazarotene cream (0.1%).The flavonoid quercetin from the rhizome reduction in epidermal thickness,anti-inflammatory, and maximum antiproliferant activities com-pared to mice treated with retinoic acid [26]. The treatment ofpsoriasis by inhibition of keratinocyte hyperproliferationthrough herbal products was also confirmed in clinical studies.Indigo naturalis ointment modulates the proliferation and differ- entiation of keratinocytes in the epidermis as well as inflamma-tory reactions by inhibiting the infiltration of T lymphocytes inpatients with chronic plaque psoriasis [40]. Analysis of biopsiestaken from patients after I. naturalis ointment treatment showed that the expressions of proliferating marker Ki-67 and inflamma-tory marker CD3 were decreased, while differentiation markers,such as filaggrin, were increased in the epidermis. Moreover,I. naturalis as well its major active constituent induribin inhibited the proliferation and abnormal differentiation of epidermal kera-tinocytes through decreasing proliferating cell nuclear antigen(PCNA) and increasing involucrin at both mRNA and protein lev-els in patients with psoriatic lesions [71].Some studies show that the inhibition of fibroblast-secreted cy-tokines could regulate keratinocyte proliferation and differentia-tion as well slow down the process of inflammation in psoriasis[72]. Ethanolic extracts from Alpinia galanga, effects on of NF- B signaling molecules in the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line, re- flecting their potential use in treating diseases with inflamma-tion and hyperproliferation such as psoriasis [73]. Copeifera known Copaiba balsam, an anti-inflammatory activity through inhibiting translocation and cytokines Med 2016; 82: 1447 -1455Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Moreover, A. ligustica, A. arborescens, and of cytokines was also con-firmed in animal-based studies. The topical application of a cytokines in mice, initially induced with psoria-sis-like dermatitis through topical application of phosphorylase kinase (PhK) including those cell migration and cell proliferation. Therefore, a modulation ofPhK activity by drugs/herbal products may be an effective psoriasis. Curcumin is a selective PhK inhibitor [77]. Itwas observed the PhK activity was highest in active un-treated psoriasis, lower in the calcipotriol and curcumin treatedgroup, and lowest in normal skin. A decreased PhK activity incurcumin and calcipotriol treated psoriasis patients was associ-ated with corresponding decreases in keratinocyte transferrin re-ceptor expression, severity of parakeratosis, and density of epi-dermal CD8+ T cells.Some reports suggest that the Hh pathway is activated in lesionalpsoriatic skin, and that treatment with the Hh pathway antago-nist cyclopamine may lead to a rapid resolution of the disease[78]. Cyclopamine isolated from Veratrum californicum was found to be more effective than topical clobetasol-17 propionatein the treatment of guttate and plaque Be-sides, inflammatory cells including CD4+ lymphocytes werefound to disappear rapidly after the treatment with cyclopamineas well as hedgehog/smoothened signaling was inhibited. On the other hand, some research found that the Hh pathway is not acti-vated in psoriasis [80]. It was observed that Hh target genes(PTCH1 and GLI1), whose expression is elevated in response to Hh signaling, were downregulated in lesional skin. Therefore,the proposed use of Hh antagonists as antipsoriatic agents is veryquestionable. Adverse Effects of Herbal Therapy The risk of adverse events increases with the topical administra-tion and the long-term use of herbal-based formulations. Onlyfew of the animal-based and clinical studies discussed above in-cluded a safety profile of herbal products. No side-effects or ad-verse events were reported for the Strobilanthes formosanus ointment [48] in patients participating in clinical trials. Local adverse events, mainly dryingup, stinging, and itching of the skin on test areas, were observedafter the topical application of Aloe vera gel [36,52]. The only clin- ical trial which verified possibility of acute that methanolic Cassia tora leaves extract incorporatedin O/W creams was safe up to a dose of 2000 mg/kg [31]. More- over, for human safety reasons the assessment of new substancesis still evaluated for irritant potentials by application to animalsfollowed by observation of visible changes such as erythema andoedema [81]. Testing for skin irritation in animals is not alwayspredictive for humans, but is still the most widely used methodin toxicity research for herbal extracts applied topically. It is wellknown that some herbal remedies may cause allergic reactions,erythema, and edema and several can be responsible for photo-sensitization [82,83]. Some herbal preparations can cause organtoxicity, hitting liver, kidneys, heart, and other organs [84 -86], or possess cancerogenic properties [87]. Moreover, herbal productsare often mislabeled (unknown purity and standardization of ac-tive constituents) and may contain additives or contaminants(heavy metals, pesticides) that are not listed in formulation [88 - 90]. Some herbal products may interact with conventional drugsand some are toxic if used improperly or at to high doses [91].Moreover, there are no regulations governing which herbal prod-ucts can be marketed for various ailments as well as no author-ities register adverse effects [92]. An increasing number of herbalformulation available for sale should prompt governments to in-troduce regulations on research which should be carried out be-fore such products are released to the market. Challenges and Perspectives for the Treatment of Psoriasis by Herbal Products The review of the literature shows that a great growth has taken place in the worldwide interest in the potential of herbal medi-cines for the treatment of psoriasis over the last 20 years. Parallelto various synthetic medicines used topically and (biological) therapies (e.g. alefa-cept, efalizumab, etanercept) also herbal products play an impor-tant role as therapeutic agents for psoriasis treatment [93 -95]. The long tradition of herbal products used in the treatment ofmany diseases is not sufficient to consider them as effective andsafe drugs. To confirm their effectiveness as new promising alter-native agent for the therapy of psoriasis a lot of research must beperformed. Studies showing antiproliferative activity of herbalproducts and their ability to modulate cell differentiation inHaCaT cell lines [96 -101] do not provide sufficient evidence that these herbal products will be effective in the treatment of psoria-sis. Also promising results obtained in the studies performed onanimals are not always consistent with the results of clinical tri-als. Therefore, only well-controlled double-blind clinical trialsand toxicological studies can prove the efficacy and safety ofherbal products in psoriasis treatment. In general, numerous dif-ficulties associated with the evaluation of the efficacy and safetyof herbal medicines, standardization of plant materials, and qual-ity of herbal products cause that only a few herbal drugs havebeen approved for clinical applications so far, and finally reachthe market [102]. Unfortunately, until now there are no approvedherbal drugs dedicated for the treatment of psoriasis. However, inmy opinion, the great progress in herbal medicine should make itpossible that the first highly efficient and completely safe herbalproduct designed for the therapy of psoriasis will be available onthe world market in the near future. Herbal products can makesubstantial contributions to drug innovation by providing novelchemical structures and/or multidirectional mechanisms of ac-tion, which are not commonly seen in synthetic compounds.The development of topical drug delivery systems facilitatesplant extract penetration through the skin and enhances the1452 Herman A, Herman AP.

Moreover, the growth of interest in natural medicine may forcepharmaceutical companies to invest in extensive preclinical andwell-controlled randomized clinical trials to prove the safetyand efficacy of herbal medicines. Moreover, new branches of bio-logical sciences, including pharmacogenomic, metabolomic, andmicroarray methodology, as well as the techniques of analyticalchemistry, such as HPLC and GC/MS, would likely enable progressin the assessment of pharmacological qualities and safety ofherbal products. These all allow for creating international guide-lines that precisely define the requirements for studies about theuse of herbal medicine. It seems that establishing global regula-tory mechanisms for the introduction of herbal drugs to theworld market is desirable and necessary. Conclusion ! Herbal products are being increasingly used in the treatment ofskin diseases like psoriasis. Some of them specifically inhibit epi-dermal hyperplasia and/or inflammation, which can be widelyused to treat psoriasis. Unfortunately, most studies provide onlylimited information about the efficacy and safety of topicallyused herbal products in the treatment of psoriasis. Therefore,more scientific evidence and documentation is desired for thepromotion of herbal treatment of psoriasis, which must be sub-stantiated by reliable clinical trials with standardized materialsand formulations.
