AcuWellness (sometimes called Acudetox) is a form of acupuncture that was developed in the 1970s to treat drug and alcohol addiction. Since its discovery, it has proven effective in decreasing cravings, reducing anxiety, alleviating stress, and improving sleep. AcuWellness has also been used to treat people in psychiatric settings, as a part of cancer treatment, and to treat survivors of natural disasters and other traumatic events. Casey Eike, licensed clinical social worker, is trained in the National Acupuncture Detox Association (NADA) protocol and has been leading AcuWellness classes for several years. When asked what her favorite thing about AcuWellness is, Casey says, \"I love seeing people look like Jello or ask me 'Do I have to leave?' People tell me, 'I've never been this relaxed' or 'I've never taken this long to just relax.' There are so many health benefits to relaxing, especially during this difficult time.\" How it works Casey starts each class with a deep breathing exercise, progressive relaxation with guided imagery, and a mindfulness exercise. Participants sit in comfortable chairs and soft, calming music is played. When participants are ready, Casey puts five acupuncture needles in each ear in specific locations. Each of these five locations corresponds to a different treatment goal (e.g., decreased cravings, improved sleep). Participants can also request to have magnets placed on the upper parts of their ears. These magnets stay in place for up to one week and reduce anxiety when pressed. If someone is hesitant about needles, they can choose the magnets or have beads placed on the locations where the needles would usually go. The class lasts approximately an hour. People report feeling a deep sense of calm, both during and after the session. Casey encourages participants to take it easy for the rest of the day if they can, so they can maintain the depths of relaxation achieved during the class. When it happens Casey's AcuWellness classes are held every Saturday at 2:30pm at Recovery Caf\u00e9 Longmont. If you have any questions before attending, please email Becky "}
