The study, published in the medical journal Lancet in 1998 and retracted last February, spurred millions of parents around the world to opt not to get the shot for their children. Wakefield is accused of manipulating and falsifying his data in a very tiny study of just 12 children. In addition, the British medical journal reveals Wakefield was also hired as a consultant by lawyers looking for evidence to launch a lawsuit against the vaccine manufacturer on behalf of parents of autistic children. Wakefield is unrepentant and says there was no fraud and there's still not enough data on vaccine safety. A Calgary dad whose 11-year-old daughter has autism says perhaps the good thing to come out of all of this is that it changed the way people thought about the causes of autism. Ian Menzies says he does not believe his daughter's autism is related to the vaccine she received when she was two. She was diagnosed when she was three. Nonetheless, he and his wife are very circumspect about any vaccines they give her now and only choose vaccines that protect against serious illnesses, such as polio. With files from "}
