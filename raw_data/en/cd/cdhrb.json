The advent of nanotechnology in acupuncture-based treatments offers lucrative growth opportunities for the market. Nanotechnology has enabled the employment of nanosensors or nanochips to offer in vivo and real-time detection solutions in reactive molecules. Assessment of connections as well as dynamics, such as reactive molecules with respect to needle stimulation, is anticipated to offer novel insights for these treatments. The consumer base for complementary medicine has increased due to the benefits and philosophies associated with it. Some philosophies include a high preference for natural products, the onset of illness is attributed to body imbalance, the ability of the body to heal itself, the treatment of the whole body, and the administration of easier therapies. Herbal medicine, naturopathy, and homeopathy are the three most adopted complementary therapies. Increase in the penetration of internet and e-marketing channels, such as video counseling and other electronic methods, used for patient communication boosts the botanicals segment growth.
