Tdap may be administered regardless of the interval since the last tetanus and diphtheria toxoid- containing vaccine. Administer 1 dose of Tdap vaccine to pregnant adolescents during each pregnancy (preferably during the early part of gestational weeks 27 through 36), regardless of time since prior Td or Tdap vaccination. Tetanus Diptheria and acellular Pertusis Tdap Catch-up vaccination: Persons aged 7 years or more who are not fully immunized with DTaP vaccine should receive Tdap vaccine as 1 dose (preferably the first) in the catch-up series; if additional doses are needed, use Td vaccine. For children 7-10 yrs who receive a dose of Tdap as part of the catch-up series, an adolescent Tdap vaccine dose at age 11-12 yrs may be administered. Persons aged 11-18 yrs who have not received Tdap vaccine should receive a dose, followed by tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) booster doses every 10 years thereafter. Inadvertent doses of DTaP vaccine to an adolescent 11-18 yrs, the dose should be counted as the adolescent Tdap booster. HPV Vaccination FOGSI, ACIP, ACOG, RCOG recommends HPV vaccination in all adolescents for protection against cancer cervix. 9-14 years two dose schedule - 0 and 6 month 14 years and above - three dose schedule HPV Vaccine ACIP (2017) Routine Vaccination Administer a 2-dose series of HPV vaccine on a schedule of 0, 6-12 months to all adolescents aged 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can start at age 9 years Catchup vaccination Age of initiation of vaccine < 15 years - 2 dose schedule - 0, 6-12 months Age of initiation of vaccine >15 years - 3 dose schedule -0, 1-2 and 6 months HPV Vaccine ACIP (2017) 2 Dose schedule 3 Dose schedule Dose Min interval Dose Min Interval 1st & 2nd 5 mth 1st & 2nd 4 wks 2nd & 3rd 12 wks 1st & 3rd 5 mths If the 2nd dose is administered at a shorter interval, a 3rd dose should be administered a min of 12 wks after the 2nd dose and a min of 5 mths after the1st dose. If a vaccine dose is administered at a shorter interval, it should be readministered after another minimum interval has been met since the most recent dose A vaccine dose administered at a shorter interval should be readministered at the recommended interval. Special populations: For children with h/o sexual abuse or assault, administer HPV vaccine beginning at age 9 yrs. Immunocompromised persons, including those with HIV should receive a 3-dose series at 0, 1-2, and 6 months, regardless of age at vaccine initiation HPV Vaccine ACIP 2017 (Gardasil9) - HPV types 6,11,16,18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. All three vaccines have been approved for administration in a 3-dose series In October 2016 FDA also approved 9vHPV for use in a 2-dose series for 9-14 yrs MMWR 2016 Rationale of 2 dose schedule - HPV Immunogenicity of 2 dose schedule is non-inferior to 3 dose schedule in age group 9-14 years for 9vHPV, 4vHPV and 2vHPV in various studies JAMA, 2016, CDC, 2016 9vHPV may be used to continue or complete vaccine schedule of 4vHPV or 2vHPV Interrupted schedule- if the schedule is interrupted it does not need to be restarted. The number of recommended dose depend on the age of initiation MMWR, 2017 Immunogenicity and HPV infection after one, two, and three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in girls in India: a multicentre prospective cohort study Unmarried girls aged 10-18 years recd 4HPV from Sept 1, 2009 to Apr 8, 2010 in 9 centres, 188 clusters, 17,729 girls Three doses 0, 60, 180 days -n- 4348 (25%) Two doses 0 and 180days-n- 4979 (28%) Two doses by default 0 and 60 days- n- 3542 (19%) One dose only by default- n-4950 Sahnkarnarayan R et al, Lancet, 2016 Immunogenicity and HPV infection after one, two, and three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in girls in India: a multicentre prospective cohort study Immune response in the two-dose HPV vaccine group was non-inferior to the three-dose group (median fluorescence intensity ratio for 16 and for HPV 18 1\u00b704 [0\u00b792-1\u00b719]) at 7 months, but was inferior in the two-dose default (0\u00b733 [0\u00b729-0\u00b738] for HPV 16 16 and 0\u00b712 [0\u00b710-0\u00b714] for HPV 18) groups at 18 months. Sahnkarnarayan R et al, Lancet, 2016 The geometric mean avidity indices after fewer than three doses by design or default were non-inferior to those after three doses of vaccine. Fewer than three doses by design and default induced detectable concentrations of neutralising antibodies to all four vaccine-targeted HPV types, but at much lower concentration after one dose. The testing of at least two samples from 838 participants showed that there was no persistent HPV 16 or 18 infections in any study group at a median follow-up of 4\u00b77 years (IQR 4\u00b72-5\u00b71). Influenza - ACIP 2017 Influenza more severe in <5 years, >65 years, pregnant women and person with underlying illness Administer 1 dose of Inactivated influenza vaccine to all children more than 9 years LAIV is not recommended for influenza 2016-1017 Both Trivalent quadrivalent virus, A/Hongkong/4801/2014(H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 like virus, Victoria lineage IIV4 - additional influenza B virus strain B/Phuket/3073/2013 Yamagata lineage MMWR, 2016 Influenza Vaccine Preparation Vaccine Strains Manufacturer Dose & Route Age Vaxigrip Trivalent Sanofi 15mcg each high dose Sanofi Fluzone each HA strain ID 18-64 years Meningococcal Vaccine IAP 2016 Recommended only for certain high risk group of children, during outbreaks, and international travelers to Hajj and sub-Sahara Africa. Meningococcal vaccine available in India of India) Polysaccharide vaccines (bi- and quadrivalent) Conjugate vaccines have potential for herd protection and their increased immunogenicity, particularly in children <2 years of age. Quadrivalent conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines are recommended only for children 2 years and above. Monovalent group A conjugate vaccine, PsA-TT can be used in children above 1 year of age. Catch up vaccination Adolescence - Hepatitis B Administer the 3-dose series to those not previously vaccinated Vaccine monovalent Hepatitis B- Recombivax HB (Merck & Co), Engerix B (GlaxoSmithKline) Unvaccinated - 0.5 ml (paediatric dose) 0,1-2 month, 6 month 0, 1, 4 month 0, 2, 4 month Engerix 0,1,2,12 month is approved for all ages Children 11-15 years - Hep B - 2 dose schedule ( adult dose Recombivax HB )- (0, 1 month) Measles,Mumps and Rubella vaccination Live attenuated vaccine MMR 2 doses 4 weeks apart (Priorix by GSK) Adverse reactions rare Mild rash Fever Pain Lymphadenitis Thrombocytopenia Serious allergic reactions very rare Avoid Pregnancy for three month If pregnancy occurs within 4 weeks of vaccination there is a very small chance of the fetus being born with CRS and usually follow and close monitoring with USG is advised instead of pregnancy termination . FOGSI 2014 Catchup Vaccination - MMR vaccine Ensure that all school-aged children and adolescents have had at least 2 doses of MMR vaccine (3 doses if the 1st dose is received before 12 months) ; The minimum interval between the 2 doses is 4 weeks. IAP 2016 MMR not required if Proof of vaccination with live attenuated vaccine Proof of exposure to measles, mumps and rubella MMR not to be given Pregnancy h/o life threatening allergic reaction to vaccine, gelatin and neomycin h/o HIV, immunocompromised state, cancer drugs, steroid treatment, blood disorder, moderate or severe illness, Catchup vaccination - Hepatitis A Pre vaccination screening for Hepatitis A antibody is recommended in children older than 10 years as at this age the estimated sero- positive rates exceed 50% Inactivated HepA vaccine - 0, 6-12 months Live attenuated H2-strain Hepatitis A vaccine - Single dose Catchup Vaccination - Typhoid Recommended throughout the adolescent period, i.e. up to 18 years of age Typhoid conjugate vaccines (Vi-PS): single dose single dose every 3 years; An interval of at least 4 weeks with the MMR vaccine Vi conjugate typhoid vaccine should be preferred over Vi-PS vaccine wherever feasible The need and exact timing of the booster doses are not yet determined Vaccine Dose Type of vaccine Comment Cholera Two doses 2 weeks Vaxchora -Oral, live attenuated Only in highly endemic areas and traveling to areas where risk of transmission is very high like Kumbh mela, etc Rabies Post-exposure prophylaxis - 0, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days Pre- exposure -0, 7 and 28 Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV), Purified Chick Embryo Cell (PCEC) vaccine, Purified Duck Embryo Vaccine (PDEV); 0.5 ml for Purified Vero Cell Vaccine (PVRV). significant contact with dogs, cats, cows, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs, donkeys, horses, camels, foxes, jackals, monkeys, mongoose, squirrel, bears and others.

Atlanta, Ga.: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002 Influenza vaccination in pregnancy Influenza is pandemic in India and worldwide Pregnant women are at high risk for influenza with 3-4 times higher rate of hospitalisation and 4-5 times higher chances of ICU admission Perinatal mortality 39/1000, 33% loss of pregnancy and 33% higher maternal mortality Most of influenza is caused by Influenza A (H1N1), (H3N2) and Influenza B Antigenic drift-Seasonal influenza,Influenza A B Antigenic shift - Pandemic, Influenza A Non-adjuvanted inactivated trivalent seasonal and monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines Inactivated influenza vaccine is safe and have adequate immune response in pregnancy with adequate transfer of transplacental antibody transfer The excellent and robust safety profile of multiple inactivated influenza vaccine preparations over many decades, and the potential complications of influenza disease during pregnancy, support WHO recommendations that pregnant women should be vaccinated. Recommended in 2nd and 3rd trimester and protects baby till 6 months of age GACVS, WHO 2014 Influenza vaccination in pregnancy CDC, RCOG, ACOG and ACIP recommends annual influenza vaccine to all pregnant mothers Influenza vaccine is an essential component in preconception, prenatal and postnatal care of women and should be offered to women who are or will be pregnant in influenza season ACOG committee Opinion, 2014 FOGSI recommends Inactivated Influenza Vaccine from 26 weeks onwards and can be given earlier in pandemic at least 2 weeks prior to delivery FOGSI 2014 Tetanus Toxoid Vaccines 59000 neonatal death in 2008 - 92% reduction from 1980 34 countries still not eliminated tetanus till 2012 WHO recommends 2 TT doses in pregnancy 4 weeks apart with last dose at least 2 weeks before delivery VARES database 2005-2010 search found Tdap to be safe in pregnancy and can be safely recommended in place TT in Pregnancy There are moderate local reaction to Tdap but because of the potential benefits of maternal pertussis immunization (ACIP) has recently recommended that pregnant women receive Tdap boosters during each pregnancy ACIP 2012 ACIP, ACOG and FOGSI recommends Tdap in place of second TT in pregnancy GACVS, WHO 2014 Pertusis vaccination in Pregnancy Substantial increase in pertusis in children in 2012 41,880 pertusis cases and 14 infant death in 2012 Maternal antibodies transported across placenta provides passive immunity to newborn before he/she can be vaccinated Vaccines are well tolerated and immunogenic in pregnant women and their neonates Tdap has been found safe to be used in pregnancy with no adverse fetal effects CDC 2012 Tdap in third trimester Tdap may be administered any time during pregnancy, but vaccination during the third trimester would provide the highest concentration of maternal antibodies to be transferred closer to birth After Tdap, a minimum of 2 weeks is required to mount a maximal immune response to the vaccine antigens. Active transport of maternal IgG does not substantially take place before 30 weeks of gestation One study of pregnant women who received Tdap within the prior 2 years noted that maternal antibodies waned quickly; even women immunized during the first or second trimester had low levels of antibodies at term. ACIP concluded that pregnant women should be vaccinated with Tdap during the third trimester to optimize transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies MMWR, 2013 ACIP update on Tdap in pregnancy Antibody levels in in non pregnant adults peak within first month with substantial decay after 1 year Maternal antibodies from women immunized before pregnancy waned quickly and the concentration of maternal antibodies was unlikely to be high enough to provide passive protection to infants Because antibody levels wane substantially during the first year after vaccination, ACIP concluded a single dose of Tdap at one pregnancy would be insufficient to provide protection for subsequent pregnancies. MMWR, 2013 ACIP recommends Tdap in every pregnancy Impact of Tdap in Pregnancy Annual mean Cases prevented by Tdap Tdap in pregnancy versus postpartum Tdap CDC, unpublished data, 2012, MMWR, 2013 Live attenuated Vaccines in Pregnancy Live Viral Vaccines has potential to cross placenta and affect fetus, they are contraindicated in pregnancies Inadvertent exposure in pregnancy raises safety concerns Safety of Monovalent Rubella and MMR live attenuated vaccines exposure in pregnancy CRS was not seen after inadvertent exposure of vaccine in pregnancy in a review of more than 680 Rubella susceptible women conceived within 3 month of vaccination. ACIP 2006 In Latin America, 2894 women rubella susceptible who conceived within 1 month of Rubella or MMR vaccine were evaluated for Rubella IgM and features of CRS in fetus. Cord Rubella IgM was positive in 70 women (3.5%) but none developed CRS. Vaccines, 2006 On the basis of these data, a maximum theoretical risk for CRS of 0.2% was estimated following inadvertent vaccination with rubella vaccine during pregnancy Inadvertent administration of MMR vaccines is not considered an indication for termination of the pregnancy, as there is no evidence of harm to the fetus GACVS, WHO 2014 Post Natal Vaccination Both inactivated and Live Vaccines (except Small Pox and Yellow Fever) are safe for lactating mothers Three vaccines should be given before discharge to susceptible mothers to protect themselves and their baby MMR Varicella Tdap Vaccination in adults and elderly FOGSI recommends vaccination for women of all ages HPV - licensed upto 45 years Tetanus ,diphtheria - TT/dT every 10 years, women more than 65 years in contact with infant should be given Tdap instead of TT/dT Influenza - annual flu shots throughout life, live attenuated upto 49 years Influenza vaccination in elderly >65 years - ACIP 2017 Annual one dose influenza vaccine prior to innfluenza season Fluzone - high dose IIV3 vaccine -60mcg of each HA strain, total 180mcg should be recommended ACIP recommendations for HPV 2017 Age <15 years - 2 doses atleast 5 month apart Age >15 years - 3 doses Adult female through 26 years who have not received any vaccination should receive 3 doses- 0,1-2,6 months Adult female who received 2 vaccines prior to 15 years are considered adequately vaccinated Adult female who initiated vaccination prior to 15 years but received only 1 dose or 2 dose less than 5 months apart should receive 1 dose of HPV Vaccine Dose Comments Guideline Influenza Inactivated CDC, ACOG, FOGSI Td 0,4 weeks and 6 month In unknown or incomplete immunization CDC, ACOG, FOGSI Tdap one dose 27- 36 weeks CDC Vaccine Recommended for use in Pregnancy Vaccine Dose Comments Guidelines Hepatitis A Hepatitis B PCV 13 No recommendation CDC PPSV23 Safety in first trimester not established CDC Polio IPV May be given if increased risk of exposure CDC Vaccine to be given in pregnancy if benefit more than the risk Vaccine Dose Comments Guidelines Influenza (LAIV) CDC, not recommended or Contraindicated in Pregnancy "}
