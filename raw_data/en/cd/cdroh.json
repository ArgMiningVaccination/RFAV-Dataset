FUNCTIONS It is a well-established fact that for proper health and wellness, individuals need to have daily, or in some cases, multiple daily bowel evacuation. Bowel evacuation is the primary process we have for the elimination of toxins in the body. However, the Standard American Diet quite often does not possess the necessary whole food fiber to elicit daily bowel evacuation. This creates problems in which digested food is allowed to maintain in contact with the walls of the intestine and colon for a prolonged period of time. In the case of certain foods such as red meat and other dense proteins, this prolonged contact has been demonstrated to be carcinogenic. Not only does this inability to have healthy bowel evacuations place individuals in risk of their overall health, but the build-up of waste material in the intestine and colon can result in bowel irregularity or even constipation. Herbal Intestinal Cleanse is a pleasant tasting herbal formulation designed to support comprehensive intestinal health. The occasional usage of an intestinal cleansing product such as Herbal Intestinal Cleanse, has been shown to support the healthy absorption of nutrients, rehydration, and gentle waste elimination. Herbal Intestinal Cleanse is formulated from natural fiber sources. The various sizes of the fibers present in this product provide a more natural and complete evacuation, and cleansing of the intestinal villi. Also the presence of Senna Leaf Powder and Buckthorn Bark Powder, provide a mild laxative effect along with the intestinal cleansing effect of the other natural herbal powders in the product.INDICATIONS Herbal Intestinal Cleanse provides a useful dietary supplement for individuals wishing to pursue gentle waste elimination.
