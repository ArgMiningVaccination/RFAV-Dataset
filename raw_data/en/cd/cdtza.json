Bone setting, manipulation, and stretching the spine as in yoga, have been a common practice in this ancient medicine. Chiropractics offers more than just adjustments. We also offer nutritional coaching, injury prevention, posture integration, and tissue alignment. Chiropractors are considered physicians in Florida and can be used as a primary care physician in workman's compensation and personal injury cases. The combination of massage, chiropractic care and trigger point therapy can enhance many health and bodily functions. We all know that balance is important to health. Activity needs to be balanced with rest. Concern needs to be balanced with not caring. In the area of the musculo-skeletal system, the left side of the joint needs to be in balance with the right side of the joint. Both musculature and connective tissue can become more tired on one side of the joint, causing malfunction, irritation, inflammation, and pain. The knee is a perfect example of a joint that is highly susceptible to imbalances of musculature. The quadriceps muscle is a group of 4 muscles that work to extend the knee. Often, the medial or the lateral muscle in this group can become hypertensive resulting in misalignment, and wear and tear on the knee itself. Over time, this can worsen, causing the individual to seek help from a professional. Please note: Upon reservation, we will ask for your credit or debit card information.
