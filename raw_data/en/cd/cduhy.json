I appreciate the input .Thanks Rick ___________________________________________________________________________ Previous post.In my endless quest for sleep, I have learned many things. First and foremost is I am fairly sure I am genetically geared to a later day and am very likely going to go to a sleep clinic for proper diagnosis of this delayed sleep phase. My natural hours when left to my own devices are several hours off what is generally considered \"normal\" in a morning-person world. However, since I have to work the standard 8-5 schedule, my sleep is lacking on a regular basis and has been for years. I have also learned I cannot take Lunesta, as the side-effects were extraordinarily unpleasant after just one pill (horrid taste, long-lasting drugged feeling, woke after six hours, etc). So there goes that idea to help reset my sleep clock. I already take melatonin on a regular basis, which does help, but generally not enough. I have tried the valerian root/melatonin combo and it didn't really help more than the melatonin solo. So here is where the topic comes into play: What do you all know about kava? It was recommended on [an herbal sleep remedy site](http://www.motherearthnews.com/Ask-Our-Experts/Natural-Health/Effective-Herbal-Sleep-Remedies.aspx)(along with chamomile, catnip, and valerian root, all of which I know are safe to use and do help). I just don't know much about kava itself. I have done some reading and learned that so long as the root only is used, it is non-toxic (toxicity comes from using stems and leaves). There is a site [here](http://www.konakavafarm.com/whatis.html)that sells root-only preparations and has a lot of information. Has anyone used this or known anyone to use this for sleep disorders and to improve sleeping? I would LOVE, dearly, to feel refreshed after sleeping. Comments Re: KAVA...... for sleep ? experiences?
