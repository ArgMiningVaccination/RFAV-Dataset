Menopause Treatment As each woman's journey through menopause is unique and the symptoms can be complex in certain cases; an in-depth consultation takes place to help devise an individualized homeopathic menopause treatment plan. For example, when it comes to hot flushes, two women may have completely different symptoms. Hot flushes may be gradual or sudden; they may occur only at night or during the day or at certain times throughout the day. A history of stress or poor diet may cause menopause symptoms for one woman, while a history of synthetic female sex hormones (through hormone replacement therapy) may cause symptoms for another. Homeopathic medicine for [menopause](https://www.drbatras.com/menopause) is prescribed based on these symptoms along with a history of emotional and general health. Conventional treatment vs. homeopathy treatment for Menopause Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) involves medication that contains female hormones. The medication replaces the estrogen that your body stops making during menopause with synthetic steroid estrogen. But at the same time, hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of certain serious conditions, including: - Heart disease - Stroke - Blood clots - Breast cancer Homeopathic menopause treatment works on balancing the hormones, detoxing the liver and improving energy. Homeopathic medicines help to support the natural self-healing of the female hormonal system in a non-invasive way. According to a study published in ResearchGate, to examine the effectiveness of homeopathic menopause treatment, 99 physicians from 8 countries took part in the study which included 438 patients with an average age of 55. Homeopathic medicines for menopause were prescribed to 98% of prescribed homeopathic remedies for menopause. A non-homeopathic treatment and/or food supplement was prescribed for 2% of the patients.

Irregular vaginal bleeding Irregular vaginal bleeding may happen when a woman is near menopause. Some women may have less severe problems with abnormal bleeding during the time prior to menopause whereas others can have excessive, unpredictable bleeding. Menses may occur more frequently (the cycle shortens in duration), or they may get farther apart (the cycle lengthens in duration) before they stop. Hot flushes Hot flushes are common among women undergoing menopause. A hot flush is a feeling of warmth that spreads over the body and is often felt in the chest and head. It usually lasts for 30 seconds to several minutes. Night sweats Night sweats (episodes of drench sweating at night) sometimes accompany hot flushes. This may lead to awakening and trouble in falling asleep again; it can result in restless sleep and daytime fatigue. Vaginal symptoms Vaginal symptoms occur because the tissue lining of the vagina becomes thinner, drier and less elastic with low estrogen levels. Symptoms may include vaginal itching, dryness and pain during sexual intercourse. The vaginal changes can also increase the risk of vaginal infections. Menopause treatment is recommended for vaginal symptoms as it can lead to health complications and increase in severity. Urinary symptoms The urethra lining (the tube leading from the bladder to release urine outside the body) also undergoes changes. It becomes drier, thinner and less elastic with declining estrogen levels. This can lead to frequent urination, leakage of urine or risk of urinary tract infection. Emotional and cognitive symptoms Peri-menopause, also known as menopause transition, is the time when the ovaries gradually begin to make less estrogen. It often reports a variety of emotional and mental processing symptoms, including irritability, memory problems, fatigue and rapid mood changes. Other physical changes Many women notice weight gain during menopause. The distribution of body fat may change; body fat may deposit more in the abdominal and waist area rather than in the thighs and hips. Changes in skin texture like wrinkles may develop along with worsening of adult acne. Since the body continues to produce small quantities of the male hormone testosterone, some women may experience slight hair growth on the upper lip, chin, chest, or abdomen. It is best recommended to get a menopause treatment at the soonest if the severity of the symptoms is affecting your physical and mental health. How long does menopause last for?

Myths and Facts [Know more](#collapsefaqpage) - Menopause begins at 50. The average woman begins menopause in her early 50s, but you may start your transition anywhere from your 30s to your 60s. You may even still be having periods when you start to experience unusual fatigue, hot flushes, mood swings, irritability and weight gain. If you are having these symptoms, you might be having perimenopause, the shift leading up to menopause. Perimenopause can last from a few months to up to 13 years prior to menopause. - Weight gain is inevitable in menopause. Weight-gain is an absolute in menopause, but it can be controlled. The hormonal changes that occur during menopause give rise to this weight gain. The body's metabolism tends to slow down, which also adds to the problem. Weight-gain around the waist, hips and thighs is commonly seen. - Hair loss is common during menopause, but the hair will grow back after some time. Hair loss is a common symptom of menopause. However, the hair does not necessarily grow back. Therefore, it is essential to take medical treatment for your hair. Homeopathy is a good answer to help you with your menopause and your hair loss as well. - The older you are when you get your period, the older you will be when you go through menopause. For many women, just the opposite is true. If you started menstruating later than usual, you may begin menopause earlier. Predicting the age you will begin menopause is very difficult, but there are some of the influencing factors which may be smoking, drinking, your mother's menopausal age and your pregnancy history. - Menopause only causes physical symptoms. Many women experience unnerving changes in their emotions, memory and concentration during perimenopause and menopause due to sudden shifts in hormones. Changes in the oestrogen and progesterone levels may cause mood swings. Drops in the progesterone may cause increased irritability and moodiness. Also, be mindful that menopause is a developmental milestone in women's life. It is sometimes referred to as \"adolescence in reverse\". Many women begin to reflect on who they are and what they want to do with the rest of their life. "}
