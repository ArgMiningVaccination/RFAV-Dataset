Most of the African traditional medicines (ATM) are formulated as energy tonics to boost and maintain immune defences. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the immune effects of a tradit ional energy tonic using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs),THP-1monocytes,andbacteriainfectedrats.WhentestedinmitogenandpeptidoglycanstimulatedPBMCs,thisenergy tonic showed minimal cytotoxicity, while in acute toxicity studies in rats it did not exhibit any significant toxicity at doses up to 2000mg/mL/kg. The energy tonic doses between 100 and 10 g/mL were shown to stimulate secretion of cytokines and increase sIL-2R levels in PHA-treated <0.05) decrease in sIL-2R levels. NF- transcriptional activity was increased in LPS stimulated THP-1 cells. In Sprague Dawley rats pretreated with the energy tonic and then infected with S. aureus,t h e r e were insignificant increases in cytokines and sIL-2R when compared to bacteria infected only and 5% Enrofloxacin treated rats.Posttreatment with energy tonic doses after infection with S. aureus did not enhance inflammatory cytokines significantly but changedtheimmuneresponseprofileanddecreasedcorticosteronelevels.ThisATMshowedpromisingimmunomodulatoryeffectsonisolatedimmunecellsandmodulatedtheimmuneresponseofratmodelsinfectedwith S.aureus. 1. Introduction Traditional health practitioners (THPs) are established healthcare service providers in their communities, more especially in African societies. This is partly due to a lack of development and poverty that traditional medicines are stillconsidered essential for the physical and mental welfare of Africans [1]. Governments in several African states are now givingmaximumattentiontoalternativehealthcaresystems,which in effect has instigated a new drive for research andinvestmentinthedesignofnewprogrammesinthisfield. Besides the use of indigenous based remedies for treat- ment of HIV and AIDS, the interest has also been increasedb yt h ec o n t i n u e du s eo ft h e s er e m e d i e sf o ri m m u n es y s t e mb a s e da i l m e n t se v e nw h e na l l o p a t h i cm e d i c i n e sm a yb eavailable. The immune system is a part of the body which is able to detect a pathogen by using a specific receptor toproduce immediate response by the activation of immune componentscells,cytokines,andchemokinesandalsorelease of inflammatory mediator [2]. Traditional healers have for centuries advocated the value of using a combination of herbalremediesandsingleextractsandcombinedmedicinalplantstoactivatethebody'simmunesystem,self-healing,and protectiveprocesses[3]. AstheAfricanconceptsofhealthandsicknessareholistic, the approach to illness management and treatment should a l s ob ec o m p r e h e n s i v ea n dh o l i s t i c .S o m ec o m m o nm e d i c a l principleshaveemergedovertimeinvariousAfricanregions.These include several scientifically proven techniques and Hindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2017, Article ID 6310967, 14 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/63109672 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine strategies, some of which are culturally specific and of psy- chological importance [4]. The philosophy of African tradi- tionalhealingcentersaroundrestoringthebody'senergybal-ance and strengthening both mind and body through com- binations of physical and mental interventions. Therefore, t h e s ee n e r g ym e d i c i n e sa r eu s e dt os t i m u l a t et h eb o d y ' s immune and hormonal systems and provide effective strate- giestoreducestress,thusreducingtheassaultontheimmunesystem caused by the production of stress-related biochemi- cals[5].Applyingtraditionalmedicinestocleansethebloodis acommonpracticeamongAfricansandislinkedtoboostingbody energy. A belief system exists which says a cure orrelief is only to be found through purging the blood and cleansing the body [6]. Boosting the immune system to fight opportunistic infections has become synonymous withthese medicinal products which are based on traditionalknowledge [7]. Any change in the immune response caninvolveinduction,expression,amplification,orinhibitionofanyphaseorpartoftheimmuneresponse[8]. In evaluating traditional medicines including ATM, Western biomedical scientists mostly have the na \u00a8ve expec- tation of discovering drugs from medicinal plants used inATM. Although these expectations are justified in certainailments, certain interventions involving rituals and divina-tions are hard to evaluate [9]. Some of the shortcomings oftheseethnopharmacologicalstudiesaretheirfocusonsingleplants and finding new active compounds, while THPsgenerally use a combination of plants with multiple phys-iological targets. Traditional herbalists for centuries havevalued the use of a combination of herbal remedies andsingleextractsandcombinedmedicinalplantstoactivatethebody'sowndefencemechanisms,self-healing,andprotectiveprocesses [3]. The increased use of these immune tonics necessitatesanevolutionofamechanismforrapidevaluation of clinical applications of these products. Researchers havestrongly advocated the use of specific animal models toevaluate the immunomodulatory mechanisms of traditionalimmune tonics [10, 11]. These can include inbred strains ofanimalswithknownsusceptibilityofinfection,autoimmunedisease, and cancer. In vitro studies for understanding themechanism of action should also be developed and usedalongside authenticated ATM material in order to produceresults that are reliable [12]. This has been proven by ar e c e n ts t u d yb yK o ff u o re ta l .[ 1 1 ]w h i c hs h o w e dt h a tt w oherbal decoctions used in the management of HIV/AIDSinGhanahadimmunostimulatoryandantimicrobialeffects.In this study, we therefore aimed to evaluate the traditionalenergytonicprescribedbyatraditionalhealerforitspossibleimmune stimulating effects using human blood models andspecificallyinfectedanimalmodels. 2.

The tradi- tional energy tonic formulationsamples were a gift from the ownerofthetraditionalmedicineformulation,HerbalistPro-tus Cele. The Herbalist was actively involved in the researchprocessandgavetheresearchersatourofthetraditionalprac-tice where the product was formulated and manufactured.Briefly,thisproductwasformulatedbycombining6differentmedicinal plants which were combined in equal measuresas sun-dried and ground plant material made up of bark,Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 stems,andcorms.The6differentmedicinalplantsare Uqonsi (Eriosema (Tragia meyeriana M\u00a8ull.Arg.)( E u ily),Iklolo(Grewia occidentalis var. occidentalis, lum capense (Thunb.) Harv., small knobwood) (Rutaceae family). These medicinal plants were identified in a book coauthored by Herbalist Cele [13] and this was used asa reference for their identification along with Hutchingset al. [14]. Chemical fingerprints of the traditional energytonic using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)andnuclearmagneticresonance(NMR)areprovidedassupplementary data. To prepare the crude extract, the sun-dried medicinal plants were powdered using a traditionalpestle and mixed proportionally at about 1kg each in a 25-litre traditional pot and then extracted by boiling in waterovernight (approximately 12 hours). The extract was thencooled, filtered once with a sifting net, and then packagedinto1-or5-litrecontainers.Asinglesampleof10litresofthetraditional energy tonic was provided for the whole of thisstudytoavoidinconsistencyinthepreparationmethod. To prepare the extract for in vitro studies, the liquid extractwasfurthersterilefilteredwithfilterpapersandfreezedried to powder. The powdered plant material was thenreconstitutedat10mg/mLinphosphatebufferedsaline(PBS)andthiswasfurthersterilefilteredtwicewith0.22 mfilters. Working concentrations of 1000, 500, 100, 50, and 10 g/mL were reconstituted using complete culture media (CCM).Endotoxin contamination was measured using the LimulusAmebocyte Lysate (LAL) QCL-1000/_0054 (Lonza, USA) with sensitivity of units (EU) per mL. Polymyxin Bsulphate(10g/mL)wasaddedtoreducetheimmunostimu- latoryeffectsduetoendotoxincontamination. Foranimalstudies,thefreezedriedaqueouscrudeextract of the traditional energy tonic was orally administered toexperimentalratsatdosesrangingfrom2000to5mg/mL/kgper body weight (2000, 300, 50, and 5mg/kg: 5 animals perdose)andthedoselevelsweredeterminedbytheexperimentto be performed. The traditional medicine preparation wasadministered in constant volume over the range of doses tobetestedandwasreconstitutedinanaqueousbuffersolution.Doses administered were prepared prior to administration[15,16]. 2.4.

The resulting supernatant was resuspended in CCM at 1\u00d7106cells/mL and then different models of PBMCs were prepared according to Leung et al. [17] by stimulating the isolated PBMCs with either PHA or PG-S. aureus for 2 hours. Without removing the different stimuli, the cells were aliquoted to 6-well plates and treatedwith doses of the traditional energy tonic ranging from1000g/mLto10g/mL at a ratio of 1:1. The stimulated and energytonictreatedPBMCswerethenincubatedfor24hours at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity.

Thetraditional medicine preparation doses ranging from 2000 to 5mg/mL/kg body weight were administered in a single dose over 24 hours by gavage using a stomach tube ora suitable intubation cannula. Animals were fasted (foodwithheld but not water) overnight prior to dosing [15].For acute toxicity studies, rats were observed for 7-14 daysafter oral administration of herbal medicine extracts.

The starting dosewas the highest prefixed dose under the OECD guidelineswhich is 2000mg/mL/kg body weight followed by seconddose in the prefixed doses regime (300mg/mL/kg). Dosingwasrepeatedtwiceforreproducibilityofthestudies. 2.6. Infection Model. To assess the in vivo mechanisms of herbal medicine extracts, male Sprague Dawley rats ( \u00b1250g body weight) were given intraperitoneal (i.p., 1mL/250g body weight) injections of Staphylococcus aureus (1\u00d710 7 particles/mL)in5%mucin.Thetraditionalmedicineextract(20mg/mL/kgbodyweight)wasgiveneither24hoursbeforeinfection (preventative) or 24 hours after infection (diseasetreatment).

Serum samples from treated rats and controlswere used to assess the changes in inflammatory cytokinesandlevelsofsolubleIL-2receptor. 2.7. Cell Cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity of the traditional energytoxicdoseswasmeasuredbyquantifyingthelevelsof Briefly, sample (100L) of 24-hour treated/control cell suspension was pipetted into three different wells of a white opaque 96-well plate. The working CellTiter-Glo Reagent (cat. number: G7570) was prepared immediately b e f o r eu s ea n dw a sa d d e dt ot h ew e l l sw i t ht r e a t e dc e l l sa t 100L per well. The plate was agitated on a plate shaker for 2m i n u t e sa t1 5 0and incubated in darkness for 10 minutes at room temperature. At the end of the incubation period,the plate was loaded into the luminometer and the relativeluminescence units (RLU) of the samples were measured.Background signals of cell culture media and energy tonicdoses (negative control) were subtracted from each averageread. A dose response curve was also generated for the ATPlevels using RLU versus different concentrations of samples.The cell viability was in triplicate and repeatedthreetimesbeforethefollow-upassayswereundertaken. 2.8.InflammatoryCytokinesAssays.

The ELISA analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, incubation of the sam-ples in the 96-well plates allowed the capture antibodies tobind their specific protein of interest. Samples stimulated with PHA or PG- S. aureus treated with the traditional energy tonic doses (100 and 10 g/mL) and controls were analysed. Also, samples from rat infection models treated with the traditional energy tonic doses (100 and 20 g/mL) a n dc o n t r o l sw e r ea n a l y s e df o l l o w i n gt h es a m ep r o t o c o l .

After incubation for 30 minutes and washing to remove theunbound enzyme, a substrate solution (100 L) produced coloured reaction product. The intensity of this colouredproduct is directly proportional to the concentration of sIL-2R present in the samples. The enzyme-substrate reactionwasstoppedbyquicklypipetting100 Lofsulphuric acid.

For serum samples from treated and control rat models, 100L of standard or samples were added to triplicate wells and incubated for 2 hours at 37 C. Standard and samples were then removed and, without washing the wells, 100 L ofbiotinantibody(1x)wasaddedtoeachwellandincubatedfor 1 hour at 37 C. This was followed by a wash step which wasrepeated3times.Horseradishperoxidase-avidin(100 L) wasaddedtoeachwell,coveredtheplate,andwasincubated for 1 hour at 37C. Following a repeated wash process, 90 L of TMB substrate was added to each well and incubated at 37C protected from light for 15 minutes.

The restorative and rejuvenating power of these herbal remedies might be due to their action on the immune system and some of the medicinal plantsare believed to enhance the natural resistance of the bodyto infections [2]. In the current study, we investigated thein vitro and in vivo immunomodulatory of an aqueousextract of an African traditional energy tonic formulated byan experienced traditional health practitioner. When testedin PHA- or PG-S. aureus -stimulated PBMCs models, this energy tonic showed minimal cytotoxicity with IC 50values well above 1000g/mL in both models (Figure 1). In the acute toxicity studies on Sprague Dawley rat models, thetraditionalenergy tonic again did notexhibit any significanttoxicityatthehighestpossibledoseof2000mg/mL/kgbodyweight with resultant estimated LD 50being in the range of 2000 to 5000mg/kg. It is important to highlight the factthat the traditional energy tonic used in this study wasprepared in the same manner and conditions as would bedone for the traditional healer's patients. Therefore the lackof toxicity demonstrated in both cell lines and rat modelsbodeswellforthesafetyoftheproductinhumans.Accordingto the traditional healer who prepared the energy tonic, theprescribeddoseoftenvariesdependingonthestateofhealthof the patient but the general recommended dose equates to02468101214161820 LPS stimulated THP-1 cellsCyclosporine 100 50 10 R enilla 1 cells treated with none cytotoxic doses of the traditional energy tonic.Onlythehighestdose(100 g/mL)oftheenergytonicinduced a significant increase (<0.05) in transcriptional activity of NF- , while the lower doses did not cause any significant change.

Following freeze drying, we calculated t h a te a c hd o s ec o n s i s t e do fa b o u t5m go fp l a n tm a t e r i a lp e rmL of water. Although it would be difficult to extrapolatethe in vitro results to a full human physiology, these recom-mended dosages seem minimal to cause any human adversetoxic effects. The World Health Organization (WHO) hasencouraged countries where traditional medicines are stillwidelyusedtoensurethatsafetyandefficacystudiesoftheseproducts are initiated to prevent any public health concerns[19]. Theabilityofimmunomodulatorstoenhanceorsuppress immune responses can depend on a number of factors, includingdose,routeofadministration,andtimingofadmin- istration.Thisresponsecanalsodependontheirmechanism of action or site of activity and therefore the methodol- ogy used to measure the immunomodulatory effects of a c o m p o u n dn e e d st ob ec h o s e nc a r e f u l l y[ 2 0 ] .T os t u d ythe immune stimulating effects of the traditional energy tonic in vitro, especially designed PBMCs models of PHA- and PG-S. aureus-stimulated immune cells were used. The traditional energy tonic at noncytotoxic doses ranging from100 to 10g/mL was also shown to stimulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and increase sIL-2R levels 6(a)). In PG- S. aureus- stimulated PBMCs, the energy tonic significantly increased IL-1,IL-2,andGM-CSFsecretionwhencomparedtoPG- S. aureusonlytreatedsamplesandcausedasignificantdecrease insIL-2Rlevels(Figures3and6(b)).PHAhasbeenshownto resulting activation of the production of IL-2 and IFN- [21]. As observed in previous studies using similar models, theproliferative effect of PHA normally peaks after 48 hours ofstimulation[22].Therefore,fullstimulatoryeffectsofPHAonsecretionofcytokinesoccurafter48hourswhenPBMCsarealsoproliferatingrapidly.ThesIL-2Rassayontheotherhandclearly demonstrated the increased production of solublereceptors as a marker of the initiation of the effects of PHA.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine generation of sIL-2R has been shown to be not as a result of cell death but the rate of release ofthis molecule is in proportion to its surface expression inimmune cells [23]. In vitro cellular activation as a result ofstimuli such as PHA or peptidoglycan has been observed tolead to not only the synthesis of cell-associated IL-2R butalso a soluble form of the be foundin cell-free supernatants [23]. Immunomodulation usingtraditional medicinal plants can be used as an alternative to,or in conjunction with, conventional therapy for a variety ofdiseases, especially when host defenses have to be activatedundertheconditionsofimpairedimmuneresponse[24].Pre-viously,wehavedemonstratedthatacommercialtraditionalmedicine modulates the levels of sIL-2R in supernatantsof PHA-stimulated PBMCs [22]. In the traditional tonic modulated levels of sIL-2R insupernatants those stimulated with PHA. Peptidoglycan is acomponentofbothGram-positiveandGram-negativebacte-rial cell walls and is a functional LPS analog. Peptidoglycanhas potent proinflammatory properties in vitro includingthe induction of IL-1 and TNF- but at a significantly higher dose than LPS [25]. Although the traditional energytonic doses were stimulatory to some of the inflammatorycytokines in PBMCs stimulated with PG- S. aureus ,t h i sinflammatory effect was not as pronounced as in PHA-stimulated PBMCs. The observed anti-inflammatory effectsagainst certain cytokines in this model may serve to controlthe immune response during bacterial infections because,duringinfection,peptidoglycanrecognitiondrivesbothcell-autonomous and whole organism defense responses [26].In vitro studies have shown that modulatory effects oftraditionalmedicinesoftendonotderivefromasinglecom-pound but from several compounds generating synergisticactivity[20].Inthisstudyandpreviousstudiesontraditionalmedicines using similar models, we have demonstrated thatthis extends to formulations of multiple medicinal plants aspracticed in African traditional medicine [22]. These obser-vations have prompted researchers working on traditionalmedicines to propose that multicomponent products thattargetmultiplesitesaffectthecomplexphysiologicalresponsemorefavorablythandrugsthatactonasingletarget[20]. Themechanismofimmunestimulationbythetraditional energy tonic was investigated in normal and LPS stimulatedTHP-1 monocytes by analyses of the transcriptional activity of NF-. Transcription factors such NF- and activator protein-1 (AP-1) regulate the gene expression leading to synthesis of cytokines, chemokines, growth hormones, andothersignalingmoleculessuchasnitricoxide(NO)[27].LPSstimulation of THP-1 cells followed by treatment with dosesofamultiherbaltraditionalmedicineshowedthatchangesintranscriptionalactivityofNF-arelinkedtomodulationof chemokines [28]. In this study, LPS stimulation of12 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine THP-1 cells followed by treatment with doses of the energy toniccausedadosedependentincreaseinNF- activitywith higher doses significantly increasing ( <0.05)t r a n s c r i p - tional activity of NF-, while the low dose did not cause anysignificantchange.TheincreasedNF- activitysupports the observed increased secretion of inflammatory at 100g/mL. Cyclosporine reduced NF- transcrip- as expected (Figure Lipopolysaccharide,similar to peptidoglycan, activates cells through Toll-likereceptor 4 (TLR4) as the central recognition and signalproteins. Engagement of cellular receptors leads to synthesisof new proteins through alteration of the pattern of geneexpression[27]. Thenextexperimentsstudiedthepossibleimmunestim- ulatory effects of the traditional energy tonic in SpragueDawleyratmodelsinfectedwithlive Staphylococcusaureus(S. aureus)beforeoraftertreatmentwithtraditionalenergytonic doses.Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most significant pathogensinhumansepsisandendocarditis. Thebacteria can also initiate blood coagulation, leading to the formation ofmicrothrombiandmultiorgandysfunctioninsepsis,whereasinendocarditisthebacteriuminducesfibrinclotsontheinnersurfaceoftheheart,theso-calledendocardialvegetation[29].Pretreatment of rat models with the traditional energy tonicfollowed by infection with S. aureus did not significantly enhance the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, eventhough some showed a slight increase (Figure 4). In thesame treated rat models, the levels of sIL-2R were slightly increased in the higher dose, while the lower dose of the energytoniccausedasignificant( <0.05)decreaseinthese receptors.Asimilartrendwasseeninposttreatedratmodels in terms of inflammatory cytokines secretion and concen-tration of sIL-2Rin circulation but both responses were less pronounced.Interestingly, there was a direct correlationbetween the slight increase in IL-2 secretion and increasedlevelsofsIL-2Rinpretreatedratmodelsat100mg/mL/kgof theenergytonic.Thiscorrelationwasalsoobservedinpostin-fection treated rat models at the lowest dose of the energytonic.TheassociationbetweentheincreasedlevelsofsIL-2Rand immunostimulation has been demonstrated in variousinflammatorydiseasesinvivo.Seidleretal.[30]showedthatpatients with chronic liver disease (CLD) had significantlyelevatedserumsIL-2RlevelscomparedwithcontrolsandthiswasassociatedwithproinflammatorycytokinesincludingIL-2, IFN-, or IL-6 and chemokines. The shedding of sIL-2Rmay also limit the responsiveness of immune cells to IL-2stimuli, thereby averting any risk of an excessive immuneresponsewhichcanleadtoinflammatorydisorders[31,32]. African traditional health practitioners (THPs) do not only target the illness affecting the patient but also treatbody, mind, and spirit. Therefore, in assessing a traditionalmedicine product like the current traditional energy tonic,another experiment evaluated the levels of corticosterone in serumsamplesoftreatedinfectedratmodels.Corticosterone issecretedbytheadrenalcortexundercontrolofthepituitaryhormone,adrenocorticotropichormone(ACTH),viaanega-tivefeedbackmechanism.Itisthemostabundantcirculatingsteroid in rats and has a wide range of activities includingregulating carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism. It hasalso an influence on the hemopoietic system and of lymphocytes and eosinophils, althoughtheseanti-inflammatoryeffectsareminimalwhencomparedtocortisol[33,34].Infectionwith S.aureus clearlyincreased the levels of this hormone when compared to uninfected rats which may be an indication of increase in stress levels (Tables 1 and 2). Pretreatment of rats with the energy tonicdoses followed by infection with bacteria further increasedlevels of corticosterone which may indicate that this type ofpreventativetreatmentisnotbeneficialinreducingstressandstimulatingtheimmuneresponse.Enrofloxacinontheotherhand significantly reduced this hormone when compared toinfected rats left untreated (Table 1). Infection of rat modelswithS.aureus followedbytreatmentwithenergytonicdoses or 5% Enrofloxacin 24 hours later resulted in significantdecrease (<0.05) in corticosterone levels when comparedto untreated, saline treated, and S. aureus infected only rats (Table2).Therefore,thiscurativeformoftreatmentseemstohavemorebeneficialeffectsinreducingcorticosteronelevels. While our main focus was on the traditional energy tonic as a traditional medicinal product, it is also importantto point out that Herbalist Cele, who has the intellectualrights to this product, has over 50 years of experience inworking with medicinal plants. Therefore his knowledge ofmedicinal plants is not doubted. The six medicinal plantsformulated to make the traditional energy tonic have com-mon characteristics in that all of them are used tradition-ally for impotence and infertility related ailments. Suchmedicinal plants are important traditional tonics because of their effects on blood flow, muscle contractibility, and other hormonal effects. This demonstrates that traditionalk n o w l e d g ei sn o tc o l l e c t e dh a p h a z a r d l yb u ti ss t r e a m l i n e dto meet a certain purpose. Of these plants, E. kraussianum has been shown to contain bioactive compounds kraus-sianone 1 and kraussianone 2 which have been shown tohave hypoglycaemic effects and vasodilatory properties inar a tm o d e l[ 3 5 ] . Rapanea melanophloeos is used by Zulu traditional healers to manage blood-clot-related diseases. Itis also widely used to treat helminthiasis (worm infection)in tropical areas [36, 37]. COX-2 free radicals [36, 38]. G. occidentalis is used traditionally as a bruised bark soaked in hot water which isused to treat wounds [14, 39]. Petroleum anti-inflammatory activity [40].

Conclusion Th ec u r r e n ts t u d yi n v e s t i g a t e dt h ei nv i t r oa n di nv i v oimmunomodulatory effects of an aqueous extract of anAfrican traditional energy tonic formulated by an experi-enced traditional healer. This traditional energy tonic has been shown to possess immunomodulatory effects both in in vitro human PBMCs and in bacteria infected rat models.The study will go a long way in charting a way towards thescientific validation of traditional medicines formulated bytraditional healers. The study of these immunomodulatorymechanisms can be enhanced by further studies involvingcytokineexpressionandapplicabilityofsuchimmunomodu-lationtodiseasessuchascancerandtuberculosis.Therefore,furtherstudiesonotheranimalmodelsandinfectionmodelswith shorter treatment periods are warranted to furtherunderstand the energy stimulating effects of this traditionalenergy tonic.
