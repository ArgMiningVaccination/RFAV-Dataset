KEY MESSAGES FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES Many people with diabetes use complementary medicine (along with) or alternativemedicine(insteadof)withconventionalmedicationsfordiabetes. Although some of these therapies may have the potential to be effective, theyhavenotbeensucientlystudiedandotherscanbeineffectiveorevenharmful. It is important to let your health-care providers know if you are using complementary and/or alternative medicine for your diabetes. Introduction Despite advances in the management of type 1 and type 2 dia- betes,therapeutictargetsareoftennotmet.Peopledissatisedwithconventional medicine often turn to nontraditional alternatives.Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) can be looselydened as health-care approaches developed outside of main-stream Western, or conventional medicine, with \"complemen-tary\"meaningusedtogetherwith,and\"alternative\"meaningusedin place of conventional medicine (1). According to a report from the Fraser Institute, 50% to 79% of Canadians had used at least 1CAM sometime in their lives, based on surveys from 1997, 2006and2016 (2).Themostcommontypesusedin2016weremassage (44%), chiropractic care (42%), yoga (27%), relaxation techniques(25%) acupuncture (22%). According to the United States 2012NationalHealthInterviewSurvey(NHIS),17.7%of Americanadultsused a dietary supplement other than vitamins and minerals (3). Afewsurveyshavesoughttocharacterizetheuseof CAMinpersonswith diabetes. In a Canadian study of 502 people with diabetes,44% were taking over-the-counter supplements with 31% takingalternativemedications (4).AUnitedStatesnationalsurveyreported 57% of those with diabetes using CAM in the previous year (5). TheMedicalExpenditurePanelSurveys(MEPS)showedthatthosewith diabetes were 1.6 times more likely to use CAM than thosewithout diabetes, with older age ( 65 years) and higher educa- tional attainment (high school education or higher) indepen-dently associated with CAM use (6). An Australian study reported 25% of people with diabetes stated they had used CAM within theprevious 5 years (7). This chapter will review CAM, including natural health prod- ucts(NHP)andothers,suchasyoga,acupuncture,taichiandreflex-ology, that have been studied for the prevention and treatment ofdiabetes and its complications. NHP for the Prevention and Treatment of Diabetes and Its Complications In Canada, NHP are dened as vitamins and minerals, herbal remedies, homeopathic medicines, traditional medicines, such astraditional Chinese medicines, probiotics, and other products likeamino acids and essential fatty acids (8). They are regulated under the Natural Health Products Regulations, which came intoeffect in 2004. In general, the current level of evidence for theecacy and safety of NHP in people with diabetes is lower thanthat for pharmaceutical agents. Trials tend to be of shorter dura-tion and involve smaller sample sizes. Concerns remain aboutstandardizationandpurityof availablecompounds,includingtheircontamination with regular medications and, in some cases, toxicsubstances (9-11). Various NHP have been studied to evaluate their impact on the development of both type 1 and type 2 diabe-tes, glycemic control in people with diabetes, and on the variouscomplications of diabetes. NHP for the Prevention and Treatment of Diabetes A number of immune modulators have been studied in an attempttopreventorarrestbetacelldeclineintype1diabetes,mostwith limited success.

A randomized controlled trial of people with new-onset type 1 diabetes assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementationon regulatory T (Treg) cells (12). After 12 months, Treg suppres- sivecapacitywasimproved,althoughtherewasnosignicantreduc-tioninC-peptidedecline.Observationalstudieshavesuggestedaninverse relationship between vitamin D levels and the develop-mentof type2diabetes (13),althoughrandomizedcontrolledtrials are lacking (14). In the large, prospective cohort study, The Envi- ronmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY), earlyprobioticsupplementationmayreducetheriskof isletautoimmu-nity in children at the highest genetic risk of type 1 diabetes (15). A number of NHP have been evaluated to assess their effect on the progression from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to diabe-tes. Tianqi is a traditional Chinese medicine consisting of 10 dif-ferentherbs.Inadouble-blind,placebo-controlledtrialof12monthsduration, Tianqi was shown to reduce the progression from IGT totype 2 diabetes by 32% (16). A systematic review and meta- analysisofobservationalstudiesofomega-3fattyacidsorshintakeshowed that an increased intake of alpha linoleic acid (ALA) andfattyshreducedtheriskof type2diabetessignicantlywithALA,only in Asians (17). In a randomized controlled number ofpeople with IGT reverting to normal blood glucose levels as well(42.15% vs. 32.87% for placebo) (18). In adults with type 2 diabetes, the following NHP have been showntolowerglycatedhemoglobin(A1C)byatleast0.5%inran-domized controlled trials lasting at least 3 months: Ayurveda polyherbal formulation (19) Citrullus Theseproductsarepromisingandmeritconsiderationandfurther research,but,astheyaremostlysingle,smalltrialsormeta-analysesof such, it is premature to recommend their widespread use. The following NHP either failed to lower A1C by 0.5% in trials lasting at least 3 months in adults with type 2 diabetes, orwere studied in trials of shorter duration, nonrandomized or Camellia sinensis (52) Flaxseed oil (53) French maritime Ginseng (55,56) regia extract(57) Liuwei Dihuang or bitter gourd) (59,60) Rosa canina L.

Chromiumisanessentialtraceelementinvolvedinglucoseand lipid metabolism. Early studies revealed that chromium de-ciencycouldleadtoIGT,whichwasreversiblewithchromiumreple-tion. This led to a hypothesis that chromium supplementation, inthosewithbothadequateanddecientchromiumstores,couldleadto improved glucose control in people with diabetes (106,107) . Indeed, an analysis of the large NHANES database showed that, inthose in the general population who reported consuming a chro-miumsupplement,theoddsof developingdiabeteswas19%to27%lowerthanthosenottakingachromiumsupplement (108).However , randomizedcontrolledstudiesof chromiumsupplementationhavehad on improv-ing A1C (109-121) , although some showed an improved fasting glucose level (120,121) .

The later meta-analysis reportedmarkedheterogeneityandpublicationbiasintheincludedstudies. Vitamin D has received much interest recently with purported benetsoncardiovasculardisease(CVD),canceranddiabetes.Ran-domized controlled trials have not demonstrated a benet ofvitamin D supplementation on glycemic meta-analyses (139,140) . Vanadium, a element that is commonly used to treat type2diabetes,hasnotbeenstudiedinrandomizedcontrolledtrialsevaluating glycemic control by A1C over a period of 3 months orlonger.L.D. Grossman et al. / Can J Diabetes 42 (2018) S154-S161 S155NHP for the Treatment of the Co-Morbidities and Complications of Diabetes A number of NHP have been evaluated for the various co-morbiditiesandcomplicationsof diabetes,includinglipidsandblood pressure (BP) in diabetes, as well as CVD, nephropathy, reti-nopathy and peripheral neuropathy. As with the studies of glyce-mic control, most had small sample sizes and meta-analyses hadmarked heterogeneity of included studies, making strong conclu-sions dicult. Randomized controlled trials demonstrating a benet high heteroge- neity showed benet on lowering total cholesterol and TG (142). Other studies have failed to show signicant benet of vitamin Dsupplementation on lipids in people with diabetes (130,137,143) . A meta-analysis of Berberine showed it to increasehigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) more than tradi-tional lipid-lowering drugs, with no difference on total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (37). Berberine was also showntoreducetotalandLDL-CandincreaseHDL-Ccombinedwithtraditionallipid-loweringdrugscomparedwiththosedrugsalone. benet on systolic with traditional BP medications can lower systolic BP by an additional 4.9mmHgand diastolic BP by 2mmHg, but not when compared with tradi-tionalantihypertensivemedicationsalone (37).In1meta-analysis, vitamin D was shown to reduce BP by a statistically signicant,but not clinically meaningful amount (145). Ethylenediaminetetra-acetic(EDTA)acidchelationtherapyhas been postulated to have a number of cardiovascular (CV) benets.A large randomized controlled trial (Trial to Assess ChelationTherapy\u2014TACT) showed a modest benet of an 18% risk reductionfor a composite of CV complications in people with a recent myo-cardialinfarct (146).Apre-speciedsubanalysisof peoplewithdia- betesshowedamorerobust39%to41%riskreductionintheprimaryendpoint out to 5-years follow up (147). The traditional Chinese medicine product, The Compound Danshen Dripping Pill (CDDP), consisting of 3 herbal prepara-tions, was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial of 24 weeksduration, for its effect on the progression of diabetic retinopathy (148). Using a nonstandardized method of grading of diabetic retinopathy. A number of NHP have been reported to improve diabetic nephropathy. However, there is variation in the denition of dia-betic nephropathy in the various studies, with many assessingurinaryalbuminexcretion(UAE)and/or24-hoururineproteinexcre-tion without a conrmatory diagnosis. Many are of short dura-tion,somewithoutreportinganassessmentof renalfunctionoritsprogression, or with conflicting results on the various measures.Some products showing a reduction in UAE in people with diabe-tes include: the traditional Chinese medicines Yiqi D (156), and vitamin D ana- logue paricalcitol in type 1 diabetes (157). AnumberofNHPhavebeenreportedtoimprovediabeticperiph- eral neuropathy, as assessed by pain scores and/or nerve conduc-tionstudies(NCS).TopicalCitrulluscolocynthis(bitterapple)extractoilwasstudiedinasmallrandomizedcontrolledtrialinpeoplewith painful diabetic polyneuropathy (158). After 3 months, there was a signicantly greater decrease in mean pain score and improve-mentinnerveconductionvelocitiescomparedwithplacebo.Ameta-analysis of puerarin in diabetic peripheral neuropathy reportedbenets in pain scores and NCS (159). In a small randomized con- trolled trial, the traditional Chinese medicine MHGWT showedreducedpainscorescomparedwithplaceboafter12weeksof treat-ment (160). A number of the above and other NHP have been evaluated for theireffectsonvariouspre-clinicalparameters,biomarkersandsur-rogateclinicalmarkersinvolvedinthepathogenesisof diabetesanditscomplications.Adiscussionof thesepapersisbeyondthescopeof this chapter. Adverse Effects It is important to consider potential harm from the use of NHP. A number of studies of NHP report adverse events, such as gastro-intestinal(Fenugreek,Berberine,TM81,bittermelon,oralaloevera)and dizziness (JYTK). an abortifacient (161). Most clinical trials have evaluated small sample sizes over relatively short periods oftime and, thus, may not identify all potential side effects or risks. Some NHP contain pharmaceutical ingredients and/or can affect themetabolism of many drugs, including statins, by inducing cyto-chromeP4503A4(CYP3A4).Somestudieshavereportedpoorergly-cemiccontrolinpeopleusingglucosaminesulfateforosteoarthritis,but a systematic review concluded that the evidence does notsupport this concern (162).

Yoga TheSanskritdenitionof yogameansunionorconnection.Yoga is a Hindu spiritual discipline. There are many types of yoga, eachwith its own techniques and methods to awaken greater aware-nessandconnectiontoself andlife.Mostpracticesof yogaincludea series of physical postures, breathing and meditation for health,relaxation and overall well-being. Yoga or yoga therapy is oftenincluded in a holistic practitioner's (chiropractor, naturopath,L.D.

Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) encompasses a holistic system that includes the combination of herbal medicines, acu-puncture, tui na (rigorous massage), dietary therapy, qi gong andtaichi(mind/bodytechniquescombiningbreathing,movementandmentalfocus).TCMworkswithinadifferentparadigmthanWesternMedicineand,assuch,canbediculttostudybyWesternresearchtechniques.Treatmentsarecomplexandfocusedonindividualimbal-ances detected by pulse and tongue diagnosis rather than specicdiseases.Mostresearchontheeffectivenessof TCMforpeoplewithdiabetes is based on specic techniques or Chinese herbal rem-edies as reviewed above.

A meta-analysis of acupuncture for diabetic gastroparesisconcludedthatacupunctureimprovedsomedyspep-ticsymptoms,suchasnausea,vomiting,lossofappetiteandstomachfullness, with no improvement in solid gastric emptying (168).A systematic review of randomized controlled trials of manual acu-puncture for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathyreported that manual acupuncture had a better effect on globalsymptom improvement compared with vitamin B12 or no treat-ment,andthatthecombinationof manualacupunctureandvitaminB12hadabettereffectcomparedwithvitaminB12alone.However,theauthorscouldnotdrawclinicallyrelevantconclusionsbecauseof high risks of bias in the studies included (169). Tai chi is an ancient mind and body practice involving gentle, slow,continuousbodymovementswithmentalfocus,breathingandrelaxation. Although there may be some benet in quality of life,there is little evidence for benet of tai chi on glycemic control indiabetes (170,171) . Manual Therapies There is a growing number of people with diabetes who seek careformusculoskeletalcomplaintsandoveralllifestylemanagementfromnaturaland/orcomplementarymedicinepractitioners.Manual therapies, including chiropractic, physiotherapy, shiatsu, regis-tered massage therapy and therapy have a trial inpeople with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, foot reflexology wasshown to reduce A1C and FPG, and improve pain scores and nerveconduction velocity (175).
