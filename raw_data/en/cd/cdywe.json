It was terrific to receive such a positive reaction to the first magazine, and this second issue is full of content to intrigue, inspire and inform. It has been a year of many 'firsts' - the Rhodes Scholar Network is proving very popular (page 32) and the Rhodes Trust has expanded its geographic footprint for the first time this century, launching Rhodes Scholarships for China in March (page 5) and for the United Arab Emirates in April. Back in Oxford, the Rhodes Service & Leadership development programme has grown rapidly, with our inaugural retreats and workshops proving to be a great success (page 14). Reading the contributions from Rhodes Scholars from across the generations and constituencies, there are certainly a lot of firsts happening around the globe due to the creativity and hard work of members of the Rhodes Scholar community. Wherever you are, and whatever field you are currently pursuing, do keep in touch!Two New Trustees The Rhodes Trust is delighted to announce the appointment of two new Trustees, Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer and Professor Dame Carol Robinson. Nicholas Oppenheimer is Chairman of Oppenheimer Memorial Trust. He was Director of Anglo American plc and Chairman of De Beers SA until 2012. Professor Dame Carol Robinson is the Doctor Lee's Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford. She was the first female Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford and previously at the University of Cambridge. She is recognised for pioneering the use of mass spectrometry for her research into the 3D structure of proteins.

Sabeel Rahman (New York & Pembroke 2005), is a Four Freedoms Centre Fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, and in the autumn will join Brooklyn Law School as an Assistant Professor of Law. In 2014, he served as a Special Advisor on economic development strategy in New York CityPhilanthropic institutions like the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg's foundation have focused on supporting innovation among city level policymakers. From the World Bank to the UN, international organisations have similarly turned to cities as the primary actors in responding to climate change, implementing human rights, and promoting economic development. There are plans underway for a Global Parliament of Mayors to launch next year, creating a network fostering innovation and sharing of best practices among city bureaucrats and elected officials. For many across the political spectrum, the city offers the hope for a more pragmatic form of governance. They operate on the frontlines, working on the mundane and the transformative. As a result, cities are now celebrated as intrinsically apolitical, pragmatic and innovative. Yet in most countries cities have highly circumscribed powers, subordinate to national authorities. Furthermore, many of the pressing policy issues from climate change to inequality are national and global in scope, making them difficult to address through piecemeal, local policies. At the same time, beneath the veneer of pragmatic problem-solving, urban politics is more often driven by sharp disparities of economic, social, and political power, dividing constituencies on bases of race, ethnicity and class. In the US and globally, the turn to the city is in fact largely circumstantial, a product of gridlock and failure at the national and international level. Cities have emerged in part as policymakers of last resort - and it is not clear that the reality of city politics is up to the task. This is not to say this moment of urban renewal is an illusion; it's not. But the prevailing view of why we should turn our attention to the city is misleading. The city does offer a potentially transformative form of governance, but the radicalism of the city is not the result of intrinsically apolitical nature. Rather, the potential of urban governance stems from the ways in which policy-making at the city level forces us to grapple with realities of power and inequality and, in so doing, to innovate new forms of more inclusive governance.Though often on the trailing edge of innovation globally, a number of American cities today are tentatively charting this path. Consider participatory budgeting (PB). First developed in Porto Alegre in Brazil in the 1990s, PB emerged as part of the rise of leftist social movements, where ordinary residents were empowered to allocate the city's budget on everything from roads to social services. In the years since PB was introduced, studies have found positive impacts in social welfare spending and outcomes, as well as participation and trust in government. The radicalism of PB lies in its attempt to convert a central governmental function that is often dominated either by technocrats or relatively non-inclusive or unresponsive decision-making into a beachhead for democratic inclusion. PB is now proliferating in a number of cities in the US, from New York City to Vallejo, California. Other city reformers are attempting a similar transformation in the realm of local economic development planning. In the US as in many countries, urban planning has typically been a major way in which minorities and poorer residents have been excluded, losing out to wealthier residents and business interests as the redevelopment wagon transforms neighbourhoods. In some cities, however, reformers are charting a new path. In New York City, the de Blasio administration is piloting a participatory approach to public space with its Community Parks initiative, a program investing $130 million into the most underprivileged neighborhoods. As a central part of the investment, the city, along with partner organisations specialising in community-based design, are launching a long-term community engagement effort aimed at empowering local residents to shape the redesign of public parks in some of the most underserved neighborhoods of the city. Where many expensive redevelopments have often sparked economic growth skewed to the local and global elite - think of New York City's High Line park which despite its beauty and tourist attractiveness, also radically transformed Chelsea into a playground for condos, galleries, and restaurants catering to the wealthiest individuals - the hope is that this democratic process will promote a more equitable and The potential of urban governance stems from the ways in which policy making at the city level forces us to grapple with realities of power and inequality We live in an increasingly urban age. While the economic centrality of cities is nothing new - the majority of humanity will soon live in cities, and cities are the economic engines of whole regions - cities are now becoming the focal point for political reform activity as well. 6 7 Rhodes Scholar inclusive form of development which serves the residents themselves. Broader efforts are underway to scale up such community participation in the city's long-term environmental sustainability plan, PlaNYC, and in the administration's neighbourhood economic development and affordable housing initiatives. Meanwhile in Oakland, the city has embarked on a long-term redevelopment of its army base into a foundation for industrial jobs. But where past major redevelopments of this sort have often been driven by incentives favouring employers and developers, in this initiative Oakland created a community oversight board with official sanction from City Hall. It comprised of local stakeholders to oversee the new development, ensure transparency, and make sure the developers and employers hold to \"community benefits agreements\" stipulating to a certain percentage of local hiring, jobs, and investments in public needs like common space or housing. A new proposed bill in Detroit is calling for mandatory community benefits agreements and public oversight similar to the Oakland model for all major development deals. As encouraging as these developments are, they remain relatively constrained in practice. First, in most US cities adopting PB, the monies at stake are relatively small: ward-level discretionary funds of a few million dollars or less apiece. Second, cities experimenting with PB are finding that to do it well, to generate widespread participation and to facilitate this engagement towards productive and effective policy proposals requires investing in institutional capacity, in high-skilled facilitation and extensive support mechanisms. Similar limits apply to the push for participatory neighbourhood planning. Most cities have preserved more traditional, technocratic control over the highest-stake and biggest redevelopment initiatives. Where participatory methods have been attempted, they often demand a level of support and staffing that is difficult to sustain. These short vignettes highlight the perils and promise of urban governance. Such inclusive, participatory methods are rightly seen as vital to empowering historically marginalised constituencies to have a voice on par with established interest groups from developers to investors, and bureaucrats themselves. But to fully achieve this goal, cities need to invest more heavily in building the capacity to manage and expand these processes. Indeed, democratising the city requires more than just good-faith policymakers consulting the public. It needs community organisers and civil society organisations that can mobilise, educate, empower, and activate more diverse constituencies to plug in to advocacy and policy-making processes. It needs individuals with skills in coalition building as well as policy design, in community engagement, and in spreading ideas whether through art, design, or the conventional white paper. Within City Hall, the democratic city needs more than policy experts; it needs dynamic and creative capacity for facilitating stakeholder engagement, meeting these constituencies halfway. It also needs the capacity to facilitate strategy, creativity, and impact within city government, knitting together the vast spread of city agencies and actors so that urban governance can have maximum social and economic impact. A growing number of American cities are already attempting to reshape their internal structures to better foster innovation and creativity, from more dynamic procurement systems that encourage entrepreneurial innovation in responding to city requests, to centralised technology offices to improve policymakers' access to and use of data and technology. This same spirit needs to be extended to the equally challenging and transformative work of stakeholder and community engagement and inclusion. Yes, cities do need financial resources and policy experts. But we also need to deepen the civic capacity of the city more broadly. This means investing in and committing to the ecosystem of distributed democratic decision-making, from community organisers to policymakers to facilitators to designers. This is a new front line for the world's fight in the city. African Contemporary Art on the Rise Julie Taylor (Zimbabwe and St Antony's 2003) read for degrees in Anthropology and Development Studies. After heading Google's communications for Sub-Saharan Africa for ve years, she founded Guns & Rain, an online contemporary ne-art business People often ask why on earth my new business is called Guns & Rain. Any decent anthropology student worth their salt should know the answer to that. It's the title of a book by David Lan, the South African-born anthropologist and playwright, now Artistic Director of London's Young Vic Theatre, who wrote about guerrillas and spirit mediums in Zimbabwe's independence struggle. His analysis speaks about nature, culture, identity, land, and other important themes that find their way into contemporary African art.Guns and What? Above: Richard Witikani (Zimbabwe), left: Ann Gollifer (Botswana), Hello Mongezi Shikongeni (Namibia), Love RosesBottom right: Bevan de (South Africa), Self-Portrait as Bird guns & rain curates contemporary fine art from southern Africa, all online. Most of the artists are young; some are already established. Buyers can order their art from the site and have it delivered anywhere in the world. The seed was sown when I made a visit home to Zimbabwe in 2008: it was a dark year, politically and economically. I learned that some artists were not eating for days at a time. On a whim, and with a gallerist's permission, I decided to post some images of artworks on a blog site. Overnight, three works sold to international buyers. I realised then that the internet could potentially change artists' lives. In 'the west', Afro-pessimist narratives about conflict, disease, famine and corruption have dominated for years. But Africa is now to a significant degree in the process of being rebranded the world's \"fastest rising continent\", based on the impressive economic growth of a good number of its 54 countries. There is increasing international interest in Africa's economic resources and business opportunities, and contemporary art is no exception to this trend. Art-buying interest from within Africa is being led by Nigerian and south African collectors, whilst renowned British and American museums and auction houses such as MOMA, Tate Modern and Bonhams have all started to showcase African talent. This year will see the debut of the first contemporary art and design fair in paris to be dedicated to African contemporary art, whilst the 2015 Venice Biennale will be directed for the first time by an African-born director, Okwui Enwezor. There's also another trend at play: thanks to the robust global demand for digital channels, especially among those under 40 years of age, art is moving online in a big way. This has led to a host of new channels to explore, 'test-drive' and buy fine art. Art is now far more accessible than it used to be - not always in terms of price but certainly in terms of access to educational and market information. while African contemporary art is now firmly trendy, African artists are still significantly under-represented on the global scene despite their accomplishments, and this is something that I seek to change with guns & rain. such under-representation also means that while the quality of artists' work is often very high, it is more affordable than similar works sold in Europe or North America. A number of curators hope to see more maturity in the way the international art community views art from Africa: they would like to see some artists making, as peers, a transition from the \"African contemporary art\" niche into the mainstream \"contemporary art\" market, in terms of quality, content and price. does it matter whether an artist is from a particular country or continent? In many cases an artist's origin may not seem important in relation to the quality of the work they produce, and artists mostly don't want to be categorised. we also need to question the assumption that African artistic practice has roots in the west. African art may introduce us to a new and different aesthetic, as well as different social and political subject matter. The internet provides a huge opportunity for African contemporary art. while the web will not supplant the entrenched mores of the art market, finding and buying art is no longer as tricky or as intimidating as it used to be. African contemporary art is increasingly accessible. I'm greatly looking forward to watching these developments play out into the future and seeing African artists rise in prominence. gunsandrain.com 10 11 Rhodes Scholar Oxford Remembered Duet amongst the Dreaming Spires Jacquelyn Bengfort (North Dakota & Wolfson 2006) reflects on the experience of arriving in Oxford as a married Rhodes Scholar Marrying within months of graduating is a time-honored and often ill-advised tradition at the US Naval Academy, where I completed my undergraduate degree. But military life is laced with black humour and my classmates traded statistics about divorce as jokes-cum-talismans that would protect our fledgling partnerships. Still, in part because college-educated young adults tend to marry ever later, doing so at 22 can seem retrograde or revolutionary - anything but unremarkable - though I'm certain that in the span of human history, marrying in your third decade of life is mostly anomalous in that it seems awfully late. Then again, life is longer than it used to be. Arriving at Oxford as a married Rhodes Scholar marked me as atypical, at least. Married Scholars are recent in our history: only since 1994 have first year Scholars been allowed to be married (second year Scholars gained that right some three decades earlier). Of course, women have only been accepted since 1977. These changes to the Scholarship's demographics were not something I spent much time pondering then, though, having just spent four years as a \"female midshipman\" and having come to find the fun in outsider status. (This also helps explain my BS degree in English, despite a strong affinity for math: choosing Shakespeare constituted rebellion.) And so, my memories of Oxford are punctuated with something different - the challenge of adjusting to being with someone else almost all the time. And becoming someone else. Marriage is about commitment. So, to my own surprise, I changed my name, defying the god of those aforementioned statistics with my nomenical derring-do. And then, for good measure, we bought a dog. My husband forwent Bon Voyage Weekend in Washington, DC, to precede me to Oxford and begin setting up house. Rhodes House welcomed him and put him in touch with the other American man married to a Rhodes Scholar - an essential friendship that made us feel less like oddities. We lived out, taking over a townhouse sight unseen from its previous occupants, a US Army officer and his wife and dog and, eventually, baby. We waited, patiently and then impatiently, for the military housing stipend that would allow us to swing the rent. We took a second honeymoon in Paris, eating at a tr\u00e8s chic McDonalds when our money ran out, because the housing stipend took months to come in. We joined the Wolfson College Bar Rota and pulled sticky pints together, inevitably fighting about now-forgotten things on the dark walk home through residential Oxford. These memories bear little similarity to those I heard from friends during a recent reunion I hosted at our DC rowhouse, one that we bought in part because it reminded us of our old place on Oxford's Leckford Road. My fellow Scholars have tales of the, let's call them eccentric, living conditions in their colleges. They talk of romantic entanglements of which I was completely unaware; of late nights spent dancing; of excursions to far-flung corners of the world during breaks; of tea in common rooms and meals in hall. I was only rarely at Wolfson, and of romantic entanglements I had only the permanent one I had imported. My husband and I spent mornings walking the dog on Port Meadow and ate far too many English breakfasts at the Jericho Cafe. We travelled a bit, mostly within Europe. There was never any question who would accompany me to the Ball. Simply put, we lived a different sort of Oxford life.It's impossible to say what would have happened to us had I gone straight from commissioning day to the sea, as the Navy would have preferred. Oxford is often cited by Scholars as a space-giver: a place whose pace allows them, for the first time in years of striving, both an intellectual challenge and breathing room to appreciate it. Oxford gave my husband and I time to learn how to be together before we had to return to the United States and learn to be apart over years of deployments. We got the chance to practice being stable in a city where few stay put. We became a place friends could come on Sunday for a home-cooked meal, or for a few weeks over summer break while working out second-year housing. Almost nine years and almost two children (and still the same crotchety dog) later, I remain as grateful to the Rhodes Scholarship and to Oxford for what they gave me personally as what they gave me academically. And really, the latter half of that statement is something I have in common with most Scholars I know, married or not. My husband Ben and I on the day I matriculated in 2006 Our dog, Winston, during our last walk around Oxford in mid-2008Oxford gave my husband and I time to learn how to be together before we had to return to the United States and learn to be apart over years of deployments 12 13 Rhodes Scholar Rhodes Retreats As part of the new Service & Leadership development programme for current Scholars at Rhodes House, there are two annual retreats. The retreat for rst year Scholars considers concepts connected to service and the many types of leadership. The second year retreat considers building a life of purpose, meaning and balanceMichael Lamb (Tennessee & Trinity 2004) is currently the McDonald-Templeton Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Oxford, and was one of the facilitators for the retreats Eight years out of Oxford, I didn't know what to expect on my return, but I could not have imagined a more lively and welcoming community at Rhodes House. I have been especially grateful to take part in the Service & Leadership development programme - three days of deep and searching conversations about the meaning of service, the character of leadership, and the practices needed to live a good life. Reading poems, sharing personal stories, and hearing the diverse perspectives of other Scholars has not only challenged me to continue wrestling with big questions, but has also reminded me of why the Rhodes community is so special.Hamish Tomlinson (New Zealand & Keble 2014) attended the rst year retreat. He is reading for a DPhil in Engineering Science The leadership retreat was a fantastic way to engage with fellow Scholars and explore the ideas of ethical leadership and impactful service. We began the retreat by defining leadership, quickly dispelling the myth that leadership is embodied in heroic figures, a stereotype to which very few of us could relate. We shared anecdotes of both good and bad leadership, and discussed famous examples including Cecil Rhodes, Nelson Mandela and Steve Jobs. We then dug deeper, exploring human nature, liberty, justice and inequality, seemingly swallowing the Oxford PPE curriculum in the process. At the end of the retreat, we tied everything back to our future careers, and discussed ways to lead a life of impact. I enjoyed the retreat and learnt a lot from the diverse experiences of Scholars from different academic backgrounds and constituencies.Eleanor Gardner (Hertford & Bermuda 2013) attended the second year retreat. She is reading for a Masters of Public Policy Any person on the street would probably imagine a meeting of Rhodes Scholars taking place in an old ornate Oxford room with people in suits and robes seated formally around a sturdy wooden table. They would likely not envision a sprawling group of Scholars on yoga mats in deep discussion in the upstairs hallway of Rhodes House. Yet this scene was precisely one of the highlights for me from the second year Rhodes Retreat in March. With groups crammed into every room of Rhodes House, we were all gathered together from our departments and colleges across Oxford. The retreat brought us together with new faces, with structure and purpose to explore the idea of Building a Good Life with each other. What I found truly remarkable was how the retreat inspired people to want to share their personal stories, past struggles, and future dreams. Within one of my group sessions, a number of Scholars commented on how our time at Oxford often feels like a life away from our 'real' lives: the places we come from, the people we know and relate to, where we want to go, and what we want to accomplish after Oxford. We had long conversations about home and how new relationships form with the places that we call home through separation from them. We discussed how each of us has searched for purpose and direction, guided by our passions, and we redefined the divisions between vocation and avocation for ourselves. One of my most powerful takeaways from the retreat was from analysing the initial perspective through which we voluntarily approached a discussion of Building a Good Life and how this evolved during our discussions. At the beginning of the weekend, we interpreted the prompt, building, as a forward-looking verb of future action. However, through the sharing of our stories, we realised the importance of reflecting on how the opportunities and experiences that we currently have and those that we hope for in the future are defined by the building that we have already undertaken. I believe that Building a Good Life is about constantly striving towards a better understanding of ourselves and the people around us, harnessing our agency to achieve diverse and balanced goals, investing in meaningful relationships with people and places, old and new, and appreciating the identities that we possess at different points in time, past, present, and future. Ultimately, a Life of Purpose, Meaning, and Balance does not come from a singular Good Life, but from the never-ending dedication to and appreciation of the process of Building , which is life. 15 Rhodes Scholar 14A Cane Do Attitude Rohan Paul (India & St Catherine's 2008) did his DPhil with the Oxford Mobile Robotics Group. He has co-invented mobility devices for visually impaired persons and steers an industry-academia-NGO alliance to bring these products to market. SmartCane for the Visually Challenged: an affordable innovation for safe independent mobility Almost a decade ago, I was an engineering undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. Searching for an interesting project, I had an opportunity to visit the National Association for the Blind (NAB) along with my fellow batch mates and met Mr Dipendra Manocha heading the Technology Training division at NAB. We asked if there were any problems for which a technology solution could be developed. Mr Manocha said, \"Yes, independent mobility is a day-to-day problem for every visually challenged person. We use the white cane to tap and detect nearby obstacles on the ground, but not the ones that are above the knee level. We frequently collide with obstacles like signboards, railings, over-hanging branches and sides of vehicles causing upper body or face injuries, causing fear and anxiety preventing many people from even stepping out of the house.\" Confronted by this reality, we pledged to work for a solution. The idea was to develop a detachable handle-shaped unit that fits on the top fold of the white cane. Directional ultrasound-based ranging would detect obstacles (from the knee to head height) up to an increased range of 3m from the user with the distance information conveyed through distinct vibratory patterns that vary with the proximity of the obstacle in front. Early prototypes were built to explore this concept. Users became aware of obstacles through varying vibration signatures before coming in contact and used these to determine a safe obstacle-free path. Continual user feedback and inputs led to several design improvements. An ergonomic grip was developed to accommodate highly varied holding styles as well a mechanism to adjust the sensor directivity. The sensor electronics was developed to detect an obstacle as thin as 3cm at a distance of 3m. The overall size was reduced for carrying in a purse or a pocket. The in-built batteries could be charged like a cell phone and the unit could be detached from the cane in case of cane-breakage during use. The device could now be used safely for several days and more users came forward to try it out. At the end of one such training session, a parent came up to us and asked, \"When will the SmartCane become a product so that my child could use this for mobility?\" Developing a usable, effective product meeting quality standards needed large scale user studies, industrial R&D, addressing manufacturing challenges as well a validation trials. IIT Delhi joined hands with Phoenix Medical System (a biomedical device company) and Saksham Trust (a welfare organisation for the blind) supported by the Wellcome Trust, UK (through generous funding) to carry out the research needed to transcend the translational gap. The painstaking and meticulous R&D work gradually evolved a basic prototype into a usable and quality-tested product. Close to 200 users in six cities in India participated in the final stage validation trials that demonstrated a drastic 90% reduction in upper body collision and 2.5 times increase in the average distance of detection. Users reported effectiveness in everyday scenarios like reaching their school, traversing a footpath, going to the market, usage at a railway station, avoiding obstacles indoor etc. The ability to navigate in an environment without touching or colliding was particularly beneficial: avoiding collisions with people, following a person in a queue without touching the person in front from behind, or gracefully avoiding bumping into a pole or wall. Following the successful validation of the technology, the device was \"Released to the People\" in early 2014 and is accompanied with extensive self-learning resources in audio and Braille formats. The device costs USD 50 in India (which is 1/20th the price of similar international products, priced at USD 1,000 - 1,300) making it the first cost-effective electronic mobility aid accessible in the developing world that constitutes 90% of the visually challenged population. Today, the SmartCane device is increasingly reaching the end-user nationally in India through a network of 40 plus organisations serving the visually challenged in diverse parts of India. The technology has been incorporated into the apex scheme of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (Government of India) for providing subsidised devices to those with very limited means. A fundraising programme has been launched with philanthropic and CSR support to subsidise for those with high mobility needs for education and work; students and young professionals with special focus on women. Presently, close to 10,000 SmartCanes have been disseminated in India and the program has expanded to Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Japan and Ghana through partner organisations. The insights from the development experience led to the setting up of the Assistive Technologies Laboratory at IIT Delhi with the mission to serve unmet needs for affordable assistive devices in areas of mobility, education, employment and independence for persons with special needs. Some of the technologies on the horizon are: tactile graphics, digital Braille reading and tutoring devices, screen reading software and public transport access technologies. The most inspiring aspect of this work has been the opportunity to work closely with our end-users and organisations working tirelessly for their empowerment. This experience revealed to us the wider dimensions of visual impairment that include poverty, stigma, gender and exclusion, and the role that technology can play in overcoming barriers and facilitating inclusion. As engineers, we learnt the importance of co-creating the product with end-users and the critical role of the scientific process and rigorous validation before scale-up. This endeavour was made possible by a passionate team and partner organisations that came together, spanning industry-academia and the non-profit sectors to make this product a reality. We realised that the development of a usable and validated technology starting from a small idea is a complex process and needs tremendous perseverance, focus and ingenuity to take to fruition. To end, we hope this endeavour is a humble tribute to the Mahatma who said that, \"A nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members\". smartcane.saksham.org 16 17 Rhodes Scholar Insight into... the Rhodes LGBTQ community We asked six Rhodes Scholars to tell us a little about their experience of the Rhodes LGBTQ community. What can history teach us and what does the future hold? What is it like to be in one of the rst equal marriages in Canada or to bring the rst same-sex partner to a Rhodes Ball? Should it be LGBT or LGBTQIA? Read on... Alain Locke Remembered Jasmine Waddell (Rhode Island & St Antony's 2000) read for her DPhil in Comparative Social Policy whilst at Oxford and is now Resident Dean of Freshmen, Elm Yard at Harvard I came out over 20 years ago and gravitated towards civil rights champions like Bayard Rustin and Audre Lorde. After graduating from Brown, I felt that I was not living up to my fullest potential, so I chose to pursue the Rhodes Scholarship because it resonated with my deep-seated values of leadership and service. To me and to my fellow black and gay Rhodes Scholars, Alain Locke (Pennsylvania & Hertford 1907) represents a model for how to live out these values and I was proud to speak at his internment ceremony.Locke confronted the same barriers over 100 years ago and emerged as the leader Rhodes envisioned - fighting OUR world's fight. One of the ways that he did this was by developing links among the various communities that he touched. For instance, multiculturalism served as a theoretical bridge; patronage of African art served as a cultural bridge and cosmopolitanism served as a social bridge. He built bridges to stay whole. As an Africanist scholar, Locke embodies the African principle of Ubuntu. This philosophy was defined by Rev Desmond Tutu as the idea that you are human through others' humanity. Locke lived this ethic and now we are left with his humanity and the charge to continue building bridges for the Rhodes community to remain whole. multiculturalism served as a theoretical bridge; patronage of ethic and now we are left with his They shall go to the Ball... In 1990, John Crandon (Kansas & Hertford 1989) attended the annual Rhodes Ball. He is believed to be the rst Rhodes Scholar to attend an ofcial Rhodes House function with a same sex partner \"We didn't know what to expect as we headed to Rhodes House in matching bow ties, cummerbunds, and corsages,\" said John. \"In 1990, there were few LGBT Rhodes Scholars, and openly taking a same sex partner to a formal Rhodes House function had apparently never been done. But, as the doors opened, we received a warm welcome from the Warden and many other Scholars.\" Crandon noted that among the attendees at that year's event was his fellow Hertford College classmate Doug Hallward-Driemeier (Missouri & Hertford 1989), who recently argued the case for marriage equality in the US Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges.The Canadian campaign for Equal Marriage Brian Rolfes (Prairies & Wadham 1989) has an academic background in law and human rights, and today is McKinsey & Company's partner in charge of global recruiting. He is also one of the founders of GLAM (the GLBT afnity group at McKinsey) and one of the rm's diversity champions What was your involvement in the campaign for equal marriage in Canada?I spent several years on the board of our local church here in Toronto, which is part of the international denomination \"Metropolitan Community Church\". Our church was one of the successful litigants in the case that saw equal marriage ushered into Canada by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 10, 2003. As lawyers, both my partner Brad and I were particularly interested and involved. When in 2003 the Ontario Court of Appeal backdated the legal recognition of our church's test case marriages (which had occurred three years earlier), the Court created the world's first fully legal same sex marriages, pre-dating some of the progressive legislation in Europe that had transpired. After the court decision was handed down, same sex marriage was immediately possible in the province, but there was a threat that the government would appeal and all could ultimately be lost. Brad and I knew we had a window where equal marriage was definitely legal and we had to act. So we got married 3 days later, on June 13. Those first early marriages made international news, and our wedding was part of a front page article in the New York Times. This prompted several friends - including a number of NYT-reading American Rhodes Scholars - to quickly get in touch demanding to know why they hadn't received an invitation... My only excuse: legal necessity made it all a bit rushed! The right to equal marriage is hugely important. It is of course personally important for the couple themselves: a public declaration of lifetime commitment, the essence of what marriage itself has been for centuries. In addition, being a gay couple who legally marries can be transformative for that couples' relatives and friends: both Brad and I had conservative relatives who suddenly looked at us - and our relationship - for what it was: a loving, committed relationship for life, fully recognised by society.What changes still need to happen? If you look back over hundreds of years, it seems that these last 20-30 years have been the most dramatic in terms of change, at least in most of the Western world. When Brad and I first met almost 22 years ago, we never dreamed that we would enjoy the right to be legally married. When we did finally marry, for the first few years we were truly seen as something novel, if not actually revolutionary. But the fight for LGBT equality continues in other forms and other places: in challenges still faced by the trans-communities in Canada, or internationally at very basic levels of state-sanctioned discrimination and intolerance. But things are changing: last year I conducted a diversity workshop for the McKinsey Mexico office that was truly inclusive and inspiring. Last month, I recently spoke in Sydney for the student and young professional LGBT group 'Out for Australia' (where the fight for equal marriage still continues). And next month, I'll present at an LGBT business conference in Brazil. In this way, I hope that I'm helping to 'fight the world's fight'. Your role as Secretary for the Ontario Rhodes Scholarship Selection Committee puts you in contact with today's generation of young leaders. Are they more comfortable in their own skin than you were when you came up to Oxford?In terms of LGBT identity, that is absolutely the case. Millennials have grown up in a setting which is much more open and accepting of difference... and that can be self- empowering. The internet and - in particular, social media - allows individuals to see difference, connect with others \"like you\", and identify role models. I always counsel young people who are embarking on their professional lives to be authentic to themselves. For LGBT youth, I'd say that you are doing yourself a disservice by not presenting the \"whole you\" to potential employers. Organisations which don't recognise that talent comes in all shapes and sizes, genders and orientations aren't worthy of your effort, and they will be on the losing side of history. 18 19 Rhodes Scholar A Walk Down Rainbow Road Rachel Paterson (Western Australia & St Edmund Hall 2012) is a current Scholar, studying for her DPhil in Infection, Immunology and Translational Medicine When I was a kid, my favourite colour was \"rainbow coloured\". I didn't want just one of the colours: I wanted all of them. I also loved Cheer Bear, the pink Care Bear with a rainbow on its tummy. Perhaps fittingly, I soon realised that I'm part of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual (LGBTQIA) rainbow. Despite this, until I came to Oxford I was quite sheltered from the diversity that exists within the rainbow and the seriousness of the challenges faced. As a teenager grappling with the daunting task of coming out, my thoughts were completely self-centred. I was consumed by worry; worry about how to tell my parents, worry about losing my friends, and worry that I would never be happy. After receiving the Rhodes, I was discussing with my therapist my nervousness about taking my partner to the official University \"send off\" event. My therapist advised me that I should \"consider hiding that part of my life\", for my own good of course. Thankfully, I didn't take her advice and there was only one awkward \"is this your sister?\" moment. I realise now that although these experiences were significant for me, many of the \"rainbowers\" I have met in Oxford have faced, and continue to face, much bigger challenges. Homosexuality is still criminalised in nearly 80 countries, including 11 countries from which Rhodes Scholars are elected. So, instead of worrying about coming out, LGBTQIA people from these countries are worried about being fired, arrested, or worse. I was encouraged to find out that Oxford now allows for the wearing of subfusc of either gender, so individuals can feel comfortable in their clothes on stressful exam day. Progress such as this is in part due to the fight for equality from the LGBTQIA community itself, but it is also critically dependent on supportive allies. There is a lot of progress that can be achieved by collectively putting into action small changes in our daily lives that will have a ripple effect throughout our communities. After all, it is not only children who can learn from my beloved Care Bears' message: when you care enough about someone, you don't give up!A Conversation about Change Dr E. Scott Pretorius (North Carolina & University 1989) is a radiologist and author of \"Radiology Secrets\". He is co-owner of USTeleradiology, which provides off-site interpretation of radiologic studies performed at hospitals and imaging centres throughout the United States How would you describe the current attitude towards the LGBTQ community in the States? It's astonishing how quickly the legal situation has changed for gay people in America and most of the West. I never thought I would see gay marriage in my lifetime. It's no longer socially acceptable to hate gay people, so even if a person harbours negative feelings toward LGBTQ persons, that hatred tends to go unvoiced. What have been some of your best and worst experiences? The worst experience was the 1999 assault of my then partner, author Robert Drake, in Ireland, in an act of anti-gay violence. He remains profoundly brain-injured as a result of that attack. The best was probably the response of my friends to that attack. When this awful thing happened, it became rapidly clear who my truest friends were. Many of them donated time and money toward Robert's care. My brother, however, told me I had shamed our family by being in such an abominable relationship; he and I didn't speak for the last 15 years of his life. You have two twins, what prompted the decision to start a family? I have always wanted a family. When I was a kid, the part of being gay that troubled me the most was the knowledge that I wouldn't have kids. My son and daughter were created by egg donation and surrogacy, and I feel very fortunate to live in a time when this is possible. There are other children in my kids' preschool with gay parents, so it's really a non-issue here. What I find most remarkable is how very much my family is like the straight families of my kids' friends. My 3 year-old twins do not know that I am gay; they just know that their Daddy really, really loves them.What are your thoughts on other parts of the world?Even as great progress has been made in the western democracies, unfortunately there has been a real backlash against gay people in many other parts of the world. India re-criminalised homosexuality in 2013. Gay people are a favourite scapegoat of Vladimir Putin. The Islamic State is throwing gay people off buildings. American evangelicals finance anti-gay hatred throughout their churches in Africa. I think the geographic area in which we will see the greatest progress occur is in developed Asia and in Southeast Asia. I think Japan will eventually legalise gay marriage. Thailand has a long history of acceptance of gay people. Vietnam's legislature actually debated a gay marriage bill in 2013. It didn't pass, but there has been remarkable progress in that country. What would you say to those in the LGBTQ community currently experiencing persecution?Well, if that person lives in the developed western world, I'd say that you have to live your own life. Eleanor Roosevelt once said that \"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent\". Some people won't like you, and you have to be strong enough to get through that. If you live in one of the approximately 80 nation-states that still criminalises homosexuality, I'd say \"be careful\". Political change is possible, but you have to choose your opportunities to affect change wisely.Today in Oxford Braden O'Neill (Alberta & University 2011) read for a DPhil in Primary Health Care, and led the Rhodes LGBTQ group last year When asked to write a short piece on LGBTQ life in the Rhodes community, I thought immediately of an email conversation I had with John Wofford (New York & Balliol 1957). His article \"On Being a Gay Rhodes Scholar\", published in the autumn 1994 edition of the American Oxonian, is a must-read, not just for \"gay Rhodes Scholars,\" but for everyone who has come to Oxford from somewhere else and has searched for ways to reconcile their background with their Oxford experience. He reported that \"1994 was dramatically different for many LGBT people... different from today, and different from 1957, my era.\" As LGBTQ Scholars recently gone down from Oxford, we can report that 2015 really is another era still, and that the Rhodes LGBTQ community today is a strong, diverse, enthusiastic group supported by Rhodes House. One of the highlights of Rhodes LGBTQ life in the past few years for Scholars in residence was hosting an alumni reception during the 110th Anniversary of the Rhodes Scholarships in September 2013. That evening, the Scholars' common room was filled to capacity with LGBTQ Scholars from the last half century and current Scholars could talk about life in Oxford as well as thanking previous generations for their contributions to the way it is now. Today, there is a cohesive and collegial group of LGBTQ Scholars who meet at least several times per term in formal and informal settings. There are discussions about LGBTQ politics and human rights, movie nights, and the group attends talks and theatre productions in Oxford throughout the year. We hope to strengthen the network of LGBTQ alumni who have gone down from Oxford and to build a cohesive worldwide network of LGBTQ Rhodes Scholars. (North Carolina in my lifetime.

Oxford won the men's and the women's races convincingly, with both boats being 6 \u00bd lengths clear of their Cambridge competitors. Both Oxford reserve boats won too, making it a clean sweep! Top Research Results According to the recently published Research Excellence Framework (REF) results, Oxford has been rated number one in the UK for the quality of its research This is a peer-review process to assess the quality of research in UK higher education institutions. Oxford's submission comprised 8,414 research outputs from 2,409 members of staff across 31 subjects. 48% of their research and impact was rated 4*, which means it has the largest volume of world-leading (4*) research in the UK.News from The Mandela Rhodes Foundation Highlights from 2014 There were a record number of Mandela Rhodes Scholars in residence and they attended some terrific leadership Workshops. Mandela Rhodes Scholars from earlier years have taken up positions within the Foundation so there are Scholars from the first four Classes (2005-2008) playing vital roles in the development and growth of The Mandela Rhodes Foundation. There has also been a move to two Selection Committees. At the Mandela Rhodes Building, flags have been unveiled representing all the countries from which Mandela Rhodes Scholars have been drawn.The First Ten Years Herzog & de Meuron/Blavatnik School of GovernmentKatie Chan 22 23 Rhodes Scholar Oxford NewsUnexpected Oxford Only in the Oxford Bubble Adam Mastroianni (Ohio & St Cross 2014) is reading for his MPhil in Evidence-Based Social Intervention Since arriving here in October, I have seen a unicyclist in cutoff jeans, undergraduates painted up like clowns and chanting, a man not so much streaking down High Street as running naked with no destination in mind, an inexplicably angry Eastern European man with a very large stuffed bear who threatened me outside of a nice men's clothing store, a gaggle of women wielding a selfie stick in front of a stained glass window at a church that some enterprising people re-purposed into a club, a man in a bunny suit riding a stationary bicycle attached to a mechanism that sprays bubbles into the air, a man in a fish suit casually reading a romance novel in a lawn chair and a man in a devil costume hollering at people to come to an improv show...okay, fair enough, that last one was me.Dear Deer Paul Manning (Maritimes & Magdalen 2013) is reading for his DPhil in Zoology Birders often tell the best stories. If you happen across a friendly person staring into a tree, or a meadow with a pair of binoculars, asking a few open-ended questions about birds will often yield to a fascinating conversation. Running through Addison's Walk, I noticed three women intensely staring into the deer park with binoculars, and a heavy duty telescope. I nodded a quick hello, did a loop through University Parks only to find the women in the same place upon return. I succumbed to my curiosity, and asked what sort of bird had turned up. To my surprise, the women weren't looking at birds at all, but rather a fallow deer named Anna. After having found the tiny days-old fawn next to her dead mum at the side of the motorway in 2014, zoologist Sasha Norris (herself an Oxford alum), fed the deer until she grew healthy and strong. Anna's rehabilitation was helped along by the companionship of a Hebridean ewe named 'Elsa'. In early January 2015, Anna was released into the Magdalen deer park, and is settling in quite comfortably with the rest of the herd. She's a little darker, and more finely boned than the others, and you can easily pick her out while rambling along Addison's Walk. If you find yourself there, do say a quick \"Hello\" to Anna, and if you spot any birders why not strike up a conversation? You could be in for a delightful story. An Unexpected Present Aravind Ganesh (Prairies & St John's 2014) is reading for his DPhil in Clinical Neurosciences When I came up to Oxford six months ago, I quickly fell in love with the city, especially with being able to bike to and from work every day - something I couldn't imagine back home in Canada. Then a hit-and-run incident while biking home in early February left me sprawled on my back with (fortunately just) an unstable knee, and newly dubious of the intrinsic goodness of people and the purported eliteness of Oxford. Two months on crutches made me doubly admire my fellow-Scholars who have thrived in this poorly accessible city despite their disabilities. But what I really hadn't bargained for were my new true friends in the Rhodes community. Our community is renowned for its talented talkers, but I've had a chance to discover the real doers. People who had known me for just a couple of months but went out of their way to visit me, help me with groceries, check in on me after my surgery, or - knowing my baseline culinary ineptitude - surprise me with food so I would have one less meal to fret about. No Blues to be won or Firsts to brag about, just good old-fashioned friendship, which they have earned for life. And that, while unexpected, has been the most beautiful gift. 24 25 Rhodes Scholar Rhodes Scholars in Research In the rst edition of the magazine, we looked at a Scholar involved in computational genetic research. Now the spotlight falls on the humanities sphere... Hugh Gaston Hall (Mississippi & St John's 1953) is Professor Emeritus at the University of Warwick Before leaving Oxford, I married Gillian Lund, the girl reading English at St Anne's who, on the afternoon of my arrival from the old 'Queen Elizabeth', had knocked on the door to my new rooms in St John's in search of their former occupant. Thence to Yale for a PhD in Romance Languages and my first experience of college teaching - a career pursued mostly in French departments at the Universities of Glasgow and Warwick and in delightful visiting appointments at Berkeley, the CUNY Graduate Center, Monash University, the ANU, the Camargo Foundation and elsewhere. Carbon-dated to July 1955, our marriage will, with help from our two surviving children, be feted by diamond anniversary celebrations this summer. My interest in Shakespeare, the current focus of my research, began in school and developed as part of an English minor at Millsaps College, but was overtaken by French studies during a Fulbright year in France and two years reading French and Italian at Oxford. However, Henri Fluch\u00e8re, then Director of the Maison Fran\u00e7aise in Oxford, gave me a copy of his book on Shakespeare to be read on the banks of the Mississippi River (inconvenient!); and I continued to see Shakespeare plays in performance. Later, when Hamlet appeared on the syllabus of a Warwick University course on European theatre, my research took a comparative turn: Hamlet compared with French classical, Spanish Golden Age and English Restoration dramas. However, the focus of my research remained early-modern French theatre, not least because my tutor at St John's, Will G. Moore, suggested I publish an essay on Moli\u00e8re in which I had disagreed with his own interpretation, commissioned a little book on Moli\u00e8re's Tartuffe for the new series of 'Studies in French Literature' he edited, and also invited contributions to The Modern Language Review. Oxford University Press has also been helpful by publishing my contribution to Essays in Honour of W. G. Moore (1973), my edition of Moli\u00e8re's Les Femmes savantes (1974), my Yale dissertation revised as Richelieu's Desmarets and the Century of Louis XIV (1990) and my translation from French of Sir Politic Would-be for the Buckingham volumes (2007). In retirement, my interests shifted to publishing verse and verse translations for my 'Richmond House Verse' series, then back to Hamlet and Joseph Haydn. As it happens, the title of my article 'Imitation, Invention and Wit in Haydn's Creativity' in the Haydn Society Journal (2014) reflects my approach not only to Shakespeare, but to Moli\u00e8re and Desmarets (who among other things invented modern comparative literature), since all three were witty, inventive imitators of contemporary society on stage and on the page also skilled in adapting well-selected literary models. I have been lucky to find an outlet for my latest research in Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, a glossy biannual international scholarly journal with stunning colour photographs of Elizabethan plays in performance. I write as an outsider experienced, however, in continental theatre traditions, secondary sources such as Franco Simone's untranslated research on humanism, the De auxiliis and other background religious controversies and early-modern music. To me conflicting keys in Josquin des Prez's Fortuna d'un gran tempo expressing mutation of fortune suggests the mutation of fortune and of styles in Hamlet. John Dowland's exactly contemporary Lacrimae variations can be compared with variations on the themes of suicide and of Virgil's \"tears of things\" in Hamlet. Shakespeare handles thematic reminiscence thematic segmentation in topoi like tempus edax (\"Devouring time\") as if they were musical themes, while repetition, variation, augmentation, acceleration, reversal and inversion all occur quasi musically in Hamlet. The 'Mousetrap' inner play, substituted for a less heinous murder at a banquet in Shakespeare's source, can be read as a retrograde inversion of the Annunciation as represented c. 1600. With a soliloquist as solo protagonist and varied restatement of themes, the structure of Hamlet anticipates aspects of the sonata form concerto. In a fifth paper in progress, 'Hamlet: tragedy as ethics and epic', I hope to show how Shakespeare draws upon Aristotle's Ethics, Horace's Ars poetica, Italian Renaissance epics and particularly Virgil's Aeneid in crafting a tragedy more subtle, more humane, more varied and more poetic than the tragedies of the two rival playwrights whose efforts he also recycles to great advantage: Kyd's Spanish Tragedy and Marlowe's Dido Queen of Carthage. It seems almost like yesterday that Gillian Lund invited me to tag along on a St Anne's excursion for my first visit to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. Will Moore, bending the rules, let me back into St John's College after midnight by a back door. 26 27 Rhodes Scholar Try, Try, Try Again This year Oxford won the Rugby Varsity match 43-6, captained by Jacob Taylor (New South Wales & Keble 2013). We asked him for his reflections, and also looked back at other Rhodes Scholars who found success on the rugby eld Reflections on Captaincy Two days ago I sat down to write my entry in the Captain's Diary. The large and weary leatherbound book contains one handwritten entry from every captain of Oxford University Rugby Football Club (OURFC), dating back to 1948. At the end of each Varsity season, win, lose, or draw, the Captain records advice and reflections for the Captains to follow. The Varsity Match is the most historic amateur rugby fixture in the world. This year, perhaps much like the four years before it, was defined by a day at Twickenham where everything ultimately \"clicked\" for Oxford, and we achieved an unprecedented fifth successive victory. So the story goes, the courage of 23 individuals to make themselves vulnerable to each other - to toil, to bleed, to find shared strength in shared weaknesses - produced an indomitable collective spirit that possessed and propelled us. The magic of this experience was victory in and of itself, irrespective of the final score line. Or so the story goes at least... \"One thing I have noticed,\" I began to write, perplexed by the task of distilling an entire year of rugby - more accurately for me, the final year in an entire career of rugby - into a few short pages of left-handed scribble, \"is that these pages are filled with retrospective calm. I have read words that are intoxicated with fulfillment, and words that are frustrated by regret. Either way, the words written here are written from a place of calm, at a point at which almost all is said, and all, at least, is done.\" \"Very rarely can you glimpse in these pages the tumult of being 'in the moment', the feud of existence in the soul of the captain as he wrestles, each year, with the task of becoming. Even less do you sense the continuation of becoming that burdens the captain beyond OURFC, the fact that for the captain who sits down to write his retrospective, the journey is not over, but in reality has only just begun. He is treading water in the depths of another ocean. Having experienced the divine, he looks wildly around for it once more, only to be defeated and confused by the speed at which the fly escapes his gaze.\" As I continued to write, I tried to resist, as much as possible, the calm of hindsight. I attempted instead to reconstruct snippets from the journey as I encountered them, with all the uncertainty and doubt and anticipation of that process. It was a modest and clunky testament, I thought, to all who find themselves in joyous tumult of being \"in the moment\" in rugby and in being.Other famous Rugby playing Rhodes Scholars Peter Dawkins (Michigan & Brasenose 1959): Won three Blues and reputedly pioneered the torpedo throw at the line-out which is now the norm throughout the rugby world.

For several of the existing constituencies, we would also like to increase the numbers over time, for example in India and Pakistan where the number of Scholarships is very low on a per capita basis. Reinstatement There are a number of Rhodes countries where we plan to reinstate the Scholarships. These include Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Singapore.Expansion - 2015 China The launch of the Rhodes Scholarships for China was marked by a gala dinner in Beijing on 30 March, at which over 250 distinguished guests attended. There will be four Chinese Rhodes Scholars as part of the Class of 2016. The United Arab Emirates Following a two year trial programme, during which time they were known as the Falcon Scholarships, the United Arab Emirates Scholarship now has full Rhodes status. All Falcon Scholars, past and present, will now be known as Rhodes Scholars, and one to two will be elected annually.Expansion - Future Plans The Rhodes Trust is discussing possible expansion to other countries in Africa (including Tanzania, Egypt and Ethiopia), the Middle East (including Oman, Bahrain, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon), Brazil and Russia. There has been a deep and long-seated commitment to expansion in Africa and initial conversations are also in place concerning a pan-African Rhodes Scholarship. Our sister organisation, The Mandela Rhodes Foundation, has also been doing terrific work in Africa, and it too is increasing the number of Scholarships it offers each year.

For Chinese students, the Rhodes Scholarships will be a unique opportunity, bringing them into a community with the highest standards of academic excellence and ethical leadership. This is the start of an exciting new chapter for the Rhodes Scholarships.\" 2015 is a year which has seen the R hodes Scholarships expand to China and the United Arab Emirates. The R hodes Trust has ambitious plans for securing and increasing the core S cholarship numbers, reinstating suspended S cholarships in Africa and Asia, and adding new S cholarships in emerging regions. We are working with funders who are interested in education and leadership in all regions of the world, but these discussions proceed at different speeds which in turn determines the sequence of new announcements. The bold vision and approach stems from the positive effect which young ethical leaders can have in their countries, and the desire for a truly global impact from the Rhodes community. 30 31 Rhodes Scholar RHODE S HOUSE NEWS RHODES HOUSE NEWSRhodes House News Rhodes Scholar Network Launched The Rhodes Scholar Network site gives Scholars an opportunity to connect across generations and countries. It is a platform for Scholars to come together and discuss topics of interest, collaborate on projects, advertise job openings, and facilitate mentor/mentee relationships. The Network's membership directory is a more sophisticated version of the paper Registers that were previously published by the Trust, and allows Scholars to search for and contact each other based on election information, locations, interests and experience. Since the Network was launched last winter, 50% of the Rhodes Scholar community have signed up and are taking part in over 30 different groups, ranging from their alumni association, to general interest and topic-specific cohorts such as education, the creative arts, global health, climate change, and technology ventures. The Network allows members to upload documents, videos and other files, which has made collaboration on projects easy. There are many discussions running on the Network at any one time, ranging from gender equality, to cultural policy, and to early stage technology commercialisation. We are currently building functionality to support Scholars who are interested in providing or receiving mentoring within the community. This feature will allow Scholars to search for mentors in the community based on their experience, interests and availability. Join your fellow Scholars on the Network and take part in the community by going to rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/rsn George Parkin Distinguished Service Award In 1902, George Parkin was invited by the founding Trustees to undertake the task of translating the idea of the Rhodes Scholarships into a working system, as the Trust's first Organising Secretary. The Scholarships would not be what they are today without his efforts. The Rhodes community has benefitted greatly from the volunteer service of its members over many years. The Trustees have decided to recognise these volunteers for their time, leadership, advice and dedication to the growth of the Scholar community, by the presentation of the newly established George Parkin Distinguished Service Award. Up to four Scholar and non-Scholar members of the Rhodes community will be awarded each year, and this year's recipients were selected by the Trustees after consultation with National Secretaries and Rhodes Trust staff. We are delighted to announce the inaugural recipients are the following Rhodes Scholars:Voting for 2016's awards will open in October 2015 and we welcome your nominations until the end of the year. We are looking for members of the community who have: shown strong and positive leadership and/or service within alumni associations over a sustained period of time or in a highly impactful way provided support to current and/or recent Scholars at scale significantly increased public awareness for and/or the standing of the Scholarships strongly guided the Trust's efforts in increasing existing or reinstating suspended Scholarships been critical to the expansion of Scholarships to new territories.

Please send your nomination to alumni@rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk Judge Sir David Baragwanath (New Zealand & Balliol 1964) David tirelessly served the Rhodes community in New Zealand for over 30 years. On his return from Oxford in 1966, he chaired the New Zealand Rhodes Scholars Association and, in this role, organised various activities to prepare Scholar-elects for Oxford. He ensured reports and newsletters were circulated, which was vital to maintain contact between Senior and current Scholars in the 1960s. His skills and commitment to the community were such that he was later appointed and served as the New Zealand Secretary for 26 years. Justice Edwin Cameron (South Africa-at-Large & Keble 1976) Edwin has served the Southern African Rhodes community since 1980, first as Assistant General Secretary and then General Secretary, responsible for the administration of the Rhodes Scholarships in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, and Swaziland. His leadership has ensured the selection of over 110 Rhodes Scholars from Southern Africa, and he undertook these duties with characteristic fairness, graciousness and dedication. Edwin has actively supported the LGBTQ Rhodes Scholar community in Oxford.Ralph S mith II MS tJ (Alabama & Corpus Christi 1973) has been recognised by the University of Oxford as a 'Distinguished Friend of Oxford'.

The Rhodes Finance & Investment Committee is pleased with the performance of OUEM which is illustrated in the graph, benchmarking OUEM's historic net performance against CPI. OUEM's stated target objective is to deliver 5% above the Consumer Price Index (CPI), with volatility no more than MSCI World. Participation rates across the Rhodes community Participation by Decade Cohort Participation by CountryAverage participationRhodes Financial Overview The annual participation rate is a strong focus for the Campaign and we are seeing a steady increase. In 2012/2013 it was at 16.6%, in 2013/2014 it reached 17.7% and at the time of going to press in 2014/2015 we are at 23.2%. Thank you to every Scholar who has donated!SECOND CENTURY CAMP AIGN SECOND CENTURY CAMPAIGNSecond Century Campaign Update on the Campaign Thanks to the generosity of our donors, we have now raised just over \u00a3100m of the \u00a3150m campaign goal. The Campaign for the Second Century focuses on securing the core 83 Rhodes Scholarships and there have been a number of new fundraising initiatives this year: Question and Answer Does my gift matter?Yes! Every gift of any size matters. Being able to show a strong level of support from within the community is extremely important when seeking external funding. Why do we hear so much about fundraising? This campaign aims to secure the 83 core Scholarships which will enable future generations of Scholars to experience all that Oxford and the Rhodes programme can offer. We hope the campaign will be complete by the end of 2017 - please support us during this crucial time. What about expansion funding? This is not part of the Campaign for the Second Century - all expansion is funded and accounted separately in the Rhodes Trust Horizon Fund.Scholar Calling At the end of 2014, a number of Current Scholars spoke to Senior Scholars about their recollections of Oxford, the new Rhodes Scholar Network and also about the progress of the campaign. Conversations were enthusiastic and wide-ranging, and covered the Oxford experience, research, shared interests and careers. The team comprised Scholars from eight different countries: Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, Namibia, Pakistan, the United States and Zambia. They clocked up 389 conversations with Senior Scholars over the two weeks of the programme.Online Annual Giving During May and June, annual giving was encouraged through an online interactive portal where Scholars can trace the increasing participation of their country, class and college. It is a fun and social platform, with plenty of friendly Oxford rivalry. Matching All gifts benefit from the current McCall MacBain match. Your gift will release a 1:1 match for donations to the Canadian Scholarships and a 1:2 match for all others.

It includes 20 new poems as well as the best pieces from his previous collections.Reflections on writing Courts in Conflict (Oxford University Press, May 2015) Nicola Palmer (St Andrew's College, Grahamstown & Queen's 2007) read for her DPhil in Law at Oxford and now works as a Lecturer in Criminal Law at the Dickson Poon School of Law, King's College London. When I first went to Rwanda in 2006, I completely underestimated how much this small landlocked country would come to shape my life and occupy my mind. An outsider, with an air ticket in my back pocket to the internationalised comforts of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania, I couldn't have imagined that this first trip would be the first of many. Yet it was an interview I conducted in a prison in Rwanda's Northern Province on that first trip which sparked the question I have then sought to answer in writing Courts in Conflict. How have international, national and localised criminal courts, adjudicating overlapping sets of offences, interacted with one another? The book examines the practices of the ICTR, the Rwandan national courts and the gacaca community courts through both the views of its participants and its legal decisions. It argues that although the courts are compatible in law, an interpretive cultural analysis shows how and why they have often been in conflict. The writing of this book was made possible, in no small part, due to the unimaginable privilege and the hugely enabling opportunity of being awarded a Rhodes Scholarship. For me, this privilege was twofold. First, if offered the chance to engage more fully with the complexity of post-genocide life in Rwanda, whether interviewing judges in sparse government offices, listening to court proceedings in rural districts or negotiating potential interviews on winding roads through the Rwandan hills. Second, it provided the space to read, think, talk and write my way through making sense of these different interpretations of post-genocide justice. The diverse corners of Oxford offered the opportunity to place those Rwandan conversations in a context of wider literatures, to draw on theory to make sense of the social data and to be offered guidance as to when I was on an interesting track or off in the academic wilderness. It also provided the space to argue it out at pubs, seminar rooms or on aeroplanes with the man I would ultimately come to marry. Our next trip to Rwanda is in July this year - this time it's to work with Rwandan researchers as they continue to ask the next set of tough questions. outsider, with an air ticket in my back pocket to the internationalised Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End (Profile Books, October 2014) Dr Atul Gawande (Ohio & Balliol 1987) Reviewed by Aravind Ganesh (Prairies & St John's 2014) On Aging, Dying, and the Healing Art... There's an adage in the medical profession that comes up from time to time when we deal with the terminally ill: \"The reason we nail the patient's coffin shut, is to keep the oncologist out.\" While rather morbid- sounding, it alludes to a key problem with modern medicine, which is that when a patient draws to their last days - from the complications of age, or from terminal illnesses like cancer - doctors and our treatments can become more torturous than disease itself. It is this fundamental problem of our time that surgeon-writer Dr Atul Gawande addresses in his powerful book, which is as much about aging - and living meaningfully - as it is about dying. Through insightful stories from numerous patients, nurses, and physicians he has carefully followed over the years, as well as deeply moving personal anecdotes, Dr Gawande skilfully weaves a very clear picture of the complex tragedy that is modern aging and dying, and how it has been aided and abetted by our medicalisation of the inescapable aging process. We all dream of being able to live according to our own terms and retain as much independence as possible in our last years, but everything about our current system flies in the face of that shared need. Our healthcare systems are designed to address single, discrete problems (a broken hip, a clogged heart vessel) but when faced with the slowly crumbling mechanisms of a naturally aging body, we become lost tinkering with each of those worn-out cogwheels and forget that our job is ultimately to better the quality-of-life of the actual person inhabiting that body. Boy do we miss the forest for the trees. However, this is not a book of lamentations, but rather a rallying cry for meaningful change. Dr Gawande highlights the important drivers of change who are trying to change the established narrative - proponents of \"assisted living\" who seek to empower seniors to live as independently as possible, for as long as possible; geriatricians who are teaching their colleagues to focus on seniors as people rather than potpourris of discrete diseases; and palliative care professionals who help dying patients and their families come to terms with what actually matters most to them, and recognise when the time comes to stop fighting. This book will provide a helpful starting point for how to critically think about - and prepare for - those last roads we must all go down.The Work: My Search for a Life that Matters (Random House, January 2015) Wes Moore (Maryland/DC & Wolfson 2001)Reviewed by Charlie Tyson (North Carolina & Balliol 2014) In his first memoir, The Other Wes Moore, Moore wove together two lives. He recounted his own story of growing up in a Bronx neighborhood blighted by crack. And he traced the life of his eponymous double, the other Wes Moore, who came of age in urban Baltimore. Writer Wes ended up as a Rhodes scholar. The other Wes found himself serving a life sentence. In The Work, Moore continues to consider lives he could have lived. But these multiple paths arise not from contingency - another wrong step, and he could have been the \"other\" Wes - but from reinvention. Moore describes how his search for meaningful work led him to stints as a banker in London, a paratrooper in Afghanistan, a fellow at the State Department and, finally, a social entrepreneur and media personality. He ends each chapter with stories of other inspiring workers: an elementary school principal, veterans' advocates, the mayor of Denver. The Work is not about a quest for one true vocation. It's about the dizzying array of ways a person can serve humanity. Moore's journey through multiple professions will resonate with many Rhodes scholars - especially those of us who yearn to transform institutions like government, finance, law, and the military, yet long for the stability those same institutions provide. While The Other Wes Moore traced a life lived headlong, The Work shows Moore constantly reflecting on his choices. Driven by high ideals and aware of the limits and virtues of each of his pursuits, Moore is a sure-footed guide for readers pondering how best they can make a difference. modern medicine, which is that when a patient draws to their urban Baltimore. Writer Wes ended up as a Rhodes scholar. The Oxford Sonata The robin who kept on hurtling the river from willow to willowsang no louder or clearer as wenestled on his territory.

Evergreen has carried me from physics to serious engagement with sustainable buildings. My marriage is a year older than all that, and deeper. Our mid-30s children are all married; their spouses are as interesting and special as they are; there's one grandchild. I'm a lucky guy.\" J.

Buying it, almost 40 years ago, has been the best investment they ever made. Merle McClung (Minnesota & Trinity 1965) writes: \"Facing failing health and the possibility that soon I would not be able to publish anymore, last year I published several books now available at Amazon.com, and started the new website/blog MakeOurDemocracyWork.com.

Taju was born on 6 January 1961 in the northern Nigerian town of Funtua and had a national and pan-African outlook. He was fluent in at least three of the major languages of his country. In his application for the Rhodes Scholarship he did not shy from expressing his political views and aspirations for the continent of Africa. He is probably the most well-known African Rhodes Scholar of the late 20th century and was President of the University Africa Society. While at Oxford, Taju was an activist; committed to African liberation, and more broadly to social justice irrespective of the racial, gendered, ethnic or geographical origins of those affected. As a supporter of the anti-Apartheid movement, African National Congress, SWAPO, Save the Sharpeville Six campaign, and any other liberation or people-centred movement, he was always willing to pick up a banner and protest, as well as organise to raise money to support campaigns. Before completing his DPhil in Political Science under the supervision of Gavin Williams, Taju moved to London to work for the Institute of African Alternatives. Later, with close comrades, he established, in London, a number of Africa-oriented think tanks: the Africa Research and Information Bureau, whose journal Africa World Review he co-founded and edited, the Centre for Democracy and Development, the Pan-African Development Education and Advocacy Programme, and Justice Africa. Taju returned to Africa as the Secretary General of the Global Pan-African Movement in 1993, having been recruited by the former Tanzanian Minister Abdul-Rahman Babu. As the then OAU Secretary General, Salim Ahmed Salim, said, 'while Taju could have gone from Oxford to work in any country or company of his choice, he instead returned to Africa to help rebuild it'. Taju organised the 7th Pan-African Congress (PAC) which was held in Kampala in April 1994. Some 5,000 delegates from Africa and the African Diaspora attended. The theme of the Congress was 'Facing the future in unity, social progress and democracy - perspectives towards the 21st century'. The resolutions called for a second liberation front to defeat re-colonisation, dictatorships, and genocidal practices across the continent. The motto, which became Taju's own, was: \"Don't agonize, Organize!\" Taju's reputation in Africa spread rapidly as he criss-crossed the continent, attending wherever progressive forces needed support. He was known for his political astuteness, an orator of penetrating insights into African and global politics, and a fearless champion of the oppressed. Taju disseminated his thoughts on Africa and Pan-Africanism in his weekly postcards that were published first in the Ugandan newspaper New Vision. Soon the postcards were eagerly awaited on a Thursday and were syndicated to newspapers across the continent and online - PambazukaNews.org. In the postcards, and in face-to-face meetings, Taju was not afraid to speak truth to power, and to castigate African leaders at the African Union. Possessing immense diplomatic skills he could criticise leaders whilst making them laugh. He was opposed to the top down, male-centred, and state-centred Pan-Africanism, and wrote in one of his postcards, 'it is now widely recognised that Pan-Africanism needs to leave the confines of conferences and executive mansions of our leaders and become part and parcel of all our lives building from the down-up'. Taju was opposed to dictatorship. In a postcard of 19 February 2009, entitled 'respect term limits for democratic change', he voiced his opposition to dictatorship, noting, 'the world has changed and so must revolutionaries'. Taju was a champion of the poor, the dispossessed, and women. In a postcard of 5 May 2009, he declared, 'it is not morally or politically right and it cannot be acceptable that mothers die giving life'. At the time of his death, he was the Deputy Director of the UN Millennium Development Goals in Africa, where, rather than being mainstreamed, he became a fighter in the struggle to get the campaign to support meaningful programmes. Taju exhibited immense warmth, energy, and passion. His loud infectious laugh and presence would instantly fill a room. More importantly, he was an eternal optimist, possessing an unwavering confidence in the people of Africa to overcome adversity. Taju never forgot his home town and set up Hawa Memorial College in Funtua in memory of his mother, who died in 1997, and personally funded the education of numerous school and university students across Africa. He published one book after the 7th PAC, entitled: Pan-Africanism: Politics, Economy & Social Change in the Twenty-First Century, and his postcards were published posthumously in Speaking Truth to Power: Selected Pan-African Postcards.
