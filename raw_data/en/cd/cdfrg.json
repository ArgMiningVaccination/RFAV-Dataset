A subpoena may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be produced. d. Command to pr oduce; included obligations. A command in a subpoena to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things requires the responding party to permit inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of the materials. 10.14 (3) Service of subpoenas. a. The requesting party is responsible for arranging service of a subpoena prior to the hearing or deposition at which the testimony is commanded or the time at which the requested documents must be produced. The party is responsible for any cost associated with serving a subpoena and for the payment of witness fees and mileage expenses. If requested, pursuant to Iowa Code section 622.69 , the witness fee is $10 for a full day' s attendance and is $5 for attendance less than a full day , and mileage shall be paid for each mile actually traveled to participate in an in-person hearing or deposition at the rate established by the supreme court for witnesses in court proceedings, except that: (1) No peace of ficer who receives a regular salary , or any other public of ficial shall in any case receive fees as a witness for testifying in regard to any matter coming to the of ficer ' s or of ficial' s knowledge in the dischar ge of the of ficer ' s or of ficial' s of ficial duties in a telephone hearing or an in-person hearing held in the county of the of ficer ' s or of ficial' s residence, except police of ficers who are called as witnesses when not on duty .

IAC 12/20/17 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 10, p. 7 b. Any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a subpoena. Serving a subpoena requires delivering a copy to the named person and, if the subpoena requires that person' s attendance and, if demanded, tendering the fees for one day' s attendance and traveling fees to and from the proceeding. If the subpoena commands the production of documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, then before it is served, a notice must be served on each party . For purposes of this rule, an employee of a state or local governmental agency is not a party merely because the agency is a party and may serve a subpoena unless the employee is also a named party in the proceeding or otherwise ineligible to serve a subpoena. c.

Proving service, when necessary , requires filing with the division a statement showing the date and manner of service and the names of persons served.

The objection must be served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made, the following rules apply: 1. At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving party may move for an order compelling production or inspection. 2. These acts may be required only as directed in the order , and the order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party' s of ficer from significant expense resulting from compliance. c. Attendance. Any party shall be permitted to attend at the same time and place and for the same purposes specified in the subpoena. No prior notice of intent to attend is required. d. Quashing or modifying a subpoena. (1) When required. On timely motion, the administrative law judge must quash or modify a subpoena that: 1. Fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; 2. Requires a person who is neither a party nor a party' s of ficer to travel more than 50 miles from where that person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person, except that a person may be ordered to attend a hearing anywhere within the state in which the person is served with a subpoena; 3. Requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter , if no exception or waiver applies; or 4. Subjects a person to undue burden. (2) When permitted.

Ch 10, p. 8 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 12/20/17 (3) Specifying conditions as an alternative. In the circumstances described in subparagraph 10.14(4) \"d\" (2) , the administrative law judge, instead of quashing or modifying a subpoena, may order appearance or production under specified conditions if the serving party: 1. Shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship; and 2. Ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably compensated. (4) A motion to quash or modify a subpoena shall be filed with the division and served on all parties of record pursuant to rule 481\u201410.12 (17A), except that a motion filed by or on behalf of a person who is neither a party nor a party' s of ficer may be filed with the division and served only on the agency with a request for the division to provide a copy of the motion to all non-agency parties. The division may require a person requesting the division to provide the motion to a non-agency party to provide an additional paper copy of the motion and any attached exhibits for the division to provide to the non-agency party . (5) The motion may be set for ar gument at the discretion of the administrative law judge. The administrative law judge may limit the participation of a person who is not a party , or the representative of such a person, to the extent necessary to protect any confidential information related to the proceeding. 10.14 (5) Duties in r esponding to a subpoena. a. Pr oducing documents or electr onically stor ed information. These procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored information: (1) Documents.

(4) Inaccessible electronically stored information. The person responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order , the person responding must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the administrative law judge may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Iowa Rule of Civil Procedure 1.504(1)(b). The administrative law judge may specify conditions for the discovery . b. Claiming privilege or pr otection. (1) Information withheld. A person withholding subpoenaed information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material must: 1. Expressly make the claim; and 2. Describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable the parties to assess the claim. (2) Information produced. If information produced in response to a subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester , or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim.

[ ARC , IAB 12/20/17, ef fective 1/24/18] 481\u201415. 5 (10A) Scope, definitions, and application. 15.5 (1) Scope. a. The Iowa Code of Administrative Judicial Conduct consists of four canons, each of which is codified as the introductory paragraph of an administrative rule, and numbered rules under each canon, which are codified as subrules. Sub rule 15.5(3) establishes when the various rules apply to a presiding of ficer or an administrative law judge. b. The canons state overarching principles of judicial ethics that all administrative law judges and presiding of ficers, as applicable, must observe. Although an administrative law judge or presiding of ficer may be disciplined only for violating an applicable rule, the canons provide important guidance in interpreting the rules. Where a rule contains a permissive term, such as \"may\" or \"should,\" the conduct being addressed is committed to the personal and professional discretion of the administrative law judge or presiding of ficer in question, and no disciplinary action should be taken for action or inaction within the bounds of such discretion. c. Consistent with the requirement of Iowa Code section 10A.801(7) (d), this Code is similar in function and substantially equivalent to the Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct adopted by the Iowa Supreme Court and contained in Chapter 51 of the Iowa Court Rules. The Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct includes accompanying comments to the rules that may provide useful guidance regarding the Ch 15, p. 8 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 12/20/17 purpose, meaning, and proper application of the corresponding rule in this Code. The comments contain explanatory material and, in some instances, provide examples of permitted or prohibited conduct. The comments may also identify aspirational goals for administrative law judges and presiding of ficers. T o implement fully the principles of this Code as articulated in the canons, administrative law judges and presiding of ficers should strive to exceed the standards of conduct established by the rules, holding themselves to the highest ethical standards and seeking to achieve those aspirational goals, thereby enhancing the dignity of the administrative judicial position. d. The rules of this Code are rules of reason that should be applied consistent with constitutional requirements, statutes, administrative rules, and decisional law , and with due regard for all relevant circumstances. The rules should not be interpreted to impinge upon the essential independence of administrative law judges and presiding of ficers in making administrative judicial decisions. e. Although the black letter of the rules is binding and enforceable, it is not contemplated that every transgression will result in the imposition of discipline. Whether discipline should be imposed should be determined by the presiding of ficer ' s appointing authority through a reasonable and reasoned application of the rules, and should depend upon factors such as the seriousness of the transgression, the facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the transgression, the extent of any pattern of improper activity , whether there have been previous violations, and the ef fect of the improper activity upon the administrative judicial system or others. f. This Code is not designed or intended as a basis for civil or criminal liability . Neither is it intended to be the basis for parties to seek collateral remedies against each other or to obtain tactical advantages in proceedings before a presiding of ficer . 15.5 (2) Definitions.

An interest in the individual holdings within a mutual or common investment fund; 2.

The provisions of the Iowa Code of Administrative Judicial Conduct apply to all persons who act as presiding of ficers under the authority of Iowa Code section 17A.1 1(1) , except as specified in paragraph 15.5(3) \"b\" for agency heads or members of multimembered agency heads. Canons and rules that apply to all presiding of ficers use the terminology \"presiding of ficer\" in their text. This Code only applies to an agency head or a member of a multimembered agency head who actually acts as a presiding of ficer and does not apply merely because the agency head or member of a multimembered agency head is authorized to serve as the presiding of ficer when another person serves as the presiding of ficer . b. The provisions of rules 481\u201415.3 (10A) and 481\u201415.4 (10A) of this Code do not apply to agency heads or members of multimembered agency heads. These provisions apply only to administrative law judges and thus the terminology \"administrative law judge\" is used in their text. c. This Code does not apply to persons who participate only in the making of a final decision in a contested case without serving as a presiding of ficer pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.1 1(1) in that contested case unless a statute or administrative rule requires such a person to abide by this Code or a particular provision of this Code. This Code may nevertheless provide useful ethical guidance for a person participating in the making of a final decision in a contested case.

IAC 8/1/18 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 59, p. 1 CHAPTER 59 TUBERCULOSIS (TB) SCREENING 481\u201459. 1 (135B,135C) Purpose. The intent of this chapter is to outline requirements and procedures to conduct tuberculosis screening for health care workers in health care facilities and hospitals and for residents of health care facilities regulated by the department. [ ARC 3930C , IAB 8/1/18, ef fective 9/5/18] purposes chapter , the following definitions apply: \" Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccination \" or \" BCG vaccination \" means a vaccine for TB. BCG vaccination is used in many countries with a high prevalence of TB to prevent childhood tuberculosis meningitis and miliary disease. BCG vaccination is not generally recommended for use in the United States because of the low risk of infection with Mycobacterium tuber culosis , the variable ef fectiveness of the vaccine against adult pulmonary TB, and the vaccine' s potential interference with tuberculin skin test reactivity . \" Baseline TB scr eening \" means the screening of health care workers (HCWs) of health care facilities or hospitals at the beginning of employment in a facility or hospital and of residents of health care facilities upon admission to a facility for latent tuberculosis infection (L TBI) and TB disease. Baseline TB screening includes a symptom screen for all HCWs and residents, and two-step tuberculin skin test (two-step (IGRA) for M. tuber culosis for those persons with previous negative test results for M. tuber culosis infection. \" Baseline TST \" or \" baseline IGRA \" means the two-step TST or IGRA, respectively , which is administered at the beginning of employment to newly hired HCWs or upon admission of residents to health care facilities. \" Boosting \" means a phenomenon in which a person has a negative TST (i.e., false-negative) result years after infection with M. tuber culosis and then a positive subsequent TST result. The positive TST result is caused by a boosted immune response of previous sensitivity rather than by a new infection (false-positive TST conversion). T wo-step testing reduces the likelihood of mistaking a boosted reaction for a new infection. \" Department \" means the department of inspections and appeals. \" Employment \" or \" employed \" means to be hired or retained for paid or unpaid work in a facility or hospital. \" Extrapulmonary TB \" means TB disease in any part of the body other than the lungs (e.g., kidney , spine, or lymph nodes). \" Health car e facility \" or \" facility \" means a health care facility as defined in Iowa Code section 135C.1 or a long-term care service of a hospital as defined in rule 481\u201451.38 (135B). \" Health car e worker \" or \" HCW \" means any paid or unpaid person (including health care students) working in a health care facility or hospital, including any person who is paid either by the health care facility or hospital or paid by any other entity (i.e., temporary agency , private duty , Medicaid/Medicare or independent contractors), or any volunteer who volunteers in a health care facility or hospital on a consistent and regularly scheduled basis for five or more hours per week. Specifically excluded from the definition of \"health care worker\" are individuals such as visitors, building contractors, repair workers or others who are in the facility or hospital for a very limited purpose and are not in the facility or hospital on a regular basis. \" Hospital \" means a hospital as defined in Iowa Code section 135B.1 . \" Interfer on-gamma r elease assay \" or \" IGRA \" means a whole-blood test that can aid in diagnosing M. tuber culosis infection. \" Laryngeal TB \" means a form of TB disease that involves the larynx and may be highly infectious. \" Latent TB infection \" or \" L TBI \" means infection with M. tuber culosis without symptoms or signs of disease having manifested. \" Mantoux method \" means a skin test performed by intradermally injecting 0.1 mL of purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin solution into the volar or dorsal surface of the forearm. Ch 59, p. 2 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 8/1/18 \" Patient \" means a person admitted to a hospital. \" Pulmonary TB \" means TB disease that occurs in the lung parenchyma, usually producing a cough that lasts greater than three weeks. Pulmonary TB is usually infectious. \" Purified pr otein derivative tuber culin \" or \" PPD tuber culin \" means a material used in diagnostic tests for detecting infection with M. tuber culosis . \" Resident \" means a person admitted to a health care facility or a long-term care service of a hospital as defined in rule 481\u201451.38 (135B). For purposes of this chapter , \"resident\" does not include a patient admitted to a hospital. \" Risk classification \" means the category that the infection control team, or designated other staf f, determines is appropriate for the facility or hospital as a result of the TB risk assessment. \" Serial TB scr eening \" means TB screening performed at regular intervals following baseline TB screening. Serial TB screening, also called annual or ongoing TB testing, consists of two components: (1) assessing for current symptoms of active TB disease, and (2) testing for the presence of infection with M. tuber culosis by administering either a TST or single IGRA. \" Symptom scr een \" means a procedure used during a clinical evaluation in which persons are asked if they have experienced any departure from normal in function, appearance, or sensation related to TB disease (e.g., cough). \" TB patient \" means a person who had undiagnosed infectious pulmonary or laryngeal TB while in a health care facility or hospital during the preceding year . \"TB patient\" does not include persons with L TBI (treated or untreated), extrapulmonary TB disease, pulmonary TB, or laryngeal TB who have met criteria for noninfectiousness. \" TB risk assessment \" means an initial and ongoing annual evaluation of the risk for transmission of M. tuber culosis in a particular health care setting. \" TB scr eening \" means an administrative control measure in which evaluation for L TBI and TB disease is performed through baseline and serial screening of HCWs in hospitals and health care facilities and residents of health care facilities. \" T ransfer \" means an HCW changes employment from one health care facility or hospital to another health care facility or hospital where the time frame between employment does not exceed 90 days. \" T r eatment for L TBI \" means treatment that prevents the progression of M. tuber culosis infection into TB disease. \" T uber culin skin test \" or \" TST \" means a diagnostic aid for finding M. tuber culosis infection. The Mantoux method is the recommended method to be used for TST . \" T uber culosis \" or \" TB \" means the namesake member or ganism of M. tuber culosis complex and the most common causative infectious agent of TB disease in humans. In certain instances, the species name refers to the entire M. tuber culosis complex, which includes M. bovis , uber culosis disease \" or \" TB disease \" means a condition caused by infection with a member of the M. tuber culosis complex that has progressed to causing clinical (manifesting signs or symptoms) or subclinical (early stage of disease in which signs or symptoms are not present, but other indications of disease activity are present) illness. \" T wo-step tuber culin skin test \" or \" two-step TST \" means the procedure used for the baseline skin testing of persons who may receive serial TST s. [ ARC assessment. 59.3 (1) Annually , a health care facility or hospital shall conduct a TB risk assessment to evaluate the risk for transmission of M. tuber culosis , regardless of whether a person with suspected or confirmed TB disease is expected to be encountered in the facility or hospital. The TB risk assessment shall be utilized to determine the types of administrative, environmental, and respiratory protection controls needed and serves as an ongoing evaluation tool of the quality of TB infection control and for the identification of needed improvements in infection control measures. IAC 8/1/18 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 59, p. 3 59.3 (2) The TB risk assessment shall include the number of persons with infectious TB encountered in the facility or hospital that resulted in the facility' s or hospital' s conducting a contact investigation of exposed HCWs or patients during the previous 12 months. 59.3 (3) TB cases include persons who had undiagnosed infectious pulmonary or laryngeal TB while in the facility or hospital during the preceding year . This does not include persons with L TBI (treated or untreated), persons with extrapulmonary TB disease, or persons with pulmonary and laryngeal TB who have met criteria for 4 (135B,135C) Health car e facility or hospital risk classification. The infection control team or designated staf f in a health care facility or hospital is responsible for determining the type of risk classification. The facility' s or hospital' s risk classification is used to determine frequency of serial TB screening. The facility or hospital risk classification may change due to an increase or decrease in the number of TB cases during the preceding year . The following criteria are consistent with those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), TB Elimination Division, as outlined in the MMWR December 30, 2005/V ol.54/No.RR-17, \"Guidelines for Health-Care Settings, of risk classifications. a. \"Low risk\" means that a facility or hospital is one in which persons with active TB disease are not expected to be encountered and in which exposure to TB is unlikely . b. \"Medium risk\" means that a facility or hospital is one in which health care workers will or might be exposed to persons with active TB disease or to clinical specimens that might contain M. tuber culosis . c. \"Potential ongoing transmission\" means that a facility or hospital is one in which there is evidence of person-to-person transmission of M. tuber culosis . This classification is a temporary classification. If it is determined that this classification applies to a facility or hospital, the facility or hospital shall consult with the department of public health' s TB control program. 59.4 (2) Classification criteria\u2014low risk. a. Inpatient settings with 200 beds or more. If a facility or hospital has fewer than six TB patients for the preceding year , the facility or hospital shall be classified as low risk. b. Inpatient settings with fewer than 200 beds. If a facility or hospital has fewer than three TB patients for the preceding year , the facility or hospital shall be classified as low risk. 59.4 (3) Classification criteria\u2014medium risk. a. Inpatient settings with 200 beds or more. If a facility or hospital has six or more TB patients for the preceding year , the facility or hospital shall be classified as medium risk. b. Inpatient settings with fewer than 200 beds. If a facility or hospital has three or more TB patients for the preceding year , the facility or hospital shall be classified as medium risk. 59.4 (4) Classification criteria\u2014potential ongoing transmission. If evidence of ongoing M. tuber culosis transmission exists at a facility or hospital, the facility or hospital shall be classified as potential ongoing transmission, regardless of the facility' s or hospital' s previous classification. es for health car e facilities and hospitals. 59.5 (1) All HCWs shall receive baseline TB screening upon employment. Baseline TB screening consists of two components: (1) assessing for current symptoms of active TB disease and (2) testing using the two-step TST procedure or a single IGRA to screen for infection with M. tuber culosis . If the first-step TST result is negative, the second stage of the two-step TST is recommended one to three weeks after the first TST result was read. Administration of the second stage of the two-step TST shall not exceed 12 months after the first TST result was read. If initiation of the second stage of the two-step TST is greater than 12 months from when the first TST result was read, the two-step procedure must be restarted. If the first-step TST result is positive, it is not necessary to perform the second stage of the two-step TST . Ch 59, p. 4 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 8/1/18 59.5 (2) An HCW may begin working with patients or residents after a negative TB symptom screen (i.e., no symptoms of active TB disease) and a negative TST (i.e., first step) or negative IGRA. The second TST may be performed after the HCW starts working with patients or residents. 59.5 (3) An HCW with a new positive test result for M. tuber culosis infection (i.e., TST or IGRA) shall receive one chest radiograph result to exclude TB disease. Repeat radiographs are not needed unless signs or symptoms of TB disease develop or unless a repeat radiograph is recommended by a clinician. T reatment for L TBI should be considered in accordance with CDC guidelines. 59.5 (4) An HCW with documentation of past positive test results (i.e., TST or IGRA) and documentation of the results of a chest radiograph indicating no active disease, dated after the date of the positive TST or IGRA test result, does not need another chest radiograph at the time of hire. 59.5 (5) TB, TST or IGRA tests for M. tuber culosis infection do not need to be performed for HCWs with a documented history of TB disease, documented previously positive test result for M. tuber culosis infection, or documented completion of treatment for L TBI or TB disease. A TB symptom screen and documentation of a previously positive test result for M. tuber culosis infection can be substituted for a baseline test result if the documentation includes a recorded TST result in millimeters or IGRA result. All other HCWs should under go baseline testing for M. tuber culosis infection to ensure that the test result on record in the setting has been performed and measured using the recommended diagnostic procedures. 59.5 (6) Previous BCG vaccination is not a contraindication to having an IGRA, a TST or a two-step skin testing administered. HCWs with previous BCG vaccination should receive baseline and serial testing in the same manner as those without BCG vaccination. Evaluation of TST reactions in persons BCG-vaccinated should be interpreted using the same criteria for those not BCG-vaccinated. An HCW' s history of BCG vaccination should be disregarded when administering and interpreting TST results. Prior BCG vaccination does not cause a false-positive IGRA test ocedur es for health car e facilities and hospitals. 59.6 (1) Health car e facilities or hospitals classified as low risk. After establishing baseline TB screening of HCWs, serial TB screening of HCWs is not necessary for health care facilities or hospitals classified as low risk. 59.6 (2) Health car e facilities or hospitals classified as medium risk. a. After establishing baseline TB screening, HCWs in health care facilities or hospitals classified as medium risk shall receive serial TB screening annually . However , an HCW with a previous positive TB test result shall only receive annual TB symptom screening in accordance with 59.5(5) . b. An HCW with a baseline positive or new positive test result for M. tuber culosis infection or documentation of previous treatment for L TBI or TB disease shall receive one chest radiograph result to exclude TB disease. Instead of participating in serial testing, HCWs should receive a symptom screen annually . This screen should be accomplished by educating HCWs about symptoms of TB disease and instructing HCWs to report any such symptoms immediately to the occupational health unit. T reatment for L TBI should be considered in accordance with CDC guidelines. 59.6 (3) Health car e facilities or hospitals classified as potential ongoing transmission. HCWs in facilities or hospitals classified as potential ongoing transmission shall receive serial TB screening every eight to ten weeks until lapses in infection control have been corrected and no additional evidence of ongoing transmission is apparent. However , an HCW with a previous positive TB test result shall only receive TB symptom screening in accordance with 59.5(5) . The potential ongoing transmission classification should be used only as a temporary classification. This classification warrants immediate investigation and corrective steps. After a determination that ongoing transmission has ceased, the setting shall be reclassified as medium risk for a minimum of one year . [ ARC who transfer to other health car e facilities or hospitals. 59.7 (1) HCWs transferring fr om a low-risk health car e facility or hospital to another low-risk health car e facility or hospital. HCWs with documentation of baseline TB screening who are transferring from a low-risk health care facility or hospital to another low-risk health care facility or hospital do not need IAC 8/1/18 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 59, p. 5 to repeat baseline TB screening if the time frame between employment from one facility or hospital to another does not exceed 90 days. If the time frame between employment from one facility or hospital to another exceeds 90 days, baseline TB screening shall be restarted for an HCW with a previous negative test result and a TB symptom screen shall be performed for an HCW with a previous positive TB test result in accordance with 59.5(5) . 59.7 (2) HCWs transferring fr om a low-risk health car e facility or hospital to a medium-risk health car e facility or hospital. HCWs with documentation of baseline TB screening who are transferring from a low-risk health care facility or hospital to a medium-risk health care facility or hospital do not need to repeat baseline TB screening if the time frame between employment from one facility or hospital to another does not exceed 90 days. If the time frame between employment from one facility or hospital to another exceeds 90 days, baseline TB screening shall be restarted for an HCW with a previous negative test result and a TB symptom screen shall be performed for an HCW with a previous positive TB test result in accordance with 59.5(5) . 59.7 (3) HCWs transferring fr om a low- or medium-risk health car e facility or hospital to a health car e facility or hospital classified as potential ongoing transmission. HCWs with documentation of baseline TB screening who are transferring to a potential ongoing risk health care facility or hospital do not need to repeat baseline TB screening if the time frame between employment from one facility to another does not exceed 90 days. If the time frame between employment from one facility or hospital to another exceeds 90 days, baseline TB screening shall be restarted for an HCW with a previous negative test result and a TB symptom screen shall be performed for an HCW with a previous positive TB test result in accordance with 59.5(5) . 59.7 (4) HCWs transferring fr om a medium-risk health car e facility or hospital to a low-risk health car e facility or hospital. a. An HCW who is transferring from a medium-risk health care facility or hospital to a low-risk health care facility or hospital and whose previous TB test result was negative shall receive a symptom screen and a single TST or IGRA upon employment if the time frame between employment from one facility to another does not exceed 90 days. If the time frame between employment from one facility or hospital to another exceeds 90 days, baseline TB screening shall be restarted. b. An HCW who is transferring from a medium-risk health care facility or hospital to a low-risk health care facility or hospital and whose previous TB test result was positive shall receive a symptom screen upon employment in accordance with 59.5(5) . 59.7 (5) HCWs transferring fr om a health car e facility or hospital classified as potential ongoing transmission to a low- or medium-risk health car e facility or hospital. a. An HCW who is transferring from a health care facility or hospital classified as potential ongoing transmission to a low- or medium-risk health care facility or hospital and whose previous TB test result was negative shall receive a symptom screen and a single TST or IGRA upon employment if the time frame between employment from one facility to another does not exceed 90 days. If the time frame between employment from one facility or hospital to another exceeds 90 days, baseline TB screening shall be restarted. b.

Baseline TB screening consists of two components: (1) assessing for current symptoms of active TB disease, and (2) using the two-step TST procedure or a single IGRA to screen for infection with M. tuber culosis . If the first-step TST result is negative, the second stage of the two-step TST is recommended one to three weeks after the first TST result was read. Administration of the second stage of the two-step TST shall not exceed 12 months after the first TST result was read. If the second stage of the two-step TST is greater than 12 months from when the first TST result was read, the two-step Ch 59, p. 6 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 8/1/18 procedure must be restarted. If the first-step TST result is positive, it is not necessary to perform the second stage of the two-step TST . 59.8 (2) All residents shall be assessed for current symptoms of active TB disease upon admission. W ithin 72 hours of a resident' s admission, baseline TB screening for infection shall be initiated unless baseline TB screening occurred within 90 days prior to the resident' s admission. 59.8 (3) A resident with a new positive test result for M. tuber culosis infection (i.e., TST or IGRA) shall receive one chest radiograph result to exclude TB disease. Repeat radiographs are not needed unless signs or symptoms of TB disease develop or unless a repeat radiograph is recommended by a clinician. 59.8 (4) Residents with documentation of past positive test results (i.e., TST or IGRA) and documentation of the results of a chest radiograph indicating no active disease, dated after the date of the positive TST or IGRA test result, do not need another chest radiograph at the time of admission. 59.8 (5) TB, TST or IGRA tests for M. tuber culosis infection do not need to be performed for residents with a documented history of TB disease, documented previously positive test result for M. tuber culosis infection, or documented completion of treatment for L TBI or TB disease. Documentation of a previously positive test result for M. tuber culosis infection can be substituted for a baseline test result if the documentation includes a recorded TST result in millimeters or IGRA result, including the concentration of cytokine measured (e.g., IFN-g).

The record should contain an accurate account of all information relevant to the client' s health care, active treatment, social information and protection of the client' s rights, such as communications, correspondence, program plans (to include both in-house and outside service programs), progress summaries, activity plans and activity participation, incidents, consent forms and all medical information. If the records are maintained electronically , the facility staf f should be able to access various parts of the record without dif ficulty .

Guidance \u00a7483.410(c)(2) \"Keep confidential\" means safeguarding the content of information including video, audio, and/or computer stored information from unauthorized disclosure without the specific informed consent of the client, parent of a minor child, or legal guardian, and consistent with the advocate' s right of access. Facility staf f and consultants, hired to provide services to the client, sign confidentiality agreements before having access to client records and should have access to only that portion of information that is necessary to provide ef fective responsive services to the client. Ch 64, p. 16 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 These agreements should be renewed according to the policies of the facility . The agreement may stipulate that the agreements are in place until either the facility or member terminates the agreement. The facility has in place safeguards to ensure that access to all information regarding clients is limited to those clients designated by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIP AA) requirements, the Developmental Disabilities Act, State law and facility policy .

Client records must be secured when staf f is not present. The facility must develop and follow procedures for maintaining the confidentiality of client information during transport to medical appointments or to other locations outside the facility . Confidentiality applies to both central records and information kept at dispersed locations. If there is information considered too confidential to place in the record used by all staf f (e.g., identification of the family' s financial assets, sensitive medical data), it may be retained in a companion record located in a secure location in the facility with a notation made in the primary record as to the location of confidential information. The facility must ensure that any client information provided to day services programs is maintained confidential. The sharing of client specific information with members of the \"specially constituted committee\" required by \u00a7483.440(f)(3), who are not af filiated with the agency , does not violate a client' s right to have information about him or her kept confidential. The committee must have relevant information to function properly . Facility confidentiality safeguards include the development and implementation of written policies to assure that members of the specially constituted team maintain confidentiality . Such processes may include signed confidentiality agreements. These agreements should be renewed according to the policies of the facility .

W1 \u00a7483.410(c)(3) must develop and implement policies and pr ocedur es governing the r elease of any client information, including consents necessary fr om the client, or par ents (if the client is a minor) or legal guardian. Guidance \u00a7483.410(c)(3) The facility develops and follows written policies governing the release of client information. Release of any personally identifiable information does not occur unless consent(s) is obtained prior to the release. These policies must address at a minimum who must give consent for the release of information from records. The policy and procedures should account for other situations involving the release of client information, such as: who should be notified when records have been released; procedures to be followed with subpoenas; time frames for providing requested information; and information regarding a client' s HIV status may not be released without specific consent and may not be in the record if that consent has not been given. W1 14 an entry in a client' s r ecord must make it legibly , date it, and sign it. Guidance \u00a7483.410(c)(4) Illegible writing in hard copy records can contribute to communication deficits among staf f. Illegible writing which cannot be easily interpreted by facility staf f upon surveyor request may constitute a safety issue. Electronic signatures are acceptable in the electronic record system. IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 17 W1 15 \u00a7483.410(c)(5) The facility must pr ovide a legend to explain any symbol or abbr eviation used in a client' s identified r esidential living unit with appr opriate aspects of each client' s r ecord.

Guidance \u00a7483.410(d)(1) If a service is not provided directly , there must be a written agreement for such services. W ritten agreements are required for emer gency services such as dentists and pharmacies. For those services that require a visit to a hospital, the Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID) typically utilizes services from an emer gency department of the hospital, thus no written contract is required. Federal statute (P .L. 94-142) requires all school-aged children to receive a free and appropriate school education. Therefore, a written agreement between ICF/IIDs and public schools is not necessary .

Guidance \u00a7483.410(d)(3) Outside services are any services needed by the clients and not provided directly by the facility (hospital visits, dental visits, day program services, etc.). Programs and services must be coordinated between the facility and the outside service, and foster consistency of implementation across settings of teaching strategies and behavior management. The facility monitors outside services on an ongoing basis to ensure that services provided are consistent with the needs of each client as identified in the Individual Program Plan (IPP). For example, if the facility is implementing a behavior management or a communication program for the client, it is shared with the outside program and implemented by the outside program (workshop, day program, etc.) and the outside program agrees to incorporate it into their day program. At periodic intervals, the facility staf f visit or communicate with the outside program to verify consistency across the two settings. Ch 64, p. 18 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 W ith outside resources, it is the responsibility of the facility to assure that the services are provided in a safe clean environment, by appropriately qualified professions, and any untoward outcome of services are promptly addressed. If, in spite of attempts by the facility to assure compliance, the outside program does not implement the program for the client, then the facility remains responsible for the lack of active treatment.

This obligation exists even when the client is less than fully competent and requires that the facility is actively engaged in activities which result in the protection of the client' s rights, advocacy for individual clients who have no family or an inactive family , and training programs for clients and staf f on the understanding and protection of client rights. Inform each client, par ent (if the client is a minor), or legal guardian, of the client' s rights and the rules of the facility; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(1) The obligation to inform requires that the facility presents information on rights to the client, his or her family or his or her legal guardian in a manner and form which they can understand. In most instances, family means parent. However , in those instances where parents are deceased or choose not to be active in the client' s life and there is another family member who does wish to be active, but is not the legal guardian, this family member should be informed of the client' s rights. Printed materials should be provided in understandable terms and provided in the language necessary to ensure understanding. Specialized methods, as indicated, should be provided for communication with clients, families or legal guardians with hearing or vision impairment. IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 19 Pro-active assertion of client rights includes, but is not limited to: Signed evidence that the client, his or her family and/or his or her legal guardian have been informed of the client' s rights, and Evidence that the communication of these rights were provided at the client' s level of comprehension, and in the language understandable to the client. The obligation to inform also requires that the facility make some determination of whether the client and his or her family , or legal guardian understood the rights presented and made additional ef forts to communicate the rights if the rights were not understood. If the facility has written \"rules of the facility\", these rules must be communicated to the client, their family and or legal guardians at the time of admission and must not be in conflict with any of the rights listed in 42 CFR 483.420 Inform each client, par ent (if the client is a minor), or legal guardian, of the client' s medical condition, developmental and behavioral status, attendant risks of tr eatment, and of the right to r efuse tr eatment; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(2) Clients, their families or legal guardians are promptly informed of any change in the client' s medical or behavioral needs that requires immediate alteration to programmatic or medical intervention. Promptly is defined by the level of severity of the alteration. In each case, they must also be informed of the attendant risks of any recommended treatments or interventions and of their right to refuse treatment, training or services. If parents or legal guardians wish for other members of the client' s family to be informed of such changes, they must put this permission in writing. The communication of this information must be provided in the manner and language understood by the client or their family or legal guardian (language boards, sign language, etc.). The term \"attendant risks of treatment\" describes the risk vs. risk and risk vs. benefit associated with the treatment. These risks include possible side ef fects, other complications from treatments including medical and drug therapy , unintended consequences of treatment, other behavioral or psychological ramifications arising from treatment, etc. The facility actively attempts to engage clients who refuse to participate in active treatment. While the regulation recognizes the client' s right to refuse treatment, persistent refusal that impacts the health and safety of the client and/or others, or the ability to provide overall active treatment, may result in facility' s consideration of alternative placements for the client. It is expected, however , that the facility has assessed the reason for refusal, and developed and implemented all possible interventions to engage the client in active treatment programs prior to referring the client to another therapeutic setting. A client, his or her family member , or legal guardian who refuses a particular treatment (e.g., a behavior control, seizure control medication or a particular intervention strategy) must be of fered information about acceptable alternatives to the treatment, if acceptable alternatives are available. The client' s preference about alternatives should be elicited and considered in deciding on the course of treatment. If the client, family member , or legal guardian also refuses the alternative treatment, or if no alternative exists to the treatment refused, the facility must consider the ef fect this refusal may have on other clients, the client himself or herself, and if they can continue to provide services to the client consistent with these regulations. If the facility is unable to provide services to a client due to consistent refusal to participate, they must weigh all options including an involuntary dischar ge. Involuntary dischar ge must be for good cause (see 483.440(b)(4)(i)). When a client is considered for participation in experimental research the client, his/her family and/or legal guardian must be fully informed of the nature of the experiment (e.g., what medications or physical interventions will be utilized, the length of the research, any possible side ef fects and how the information from the research will be utilized). Information regarding the possible consequences of participating or not participating must be provided to the client, family member or legal guardian. The written consent Ch 64, p. 20 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 of the client, his/her family or legal guardian must be received prior to participation. For a client who is a minor or who has been adjudicated as incompetent, the written informed consent of the parents of the minor or the legal guardian is required. The signed, informed consent documentation must be in compliance with HHS Guidelines for Research Involving Human Subjects. The signed consent must also include a clear discussion of what treatments will be included in the research, the time limits for the research and should clearly inform the client, family member or legal guardian that the client may end participation at any time without fear of recrimination. If the research protocol indicates that clients receive compensation, then clients are compensated per the protocol. Any research must be reviewed and approved by the Specially Constituted Committee. See W263. clients to exer cise their rights as clients of the facility , and as citizens of the United States, including the right to file complaints, and the right to due pr ocess; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(3) T o the extent that a client is able, choices are made on his/her own. Each client has autonomy of decision making and choice. They are free to move about without limitations imposed due to staf f preferences or staf f convenience. Clients are not restricted without due cause or due process. T o the extent that the client is able to make decisions for him or herself, it is inappropriate to delegate the person' s right to others (e.g. parents, family members, etc.). The facility has an obligation to assure client health and safety and must balance that obligation with the rights of clients. If the facility has implemented a restriction, the following should be in place: An assessment supporting the need for the restriction; An individualized behavior plan to reduce the need for the restriction has been developed and implemented; A written informed consent for the behavior plan which includes the restriction; Approval of the Specially Constituted Committee; and Monitoring by the Committee of the progress of the training program, designed to reduce and eventually eliminate the restriction. Clients, families, and legal guardians have the right to register a complaint with the facility and the State Survey Agency . If so, the facility must respond promptly and appropriately . The facility must ensure protection of the client from any form of reprisal or intimidation as a result of a complaint or grievance reported by the client, family , or legal guardian. Issues involving the exercise of constitutional rights such as voting should be addressed as a component of the IPP when the Interdisciplinary T eam (IDT) determines a need for training. Clients who have been adjudged to need guardianship or have been assessed as needing assistance to advocate for themselves should receive assistance or support so they may exercise their rights as citizens of the United States. W126 Allow individual clients to manage their financial affairs and teach them to do so to the extent of their capabilities; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(4) The regulation is clear that in those cases where a client already possesses the skills necessary to independently manage their own financial af fairs, the facility will allow the client to continue to do so. Formal training in financial management must be provided for all other clients in the facility to the extent of their capabilities. The regulation places the responsibility for determining the extent of the client' s capabilities in this matter upon an assessment and interdisciplinary process within the facility . T o reach a determination as to whether a money management program is appropriate, the facility IDT uses the comprehensive functional assessment (CF A) to evaluate the ability of each client to participate in such a program. Under 42 C.F .R. 483.440(c)(3), the team evaluation must establish, through IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 21 documentation, that the IDT considers all of the objective data within the assessment in reaching their determination, especially the identification of client skills which can be used across training programs. Examples of assessment findings that may be considered by the IDT include skills that can be cross- utilized in training programs such as: 1. Fine motor coordination; 2. The ability to make choices; 3. The ability to identify preferences; and 4. Cognitive abilities including tracking, attention span, communication, and the client' s ability to understand the cause and ef fect. (The client understands of cause and ef fect is significant in the determination.) Money management includes a broad spectrum of programs with varying levels of participation by the client ranging from the use of choice in money expenditures, to an understanding of the concept of money , and ultimately to actual money handling and budgeting. The IDT must not conclude that a money management program is inappropriate based solely upon the level of intellectual or physical disability of the client. The CF A must be reviewed at least annually per 42 C.F .R.483.440(f)(2). As a part of this annual review , a client' s ability to participate in money management will also be reviewed. The annual review should always include an update to the CF A and take into consideration any changes in the client' s circumstances since the last IPP . The need for a formal money management program must be addressed in every client' s IPP by the IDT on an annual basis. The determination of the appropriateness of a formal money management program is made by the IDT and must be based upon a CF A. The IDT discussions resulting in that determination must be established through documentation in the client' s IPP that clients ar e not subjected to physical, verbal, sexual or psychological abuse or punishment; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(5) Identification of patterns or isolated instances of physical, verbal, sexual or psychological abuse or punishment without prompt identification and corrective action by the facility would result in a non-compliance determination for this Standard and Condition level non-compliance. The facility must develop and implement systems that protect clients from all forms of abuse, neglect, or mistreatment, including client to client abuse, neglect, or mistreatment. a. The facility is expected to ensure that staf f possess and demonstrate needed competencies to ef fectively and appropriately interact with clients. b. The facility must monitor to assure that systems are ef fectively implemented and the facility takes immediate actions to address circumstances where abuse, neglect, or mistreatment have occurred and prevent reoccurrence. c. The facility must be or ganized in such a manner as to proactively assure clients are free from any threat to their physical and psychological health and safety . d. The facility must act to prevent physical, verbal, sexual or psychological abuse. If the facility fails to implement appropriate corrective action, the potential of additional threats to the clients remain at the facility . \"Threat\", for the purposes of this guideline, is considered any condition/situation which could cause or result in severe, temporary or permanent injury or harm to the mental or physical condition of clients, or in their death. \"Abuse\", for the purposes of this guideline, is the willful infliction of injury , unreasonable confinement, intimidation or punishment with the resulting physical harm, pain or personal anguish. Physical abuse refers to any action intended to cause physical harm or pain, trauma or bodily harm (e.g., hitting, slapping, punching, kicking, pinching, etc.). It includes the use of corporal punishment as well as the use of any restrictive, intrusive procedure to control inappropriate behavior for purposes of punishment. Ch 64, p. 22 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 V erbal abuse refers to any use of insulting, demeaning, disrespectful, oral, written or gestured language directed towards and in the presence of the client. Psychological abuse includes, but is not limited to, humiliation, harassment, and threats of punishment or deprivation, sexual coercion and intimidation (e.g. living in fear in one' s own home). Since many clients residing in ICF/IIDs are unable to communicate feelings of fear , humiliation, etc. associated with abusive episodes, the assumption is made that any actions that would usually be viewed as psychologically or verbally abusive by a member of the general public, would also be viewed as abusive by the client residing in the ICF/IID, regardless of that client' s perceived ability to comprehend the nature of the incident. Sexual abuse includes any incident where a client is coerced or manipulated to participate in any form of sexual activity for which the client did not give af firmative permission (or gave af firmative permission without the attendant understanding required to give permission) or sexual assault against a client who is unable to defend him/herself. The facility must implement, through policies, oversight and training, safeguards to ensure that clients are not subjected to abuse by anyone including, but not limited to, facility staf f, consultants or volunteers, staf f of other agencies serving the client, family members or legal guardians, friends, other clients, or the general public. The facility must take whatever action is necessary to protect the clients residing there. For example, if a facility is forced by court order or arbitration rulings to retain or reinstate an employee found to be abusive, the facility must take measures to protect the clients of the facility (such as assigning the employee to an area where there is no contact with clients). W128 e fr ee fr om unnecessary drugs and physical r estraints and ar e pr ovided active tr eatment to r educe dependency on drugs and physical r estraints; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(6) The facility must implement an aggressive active treatment program, which includes appropriate replacement behaviors, to address the reduction/elimination of physical restraints and drugs to manage behaviors. For purposes of this Guideline drugs to manage behavior are \"unnecessary\" if there is evidence the drugs are being used: In excessive dose (duplicate therapy); For excessive duration; Not monitored adequately; W ithout adequate indications for its use; W ith adverse consequences which indicate the dose should be reduced or discontinued; or Any combination of the reasons listed above. The long term use of a drug/physical restraint to manage behavior combined with one or more of the following may indicate unnecessary use: The client' s developmental and/or behavioral needs are not being met and the appropriateness of less restrictive approaches to manage inappropriate behaviors should be questioned; Staf f behavior may be prompting behaviors in clients which result in the chronic use of physical restraints and drugs to control behavior; Staf f may have inadequate training and/or experience to provide active treatment and employ preventive measures; Restraints applied for behaviors when less restrictive measures have not been tried or have been tried and found to be just as ef with the opportunity for personal privacy and Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(7) The facility must provide areas within the living area in which the client can have time to be alone, when appropriate, and to have privacy (their conversations cannot be overheard) for personal IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 23 interactions/activities. There should be a location where the client can meet privately with family and/or friends and a telephone available where he/she can hold private telephone conversations. Personal privacy for clients also includes the right to have certain personal information about them kept confidential. Staf f should not discuss one client in front of others (clients, parents, legal guardians, visitors, etc.) and should not post personal information about clients in areas where other clients, families and the public can read the information. V ideo/audio taping or live feed must not be used in place of or for the convenience of staf f. The facility may install video/audio equipment for purposes of observing client/staf f interactions. V ideo/audio equipment may only be installed in common areas (in no case may videotaping or live feed be done in bathrooms or areas where private visits are conducted). The clients, families and/or legal guardians of the clients residing in the areas where videotaping or live feed will occur must give informed consent for the installation and must be assured that no personal privacy will be jeopardized. The use of the equipment must be presented at and approved by the specially constituted committee for the facility prior to the installation of video or audio devices. Motion sensors should not be considered cameras. W130 and car e of personal needs; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(7) Clients must be provided privacy during personal hygiene activities (e.g., toileting, bathing, dressing) and during medical/nursing treatments that require exposure of one' s body . People not involved in the care of the client should not be present without their consent while they are being examined or treated. Whenever possible, the facility should be sensitive to clients' preferences for same sex care in private situations. that clients ar e not compelled to perform services for the facility and Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(8) Clients are not required or expected to be a source of labor for a facility . The client must not be required or expected to do productive work for the facility , other than appropriate care of one' s own personal space or shared responsibilities for common areas. W132 that clients who do work for the facility ar e compensated for their efforts at pr evailing wages and commensurate with their abilities; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(8) \"W ork\", as used in the regulation, means any directed activity , or series of related activities which results in a benefit to the economy of the facility or in a contribution to its maintenance, or in the production of a salable product. In deciding whether a particular activity constitutes \"work\" as defined above, the key determinant is whether the facility would be required to hire additional full or part-time staf f (or pay overtime to existing staf f) to perform the service the client is asked to perform. Clients volunteering to do real work that benefits the facility should give informed consent for such practices and understand that by providing employable services they are able to be compensated. This does not preclude a client from helping out a friend or being kind to others. Self-care activities related to the care of one' s own person or property are not considered \"work\" for purposes of compensation. In general, participation in any household task which promotes greater independent functioning and assists the client to prepare for less restrictive setting (and which the client has not yet learned) is permitted as long as tasks are included in the IPP in written behavioral and measurable terms. This participation must be supervised, and indices of performance should be available. No task may be performed for the convenience of staf f (e.g., supervising clients, running personal errands). Ch 64, p. 24 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 \"Compensated\" means the client is provided with money or other forms of negotiable compensation for work (including work performed in an occupational training program) and such compensation is to be used at the client' s discretion. Prevailing wage refers to the wage paid to non-disabled workers in nearby industry or the surrounding community for essentially the same type, quality and quantity of work or work requiring comparable skills. A client who works in the facility must be paid at least the prevailing minimum wage, unless an appropriate certificate has been obtained by the facility in accordance with current regulations and guidelines issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended. Any client performing \"work\", as defined above, must be compensated in direct proportion to his or her output. The facility should utilize Department of Labor and/or Department of V ocational Rehabilitation formulas and techniques for determining rate of pay . A client' s pay is not dependent on the production of other clients when he or she works in a group. When the client' s active treatment program includes assignment to occupational or vocational training or work, specific work objectives of anticipated progress should be included in the IPP along with reasons for the assignments. If the training of clients on particular occupational activities or functions involves \"real work\" to be accomplished for the facility , the clients must be compensated based on ability . For example, if in the process of work training activities which involve learning to clean a floor , the floor for a particular building is cleaned and does not require further janitorial cleanup, then the client must be compensated for this activity at the prevailing wage. W133 clients the opportunity to communicate, associate and meet privately with individuals of their choice, Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(9) Privacy must be provided for both face-to-face interactions and electronic interactions. The facility must provide opportunities for the client to communicate, through regular mail, telephone and/or electronic mail and meet in private with persons of their choice (e.g., friends from the community , family members, and advocates). There may be instances where legal guardians override the wishes of the client. In these instances, the facility should be actively working with the legal guardian and the client to reach the maximum agreeable level of interaction for the client. Space must be provided for clients to receive visitors in reasonable comfort and privacy . eceive unopened mail; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(9) Clients must be provided the opportunity to send/receive all types of mail unopened and read the contents themselves if able. If the staf f has to open and read mail to the client, this should be done in a private place allowing the client as much participation as possible. Clients who have their own electronic equipment must be provided the opportunity to send, receive, and read electronic mail with privacy . that clients have access to telephones with privacy for incoming and outgoing local and long distance calls except as contraindicated by factors identified within their individual pr ogram plans; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(10) Any restriction of telephone access must be explained in the IPP with a plan to advance the client' s access. For persons with hearing loss who could benefit, T ext T elephone (TTY) services or other accommodations should be provided. As with any other rights restriction, the restriction must be addressed in the IPP , written informed consent obtained, and the plan must be reviewed and approved by the specially constituted committee. W136 IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch the opportunity to participate in social, r eligious, and community gr oup activities; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(1 1) Clients should be of fered the opportunity to participate in various types of activities in the community (e.g., going to grocery stores, hair salons, restaurants, places of worship, pharmacies, community meetings and events) based on their interests and choices. The facility must make accommodations for physical issues such as hearing impairment and mobility limitations. In addition, clients should be taught the applicable skills to participate in their choice of activities to the fullest extent of their abilities. It is not acceptable for all client activities to be provided in the facility . When a client is identified to be on restriction from community integration opportunities, interview clients, families, legal guardians and staf f to determine if due process was af forded for this restriction and whether the restriction is included in the IPP . In the event of a court placement that restricts community access, due process does not apply . There should be evidence that the facility assists and encourages all clients, regardless of functioning levels, to have input into the decisions on community integration activities. It is not acceptable to require clients to attend unwanted activities due to staf fing right to r etain and use appr opriate personal possessions and clothing, and Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(12) Clients should have personal possessions and clothing which meet their needs, interests and choices. Clients should have free access to their own possessions and clothing. When considering whether a client has free access to their personal possessions and clothing, ensure that physical limitations have been addressed. Clients who are unable to access and use personal possessions and clothing appropriately are involved in programs to learn the necessary skills to do so. In situations where the behavior of one or more clients in a living area prevents free access to personal possessions for each client, the facility must develop IPPs for the client with disruptive behavior . The facility must also ensure that during the implementation of this program plan that none of the other clients have their rights infringed upon. Clients should not be without personal possessions because of the behavior of others with whom they live. All client possessions, regardless of their apparent value to others are treated with respect for what they may represent to the client. Where those choices include socially stigmatizing materials, the facility should provide learning opportunities to make more socially appropriate choices. The facility should encourage clients to use or display possessions of his or her choice in a culturally normative manner . If a method for identifying personal ef fects is used, it should be inconspicuous and in a manner that will assist the client to identify them. \"Appropriate\" clothing means a supply of clothing that is suf ficient, in good repair , accounts for a variety of occasions and seasons, and appropriate to age, size, gender , and level of activity . Modification or adaptation of clothing fasteners should be considered based on the needs of a client with a physical disability to become more independent. As appropriate, each client' s active treatment program maximizes opportunities for choice and self-direction with regard to choosing and shopping for clothing which enhances his or her appearance, and selecting daily clothing in accordance with age, sex and cultural norms. Clients are permitted to keep personal clothing and possessions for their use while in the facility . Determine how the facility both ensures the safety of personal possessions while at the same time providing client access to them when the client chooses. Clients are provided the opportunity , encouraged, and trained to use age-appropriate materials. The term \"age-appropriate\" refers to anything that reinforces recognition of the client as a person of a certain chronological age. Clients who choose to keep items traditionally used by children such as dolls or Ch 64, p. 26 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 model cars are not an automatic citation. There must be evidence the facility is encouraging the client to use these possessions in a socially appropriate, non-stigmatizing manner . The facility' s environment must be furnished with materials and activities that will enhance opportunities for growth. W138 client is dr essed in his or her own clothing each day; and Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(12) Clothing such as pajamas, underwear , socks, hats, mittens/gloves, and coats should be the personal property of the client and not considered \"stock\" items. There should be no communal clothes. If clients are unable to do their own personal laundry the facility must ensure that clothing is properly laundered and returned to the appropriate client. The staf f of the facility should ensure that clients dress appropriately for the season and the occasion by implementing training programs or guidance for the client as indicated.

Pocket money given to the client does not need to be itemized. Pocket money should be considered a nominal amount of five dollars or less at a time. Funds provided by the facility and dispensed to a client as part of a program to train the client in money management, and funds that are not entrusted to the facility (e.g., funds paid directly to the client' s representative payee) do not require accounting. In those instances where a legal guardian or the individual client is in control of their personal funds, no accounting is necessary by the facility . of client funds with facility funds or with the funds of any person other than another client. Guidance \u00a7483.420(b)(1)(ii) If the facility elects to pool clients' funds in an interest-bearing account, including common trust accounts, it is expected to know the interest separately accrued by each client, as part of its required accounting of funds. Interest accumulated to a client' s account belongs to the client, not the facility ecord must be available on r equest to the client, par ents (if the client is a minor) or legal guardian. Guidance \u00a7483.420(b)(2) Those persons having legal authority to access the accounting records for personal funds such as the client, parent, or legal guardians should be af forded access upon request unless there is documented rationale for withholding the information. It is not necessary that a facility furnish an annual financial statement to the client, or the client' s parent or legal guardian, since the facility is already required to make the financial record available at any time upon request.

The facility encourages and engages parents, family members and legal guardians in the continued implementation of active treatment programs even while spending time outside of the facility setting. \"Unobtainable\", for the purposes of this guideline, means that the facility has made a good faith ef fort to seek parental or legal guardian participation in the process, even though the ef fort may ultimately be unsuccessful (for example, the parent may be impossible to locate or may prove unwilling or unable to participate). \"Inappropriate\", for the purposes of this guideline, means that behavior of the parent or legal guardian could be disruptive or detrimental to the client' s program outcome. In this case, determine what the facility has done to bring ef fective resolution to the pr omptly and appr opriately; Guidance \u00a7483.420(c)(2) It is reasonable to expect that the facility will provide at least an interim response to inquiries from the client' s families and friends within 48 hours. individuals with a r elationship to the client (such as family , close friends, legal guardians and advocates) at any r easonable hour , without prior notice, consistent with the right of that client' s and other clients' privacy , unless the interdisciplinary team determines that the visit would not be appr opriate; Guidance \u00a7483.420(c)(3) Any limitations on visitors must be implemented as a result of IDT evaluation and discussion and be documented. This documentation should include evidence of approval from the specially constituted committee. Decisions to restrict a visitor for an individual client must be reviewed and re-evaluated each time the IPP is reviewed or at the client' s request.

It is reasonable to expect the facility to contact the family or legal guardian of a client as soon as possible after an incident occurs, but no later than 24 hours after the incident. If notification is done via electronic mail, the facility must request a response from the e-mail recipient to confirm notification. T elephone notification must be accomplished by talking to the person directly . If a message is left, the facility must request a call back to confirm receipt of the notification. Contact by letter may be utilized as follow up confirmation, but not be the initial, primary or sole mode of communication with the family or legal guardian. If unable to contact the family or legal guardian, there should be evidence that the facility attempted to reach alternate emer gency contacts. Requests from clients who are their own guardian to limit notifications to their families must be honored. (d) Standard: Staff tr eatment of The must develop and implement written policies and pr ocedur es that pr ohibit mistr eatment, neglect or abuse of the client. Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(1) The facility , through implementation of its policies, must set up a structure that screens and trains employees, protects clients and prevents, identifies, investigates and reports abuse, neglect and mistreatment of clients. The policies must designate who (either by name or title) has the authority to act in the Administrator ' s absence and take any immediate corrective actions necessary to assure a client' s safety such as removing a staf f person from direct client contact. \"Mistreatment\", for the purposes of this guideline, includes behavior or facility practices that result in any type of client exploitation such as financial, physical, sexual, or criminal. Mistreatment also refers to the use of behavioral management techniques outside of their use as approved by the specially constituted committee and facility policies and procedures. \"Neglect\" means failure to provide goods and services necessary to avoid physical harm, mental anguish or mental illness. Staf f failure to intervene appropriately to prevent self- injurious behavior may constitute neglect. Staf f failure to implement facility safeguards, once client to client aggression is identified, may also constitute neglect. Refer to W127 for definitions of abuse. Staff of the facility must not use physical, verbal, sexual or psychological abuse or punishment. W151 Staff not punish a client by withholding food or hydration that contributes to a nutritionally adequate must pr ohibit the employment of individuals with a conviction or prior employment history of child or client abuse, neglect or mistr eatment. IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 29 Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(1)(iii) The facility is required to screen potential employees for a prior employment history of child or client abuse, neglect or mistreatment, as well as for any conviction based on those of fenses. The abuse, neglect or mistreatment must have been directed toward a child or a client/resident/patient of a health care facility in order for the prohibition of employment to apply . No one with a conviction or substantiated allegation of child or client abuse, neglect or mistreatment regardless of employment date, is employed by the facility . This requirement also applies to acts of abuse, neglect or mistreatment committed by a current ICF/IID employee outside the jurisdiction of the ICF/IID (e.g., in the community or in another health care facility). The facility must follow state guidelines or requirements for background checks to assure that they make every ef fort to check new employee' s background. Where the facility has terminated an employee based upon confirmation that abuse, neglect or mistreatment occurred during the employee' s performance, and the termination decision was overturned by either arbitration finding or a court finding, the employee must be returned to a position which does not involve direct contact between that employee and clients of the facility . A person who abused a resident in a nursing facility , and as a result, is barred from employment in the nursing home setting would also be prohibited from employment in the ICF/IID. While facilities are not required to periodically screen existing employees, if the facility becomes aware that such action has been taken against an employee, the facility is required to prohibit continued employment. This is also true of any conviction in a court of law for child, elder , or client (resident, patient) abuse, neglect or mistreatment. Therefore, conviction for abusing one' s own child is also a reason employment would be prohibited. W153 that all allegations of mistr eatment, neglect or abuse, as well as injuries of unknown sour ce, ar e r eported immediately to the administrator or to other officials in accordance with State law thr ough established pr ocedur es. Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(2) Injuries of unknown source that give rise to a suspicion that they may be the result of abuse or neglect, should be reported immediately . An injury should be reported as an \"injury of unknown source\" when: The source of the injury was not witnessed by any person and the source of the injury could not be explained by the client; and The injury raises suspicions of possible abuse or neglect because of the extent of the injury or the location of the injury (e.g., the injury is located in an area not generally vulnerable to trauma) or the number of injuries observed at one particular point in time or the incidence of injuries over time. It is important to note that members of the ICF/IID population are a mobile population and lead active lives. Therefore, they experience normal day-to-day bumps and minor abrasions as they go about their lives. These minor occurrences which are not of serious consequence to the individual and do not present as a suspicious or repetitive injury (as discussed above) should be recorded by the facility staf f once they are aware of them and follow-up should be conducted as indicated. For injuries that do not rise to the level of reportable \"injuries of unknown source\", the facility should follow its policies and procedures for incident recording, investigation, and tracking. The facility must immediately report any suspicious injuries of unknown source and all allegations of mistreatment, neglect or abuse to a client residing in the facility regardless of who is the alleged perpetrator (e.g., facility staf f, parents, legal guardians, volunteer staf f from outside agencies serving the client, neighbors, or other clients, etc.). If state law requires reporting to an agency or entity other than the administrator , the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expects the administrator to be notified as well, in order to ensure facility response to promptly safeguard the client(s). For the purposes of this regulation \"immediately\" means there should be no delay between staf f awareness of the occurrence and reporting to the administrator or other of ficials in accordance with Ch 64, p. 30 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 State law unless the situation is unstable in which case reporting should occur as soon as the safety of all clients is assured. W154 The facility must evidence that all alleged violations ar e thor oughly investigated and Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(3) In the absence of any pre-survey information that would indicate the need for a more thorough review of reports of investigation, review 5 percent of the total client investigations for the last three (3) months (but no less than 10). A thorough investigation includes at a minimum: The collection of all interviews, statements, physical evidence and any pertinent maps, pictures or diagrams; Review of all information; Resolution of any discrepancies; Summary of conclusions; and Recommendations for action both to safeguard all the clients during the investigation and after the completion of the report. If patterns of possible abuse, mistreatment or neglect are identified, or the incident report logs for the past three (3) months indicate an extremely high incident rate, then a full review of the incidents for the past three (3) months should be completed. W155 must pr event further potential abuse while the investigation is in pr ogr ess. Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(3) The facility must take all measures necessary to protect the client, including removal of the staf f from working with the client if indicated. See all investigations must be r eported to the administrator or designated r epr esentative or to other officials in accordance with State law within five working days of the incident and, Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(4) Some states require that allegations of abuse must be reported to the police. A police investigation may take longer than five (5) working days. Their investigation does not change the requirement that the facility must complete an internal investigation report of findings within the five day timeframe. When outside authorities are involved, the facility will still be required to complete their investigation within five days to the extent authorized by such entities. \"W orking days\" means Monday through Friday , excluding state verified, appr opriate corr ective action must be taken. Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(4) The facility is required to ensure that clients residing in the facility are not subjected to physical, verbal, sexual or psychological abuse or punishment. Appropriate corrective action is required for findings of abuse, neglect or mistreatment by other clients residing in the facility , staf f of outside agencies, parents or any other person, and for injuries to clients resulting from controllable environmental factors. If the facility receives allegations of abuse, neglect, or mistreatment of a client during out of facility visits with their family , they must report these allegations to the appropriate state authority for investigation. The facility does not have to conduct an internal investigation regarding the alleged violation. IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 31 Appropriate corrective action is defined as that action which is reasonably likely to prevent the abuse, neglect, mistreatment or injury from recurring. This regulation does not require staf f termination as the only appropriate corrective action. The corrective action imposed by the facility is commensurate with the violation. When a facility is forced to re-hire a staf f person, determined by the facility investigation to have been responsible for abuse, neglect, or mistreatment, the facility continues to be responsible for ensuring the health and safety of the clients, and ensures that those staf f members do not work directly with clients. (a) Standard: Qualified intellectual disability pr ofessional eatment pr ogram must be integrated, coordinated and monitor ed by a qualified intellectual disability pr ofessional who - Guidance \u00a7483.430(a) The position of qualified intellectual disability professional (QIDP) is unique to the ICF/IID program. This position can be central to the overall responsiveness and ef fectiveness of an active treatment program. Whether a supervisory or non-supervisory position, the QIDP is responsible to: Orchestrate all facets of the active treatment ef fort, including the IDT creation of relevant IPPs tailored to meet individual client needs; Ef fectively coordinate internal and external program services and supports to facilitate the acquisition of client skills and adaptive behaviors; and Promote competent interactions of residential staf f with clients in program implementation and behavior management. Breakdowns in the provision of needed services does not automatically equate with deficient practice with QIDP regulations. Non-compliance with QIDP regulations exist where the facility has failed to provide a QIDP or suf ficient numbers of QIDPs to ef fectively perform these required functions or the QIDP(s) has failed to assertively attempt to integrate, coordinate and/or monitor each client' s active treatment program. Elements of integrating, coordinating and monitoring active treatment programs include: Routinely observing clients across settings in program areas to assess ef fectiveness of program implementation and consistency of training ef fort to determine ef fectiveness of IPPs and making timely modifications to facilitate achieving desired skills or goals. Routinely interacting with program staf f across settings to assist in determining the ef fectiveness and continued relevance of program plans in meeting identified client needs. Determining the need for program revision based on client performance. Identifying inconsistencies in training approaches or programs not being implemented as written and facilitating the resolution of these inconsistencies. Assures follow-up occurs for any recommendation for services, equipment or programs so that needed services and supplies are provided in a timely manner to meet the client' s needs. The number of QIDPs will vary depending on such factors as the number of clients the facility serves, the complexity of needs manifested by these clients, the number , qualifications and competencies of additional professional staf f members, and whether or not other duties are assigned to the QIDP function. The QIDP function may not be delegated to other employees even though the QIDP co- signs their work. year of experience working dir ectly with persons with intellectual disability or other developmental disabilities; and Guidance \u00a7483.430(a)(1) \"Experience\" means providing professional or direct services, either paid or volunteer , in a setting that serves persons with intellectual disabilities.

Guidance \u00a7483.430 (b)(1) The ef fectiveness of the active treatment ef fort is dependent on a facility' s assembly of a competent team of professional program staf f, with knowledge of contemporary care practices in intellectual disabilities specific to their field of expertise, that work cooperatively as members of an IDT . The facility is responsible for the acquisition of professional staf f necessary to provide direct and indirect professional services to meet client needs. Professional program services are those services that meet the needs identified by a client' s CF A that must be provided by a member of a vocation founded upon specialized education/training. Professional staf f services also include on-going monitoring of the ef fectiveness of programs and plans developed by professional staf f but implemented by non -professional staf f. Indirect professional staf f services also include on-going, technical support to staf f implementing these programs as well as timely assessment of the need for modification of the program with appropriate communication to the QIDP and IDT . The needs identified in the initial CF A, as required in \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v), should guide the team in deciding if a particular professional' s involvement is necessary and, if so, to what extent professional involvement must continue on a direct or indirect basis. Since such needed professional expertise may fall within the purview of multiple professional disciplines, based on overlapping training and experience, determine if the facility' s delivery of professional services is adequate by the extent to which clients' needs are aggressively and competently addressed. Some examples in which professional expertise may overlap include, but are not limited to: Physical development and health : nurse, dietitian, pharmacist. Nutritional status : nurse, nutritionist or dietitian. Sensorimotor development : educators, recreation therapists, and occupational therapist, physical therapist. Af fective (emotional) development : special educators, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health counselors, rehabilitation counselors, behavior therapists, behavior management specialists, behavior analyst, and medical staf f. Speech and language (communication) development : speech-language pathologists, special educators for people who are deaf or hearing impaired, and medical staf f. Auditory functioning : audiologists (basic or comprehensive audiologic and use of amplification equipment); speech-language pathologists (like audiologists, may perform aural rehabilitation); special educators for clients who are hearing impaired and medical staf f. IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 33 Cognitive development : teachers (if required by law , e.g., school aged children, or if pursuit of GED is indicated), behavior analysts, psychologists, speech-language pathologists. V ocational development : occupational therapists, vocational rehabilitation counselors, or other work specialists (if development of specific vocational skills or work placement is indicated). Social Development : teachers, professional recreation staf f, social workers, behavior analysts, psychologists (specialized training needs for social skill development). Adaptive behaviors or independent living skills : special educators, occupational therapists, behavior analysts, and medical staf f. ectly with clients Guidance \u00a7483.430(b)(1) Examples of professional staf f working directly with clients include: performing professional assessments of clients, provision of direct support and services and periodic monitoring by the professional of the client working on the program. The amount and degree of direct care that professionals must provide will depend on the needs of the client and the ability of other staf f to ef fectively work with clients on a day-to-day basis. For those services that must be provided by a professional due to either law , licensure or registration, the client receives the services directly from the professional. Professionals may deliver services through the supervision and direction of subordinates where provided by law . pr ofessional pr ogram staff who work with clients.

Designing residential activity programs and teaching staf f how to implement them. Conducting classes on discipline specific topics. Answering questions of staf f related to program implementation or specific behavioral management issues. Monitoring active treatment areas to identify program implementation or staf f-client interaction must have available enough qualified pr ofessional staff to carry out and monitor the various pr ofessional interventions in accordance with the stated goals and objectives of every individual pr ogram plan. Guidance \u00a7483.430(b)(2) There should be suf ficient professional staf f in the facility to ensure that: needed assessments by professionals are completed timely; direct professional services are provided when indicated; clients are receiving interventions as specified in the IPP; client outcomes are being monitored by the professional; assessments and outcomes are being communicated to the IDT ; and professional staf f are available to consult with team members when needed.

Guidance \u00a7483.430(b)(3) When a professional does an assessment and determines there are client needs which become incorporated into the IPP , with a current prioritized objective, the professional should actively participate on the IDT . This participation may be through written reports or verbally while attending the IPP meeting or participating via telephone or other electronic means, to provide team members with the opportunity to review and discuss information and recommendations relevant to the client' s needs, and to reach decisions as a team, rather than individually , on how best to address those needs. must participate in on-going staff development and training in both formal and informal settings with other pr ofessional, parapr ofessional, and nonpr ofessional staff members.

Formal training: a specific training done at the time a program is implemented or updated by the professional, with all staf f who works with the client. Informal training: when the professional observes the staf f not correctly implementing a program, the professional provides informal guidance on correct implementation. T raining on programs that apply to multiple clients: when a particular program applies to several clients in a facility , a professional may provide training to several staf f on a particular topic that applies to multiple clients (such as safe transfer techniques).

Even though minimum ratios are defined at \u00a7483.430(d)(3), active treatment may require more staf f than the minimums required ratios, therefore compliance should not be based on staf fing ratios alone. \u00a7483.430(d)(2) Dir ect car e staff ar e defined as the pr esent on-duty staff calculated over all shifts in a 24-hour period for each defined r esidential living unit. Guidance \u00a7483.430(d)(2) \"Direct care staf f\" are those personnel who are assigned to work directly with the clients providing support during activities of daily living and active treatment programs. Ch 64, p. 38 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 Professional staf f who work with clients in a living unit on a periodic basis are not included in direct care staf f ratios. Supervisors of direct care staf f can be counted only if they share in the actual work of the direct care of clients on a continuous basis (e.g. take client assignment). Direct care supervisors whose principle assigned function is to supervise direct care staf f may not be included in direct care staf f ratios although they may occasionally provide direct services to clients. Non-direct care staf f supervisors whose principle assigned function is to supervise non- direct care staf f may not be included in direct care staf f ratios. staff must be pr ovided by the facility in the following minimum ratios of dir ect car e staff to clients: (i) For each defined r esidential living unit serving childr en under the age of 12, sever ely and pr ofoundly r etarded clients, clients with sever e physical disabilities, or clients who ar e aggr essive, assaultive, or security risks, or who manifest sever ely hyperactive or psychotic-like behavior , the staff to client ratio is 1 to 3.2. (ii) For each defined r esidential living unit serving moderately r etarded clients, the staff to client ratio is 1 to 4. (iii) For each defined r esidential living unit serving clients who function within the range of mild r etardation, the staff to client ratio is 1 to 6.4. Guidance \u00a7483.430(d)(3) The minimum ratios in this standar d indicate the minimum number of dir ect-car e staff that must be pr esent and on duty , 24 hours a day , 365 days a year , for each discr ete living unit. For example, to calculate the minimum number of living unit staff that must be pr esent and on duty in a discr ete living unit serving 16 individuals with multiple disabilities: divide the number of individuals \"16,\" by the number corr esponding to the r esult equals \"5.\" Ther efor e, the facility must determine how many staff it must hir e to ensur e that at least 5 staff will be able to be pr esent and on duty during the 24 hour period in which those individuals ar e pr esent. Using the living unit described above, \"calculated over all shifts in a 24-hour period\" means that ther e ar e pr esent and on duty every day of the year: one dir ect car e staff for each eight individuals on the first shift (1:8), one dir ect car e staff for each eight individuals on the second shift (1:8), and one dir ect car e staff for each 16 individuals on the thir d shift (1:16). Ther efor e, ther e ar e five (5) dir ect car e staff pr esent and on duty for each twenty-four hour day , for 16 individuals. The same calculations ar e made for the other ratios, whichever applies. Determine if absences of staff for br eaks and meals r esults in a pattern of pr olonged periods in which pr esent and on-duty staff do not meet the ratios. W188 \u00a7483.420(d)(4) When ther e ar e no clients pr esent in the living unit, a r esponsible staff member must be available by telephone. \u00a7483.430(e) Standard: Staff T raining must pr ovide each employee with initial and continuing training that enables the employee to perform his or her duties effectively , efficiently , and competently . Guidance \u00a7483.430(e)(1) Newly employed staf f receive a supported orientation program (mentor or ongoing supervision) during their early employment. All staf f receive continuing education on such issues as abuse and neglect, handling emer gency situations, behavior management, and treating people with respect and dignity , etc. The primary evidence of an ef fective staf f training program is the observed competent interaction between staf f and clients. \u00a7483.430(e)(2) For employees who work with clients, training must focus on skills and competencies dir ected toward clients' W190 IAC 6/16/21 Inspections receive training in the following areas: developmental programming principles and techniques (e.g. techniques to involve clients in their programs to their highest capability , use of positive reinforcement, use of assistive technology , use of appropriate materials and providing informal opportunities to practice skills); use of adaptive equipment and augmentative communication devices and systems; and ef receive training in the following areas: use of behavioral principles during interactions between staf f and clients; use of accurate procedures regarding abuse detection and prevention, restraints, drugs to manage behaviors, client safety , emer gencies, etc.; use of least restrictive interventions; use of positive behavior intervention programming; and training clients in appropriate replacement behaviors. Staf f receive training in the following areas: signs and symptoms of the client' s changing health (e.g. constipation, urinary tract infections, adverse drug reactions, as indicated); exercise and diet; first aid; infection control; reporting to appropriate healthcare professionals; and for those staf f who can administer medications, how to include clients in their medication administration by recognizing and encouraging the use of applicable skills. W193 Staff must be able to demonstrate the skills and techniques necessary to administer interventions to manage the inappr opriate behavior of clients. Guidance \u00a7483.430(e)(3) Staf f correctly and consistently implement the interventions specified in the behavior plans of clients with whom they are working. Inadequate training is evident when staf f do not correctly implement behavioral programs, use inappropriate management techniques, cannot explain what intervention is to be used and how it is to be implemented. W194 Staff must be able to demonstrate the skills and techniques necessary to implement the individual pr ogram plans for each client for whom they ar e r esponsible. Guidance \u00a7483.430(e)(4) Staf f are observed in various settings during the day correctly and consistently implementing the specific IPPs of the clients with whom they are working. W195 Ch 64, p. 40 Inspections and active tr eatment pr ogram, which includes aggr essive, consistent implementation of a pr ogram of specialized and generic training, tr eatment, health services and r elated services described in this subpart, that is dir ected toward- (i) The acquisition of the behaviors necessary for the client to function with as much self-determination and independence as possible; and (ii) The pr evention or deceleration of r egr ession or loss of curr ent optimal functional status. Active treatment embodies an individually- tailored series of daily life and living experiences that serve as the primary opportunity for the acquisition, development and expression of functional skills and adaptive behaviors necessary for the client to experience optimal independence and promote purposeful \"self-expression\". The uniqueness of each client is a core consideration in the design of active treatment programs. It is expected that individual clients are given the opportunity to provide input into the content of their day-to-day living experiences. An active treatment program includes the following elements as substantiated through observation, interview and record review: a) Each client' s needs and strengths have been accurately assessed and relevant input has been obtained from team members; (Observations and interviews with the client by the surveyor should be consistent with the current assessment information. Interview the QIDP regarding any needs observed but not addressed through assessment/programming by the facility). b) Each client' s IPP is based on assessed needs and strengths, and addresses major life areas such as personal skills, home living skills, community living skills, employment skills, etc., essential to increasing independence and ensuring rights; c) Needs identified as a priority are addressed formally and through activities which are relevant and responsive to client need, interest and choice; d) Active treatment is consistently implemented in all relevant settings both formally and informally as the need arises or opportunities present themselves. It should not be limited to specific periods of time during the day or environments. Each client should receive aggressive and consistent training, treatments and supports in accordance with their needs and IPP . New skills and appropriate behaviors are encouraged and reinforced across environments and times of day . Each client has the adaptive equipment and environmental adaptations necessary for him/her to progress toward heightened independence as recommended and contained in their IPP . Active treatment means taking advantage of opportunities for the practice of new skills and the use of other skills during the normal rhythm of each client' s day . e) Each client' s performance related to IPP objectives is accurately and consistently measured and documented and programs are modified on an ongoing basis based on data and major life changes; and i. Clients with degenerative conditions receive training, treatment and services designed to retain skills and functioning and to prevent further regression to the extent possible. ii. Clients may need adjustments to their active treatment programs as functional or endurance limitations are identified associated with the aging process. In such cases, there may be more of an emphasis on the retention of skills already attained and reducing the rate of loss of skills, than on the acquisition of new skills. In lar ge part, it is this pervasive and continuous reinforcement of \"formal\" training through \"informal\" routine daily living experiences and interactions with staf f and others that makes active treatment programs ef fective. Formal settings are those that are planned and specifically structured for training on objectives and interventions. Informal settings are times that are not anticipated or planned but that of fer the opportunity for training. Active treatment programs mirror normal living experiences such as leisure activities and social conversation at the dinner table. It must be clear that active treatment programs are far more than IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 41 implementation of discreet formal training sessions or programs that are conducted at prescribed times by defined personnel. Learning occurs in the process of the normal rhythm of life and life experiences. W197 eatment does not include services to maintain generally independent clients who ar e able to function with little supervision or in the absence of a continuous active tr eatment pr ogram. Guidance \u00a7483.440(a)(2) All active treatment programs must be based upon assessed developmental needs which are prohibiting the client from living in a more independent setting. Active treatment moves clients to a more independent setting. When a client is in the facility simply for protective oversight and is not in need of training for developmental deficits, this does not constitute active treatment (e.g. a court placement to protect the community or the client from the client' s behavior). Programs that are simply being provided to maintain a client' s independence would not be considered active treatment since the client is not actively being trained to live in a more independent setting. If a client already possesses the skills that enables them to live in a less restrictive environment, and does not require the structure, support and resources that services that only an ICF/IID can provide, they can be considered generally independent. For example, a client is admitted to the ICF/IID for the primary purpose of competency determination for a court hearing. This client lived independently prior to admission. The active treatment programs they are receiving are focused on maintaining that independence and do not address specific developmental deficits that inhibit independent living. This would not be considered active treatment. (b) Standard: Admissions, transfers, and discharge Clients who ar e admitted by the facility must be in need of and r eceiving active tr eatment services. Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(1) All client admissions must be based upon assessed developmental deficits which are prohibiting the client from living in a more independent setting and which require those intensive specialized supports, services, and supervision that only an ICF/IID can provide. The individual components of the provision of active treatment include CF A, IPP , program implementation, program documentation, and program monitoring and change. When any of these individual components of active treatment are not in place, resulting in the clients not receiving active treatment, this regulation this not met. W199 must be based on a pr eliminary evaluation of the client that is conducted or updated by the facility or by outside sour ces. Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(2) Preliminary evaluations should support the need for an admission to an ICF/IID (e.g., deficits in functional skills or adaptive behaviors). The information from the preliminary evaluation must be used by the facility to make an admission decision. Occasionally , emer gency admissions of clients may occur without benefit of a preliminary evaluation having been conducted prior to admission . When situational emer gencies necessitate admission before a preliminary evaluation can be conducted, or when pre-admission information is incomplete, the completion of the preliminary admission evaluation within seven (7) calendar days after admission will satisfy compliance with this requirement. W200 \u00a7483.440(b)(3) A pr eliminary evaluation must contain backgr ound information as well as curr ently valid assessments of functional developmental, behavioral, social, health and nutritional status to determine if the facility can pr ovide for the client' s needs and if the client is likely to benefit fr om placement in the facility . Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(3) The preliminary evaluation contains specific information useful to determine if the facility can meet the client' s needs and if the client can benefit from placement. The facility makes every reasonable ef fort to gather all available data to assist in their determination. Background information would include information that gives insight into the clients' previous living environments and programming ef forts. The assessment must include a consideration as to whether reasonable accommodation as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act would enable the client to benefit from placement in facility . \u00a7483.440(b)(4) If a client is to be either transferr ed or discharged, the facility must - s r ecord that the client was transferr ed or discharged for good cause; and Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(4)(i) T ransfer or dischar ge occurs only when the facility cannot meet the client' s needs, the client no longer requires an active treatment program in an ICF/IID setting; the individual/guardian chooses to reside elsewhere, or when a determination is made that another level of service or living situation would be more beneficial to the client. \"T ransfer\" means the temporary movement of a client to another facility (e.g. another ICF/IID, psychiatric hospital, medical hospital) with the intention of return to the original site. \"Dischar ge\" means the permanent movement of a client to another facility or setting which operates independently from the ICF/IID (e.g. the facility is not under the jurisdiction of the facility' s governing body). Documentation includes evidence of an assessment that evaluated the pros and cons of the transfer or dischar ge and the rationale for the final decision. time to pr epar e the client and his or her par ents or guardian for the transfer or discharge (except in emergencies). Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(4)(ii) The client and their family or the client and their legal guardian are involved in planning for any transfer or dischar ge and receive the services necessary to assist in preparing for movement, unless an emer gency (medical) situation prevents that involvement. If the client has an advocate, the advocate should participate in the decision-making process. Orderly , planned transfers and dischar ges usually take place over an extended period of time. The IPP should reflect objectives or interventions which prepare the client for transfer or dischar ge. T ransfers or dischar ges executed on short timeframes (e.g. less than 30 days) without \"good cause\" would not comply with the \"reasonable\" intent of the regulations. \"Reasonable\" time is the time required to provide clients and their families with planned steps and established timeframes to facilitate the successful transition. T ime frames are modified based on client needs and emer gent situations. Preparation of the client for transfer may include orientation or trial visits to the new location. Staf f should take steps to minimize potential anxiety or any behavioral reactions which could result from the client' s transfer . \u00a7483.440(b)(5) At the time of the discharge, the 64, p. 43 \u00a7483.440(b)(5)(i) Develop a final summary of the client' s developmental, behavioral, social, health and nutritional status Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(5)(i) The final summary should be useful for continued services in the client' s new setting. The final dischar ge summary should be entered into the client' s record, provide a summary of the client' s course of stay in the ICF/IID, provide a final summary of the client' s developmental, behavioral, social, health and nutritional status, and include the current status of the objectives listed in the client' s IPP .

Sharing the dischar ge summary with State Agencies as applicable is determined by state requirements. W205 plan of car e that will assist the client to adjust to the new living envir onment. Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(5)(ii) The post dischar ge plan of care is a component of the dischar ge summary . The facility utilizes the information from the dischar ge summary to prepare the dischar ge plan of care. The post-dischar ge plan of care identifies the essential supports and services necessary for the client to successfully adjust to the new living environment and describe necessary coordination of services. It should incorporate the client' s preferences. It should identify specific client needs after dischar ge such as personal care, physical therapy , client/caregiver education needs, and the ability of the client or caregiver to meet those needs after dischar ge. (c) Standard: Individual pr must an individual pr ogram plan developed by an interdisciplinary team that r epr esents the pr ofessions, disciplines or service ar eas that ar e r elevant to- - i) Identifying the client' s needs, as described by the compr ehensive functional assessments r equir ed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and ii) Designing pr ograms that meet the client' s needs. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(1) If a need is identified in the CF A, the professional associated with that need will conduct an initial evaluation for the development of the IPP . The needs identified in the CF A determine the professional, paraprofessional, direct support staf f, disciplines or service areas that must participate in the development of the IPP . in interdisciplinary team meetings. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(2) While there is no correct number of individuals that comprise the IDT , the team should include appropriate facility staf f (professional and paraprofessional staf f), that are responsible for designing, developing, and/or implementing the client' s IPP and direct support staf f who work closely with the clients. Ch 64, p. 44 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 For any prioritized objective, the paraprofessional or professional personnel responsible for the development and monitoring of that program should participate on the team, either through actual attendance or written or verbal input. Members of the IDT may change as the assessed needs of the client change (e.g. medical issues, nutritional issues, communication needs, fine motor skill needs, gross motor skill needs, social issues or behavioral concerns). W208 Participation other agencies serving the client is encouraged. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(2) The facility must make every ef fort to coordinate the Individual Education Plan (IEP) from the school or the client' s program plan from outside program, work site or workshop with the IPP . This may result in a single document, but there is no requirement for a single combined document. There must be evidence that all applicable plans were coordinated (evidence of discussion across the plans and observation would confirm integration of the IPP across the various settings). The QIDP is responsible for the coordination of the plans. The facility should communicate changes in the IPP or in the clients' life situation with teachers and workplace representatives either directly or through written communication. W209 Participation by the client, his or her par ent (if the client is a minor), or the client' s legal guardian is r equir ed unless the participation is unobtainable or inappr opriate. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(2) The facility should make every ef fort to schedule team meetings at a time that enables the client parent or legal guardian, to attend without having to forfeit work time or pay . The facility should make every ef fort to schedule team meetings at a time that enables the client parent or legal guardian, to attend without having to forfeit work time or pay . It is expected that the client will routinely attend team meetings unless their participation is unobtainable. Examples of when client participation is not available include, but are not limited to: 1) the client is away from the facility for medical reasons or hospitalization; or 2) although the facility has documented repeated attempts to engage the client, the client refuses to participate. If families/legal guardians are unable to attend a program planning meeting, the facility provides them information regarding the meeting outcome and gives them an opportunity to discuss the plan with the facility staf f. \"Unobtainable\", for the purposes of this guideline, means that the facility has made a good faith ef fort to seek parental or legal guardian participation in the process, even though the ef fort may ultimately be unsuccessful (for example, the parent may be impossible to locate or may prove unwilling or unable to participate). \"Inappropriate\", for the purposes of this guideline, means that the parent or legal guardian' s behavior is so disruptive or uncooperative that others cannot ef fectively participate; the client does not wish his or her parent to participate, and the client is competent to make this decision; or there is strong and documented evidence that the parent or legal guardian is not acting on the client' s behalf or in the client' s best interest. In the case of the latter , determine what the facility has done to bring ef fective resolution to the problem. Instances when it is not appropriate for the client, parent or legal guardian, to attend the team discussion are rare. If the client does not attend the meeting, the facility must document the reason for his/her non-participation. There may also be instances where a parent or legal guardian is considered unobtainable for a team meeting, such as being out of the country . In these instances, the parent or legal guardian should still be notified of the meeting, provided with information concerning the outcome of the meeting and documentation in the client record should describe why the parent or legal guardian could not attend and what information was provided to them. IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 45 If the client is an adult who is competent to make decisions and who is not adjudicated, parents may not participate in the process if their participation is opposed by the client. In the event that a non-adjudicated adult chooses not to have their family involved in the active treatment process, the surveyor should see evidence in the record of ef forts made by the facility to understand why the client has declined family participation. If the client continues to decline family involvement after the facility has held discussions with him/her about the importance of this issue, the facility should honor the wishes of the client. In general, the more involvement and communication among the team members, the client and the parent or legal guardian the more likely the plan will be successful. The facility goal should be to routinely include these parties unless rare circumstances exist. W210 after admission, the interdisciplinary team must perform accurate assessments or r eassessments as needed to supplement the pr eliminary evaluation conducted prior to admission. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3) For new admissions, the CF A is completed within 30 days after admission and is utilized as the basis for the IPP . New , revised or updated assessments completed within the first 30 days of admission, accurately identify the functional abilities of the client. \"Accurate\" assessments refer to assessment data that are current, relevant and valid, and the skills, abilities, and training needs identified by the assessment correspond to the client' s actual, observed status. Assessments must be administered with appropriate adaptations such as specialized equipment, use of an interpreter , use of manual communication and tests designed to measure performance in the presence of visual disability . The content of or format of the assessments or the particular assessment tools which are to be used for the CF A are not specified. Assessments must include identification of those functional life skills in which the client needs to be more independent and those services needed for the client to become more community integrated. W21 1 must take into consideration the client' s age (for example, child, young adult, elderly person) and the implications for active tr eatment at each stage, as applicable, and must - Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3) During assessment, the client is given opportunities to participate in age-appropriate activities to assess the person' s functioning in those activities or settings. For example, the use of baby toys during the assessment of an adult would not be appropriate. W212 disabilities and wher e possible, their causes; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(i) The CF A includes: all diagnoses and developmental deficits for the client; the supporting information for each; and each evaluation should include conclusions and recommendations which go into the development of an active treatment program for the client. W213 Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(ii) Ch 64, p. 46 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 The client' s identified developmental strengths, preferences, methods of coping/compensation, community use and awareness, friendships and positive attributes and capabilities are clearly described in functional terms in the assessments. Identified strengths are consistent with the client' s observed functional status. and behavioral management needs; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(iii) The CF A must address and identify those skill deficits/needed supports that may be amenable to training, those that must be treated by therapy and/or provision of assistive technology , and those that require adapting the environment and/or providing personal support. Assessment of needed supports should be done within the context of the client' s age, gender , and culture. \"Behavioral management needs\" include those behaviors that interfere with progress, prevent assimilation into the community , decrease freedom or increase the need for restriction of activities (e.g. spitting, pica, self-injurious behavior , aggressive behavior toward others or self-injurious behavior). A functional behavioral assessment is a problem-solving process for evaluating client inappropriate behavior . It relies on a variety of techniques and strategies to identify the purpose of the specific behavior(s) and to help the IDT select interventions to directly address the behavior(s). A functional behavior assessment looks beyond the behavior itself. The focus when conducting a functional behavioral assessment is on identifying significant client-specific social, af fective, cognitive, and/or environmental factors associated with the occurrence (and non-occurrence) of specific behaviors. The CF A must identify the specific accommodations that address the client' s needs to ensure better opportunity for the client' s success. The identified accommodations may be assistive technology which can help a person learn, play , complete tasks, get around, communicate, hear or see better , control their own environment and take care of their personal needs (e.g. door levers instead of knobs, plate switches, audio books, etc.). needs for services without r egard to the actual availability of the services needed; and Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(iv) Identification of needed services is based on the CF A. In the presence of significant developmental deficits, it is not acceptable for the facility to say that a particular professional therapy or treatment is not needed or not available if the CF A identifies a deficit. The assessment must identify the course of specific interventions recommended to meet the client' s needs, both through direct professional services and non-professional services. For example, a client' s communication skill development may not require the intensive services of a speech-language pathologist however , the direct care staf f will need to work with the client and use a pre-determined communication system. \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Include Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) The CF A should include an assessment of each of the areas listed below . Assessments should include specific information about the person' s ability to function in dif ferent environments, specific skills or lack of skills, and how function can be improved, either through training, environmental adaptations, or provision of adaptive, assistive, supportive, orthotic, or prosthetic equipment. If assessments are done separately by professional disciplines, there should be evidence that the assessments are brought together in an interdisciplinary approach to address the client' s various developmental areas. The CF A must be completed upon admission and annually as indicated. While the assessment may not have the specific titles of the areas listed below , the surveyor must be able to identify information within assessments from each of the areas below . W216 IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] and health, Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Physical development and health : This portion of the CF A includes the client' s developmental history , results of the physical examination conducted by a licensed physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner , health assessment data (including a medication and immunization history); a review and summary of all laboratory reports since the last comprehensive evaluation, a summary of all required medical interventions since the last CF A; skills of the client normally associated with the monitoring and supervision of one' s own health status, and administration and/or scheduling of one' s own medical treatments. Reports of all specialist consultations should be included in the assessment as indicated by physical examination results. IDT reviews any current advanced directives that the client may have in place as part of the CF A. W217 Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Nutritional status : Nutritional status includes height and weight, the client' s eating habits and preferences, favorite foods, determination of appropriateness of diet, adequacy of total food intake, bowel habits, means through which the client receives nutrition (e.g. feeding tube) and the skills associated with eating (including chewing, sucking and swallowing disorders). W218 : Sensorimotor development includes the development of perceptual skills that are involved in observing the environment and making sense of it. Identified sensory deficits should be evaluated in conjunction with the impact they will have on the client' s life. A sensory deficit in eye contact may not have a detrimental ef fect on the client' s life if it will not hold the client back from further accomplishments or skill acquisitions. Motor development includes those behaviors that primarily involve: muscular , neuromuscular , or physical skills and varying degrees of physical dexterity . Because sensory and motor development are intimately related and because activities in these areas are functionally inseparable, attention to these two aspects of bodily activity is often combined in the concept of sensorimotor development. For those motor areas that are identified by the assessment as limited, the assessment should specify the extent to which corrective, orthotic, prosthetic, or support devices would impact on functional status and the extent of time the device is to be used throughout the day . : Af fective or emotional development includes the development of behaviors that relate to one' s interests, attitudes, values, morals, emotional feelings and emotional expressions. W220 language development Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Speech and language (communication) development : One of the most contributable causes of behaviors, frustration by the clients, etc. is lack of ef fective communication. It is imperative that the CF A identifies how the client communicates, what barriers are present, what services are available and what programs and services will be provided to assist the client to go out into and participate fully in the world. Observed client communication skills match the evaluation results and that training programs are in place to address needs. Ch 64, p. 48 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 Communication development refers to the development of both verbal and nonverbal and receptive and expressive communication skills. Assessment data identify the appropriate intervention strategy to be applied, and which, if any , augmentative or assistive devices will improve communication and functional status. These intervention strategies should provide the client with a viable means of communication which is appropriate to their sensory , cognitive and physical abilities. functioning : Auditory functioning refers to the extent to which a person can hear , to the maximum use of residual hearing if a hearing loss exists, and whether or not the client will benefit from the use of amplification, including a hearing aid or a program of Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Cognitive development : Cognitive development refers to the development of those processes by which information received by the senses is stored, recovered, and used. It includes the development of the processes and abilities involved in memory , reasoning and problem solving. It is also the identification of dif ferent learning styles the client has and those best used by the trainers. It is critical that the CF A address the individual learning style of the client in order to best direct the way the trainers will teach formal and informal programs. W223 Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Social Development : Social development refers to the formation of those self-help, recreation and leisure, and interpersonal skills that enable a client to establish and maintain appropriate roles and fulfilling relationships with others. Assessments may address family supports and relationships, sexual awareness and sexuality , friendships, social awareness, social skills and social interests. adaptive behaviors or independent living skills necessary for the client to be able to function in the community , Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Adaptive behaviors or independent living skills : Adaptive behavior refers to the ef fectiveness or degree with which clients meet the standards of personal independence and social responsibility and community orientation and integration expected of their age and cultural group. Adaptive behaviors are those behaviors that are developed to cope with deficits in order to be able to perform every day skills as independently as possible. Independent living skills include, but are not limited to, such things as food shopping, meal preparation, housekeeping and kitchen chores, laundry , bed making, and budgeting. Assessment may be performed by anyone trained to do so. Standardized tests are not required. Standardized adaptive behavior scales which identify all or predominantly all \"developmental needs\" are not suf ficient to meet this requirement, but can serve as a basis for screening. W225 V ocational development, \"as applicable\" : V ocational development refers to work interests, work skills, work attitudes, work-related behaviors, and present and future employment options. The determination of whether or not a vocational assessment is \"applicable\" is typically based on age (adolescents or adults more than likely require this type of assessment). The vocational assessment for each client may address IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 49 job sampling, job development, on-site job training and long term follow-up, as appropriate to the client and determined by the IDT . V ocational assessments should describe, for all domains, what clients can and cannot do in terms of skills needed within the context of their daily lives and jobs. Assessments should be individualized and based on: Actual performance of the client against objective criteria; Reports by staf f/parents/legal guardians; and Observed performance in a variety of settings. W226 \u00a7483.440(c)(4) W ithin 30 days after admission, the interdisciplinary team must pr epar e for each client an individual pr ogram the specific objectives necessary to meet the client' s needs, as identified by the compr ehensive assessment r equir ed by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4) Objectives are developed for those needs that are identified by the CF A and which are considered to be most likely to improve the client' s ability to independently function in his/her daily life, as determined by the IDT . There is a clear link between the specific objectives and the functional assessment data and recommendations. Objectives are developed for those needs that are observed to most likely impact the client' s ability to function in daily life. T raining objectives should be developed to address client needs rather than staf f oriented objectives. Clients are expected to have training objectives in the areas of activities of daily living, based on the client' s assessed needs and as prioritized by the IDT . If clients have eyeglasses, dentures and/or other assistive devices it is expected that the team considers objectives, based upon the assessment of client needs, addressing the care and use of such devices. However , in the area of programs to teach the clients' money management it is not expected that every client will automatically have a formal training objective to participate in such a program. The decision to prioritize such a program and to what level the program is developed is decided by the IDT based upon the results of the CF A and in consideration of such factors as, transferable skills, the ability to make choices, the ability to identify preferences and cognitive abilities such as attention span and an understanding of the principle of cause and ef fect. Similarly , the decision to prioritize and develop a training objective for a client to participate in a self-administration program for medications must be made by the IDT and be based upon information from the CF A. Formal self administration programs should not be confused with informal ef forts to include the client in the administration process such as allowing them to hold a glass of water , identify the box where his/her medications are stored or put a pill into their own mouth themselves under the supervision of a person who is qualified to administer medications. W228 and planned sequence for dealing with those objectives. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4) The objectives identified in W227 are or ganized in a logical sequence, determined by the team that will assist the client toward the attainment of skills resulting in greater self- choice, independence, and community integration. The logical sequencing of objectives means there is a completion of one objective that serves as the building block for the next with relevance to the client' s functional status. Where objectives are logically ordered but do not have relevance to the client' s functional status, refer to 483.440(c)(4). If the IPP is or ganized in a logical sequence, this requirement is met. For example, if the long term goal is to travel independently in the community , the objective sequencing may involve training the client to Ch 64, p. 50 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 recognize traf fic signs, cross the street safely , and to obtain help when needed if lost or an emer gency arises. These objectives must terms of a single behavioral outcome; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(i) Each objective clearly states one expected learning result. \"Single\" behavioral outcome means that there is a separate objective assigned for each discrete behavior that the team intends the client to learn. For example, \"Mary will bake a cake and clean the oven\" are two separate behaviors and, therefore, should be stated in two separate objectives. Completion of the morning hygiene routine includes programs for performance of face washing, tooth brushing and hair combing which are three separate objectives; however , the behavioral outcome for each would be the same (e.g. completion of the morning hygiene routine). W230 Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(ii) Completion dates are based on the client' s rate of learning. Completion dates are assigned to each objective on which the client is currently working. Completion dates are individualized (e.g. not all the same for all clients and all objectives). The \"projected date of completion\" for an IPP objective is not the same as a \"review\" date. For each objective assigned a priority , the team should assign a projected date (month and year) by which it believes the client will have learned the new skill, based on all of the assessment data. This date triggers the team to evaluate continuously whether or not the client' s progress or learning curve is suf ficient to warrant a revision to the training program. pr ovide measurable indices of performance; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(iii) The desired learning outcome is stated in a manner which enables all staf f working with the client to consistently identify the tar get behavior and to clearly identify when it is being displayed. The objective is stated in a manner which permits it to be measured with quantifiable data. \"Behavioral\" terms include only those behaviors which are \"client\" rather than staf f oriented and those that any person would agree can be seen or heard. Determine if all staf f who work with the client can define the exact same outcome on which to measure the client' s performance. \"Measurable indices of performance\" are the quantifiable criteria to use in determining successful achievement of the objective. Quantifiable criteria include various measurements of intensity and duration. For example, \"Client X will walk ten feet, with the use of her tripod walker , on each of five (5) consecutive ession appr opriate to the individual; and Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(iv) Objectives must be relevant to the client' s current skill sets and abilities as identified in the CF A. The ICF/IID must consider the person' s current functional abilities and project what steps, methods, and strategies are likely to be ef fective in achieving the and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 51 Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(v) Priorities are established based on the needs and in consideration of the desires of the client and emphasize the development of greater independence, self-choice, and community integration. The team determines which objectives are the highest priority to be addressed, either because the client has an immediate need or the priority objectives must be accomplished before other priorities are addressed. \u00a7483.440(c)(5) Each written training pr ogram designed to implement the objectives in the individual pr ogram plan must specify: Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5) The following regulations (5) (i-iv) apply to formal training programs developed for current implementation. used; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(i) The training program provides clear directions to any staf f person working with the client on how to implement the teaching strategies. T o comply with this requirement the methodologies must be written in a clear enough manner that a substitute staf f person will be able to read the methodologies and implement them without substantial dif ferences from a regularly assigned staf f person. Methodologies should be consistent across settings, such as when the client is in the day program. W235 of the method; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(ii) Active treatment (the implementation of training programs pursuant to objectives) should be provided in formal and informal settings throughout the rhythm of the client' s day . While there may be structured episodes when the client works intensively and singularly on one or more objectives (schedule), the provision of active treatment is not adequate when confined solely to these types of formal settings but should be incorporated into all activities when appropriate (client' s routine). For example, objectives on grasping may be as ef fectively carried out during the client' s use of a toothbrush and a spoon as in an isolated session. W236 the pr ogram; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(v) The IPP should include the actual name of the staf f person who is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the client' s program to ensure it is being implemented appropriately , as well as the designated position which will implement the program. The QIDP should be familiar with the assessment and recording requirements for each client for each formal objective, including who is responsible for making these observations and completing the recording, and demonstrate a familiarity with the current data recorded for each client. W237 and fr equency of data collection necessary to be able to assess pr ogr ess toward the desir ed objectives; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(iv) The IDT must determine the type of data necessary to judge a client' s progress on an objective, and describe the data collection method in the written training program. The facility determines what data to collect, but whatever system is chosen for collection must yield accurate measurement of the criteria stated in the client' s IPP objectives. For example, if the criteria in the client' s IPP objective specified a behavior to be measured by \"accuracy ,\" or \"successes out of opportunities,\" then it would not be acceptable for the prescribed data collection method to record \"level of prompt\". Ch 64, p. 52 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 Examples of a few data collection systems include, but are not limited to: level of prompt; successful trials completed out of opportunities given; frequency counts; and frequency sampling. The IDT must consider and select the type and frequency of data collection for each objective based upon the need to measure appropriately the client' s performance toward the tar geted IPP skill development. The facility should collect data with enough frequency and content to be able to appropriately measure the client' s performance toward the tar geted IPP skill development. The frequency of data collection may vary with the objective but must be made at suf ficient intervals to allow analysis of the progress of the client. W238 behavior(s), if applicable; and Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(v) Any specific behaviors which would interfere with the client' s ability to function in, or benefit from the training program are identified (e.g. a fear of water could interfere with the client' s bathing program). r eplacement of inappr opriate behavior , if applicable, with behavior that is adaptive or appr opriate. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(vi) The training program provides specific information as to how to elicit or strengthen appropriate behavior and what behaviors to teach reinforce or encourage which would reduce or replace the inappropriate behavior . If a client is exhibiting an inappropriate behavior , the CF A should discover why the behavior is occurring and the team should develop associated training objectives to help the client develop more appropriate behaviors. The objective for decelerating tar geted inappropriate behaviors is not solely the reduction of these behaviors. The objective should also include the positive functional replacement behavior (adaptive behavior). A replacement behavior allows a client to substitute an unconstructive or disruptive behavior with something more constructive and functionally equivalent. For example, instead of throwing work materials as a way to get a break from vocational task demands, teach the client to say or sign for 'break'. \u00a7483.440(c)(6) The individual pr ogram to support the individual toward independence. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(i) Appropriate materials, adaptations and modifications to equipment and the environment are available in order to promote and support individual training programs. Examples may include, but are not limited, to built-up toilet seats, adaptive eating utensils, extended reach devices, and modification to the facility van to accommodate a wheelchair . The IPP describes supports and services, in addition to the individual goals and objectives that will be provided by the facility to assist the client to function with greater independence. W241 e pr ogram strategy information (which must be accessible to any person r esponsible for implementation) can be found. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(ii) IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 53 This requirement refers to the training program plans, objectives, descriptions of staf f interventions and data collection tools which must be readily accessible to any staf f in order for the programs to be consistently and ef fectively carried out and data Include, for those clients who lack them, training in personal skills essential for privacy and independence (including, but not limited to, toilet training, personal hygiene, dental hygiene, self-feeding, bathing, dr essing, gr ooming, and communication of basic needs), until it has been demonstrated that the client is developmentally incapable of acquiring them. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(iii) All clients who lack the skills listed within this standard have associated training programs developed to meet their needs according to prioritization. These programs are consistently implemented in both formal and informal settings. \"Developmentally incapable\" is a decision made by the IDT that means a client does not have the capacity to acquire certain skill sets. The decision must be based on an assessment of the client' s strengths, needs, and functional limitations. The determination of developmental incapability must be accompanied by written evidence supporting this determination. Such evidence may include training programs which failed after many dif ferent strategies were tried, or physical limitations that preclude the acquisition of the skill. Examples are: 1) Eye contact program was attempted using seven dif ferent methods over a two year period; 2) An client has two frozen elbow joints which do not allow her to get her hands to her mouth and consequently she will not be trained on any hand to mouth skills; and 3) Some clients may have insuf ficient neuromuscular and sensory control to ever be totally independent in toileting skills. T oilet scheduling alone without any plan to progress would not be considered a toilet training program. The components of functional skills \"training\" as used in this regulation means aggressive implementation of a systematic program of formal and informal techniques, which are: tar geted toward assisting the client achieving the measurable behavioral level of skill competency specified in IPP objectives; implemented at natural occurrences of activity and training programs; ( e.g.: an objective for a client to increase grasping may be implemented as easily in the workshop with a built up tool as in the bathroom with a toothbrush); conducted by all personnel involved with the client including those outside the home such as in day programs; and carried out in conversation and interaction with the client appropriate to the situation. \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(iv) Identify mechanical supports, if needed, to achieve pr oper body position, balance, or alignment. The plan must specify Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(iv) The use of mechanical supports are based upon an individual assessment and fitting. Mechanical devices are used to support a client' s proper body position or alignment and may be essential to prevent contractures or deformities. However , mechanical supports restrict movement and the client should be released from the support periodically for exercise and free movement. Mechanical supports may not be used as a substitute for programs or therapy . For example, the use of a bolster to position a client upright in a sitting position without any indication there has been an assessment for the need for muscle re-training may be an indication of a mechanical device in lieu of programming. Some supports allow movement and provide opportunity for more increased functioning. Some examples of devices used as mechanical supports include splints, wedges, bolsters, lap trays, etc. Wheelchairs are not generally used to position or align the body and would not alone constitute a mechanical support. However , adaptations to a wheelchair which facilitate correct body alignment by inhibiting reflexive, involuntary motor activity are mechanical supports and should be included in the plan for the client. Ch 64, p. 54 Inspections and Appeals[481] that clients who have multiple disabling conditions spend a major portion of each waking day out of bed and outside the bedr oom ar ea, moving about by various methods and devices whenever possible. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(v) Clients with sensory or physical dif ficulties should be given the same opportunities to move around in their environments as clients who do not have those dif ficulties. Even clients who use specialized wheelchairs should be given the opportunity to utilize other devices such as walkers, wagons and scooters to move about and/or change their positions. W ith the exception of those clients who are acutely ill (such as those who are hospitalized or incapacitated by a \"short term\" illness), all clients should be out of bed and outside their bedroom area as long as possible each day , and in proper body alignment at all times. This is a necessity in order to prevent regression, contractures, and deformities and to provide sensory stimulation. Bed rest is a temporary situation associated most usually with a medical condition and must be ordered by the medical staf f of the facility . The term implies that the client will remain in his/her bed for most of any 24-hour period. Although active treatment programs may be carried out to some extent while the client is on bed rest, the client' s program cannot be completed in its entirety . While there may be situations where continuous bed rest may be necessary , these situations are rare. For those rare instances where out-of-bed activity is a threat to a client' s health and safety (e.g., blood clot in the leg), active treatment adapted to the medical capacity of the client must be continued. W247 and self-management. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(vi) Choice and self-management are integral components of becoming independent. Clients should be given opportunities for choice and self-management in both formal and informal settings through the IPP process, leisure activities, and other life choices. The ICF/IID must incorporate opportunities into daily life experiences that promote choice making and decision making by clients. Examples of some activities leading toward responsibility for one' s own self-management include, but are not limited to: 1) choosing housing or roommates; 2) choosing clothing to purchase or wear; 3) choosing what, where, and how to eat (e.g., the use of family style dining, access to condiments and second helpings). Choices can be made by all clients. The type of choices the person makes may vary from simple to complex, dependent upon client abilities. Clients are provided opportunities for choice and self-management and the facility does not limit choices by making decisions for the people being served without their input. Clients are provided the opportunity to demonstrate skills to the degree they are capable and only assisted by staf f as indicated in their IPP . A lack of facility staf fing or staf f convenience must not result in a limitation of choices of self-management for the clients. W248 IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] of each client' s individual plan must be made available to all r elevant staff, including staff of other agencies who work with the client, and to the client, par ents (if the client is a minor) or legal guardian. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(7) The client or legal representative, as well as the facility staf f, and staf f from outside agencies, with appropriate consent, have, or can access, a copy of the IPP . (d) Standard: Pr team has formulated a client' s individual pr ogram plan, each client must r eceive a continuous active tr eatment pr ogram consisting of needed interventions and services in sufficient number and fr equency to support the achievement of the objectives identified in the individual pr ogram plan. Guidance \u00a7483.440(d)(1) There should be no delay in the development and implementation of the IPP . T o promote a team process and meaningful discussion, IPP development should take place during IDT meetings. Any IPP objective or modification that is critical to the health and safety of any client should be implemented immediately following IDT discussion.\" Each individual receives training and services consistent with the current IPP . The time period between admission and the 30 day IDT meeting is primarily to assist the client to become adjusted and acclimated to his or her new living environment and to enable the facility to complete the CF A. During this time period the facility should also be providing those services and activities determined during the pre-admission assessment as essential to the client' s daily functioning. The active treatment program for the client is consistently implemented in all relevant settings both formally and informally as opportunities present themselves. It should not be limited to specific periods of time during the day or specific environments. Each client should receive aggressive and continuous training, treatments and supports in accordance with their needs and IPP . New skills and appropriate behaviors are encouraged and reinforced across environments and times of day . During observations confirm that the client activities relate directly to the strengths, needs and objectives in the IPP for each client and are not \"busy work,\" generalized or non-developmental time fillers. For example, screwing nuts on bolts and then unscrewing them repeatedly with no goal or transferable skills is \"busy work.\" Screwing nuts on bolts that will be part of a product is functional reinforcement of skill acquisition. Clients use adaptive equipment, assistive devices, environmental supports, materials, supplies, etc., as specified in each client' s IPP to assist the client to accomplish stated objectives. There is no specific number or frequency of interventions that meets this requirement. The surveyors should see that the facility capitalizes on all opportunities throughout the course of the day that promote progress toward the achievement of goals and objectives. Informal opportunities (\"teachable moments\") should be utilized to reinforce learning or appropriate skill development and needs are addressed as they present. Although a client may not be able to reach complete independence in a functional skill, it is crucial that retention of their current skills be supported. Clients may have defined periods of time where they may engage in leisure activities of their choice which are not necessarily directly associated with their IPP goals and objectives.

The purpose of the committee is to assure that each client' s rights are protected utilizing a group of both internal staf f and external participants who have no vested inter est in the facility as well as clients as appr opriate . There should be evidence that the committee members have been trained annually on the rights of the clients, what constitutes a restriction of a right and the dif ference between punishment and training. Depending on size, complexity and available resources, the ICF/IID may establish more than one specially constituted committee. However , each committee must contain the required membership and participate regularly and perform the functions of the committee according to the requirements. Participation on the specially constituted committee(s) must be in real time allowing all membership to speak and discuss in an interactive mode. The regulation does not specify the professional credentials of the \"qualified persons\" (who have either experience or training in contemporary practices to change inappropriate client behavior). There is no requirement that any specific discipline, such as nurse, physician or pharmacist be a member of the committee. The intent of including \"persons with no ownership or controlling interest\" on the committee is to assure that, in addition to having no financial interest in the facility , at least one member of each constituted committee is an impartial outsider in that he/she would not have an \"interest\" represented by any other of the required members or the facility itself. Staf f and consultants employed by the facility or at another facility under the same governing body , cannot fulfill the role of person with no ownership or controlling interest. Although occasional absences from committee meetings are understandable, patterns of absence by the required membership of the committee is not acceptable. At least a quorum of committee members (as defined by the facility) must review , approve and monitor the programs which involve risk to client rights and protections and that quorum must include one person from each of the required categories. W262 pr ograms designed to manage inappr opriate behavior and other pr ograms that, in the opinion of the committee, involve risks to client pr otection and rights; Guidance \u00a7483.440(f)(3)(i) Any program that utilizes restrictive or intrusive techniques must be reviewed and approved by the specially constituted committee prior to implementation. This includes, but is not limited to: restraints; drugs to manage behavior; restrictions on community access; contingent denial of any right; or restrictions of materials or locations in the home. The committee should ensure that consequences within a written behavior management program do not violate the client' s rights. There is no requirement for the committee to evaluate whether the proposed program is consistent with current practices in the field. Documentation should verify that the specially constituted committee considered factors, such as whether less intrusive methods have been attempted, whether the severity of behavior outweighs the risks of the proposed program and whether replacement behaviors are included within the plan. Any revision to a behavior plan that increases the level of intrusiveness must be re- reviewed by the specially constituted committee. The committee need not reapprove a program when revisions are made in accordance with the approved plan. For example, if the physician changes the dosage of a medication in accordance with the drug treatment component of the active treatment plan to which the legally authorized person has given consent and which has already been approved by the committee, then there is no need for the committee or the legally authorized person to reapprove the plan. Generally , this would also apply if the medication was changed to another within the same therapeutic class or family .

In the event of an emer gency , the facility may obtain a verbal consent, which must be authenticated in writing as soon as possible and subsequently submitted to the committee as verification. The consent is required for the entire behavior management program not just the specific restrictive technique. Consent is informed when the person giving consent is fully aware of the: specific treatment; reason for treatment or procedure;; the attendant risks vs. benefits; alternatives; right to refuse; and the consequences associated with consent or refusal of the program. Informed consent must be in writing and must be specific to the program and restrictive practice and reflect a specific time frame. Blanket consents are not allowed. In the case of unplanned events such as assault and property destruction requiring immediate action, verbal consent may be obtained. However , it should be authenticated in writing as soon as reasonably possible (within 30 days). For clients up to the age of 18, their parent or legally appointed guardian must give consent for him or her . At the age of 18, however , clients become adults and are assumed to be competent unless otherwise determined by a court. For clients who are adults and have not been adjudicated incompetent and have not been assigned a legal guardian who may not fully understand the consequences of the program, informed consent for use of restrictive programs, practices or procedures should be obtained from a person or an entity in accordance with state law , to act as the representative or advocate of the client' s interests. The specially constituted committee must ensure that the informed and voluntary consent of the client, parent of a minor , legal guardian, or the person or or ganization designated by the state is obtained prior to each of the following circumstances: The involvement of the client in research activities; or Implementation of programs or practices that could abridge or involve risks to client protections or rights. monitor and make suggestions to the facility about its practices and pr ograms as they r elate to drug usage, physical r estraints, time-out r ooms, application of painful or noxious ol of inappr opriate behavior , pr otection of client rights and funds, and any other ar eas that the committee believes need to be addr essed. Guidance \u00a7483.440(f)(3)(iii) The committee has been made aware of and reviewed: facility policies and procedures; facility services; programs; and practices which may restrict or violate the rights of client. The committee has established and uses a mechanism for monitoring clients' rights issues and informs the governing body of any issues of concern in a timely manner . This process is at the discretion of the committee. There is no requirement for periodic review of the policies by the committee. Ch 64, p. 60 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 The function of the committee is not limited to the review , approval and monitoring of restrictive behavior management practices. Examples of issues involving client rights that might be reviewed by the committee, in addition to behavior management, include, but are not limited to: 1) Research proposals involving clients; 2) Abuse, neglect and mistreatment of clients; 3) Allegations dealing with theft of a client' s personal property or funds; 4) Damage to a client' s goods or denial of other client rights; 5) Client grievances; 6) V isitation procedures; 7) Guardianship/advocacy issues; 8) programs; 9) Confidentiality issues; 10) Advance directives/DNR orders; 1 1) Practices which restrict clients (e.g., locked doors, fenced in yards); and 12) V ideo monitoring.

Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(1) The primary survey emphasis is on the implementation of the policies and procedures developed by the facility . Conduct between staf f and clients refers to language, actions, discipline, rules, order and other types of interactions exchanged between staf f and clients or imposed upon clients by the staf f during a client' s daily experiences that af fect the quality of a client' s life. \u00a7483.450(a)(1) These policies and pr ocedur es and independence of the client; Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(1)(i) Consistent with facility policies, staf f is observed to be engaged in activities which promote the client' s growth, development and independence. 1) IPPs and data support the fact that from the time of admission, clients are learning new adaptive and functional skills while becoming more independent. 2) Interactions between clients and staf f are consistent and positive. 3) Staf f teach and encourage clients to interact with each other in a manner that promotes social integration both in the facility and out in the community . 4) All opportunities to teach and reinforce skill acquisition are utilized. 5) Staf f identify and remove impediments in the learning environment (e.g. client is unable to concentrate in a room with a television because when they see the television, they want to watch their favorite show . Staf f must identify this learning impediment and train in an environment without a television). 6) Staf f encourage clients to complete tasks with as much independence as possible. 7) Staf f encourage clients to take risks while providing reasonable safeguards to prevent injury .

W271 staff, clients, par ents of minor childr en, and legal guardians. Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(1)(iv) Policies and procedures for management of conduct between staf f and clients (483.450(a)(1)) should be provided to clients, parents of minor children, and legal guardians at admission and upon request. Policies and procedures are available on the residential and program areas if these are in separate buildings. W272 T o the extent possible, clients must participate in the formulation of these policies and pr ocedur es. Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(2) \"T o the extent possible\" does not mean that the clients are excluded due to the clients' schedule or intellectual or developmental level. Facilities should be able to provide documentation that substantiates that clients were of fered the opportunity and participated in the development of the policies. This could be accomplished through client committees or in house meetings. There should be documentation of these discussions between the client representatives and the facility . Clients must not discipline other clients, except as part of an organized system of self-government, as set forth in facility policy . Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(3) Staf f will promptly intervene when any clients tries to independently impose discipline upon another client. For example, a client who is serving dessert to the group withholds dessert from another client based upon their own evaluation of that client' s behavior .

Examples of negative interventions include, but are not limited to, removal of a privilege, implementation of restraint, and/or the use of exclusionary time out. W277 a hierar chy to be implemented, ranging fr om most positive or least intrusive, to least positive or most intrusive; Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(ii) Policies and procedures must include a clear progression as to how staf f implement interventions to manage inappropriate client behavior . Facility policy and procedures must define the entire hierarchy of possible interventions from the most positive, functionally appropriate approaches to most intrusive approaches authorized. The facility determines at what level in the hierarchy the IPP will begin for each client based on their individual assessment. The plan must still begin at the least intrusive technique shown ef fective for that client. Individual plans should specify the specific techniques that have been determined through assessment to be least restrictive for each client. The facility policy for unexpected behavioral incidents must provide direction for the staf f in the utilization of the hierarchy . For clients not on a behavior plan, staf f must apply the appropriate level of intervention per the established hierarchy , including emer gency measures to prevent harm to self the use of mor e r estrictive techniques, that the client' s r ecord documents that pr ograms incorporating the use of less intrusive or mor e positive techniques have been tried systematically and demonstrated to be ineffective; and Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iii) Policies must be implemented to ensure that all restrictive procedures begin at the lowest level of the hierarchy unless there is documented evidence that less intrusive interventions have been tried and have been found to be inef fective. The facility is not required to justify dis continuing the use of a more restrictive technique before initiating a less restrictive technique, since the intent of the regulation is to use the most positive, least intrusive technique possible. IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 63 In emer gency situations where an unanticipated behavior requires immediate protection of the client or others, the technique chosen is the least restrictive appropriate technique possible. \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iv) Addr ess \"T ime-out room\" is defined as a separate room that is used to remove a client from stimulation that may be triggering and reinforcing maladaptive behavior .

Drugs to manage inappropriate behavior are defined as any medication prescribed and administered for purposes of modifying the maladaptive behavior of a \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iv)(D) \"Application of painful or noxious stimuli\" is defined as any procedure by which staf f apply , contingent upon the exhibition of maladaptive behavior , startling, unpleasant, or painful stimuli, or stimuli that have a potentially noxious ef fect. While the regulation permits the use of painful or noxious stimuli these techniques are the last resort and can only be utilized for behaviors that are causing significant harm and have not responded to competently administered interventions of less intrusive nature. Facility policies must state that: The use of noxious stimuli is only permitted when the client exhibits behaviors so severe that they present a potential risk for significant or even life-threatening circumstances; the IDT and facility must weigh the potential risk of the behavior against the risk involved in the use of the painful or noxious techniques to manage behavior; Ch 64, p. 64 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 that safeguards and strict oversight must be in place for consideration to use techniques that may be painful or even unpleasant; techniques that may be painful or noxious must be time limited; the proposed use of these techniques requires scrutiny of clinical ef fectiveness and specially constituted committee review; and on-going monitoring and safeguards must be in place during implementation of the technique. W283 The members authorize the use of specified interventions; Guidance contr olling the use of interventions. Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iv)(F) Facility policies must address what supervisory oversight is provided during the application of the intervention in order to ensure that procedures were followed correctly .

A staf f member cannot employ a behavior management technique simply because a client refuses to follow a staf f request. The implementation of all interventions, except in emer gency situations, must be administered consistent with the IPP and the specific behaviors identified in the IPP requiring the intervention. Instances where an intervention is done as a punishment because the client did not comply with staf f instructions and not associated with the IPP include: Personal property confiscated for behavior at staf f discretion; Rights restricted without approved plans; and Punitive house rules, such as prohibiting reentry into the kitchen for snacks if a meal is not eaten completely . \u00a7483.450(b)(3) Inadequate numbers of staf f, inef ficient deployment of staf f, and insuf ficient training of staf f can lead to restrictive practices used for staf f convenience. Examples of techniques used to manage client behavior for staf f convenience including, but are not limited to: Clients allowed to discipline other clients; Clients restricted to one area of the home; and Unauthorized use of restraints (e.g., lap trays, bean bags, gait belt, and merry walkers for the purpose of restricting movement) W288 IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch Implementation: 04-27-15) active tr eatment pr ogram. Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(3) Substitutions for active treatment programming occur when the staf f utilizes interventions and restrictive techniques on their own, either because there is not a formal behavioral program to address the client' s behaviors or because the staf f do not follow the plan as written. interventions to manage inappr opriate client behavior must be incorporated into the client' s individual pr ogram plan, in accordance with \u00a7483.440(c)(4) and (5) of this subpart. Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(4) The use of behavior interventions are expected to be incorporated into the IPP and be based upon the results of the functional behavioral assessment. However , there may be isolated and rare instances when a client exhibits unexpected behavior that requires immediate intervention on the part of the staf f. In these instances, the least restrictive intervention must be employed and removed as soon as the client is no longer an immediate threat to self or others. The IPP team must then discuss the need for adding a behavioral plan into the clients program. W290 to contr ol inappr opriate behavior ar e not permitted. Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(5) The staf f of the facility may not maintain or use, outside of the IPPs, any list of \"as needed\" interventions that can be used with any client at any time. W ith the exception of isolated and rare emer gency situations, all restrictive behavior interventions must be incorporated into the formal IPP and individualized for the client. (c) Standard: T ime-out may placed in a r oom fr om which egr ess is pr evented only if the following conditions ar e met: (i) The placement is a part of an appr oved systematic time-out pr ogram as r equir ed by paragraph (b) of this section. (Thus, emergency placement of a client into a time-out r oom is not allowed.) (ii) The client is under the dir ect constant visual supervision of designated staff. (iii) The door to the r oom is held shut by staff or by a mechanism r equiring constant physical pr essur e fr om a staff member to keep the mechanism engaged. Guidance \u00a7483.450(c)(1) Seclusion, defined as the placement of a client alone in a locked room, is never allowed. T ime out procedures allows a client to be alone in a room, but do not allow that room to be locked. During a time out procedure, egress can only be prevented by a person standing in the door way , or holding the door closed, but as soon as the staf f move from the door way or let go of the door the client can come out. Use of the timeout room or procedure must be part of an approved behavioral plan and may involve the separation of a client from a group or a particular situation, in a non- locked setting for the purpose of calming or removing the client from the reinforcing stimuli that are sustaining an identified maladaptive behavior . Designated time out rooms must be set up so that the staf f has continuous, direct observation of the client at all times. Because of the danger that staf f can get distracted by other events or duties, this cannot be accomplished by a camera in lieu of the staf f having direct visual of the client. Ch 64, p. 66 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 Key locks, latch locks, and doors that open inward without an inside doorknob are not permitted by the regulations for use in time out rooms as they do not require constant physical pressure from a staf f member to keep the door shut. In each instance where a time out room is used, the client' s IPP must include: The functional behavioral assessment which resulted in a recommendation for the use of time out procedures; and Instructions on how often data is to be collected during the time out period and the criteria for release from time out. The use of a time out room must be approved by the Specially constituted committee as part of an approved program. W292 a client in a time-out r oom must not exceed one hour must be pr otected fr om hazardous conditions including, but not limited to, pr esence of sharp corners and objects, uncover ed light fixtur es, unpr otected electrical outlets. Guidance \u00a7483.450(c)(3) Because placement in the time out room is typically secondary to extreme behaviors, it is acceptable that there be no furniture in this room. A door that opens inward can potentially be held closed, either intentionally or inadvertently , by the client in the room, thereby denying staf f immediate access to the room. activities must be kept. Guidance \u00a7483.450(c)(4) The documentation in the client' s record accurately reflects planned (e.g. part of the IPP) usage and presents a picture of events prior to, during, and following the use of time-out. The IPP should include direction as to how often data must be collected during each use of time out for each individual client.

The plan must address: 1) The specific type of client behavior to be managed by this plan; 2) The less restrictive behavioral approaches which were previously used, but were unsuccessful; 3) The hierarchy of measures that must be utilized prior to the application of physical restraint; 4) The type of physical restraint; 5) The type of client behavior that would indicate that the patient is calm and can be released from the restraint; and 6) The replacement behavior being taught to the client to reduce the need for future restraints.

Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(1)(iii) Physical restraint during medical procedures must be utilized only when absolutely necessary and be used as a last resort in order for the facility or practitioners to deliver needed medical care to the client. The restraint must be released as soon as the medical procedure is completed unless it is necessary to continue restraint for a longer period of time to continue to deliver care or to prevent the client from displacing tubes or dressings. These restraints may only be used as long as the physician indicates them to be necessary . For instances where physical restraint are used by the facility or a practitioner during a medical procedure, the client record and interviews should verify that less restrictive measures were attempted before using physical restraint and verify whether any injuries occurred during the use of the physical restraint. W ritten orders by medical personnel for the application of a physical restraint should include the reason that the restraint is necessary , the type of restraint to be used and the length of time the restraint will be applied. A restraint device used to prevent a client engaging in self-injurious behavior is not considered a restraint for medical condition. \u00a7483.450(d)(2) Authorizations to use or extend r estraints as an emergency measur e must be: Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(2) Facility policies should list who in the facility is allowed to authorize the emer gency use of restraints or to extend the use of an emer gency restraint, and the training that is required for those persons who may authorize. Documentation in the client record in those instances should confirm that the facility follows that policy . than 12 consecutive hours; and Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(2)(i) This regulation does not mean that restraints may be authorized to be applied for up to a 12 hour period. The client must be released from the physical restraint as soon as the client is no longer a risk to self or others. Once the behavior has ceased, the emer gency has ended, and the client has been released, another authorization would be required for any new emer gency situation. The 12 consecutive hour period is the absolute maximum period of time that emer gency physical restraint may be utilized for a client during an individual behavioral incident. It is reasonable to expect that the facility will reassess the emer gency situation for any client who remains in physical restraint for longer than one hour and reassess the situation at least every 30 minutes thereafter up to 12 hours when the physical restraint must be removed. W299 soon the client is r estrained or stable. Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(2)(ii) There may be instances where the maladaptive behaviors of a client or clients escalate into a serious and immediate event that must be de-escalated quickly in order to prevent harm to clients, staf f, other Ch 64, p. 68 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 clients, or by standers when incidents occur in the community . In these instances, the staf f should contact the appropriate person to obtain authorization for the use of physical restraint as soon as the situation is stable. Retrospective documentation of the incident should confirm the need for authorization after application. W300 must not issue orders for r estraint on a standing or as needed basis. Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(3) All instances of physical restraint must be ordered on a case by case basis with individual assessment of the situation and authorization based upon the individual client. Authorizations should include the rationale for the use of the physical restraint versus other less restrictive measures. W301 placed in r estraint must be checked at least every 30 minutes by staff trained in the use of r estraints, Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(4) The frequency of monitoring will vary according to the type and design of the device and the psychological and physical well-being of the client. The facility should be checking the client often enough to adequately assess the physical status of the client (e.g., circulation, respiration and vital signs) of the client and the need to continued restraint. The more restrictive the intervention, the greater the risk to the client and the more often the client must be assessed. Frequent assessment will assure that the client will be released as soon as possible, however , in no instance may the staf f go longer than 30 minutes without checking the client. W302 as quickly as possible, and Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(4) \"As quickly as possible\" means as soon as the client is no longer a danger to self or others. Documentation should support that the client was released from restraint as soon as they became calm. W303 these checks and usage must be kept. \u00a7483.450(d)(5) Restraints must be designed and used so as not to cause physical injury to the client Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(5) Physical restraints to include mechanical devices must be the correct size for the client and be applied with the correct amount of pressure according to manufacturer ' s directions. In addition to observation of any physical mechanical restraint in use at the time of the survey , review incident reports for any injuries as a result of restraint use.

However , if a mechanical physical restraint is applied to an extremity to prevent a client from removing post-operative sutures, the restraint must be released every two (2) hours for a period of not less than ten (10) minutes in order to maintain adequate circulation. Mechanical restraints placed on the client during sleeping hours must be medically based and specifically ordered by a physician. There should be evidence in the client' s record why the mechanical physical restraint is necessary during sleeping hours. While it is not necessary to wake the client every two (2) hours to release the restraint and provide opportunity for exercise, the staf f must check the restraint frequently during the night to ensure that the restraint is still properly applied and the client appears comfortable. W307 such activity must be kept. \u00a7483.450(d)(7) Barr ed enclosur es Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(7) A bed or play equipment with bars that prevent the client from leaving the bed or voluntarily climbing out of the bed are barred enclosures. The use of such enclosures must be a part of the written IPP and behavioral assessments must clearly state why such an enclosure is necessary , the risks of using the enclosure versus not using it and what less restrictive measures have been tried prior to the implementation of the barred enclosures. Such devices may not be used in lieu of adequate staf be e than thr ee feet in height and must not use drugs in doses that interfer e with the individual client' s daily living activities. Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(1) Clients are alert and available for participation in daily living activities. Some medications administered for medical reasons or to manage behavior may cause drowsiness as a side ef fect or due to an accumulation of the drug in the client' s system. For clients who are observed to be sleeping in chairs during their work day , their programs or recreational times, there should be evidence that the facility staf f notified the medical staf f and an assessment was performed of the client including their medication regimen. Medical staf f should make adjustments to address the issue if indicated. \u00a7483.450(e)(2) Drugs used for contr ol of inappr opriate team and Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(2) The physician and other team members discuss the risks and benefits of the medication to address the tar get behavior/symptoms, and approve the use of the drug as being consistent with the active treatment program. Decisions about the necessity of the use of drugs to manage inappropriate behavior should be made by the IDT . It is the responsibility of the IDT members to provide the physician with suf ficient information regarding the need for a client to receive a drug for inappropriate behavior . The physician will make the ultimate decision to order the use of the drug. The IDT should document any disagreement with the physician' s order . Ch 64, p. 70 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 In those instances where a client returns from a physician' s visit with an order for an unsolicited drug to manage client' s inappropriate behaviors, there must be evidence (e.g. IDT meeting notes or clients record) that the team concurred with the necessity for the order without trying less restrictive measures first and discussed any concerns with the physician. W312 only as an integral part of the client' s individual pr ogram plan that is dir ected specifically towards the r eduction of and eventual elimination of the behaviors for which the drugs ar e employed. Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(2) All medications to manage behavior must be integrated into the IPP and the IPP must specify how the specific tar get behavior for which the medication is prescribed will be reduced or eliminated. This includes medications which are typically used for medical conditions that may be used to manage behavior (e.g. 1. propranolol (Inderal), an antihypertensive used for self-injurious behavior , and 2. carbamazepine (T egretol), an anticonvulsant, used for aggression). Drugs for behavior management must not be ordered on a PRN basis for a client. The facility staf f must contact the physician to obtain a one-time order if the situation necessities the use of medication. The facility policy must address the maximum number of times a medication can be used as an emer gency prior to being incorporated in the IPP , side ef fects of such medications, and the frequency of re-evaluation of ongoing behavior and its treatment. Clients or their legal guardian have the right to choose sedation for medical and dental procedures. However , the facility cannot do routine administration of medication for sedation for medical and dental procedures without the agreement/consent of the client or their parent/legal guardian and they must follow the specific orders of the healthcare practitioner who will be providing services to the client. Decisions to order medications prior to medical and dental procedures must be made on an individual basis. Clients who demonstrate severe anxiety around these procedures should be considered for desensitization programs. of inappr opriate behavior must not be used until it can be justified that the harmful effects of the behavior clearly outweigh the potentially harmful effects of the drugs. Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(3) The risk(s) associated with the drug being used is consistent with the type and severity of the behavior/symptoms it is intended to af fect. At the time the drug was started and incorporated into the IPP , the behaviors were discussed and presented to team members. It was the documented decision of the team that the behaviors were of such a severity that pharmacological intervention was required and the physician was provided with the team information to assist him in his decision to prescribe the medication. \u00a7483.450(e)(4) Drugs used for contr ol of inappr opriate behavior must be- - \u00a7483.450(e)(4)(i) the drug r egimen r eview r equir ement at \u00a7483.460(j), Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(4) The physician and pharmacist must regularly review use of drugs for control of inappropriate behavior for their ef fectiveness in changing the tar geted behavior/symptoms, untoward side ef fects, contraindications for continued use, and communicate this information to relevant staf f. adverse consequences by facility staff; and IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 71 Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(4) Direct support staf f members are the people who most closely and most frequently observe and record client behaviors. There should be evidence that the direct support staf f receive information via the IPP as to the behaviors to be observed, the side ef fects associated with the medication, the amount and types of documentation required and the communication with clinical staf f which is indicated. See 483.430 (e)(1) for training on observations, documentation and communication related to behavior management. \u00a7483.450(e)(4)(ii) Gradually withdrawn annually Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(4) Clients receiving medications to control behavior must be evaluated at least annually for a possible reduction of the medication progressing the client toward final elimination of the drug or lowest possible therapeutic level of the drug. However , evaluation should be done earlier than annually if observations indicate that the client' s behavior has improved to the point that reduction may be considered as determined by the IPP , unless otherwise ordered by the client' s ed pr ogram conducted in conjunction with the interdisciplinary team, unless clinical evidence justifies that this is contraindicated. Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(4) The IDT is aware of and involved in planning the drug reduction program and participates in its implementation and monitoring. Progress or regression of the client is monitored and taken into consideration in determining the rate of withdrawal and whether to continue withdrawal. In determining whether there is clinical contraindication to the annual drug withdrawal, the physician and IDT should consider the client' s clinical history , diagnostic/behavioral status, previous reduction/discontinuation attempts, and current regimen ef fectiveness. If a client also has a diagnosis of a psychiatric condition that requires a stable level of a psychiatric medication in order to control the symptoms associated with the psychiatric diagnosis, the annual evaluation for reduction of that particular medication for the symptoms of the psychiatric diagnosis would not apply . Documentation in the client' s record from their psychiatrist or physician that medication reduction would be contraindicated or that the current level of medications is therapeutic meets the intent of this regulation.

Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(1) A designated physician must be available via telephone, pager , e-mail or on-site in the facility on a 24 hour per day basis for consultation regarding both emer gency and non-emer gency medical issues. If the facility employs a fulltime physician, there must be procedures in place for coverage in the absence of the physician from the facility . If the facility contracts with a community-based physician for 24 hour per day coverage, there must be written arrangements in place to detail the responsibilities of the contract physician regarding direct services to the clients, interactions with the direct support staf f and the interactions between the nursing staf f of the facility and the contract physician. The contract with the contract physician must delineate the process for coverage when he/she is not available. Ch 64, p. 72 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/16/21 Upon interview , the staf f should be aware of the procedures they are to follow to contact a physician in the event of an illness or injury . Routinely sending clients to emer gent care or the emer gency room of a hospital because there are no facility physicians available for consultation is not consistent with the regulations. Interview and record review verify that the physician is available and responsive 24 hours a day . The physician must develop, in coordination with licensed nursing personnel, a medical car e plan of tr eatment for a client if the physician determines that an individual client r equir es 24-hour licensed nursing car e. Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(2) A medical care plan of treatment is developed for those clients who are either acutely ill and require licensed nursing care and monitoring temporarily on a 24 hour basis or clients whose chronic medical conditions require or indicate 24 hour licensed nursing care and monitoring. The physician determines when 24 hour nursing care is required. The medical care plan is based upon the orders from the physician for treatments and care and nursing standards of practice. There is evidence in the client' s record that the physician and the nursing staf f at the facility work together to ensure that the medical care plan is current and appropriate (e.g. changes in physician written orders for care pursuant to observations from the nursing staf f and/or direct observations and interactions with the client, and nursing documentation of care). The fact that a client has a medical care plan in place should not preclude him/her from an active treatment program, except in instances of acute illness where the active treatment program is temporarily suspended. For clients with chronic medical conditions, it may be necessary for their active treatment program to be modified due to the tolerance level of the client or adapted to accommodate medical limitations. However , active treatment must be provided on a continuous basis. must integrated in the individual pr ogram plan. Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(2) Although the medical care plan can be a separate document, it is always an integral part of the IPP process. There should be evidence that the plans are shared and discussed at the time of all interdisciplinary discussions and the information from the medical care plan is utilized in the development of the IPP objectives. \u00a7483.460(a)(3) The facility must pr ovide or car e Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(3) The facility has procedures in place to ensure that the clients receive general health care services to assure optimal levels of wellness. General health care services include assessment and treatment of acute and chronic complaints or situations; teaching relevant heath care principles to staf f and clients; and periodic surveillance of the health status of the clients. As a result of clinical assessment, referrals are made for specialized assessment and tests. Facility health care staf f follow-up to ensure the assessments are done and the findings incorporated into the medical care plan and/or the IPP . The facility must have arrangements in place to provide routine or episodic laboratory , and radiology services for the clients if not provided in-house or through the clients physician. There must be a written agreement that specifies the responsibilities of the facility and outside provider . (See \u00a7483.410(a)). Preventive health care services include screening procedures designed to identify health concerns and initiate treatment as early as possible. The facility should have a health prevention program in place and follow the plan to address those screenings that the facility will perform periodically that are relevant to all clients, and those screenings associated with a particular gender or age or vulnerability . IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 73 Physician refusal to perform a test, such as a pap smear , must be consistent with guidelines for clients, per the local standard in the community . If the facility has a physician that refuses to provide preventative healthcare based on the client' s level of functioning, medical staf f at the facility should meet with and consult with this physician in order to ensure that clients receive the same health services as persons living in the local community .

All clients, including clients who are non-verbal, should have evidence in his/her record that they receive an annual evaluation of their vision and hearing which includes a screening as a minimum, follow-up examination as indicated by the screen and timely referrals as indicated by the examination. Screening is a gross assessment of the client' s vision and hearing and usually does not include a measurement of acuity . Examinations are conducted to follow-up on issues noted in the screening and are conducted by qualified professionals. Clients who appear to have vision or hearing problems or the staf f indicate that they have vision or hearing problems and no accommodations have been made. The annual vision and hearing evaluation verifies that clients appearing to have vision/hearing issues or if staf f indicate that a client has vision/hearing issues that these issues have been/are being addressed. If a client' s vision or hearing can only be assessed through examinations conducted by specialists (e.g., comprehensive ophthalmological examinations and evoked response audiometry (ERA)), these tests need not be conducted yearly , but rather upon the specialist' s expressed recommendations. During discussions at the annual IPP review the team reviews information from the health professional, speech and hearing professional, and direct support staf f and makes referrals back to the specialist if indicated.

The physician' s input may be by means of written reports, evaluations, and recommendations. The physician (consistent with Medicaid Utilization Control regulations at \u00a7456.380) must evaluate the client at the time of admission to identify all diagnoses and complaints, provide orders for all medications and treatments and provide recommendations for restorative and rehabilitative services. \u00a7456.380 requires that a physician conduct this initial assessment therefore, it may not be done by a physician extender ( e.g., Physician assistant or Advanced Practice Registered 75 \u00a7483.460(b)(2) If appr opriate, physicians must participate in the r eview and update of an individual pr ogram plan as part of the interdisciplinary team pr ocess either in person or thr ough written r eport to the interdisciplinary team. Guidance \u00a7483.460(b)(2) The need for physician participation on an individual client' s IPP team is determined by the medical needs of the client. How the physician participates (whether through written report, telephone consultation, attendance at the meeting, etc.) is to be left to the discretion of the facility . In instances where a client has no overriding medical issues, the nurse of the facility can represent the medical component on the IDT process or consult with the appropriate physician and share the information with the team. However , in situations where a client' s medical condition is unstable/fragile to the extent that it impacts the training/work that may be planned, the physician must participate in providing guidance on the types and extent of programs that would be appropriate considering the client' s physical/medical limitations. If a client is noted to be having dif ficulty participating in the objectives set forth in his/her IPP due to serious medical concerns, review the input that was provided by the physician into the development of the plan and whether the IPP team requested such input. (c) Standard: Nursing services must pr ovide clients with nursing services in accordance with their needs.

An eventful year medically would include a year which required unplanned hospital admissions or in which medical issues necessitated treatment for a prolonged or continuing period. However when a client has had an eventful year medically or current medical/health concerns, this could have an impact on their objectives and accordingly the nurse should participate in the IDT discussion directly .

The medications observed during the observations may or may not be for clients in the survey sample. Any concerns regarding a medication that is about to be administered should be brought to the attention of the person administering the medication. The record of observation should be reconciled with the most current signed physician' s orders. For lar ge facilities (17 or more beds) with either single or multiple buildings, the medication administration pass will encompass a total of 12 doses. The observations should be split between two separate passes 6/6 (one in the morning and one in late afternoon or early evening). Any concerns regarding a medication that is about to be administered should be brought to the attention of the person administering the medication. The record of observation should be reconciled with the most current signed physician' s orders. Unlicensed personnel ar e allowed to administer drugs only if State law permits; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(3) Unlicensed personnel administer only those forms of medication which state law permits. Licensed nurse(s) in the facility oversee any administration of medications by unlicensed persons and periodically evaluate their performance. W371 Clients ar e taught to administer their own medications if the interdisciplinary team determines that self-administration of medications is an appr opriate objective, and if the physician does not specify otherwise; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(4) The IDT decision that a self-administration program is appropriate, as is the case for all formal training objectives, must be based upon accurate, current, valid assessment of the client' s skills and potential. The determination as to the appropriateness of a self- administration program must never be made singularly on the client' s diagnosis or current functional abilities. For clients assessed to be inappropriate for a self-administration program, but determined by the IDT to possess the capacity to functionally , cognitively , emotionally or developmentally benefit from participation in the drug administration process, it is expected that the facility will provide opportunities for the client to participate in the medication administration process under direct supervision. This participation can include but is not limited to, identifying the medication taken, reaching/grasping a cup of water during the process and placing oral medications in the mouth, etc. W372 of the interdisciplinary team' s decision that self-administration of medications is an objective for the client; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(5) While the IDT may set an objective of self administration of medication for a client, they are required to notify the client' s physician of this proposed objective. If the client' s physician objects on medical grounds, the team must not proceed with the objective until such time as a discussion is held with the physician and he/she agrees to proceed after receiving additional information. IAC 6/16/21 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, self-administers medication until he or she demonstrates the competency to do so; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(6) The written self-administration program for a client must detail the criteria that will be employed by the facility staf f to verify that the client successfully completes all phases of the program and continues to comply with all necessary requirements for self administration. Clients who self-administer medications must secure all medications in such a manner as to protect access by other clients or visitors. W374 by clients while not under the dir ect car e of the facility ar e packaged and labeled in accordance with State law; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(7) When clients go out of the facility for home visits, or to attend work or school, drugs they are taking must be packaged and labeled in accordance with state law by a person authorized by state law to package and label. \u00a7483.460(k)(8) Drug administration err ors and adverse drug r eactions ar e Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(8) Documentation of any medication error should be entered into the client' s record and should include what error was made, who was notified of the error , the response of the medical person notified, the physical condition of the client at the time of the notification and subsequent observations of the clients physical condition related to the error . Documentation of adverse drug reactions must be entered into the client' s record and should include all complaints made by the client or observations made by the staf f following the drug administration, the notification of medical personnel, and the response of the medical personnel, any emer gency actions that were required and all subsequent observations of the client' s condition related to the reaction. a physician. Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(8) \"Immediately\" means at the time the error or reaction is identified.

Guidance \u00a7483.460(l)(2) \"Authorized persons\" is restricted to those who administer the drugs (as allowed by state law) and nursing supervisors (if any). No other personnel should have access to these keys. W384 trained to self-administer drugs in accordance with \u00a7483.460(k)(4) may have access to keys to their individual drug supply . Guidance \u00a7483.460(l)(2) Drugs that are self-administered do not have to be double locked. The purpose for the double locking is to limit access to scheduled drugs. Since the client is generally the only one who has access to his/her drug supply (with perhaps the exception of a licensed nurse or whoever has overall responsibility for medication administration at the facility and a facility' s Director of Nursing Services, who may have access to all of the facility' s drug supplies), there is no need to further limit access.

Guidance \u00a7483.460(n)(1) If the facility performs laboratory services, it must have a current, valid Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certificate for the types of tests it is performing. For the purposes of this regulation, a \"laboratory service or test\" is defined as any examination or analysis of materials derived from the human body for purposes of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of the health of human beings. W394 laboratory chooses to r efer specimens for testing to another laboratory , the r eferral laboratory must be certified in the appr opriate specialties and subspecialties of service in accordance with the r equir ements of part 493 of this chapter . Guidance \u00a7483.460(n)(1) A facility performing any laboratory service or test must have applied to CMS, and received a Certificate of W aiver , Certificate of Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation. An application for a Certificate of W aiver may be made if the facility performs only those tests on the waived list. A complete list of waived tests can be found at: http://www .accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfClia/analyteswaived.cfm . If the facility performs any test, not appearing on the waived list, a Certificate of Compliance or Certificate of Accreditation is required. An appropriate CLIA certificate is required regardless of the frequency with which the laboratory services or tests are conducted. When no tests are performed, a CLIA certificate is not needed. Facilities only collecting specimens and not performing testing do not need a certificate. A not-for -profit, a state, or local government or ganization may have one certificate covering all the facilities it operates (e.g., all the separately certified residences which fall under its governing body), if no more than a total of 15 types of waived or moderately complex laboratory tests are used. This exception applies only to laboratories performing limited public health testing. See State Operations Manual (SOM) 6008. Each location where a laboratory tests are performed must file a separate application to be separately certified unless the laboratory meets one if the exceptions outlined at 42CFR493.35(b), 493.443(b), or 493.55(b). Any laboratory located in a state that has a CMS-approved laboratory program is exempt from CLIA certification. Currently there are two states with approved programs: W ashington and New Y ork. New Y ork has a partial exemption; therefore, if the laboratory is located in New Y ork, contact the New Y ork State Agency to determine if the exemption applies.

When surveying an ICF/IID for compliance with the LSC, it is first necessary to determine whether the facility will be surveyed under Health Care (HC) or Board and Care (BC) occupancy . If clients receive nursing services, or if the provider elects to use Health Care, the facility should be surveyed as a Health Care Facility under Chapter 18 or 19 of the LSC, as appropriate. If clients receive personal care and protective oversight but not continuing nursing services, the facility is to be surveyed under Board and Care and the following three steps should be followed: 1) Determine the size (16 or less = small; 17 or more = lar ge); 2) Determine the Evacuation Dif ficulty (PROMPT , SLOW , or IMPRACTICAL) using Appendix F of the fire safety evaluation system for board and care facilities (FSES/BC); and 3) Survey the building using one of two methods: a. The prescriptive requirements of Chapters 32 or 33; or b. The FSES/BC, Appendix G. (1) General.
