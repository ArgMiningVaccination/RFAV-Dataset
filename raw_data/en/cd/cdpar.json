Diabetes is a medical condition in which the body fails to form an adequate amount of insulin to control the blood sugar or when the body fails to utilize the insulin in an effective manner. Mixtard is a replacement insulin that acts similarly to the insulin produced by the pancreas. The active component in Mixtard, human insulin, is formed by a method called recombinant technology. In this method, the production of insulin occurs by yeast cells into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced. And this makes them capable of forming insulin. Mixtard is also composed of insulin in two forms namely, a soluble form, which acts rapidly (within half an hour of injection) as well as an 'isophane', form which gets absorbed gradually throughout the day. Due to this, Mixtard is longer-acting insulin. The replacement insulin works similarly to naturally formed insulin and helps the sugar to get into the cells from the bloodstream.
