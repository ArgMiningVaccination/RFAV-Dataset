Understanding how to support your adrenals starts with understanding the type of stress symptoms and intensity of adrenal imbalance you are experiencing. Are you \"burned out\" and exhausted all the time \u2014 or do feel you \"tired and wired\" and can't get to sleep at night? Table of contents [How do you know if you have adrenal fatigue?](#adrenal-fatigue) [Natural supplements and herbs for adrenal fatigue](#best-supplements) [Tips for taking your supplements](#tips) How do you know if you have adrenal fatigue? [Stress in women](/adrenal-fatigue-and-stress/how-to-relieve-stress/) triggers many different physical and emotional effects. While it's one thing to be tired after a long day, feeling fatigued every day for no apparent reason can be an indication of a larger problem. Are you experiencing adrenal fatigue? Look at the list of symptoms below: [Fatigue](/symptoms/fatigue/) - Brain fog - Ongoing sleep disturbances - Inability to cope with stress physically or emotionally - Jumpiness and anxiety - Mood changes (depression) - Digestive issues - Lowered immunity (you catch colds and flu viruses easily) - Body aches [Low libido](/adrenal-fatigue-and-stress/stress-and-sex-life/) - Light headedness - Low blood pressure [Weight gain](/adrenal-fatigue-and-stress/can-stress-cause-weight-gain/)and belly fat - Hair loss Natural supplements and herbs for adrenal support Chronic stress and fatigue are important signs your adrenals are overworked and in need of repair. If you've ever attempted to \"fix\" your symptoms with caffeine and sugar or even sleeping pills, you already know there's a big problem with that approach \u2014 any momentary relief you get is followed by feeling even worse. There's got to be a better way, and there is! According to a growing body of research, key vitamins, minerals and herbs and other plant-based compounds offer powerful help to restore underlying adrenal function and protect the body from stress. Some of these natural substances nourish adrenal glands and provide raw materials for healthy cortisol production. Others go a step further, interacting with the central nervous system and immune system to balance the body's \"fight-or-flight\" response and make it easier to return to equilibrium and calm after a stress challenge. Let's take a closer look at these compounds and how natural adrenal supplements can help. Vitamin C: The adrenal glands require Vitamin C to produce stress hormones and maintain their balance. When you are under chronic stress, Vitamin C can become depleted. Vitamin C is water soluble and is not stored in the body, so replenishing your supply daily through a [high quality multivitamin supplement](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/collections/a-to-z/products/essential-nutrients-multivitamin) is an important step to keep the adrenals and all your tissues nourished. Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid): Vitamins in the B complex family improve cellular energy. Certain B vitamins, including Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) provide targeted support to the adrenals. As studies show, B5 supports balanced cortisol production and helps reduce levels of excess [cortisol triggered during stress events](https://www.womenshealthnetwork.com/adrenal-fatigue-and-stress/negative-effects-of-high-cortisol/). Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): An overactive stress response can disrupt the nervous system and neurotransmitter production, often leading to depressed mood, jumpiness and anxious feelings. Vitamin B6 helps restore equilibrium to your nervous system by supporting the manufacture of key neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Vitamin E: A powerful antioxidant, vitamin E supports hormone production and stress recovery by protecting adrenal tissue from free radical damage that impairs function. Calcium: The mineral calcium acts like a shock absorber for the adrenals during times of stress by assisting in restoring calm to the body after the stressor has passed. Magnesium: Magnesium supports balanced blood glucose metabolism and neurotransmitter production, helping stabilize mood and increase feelings of calm. Most of us don't get anywhere near enough magnesium in our diets. Chronic stress further depletes magnesium, leaving you at much higher risk of deficiency. Studies show daily [magnesium supplementation](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/magnesium-citrate) can improve sleep and promote relaxation. Trace minerals: Adrenal imbalances can trigger and/or worsen other problems, like low thyroid function. Zinc, manganese, selenium, and iodine are trace minerals needed to keep your entire endocrine system humming along and your hormones balanced. It's important to supplement with these trace minerals since it's difficult to get enough through diet alone. Nature has a few other tricks up her sleeve to help us deal with our stress, whether it's physical, emotional, or environmental. Here are some adaptogenic substances which are especially useful for maintaining a healthy stress response and keeping you calm and focused. Astragalus root This staple of herbal medicine enhances the body's natural ability to adapt to stress, bolstering the immune system so that you stay well. Astragalus root even helps maintain normal blood sugar levels and alleviates insulin resistance. Cordyceps This wild fungus, found in the high altitude Tibetan Plateau, is part of the Traditional Chinese Medicine approach to adrenal health. Cordyceps helps support physical stamina, energy levels and immune health during times of stress. Cordyceps also assists in balancing the body's inflammatory response and helps stabilize blood sugars. Eleuthoro Formerly called Siberian ginseng, Eleuthoro acts to limit excess cortisol in your system by inhibiting the cortisol-boosting enzyme C-Jun N-terminal kinase. Through this action, Eleuthoro helps to shorten recovery from acute stress, decrease stress-related fatigue, improve stamina, and regulate blood sugar. L-theanine An amino acid found in green tea, L-theanine helps the brain enter a more relaxed state, lowering stress hormone levels. In one study, participants given L-theanine one hour before undertaking a stressful task reported lower levels of stress while performing the task. Through saliva testing, researchers even detected lower levels of stress hormones after the stressful task for up to three hours later. Rhodiola rosea Also known as \"golden root,\" Rhodiola is an adaptogenic herb that helps protect against stress-related fatigue and \"burnout\", encouraging a balanced response to stress throughout the body. Rhodiola increases mental clarity and offers immune and blood sugar support. Studies show that added benefits of Rhodiola are its antidepressant and anti-anxiety properties. Passion flower This wildflower from South America is a calming herbal agent shown to reduce excess cortisol levels. Passion flower is also believed to bind to GABA receptors to ease restlessness and improve mood and sleep. Phosphatidylserine This phospholipid is an important blocking agent that protects against the harmful effects of cortisol at the cellular level. Phosphatidylserine is also important for brain health, helping with focus and mental clarity. The best supplements for adrenal fatigue In an ideal world, we'd get all the nutrients we need to restore adrenal health from a [well-balanced diet](/adrenal-fatigue-and-stress/the-adrenal-fatigue-diet/). However, adaptogenic herbs aren't typically part of everyday foods, and no matter how well we eat, a stressful day can really burn through all our nutrient stockpiles. The best supplements for adrenal fatigue are those formulated to address fatigue and stress symptoms by delivering key nutrients in therapeutic amounts. [Adaptisol](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/adaptisol) is formulated with the adaptogenic herbs astragulus, eleuthero, cordyceps and rhodioloa to and [restore energy levels](https://www.womenshealthnetwork.com/adrenal-fatigue-and-stress/how-to-boost-energy-naturally/). Adaptisol aids the body's natural ability to adapt to stress, enhances mental clarity, and supports healthy immune function. Adaptogens help to protect the body from the effects of excess cortisol and prevent cortisol overproduction in the first place. Adaptisol is designed for women whose symptoms cluster around the \"tired\" end of the adrenal spectrum, including extreme fatigue, brain fog, lack of focus, mood changes and weight gain. [Serinisol](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/serinisol) is formulated with minerals and natural adaptogenic compounds to restore your calm and ease sleep disruptions. When stress is ongoing, cortisol does not return to normal levels as intended and instead can stay high for long periods. This will affect your body negatively, leading to symptoms like anxiety, sleeplessness and impaired memory. Ingredients in Serinsol, including magnesium, L-theanine and passion flower specifically aid in the reduction of excess cortisol and help to promote relaxation, ease racing thoughts and improve sleep.Serinisol is best for stress symptoms that leave you feeling \"wired\" and restless.
