RESTORE in the quiet meditative, nature of Bali's serene mountains & waterfalls EMPOWER with nervous system education to take your health back into your own hands Rest, Replenish, Reflect, Restore & Re-Set Emerging Renewed A four-day experiential training Colour has this laser-like ability to shine a light deep into the memory banks of the collective unconscious to find the most perfect healing story to help resolve a seemingly unsolvable situation in the here and now. Through psychodramatic embodiment and other expressive arts, we can learn how to disentangle and liberate ourselves from these old and outdated programmes running in the background. The healing power of Colour Stories enables us to live much more in the present, thus having a greater opportunity for creating the life we were born to live. This simple, yet profound process is an integration of Jungian active imagination, bodywork, colour psychodynamics, psychodrama and Soul retrieval. You will learn how explore the origins of deep-seated emotional and mental patterns through the healing power of colour. By embracing and harnessing the potent potential of colour we gain greater awareness of our authentic core essence, enabling us to live more peacefully and feel much more at-home in our body and our day-to-day life. This process also helps to clear the energy bodies of any misplaced energy, it also brings back lost energies that we might have lost or given away. It is in a sense, in part, what Shamans would call a form of Soul retrieval. Colour Story exploration requires that you only need to be able to imagine, you don't even need to close your eyes if you don't want to. It does not involve hypnosis or relaxed states of being; it only requires you to be present, focused and enter into the active imaginary realms of \"As if\". Another benefit of this work is that it can give you access to latent gifts and talents too. In this four-day experiential training you will learn: How to guide and retrieve Colour Stories Psychodramatic embodiment techniques Colour Healing Soul-retrieval methods Whole-person integration and ritual. This is a profound and completely Enlightening 9 days Retreat In which you will be submerged in Masculine Activations, DNA upgrades, galactic awakening, energetic downloads, cellular healings, Elemental activations, and ascension teachings-remembering. Where you will be immersed in pure high frequencies in everything you do. This is an invitation to participate in a full spectrum of releasing and upgrading of mind, bodies, heart and soul. The Power of Sacred Sites Sacred sites, also known as earth energy vortexes, are high frequency places on the earth grid where the land has concentrated focused energy to amplify, catalyze and accelerate the awakening, transformation and ascension. Thanks to the remarkable nature of these heighten locations, the veils are thinner and so multi-dimensional reality more easily accessed. The multidimensional realms are more readily available and higher guidance is in highest.
