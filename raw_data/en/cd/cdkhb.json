Accessed (insert date) [include page numbers, table number, etc. if applicable] Use of antiretrovirals in pediatric patients is evolving rapidly. These guidelines are updated regularly to provide current information.The most recent information is available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection Developed by the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnoud Center, UMDNJ The Health Resources and Services Administration The National Institutes of HealthAugust 16, 2010August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page i What's New in the Pediatric Guidelines? The updated Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection include the following changes made to the February 23, 2009, version of the guidelines. Key updates are also highlighted throughout the guidelines. Ratings for Primary Recommendations The key change prominent in the current guidelines is development of a ratings system to indicate strength and quality of evidence for each major recommendation. The strength of each recommendation is indicated by a letter (A = Strong, B = Moderate, C = Optional); the quality of the evidence supporting each recommendation is represented by a Roman numeral (I, II, III). In addition, because many pediatric recommendations will be based on data from clinical trials or observational studies in adults, with only safety and pharmacokinetic data in children, evidence ratings that are based on adult data will be indicated with an asterisk (*). Format Changes/New Sections Previous Appendix B: Characteristics of Available Antiretroviral Drugs and Supplement I: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information Information in the previous Appendix B: Characteristics of Available Antiretroviral Drugs and pevious Supplement I: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information of the February 23, 2009, guidelines has been combined into a new format with a table for each drug summarizing drug formulation, dosing recommendations, important adverse effects, and special instructions. Each table is followed by a short text section that inclu des important pediatric experience and references for that particular drug. Updated information on drugs is provided. Previous Supplement III: Adverse Drug Effects This supplement to the previous version of the guidelines describes specific adverse drug e ffects observed in children, including lactic acidosis, hepatic hematological complications, and hypersensitivity reactions and skin rashes. The supplement has been modified into a table format and included in the body of the current guidelines, with information on common causative drugs, estimated frequency of occurrence, timing of symptoms, risk factors, potential preventive measures, and suggested clinical management strategies and provides selected references regarding these toxicities in pediatric patients. Previous Supplement II: Managing Complications of HIV Infection in HIV -Infected Children on Antiretroviral Therapy This supplement on pain management and nutrition included in the previous version of the guidelines has been retired . (See Supplement II: Managing Complications of HIV Infection in HIV- Infected Children on Antiretroviral Therapy in the archived February 23, 2009, Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection at http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov .) Key Updates Updates to the various sections of the guidelines include the following new information/key changes: Diagnosis of HI V Infection in Infants Viral diagnostic testing at birth is recommended for infants at high risk of HIV infection, such as infants born to HIV- infected mothers who did not receive prenatal care or prenatal antiretroviral therapy or who had HIV viral loads > 1,000 copies/mL close to time of delivery (BIII). Viral diagnostic testing continues to be recommended for all HIV-exposed infants at age 14-21 days, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months (AII). August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page ii An HIV qualitative RNA assay (APTIMA HIV- 1 RNA Qualitative Assay) is an alternative diagnostic test that can be used for infant virologic diagnostic testing (AII). When to Start Antiretroviral therapy continues to be recommended for all children younger than 12 months of age regardless of clinical, immunologic, or virologic symptoms (AI). However, whereas prior guidelines said antiretroviral therapy could be considered for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children with CD4 >25% (or >350 cells/uL if age > 5 years) and HIV RNA >100,000 copies/mL, the current guidelines now rec ommend therapy in this situation (BII). Additionally, whereas prior guidelines recommended deferral of therapy for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children with CD4 > 25% (or > 350 cells/uL if age > 5 years) and HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL, the current guidelines say therapy can be considered or deferred (CIII). Specific recommendations are: o Initiation of antiretroviral therapy is recommended for children age 1 year with AIDS or significant symptoms (Clinical Category C or most Clinical Category B conditions), regardless of CD4 percentage/count or plasma HIV RNA level (AI*). o Initiation of antiretroviral therapy is also recommended for childre n age 1 year who have met the age-related CD4 threshold for initiating treatment (CD4 <25% for children 1 to <5 years of age (AII) and <350 cells/mm 3 for children 5 years of age (AI*), regardless of symptoms or plasma HIV RNA level). o Initiation of antiretroviral therapy is also recommended for children age 1 year who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms (Clinical Categories N and A or the following Clinical Category B conditions: single episode of serious bacterial infection or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis) and have CD4 25% for children 1 to <5 years of age or 350 cells/mm 3 for children 5 years of age and have plasma HIV RNA 100,000 copies/mL (BII). o Initiation of antiretroviral therapy may be considered or deferred for children age 1 year who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and who have CD4 25% for children 1 to <5 years of age and 350 cell/mm3 for children 5 years of age and have plasma HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL (CIII). What Drugs to Start: Initial Combination Therapy for Antiretro viral-Na\u00efve Children Recent data from clinical trials of nevirapine versus lopinavir/ritonavir -based therapy in children with single -dose nevirapine exposure for prevention of mother- to-child transmission of HIV are discussed. NNRTI -based therapy is not recommended for infants or children age <3 years with single-dose nevirapine exposure (AI). Darunavir in combination with low- dose ritonavir is now recommended as an alternative protease inhibitor for initial therapy in children age >6 years (AI*). Nelfinavir has been moved from an alternative protease inhibitor for initial therapy to a protease inhibitor for use in special circumstances in children age > 2 years (AII). Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV -Infected Children and Adolescents Results of se veral new studies regarding interventions to improve adherence in children and/or adolescents are described. Additional Updates References have been updated in many sections.

Included is information on the management of adverse events of antiretroviral drugs in children and details on pediatric data related to antiretroviral agents. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children, a working group of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (OARAC), reviews new data on an ongoing basis and provides regular updates to the guidelines. The guidelines are available on the AIDS info Web site at http:// aidsinfo .nih.gov . Separate sets of guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-exposed and - infected children [1] and for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected postpubertal adolescents and adults [2] are also available on the AIDS info Web site. Because these guidelines were developed for the United States, they may not be applicable in other countries. The World Health Organization provides guidelines for resource- limited settings at http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/arv/en . Since the development of the initial guidelines in 1993 (with the support of the Fran \u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnou d Center [FXBC] , University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey [ http://www.fxbcenter.org ]), dramatic advances in medical management have followed the results of clinical trials of antiretroviral combination th erapies in children. HIV mortality has decreased by more than 80%-90% since the introduction of protease inhibitor-containing combinations, and opportunistic and other related infections have significantly decreased in the era of highly active antiretrovir al therapy (HAART) [3-8]. Advances including resistance testing and the ability to measure antiretroviral drug levels have enabled clinicians to more carefully choose very effective initial regimens while preserving selected drugs and drug classes for second- or third -line regimens. Therapeutic strategies continue to focus on early initiation of antiretroviral regimens capable of maximally suppressing viral replication to prevent disease progression, preserve immunologic function, and reduce the development of resistance. At the same time, availability of new drugs and drug formulations has led to regimens that improve adherence with less frequent dosing schedules. Improved monitoring and dosing schedules have also led to a decrease in drug failure due to toxicity. The use of antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy in HIV- infected women has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the transmission rate to infants, which is currently less than 2% in the United States, and the number of infants with AIDS in the United States continues to decline [9]. Finally, children living with HIV infection are, as a group, growing older, bringing new challenges of adherence, drug resistance, and management of multiple drugs. Although the pathogenesis of HIV infection and the general virologic and immunologic principles underlying the use of antiretroviral therapy are similar for all HIV -infected people, there are unique considerations for HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents, including: Acquisition of infection through perinatal exposure for many infected children; In utero , intrapartum, and/or postpartum neonatal exposure to and other antiretroviral drugs in most perinatally infected children; Requirement for use of HIV virologic tests to diagnose perinatal HIV infection in infants younger than 18 months; Age- specific differences in CD4 cell counts; Changes in pharmacokinetic parameters with age caused by the continuing development and maturation of organ systems involved in drug metabolism and clearance; Differences in the clinical and virologic manifestations of perinatal HIV infection secondary to the occurrence of primary infection in growing, immunologically immature persons; and Special considerations associated with adherence to antiretroviral treatment for infants, children, and adolescents. These recommendations represent the current state of knowledge regarding the use of antiretroviral drugs in children and are based on published and unpublished data regarding the treatment of HIV infection in infants, August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 2 children, adolescents, and adults and, when no definitive data were available, the clinical expertise of the Panel members. The Panel intends the guidelines to be flexible and not to replace the clinical judgment of experienced health care providers. GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT PROCESS An outline of the composition of the Panel and the guidelines process can be found in Table 1. Table 1. Outline of the Guidelines Development Process Page 1 of 2 Topic Comment Goal of the Guidelines Provide guidance to HIV care practitioners on the optimal use of antiretroviral agents in HIV -1-infected infants, children, and adolescents (through puberty) in the United States. Panel members The Panel is composed of approximately 25 voting members who have expertise in the management of HIV infection in infants, children, and adolescents. Members include representatives from the Committee on Pediatric AIDS of the American Academy of Pediatrics and community represe ntatives with knowledge of pediatric HIV infection. The Panel also includes at least one representative from each of the following HHS agencies: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Resources and Serv ices Administration (HRSA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The U.S. government representatives are appointed by their respective agencies; nongovernmental members are selected after an open announcement to call for nominations. Each member serves on the Panel for a 3-year term with an option for reappointment. A list of current members can be found on page vi ii of this document. Financial disclosure All members of the Panel submit a written financial disclos ure annually. A list of the latest disclosures can be found in Appendix A of this document. Users of the guidelines Providers of care to HIV -infected infants, children, and adolescents Funding source Office of AIDS Resear ch, NIH Evidence collection The recommendations are generally based on studies published in peer-reviewed journals. On some occasions, particularly when new information may affect patient safety, unpublished data presented at major conferences or prepared by the FDA and/or manufacturers as warnings to the public may be used as evidence to revise the guidelines. Recommendation grading As described in Table 2 . Method of synthesizing data Each section of the guidelines is assigned to a small group of Panel members with expertise in the area of interest. The members synthesize the available data and propose a recommendation to the Panel. All proposals are discussed at monthly teleconferences and then are voted on by the Panel members before being endorsed as official recommendations. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 3 Topic Comment Other guidelines These guidelines focus on HIV -infected infants, children, and adolescents through puberty. Separate guidelines outline the use of antiretroviral therapy in pregnant HIV- infected women and interventions for prevention of mother- to-child transmission, antiretroviral therapy for nonpregnant HIV-infected adults and postpubertal adolescents, and antiretroviral prophylaxis for those who experience occupational or nonoccupational exposure to HIV. These guidelines are also available at the AIDS info Web site (http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov ). These guidelines focus on HIV-infected children from infancy through puberty. For more detailed discussion on issue s of treatment of postpubertal adolescents, the Panel defers to the designated expertise offered by the Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents. Update plan The Panel meets monthly by teleconference to review data that may warrant m odification of the guidelines. Updates may be prompted by new drug approvals (or new indications, formulations, or frequency of dosing), new significant safety or efficacy data, or other information that may have a significant impact on the clinical care o f patients. For cases in which significant new data become available that may affect patient safety, a warning announcement with the Panel's recommendations may be made on the AIDS info Web site until appropriate changes can be made in the guidelines document. Updated guidelines are available at the AIDS info Web site (http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov ). Public comments A 2-week public comment period follows release of the updated guidelines on the AIDS info Web site. T he Panel reviews comments received to determine whether additional revisions to the guidelines are indicated. The public may also submit comments to the Panel at any time at contactus@aidsinfo.nih.gov . Basis for Recommendations Recommendations in these guidelines are based upon scientific evidence and expert opinion. Each recommendation includes a letter ( A, B, or C ) that represents the strength of the recommendation and a Roman numeral ( I, II, or III) th at represents the quality of the evidence that supports the recommendation. Because licensure of drugs in children often relies on efficacy data from adult trials in addition to safety and pharmacokinetic data in children, recommendations for antiretroviral drugs may need to rely on data from clinical trials or studies in adults. Pediatric drug approval may be based on evidence from adequate and well- controlled investigations in adults if: (1) it is expected that the course of the disease and the effects o f the drug are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations to permit extrapolation of adult efficacy data to pediatric patients; (2) there are supplemental data on pharmacokinetics of the drug in children so that systemic exposure in adult s and children are similar; and (3) studies supporting the safety of the drug in pediatric patients are provided [10]. In addition, if there was a concern that concentration-response relationships may be different in children, studies relating activity of the drug- to-drug levels (pharmacodynamic data) in children should be available. Table 1. Outline of the Guidelines Development Process Page 2 of 2 August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 4 In many cases, there is substantially greater evidence from adult studies (especially randomized clinical trials) than from pediatric studies related to use of antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, for pediatric recommendations, the following rationale has been used when the quality of evidence from pediatric studies is limited: Quality of Evidence I Randomized Clinical Trial Data. In the absence of large pediatric randomized trials, adult data may be used if there are substantial pediatric data consistent with high - quality adult studies. o Quality of Evidence Rating I will be used if there are data from large randomized trials in children with clinical and/or validated la boratory endpoints. o Quality of Evidence Rating I* will be used if there are high- quality randomized clinical trial data in adults with clinical and/or validated laboratory endpoints and pediatric data from well - designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long- term clinical outcomes that are consistent with the adult studies. For example, if a randomized Phase III clinical trial in adults demonstrates a drug is effective in antiretroviral -na\u00efve patients and data from a nonrandomized pediatric trial demonstrate adequate and consistent safety and pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population, a rating of I* may be used for quality of evidence. Quality of Evidence Rating II Nonrandomized Clinical Trials or Observational Cohort Data. In the absence of large, well -designed, pediatric, nonrandomized trials or observational data, adult data may be used if there are sufficient pediatric data consistent with high -quality adult studies. o Quality of Evidence Rating II will be used if there a re data from well -designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohorts in children . o Quality of Evidence Rating II* will be used if there are well -designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in adults with supporting and consistent information from smaller nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data in children. For example, if a large observational study in adults demonstrates clinical benefit to initiating treatment at a certain CD4 cell count and observational data in children indicate that that a similar CD4 count is associated with clinical outcomes in children older than a specific age, a rating of II* may be used for quality of evidence. Quality of Evidence Rating III Expert opinion. The criteria do not differ for adults and children. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 5 Table 2. Rating Scheme for Recommendations Strength of Recommendation Quality of Evidence for Recommendation A: Strong recommendation for the statement B: Moderate recommendation for the statement C: Optional recommendation for the statement I: One or more randomized trials in children with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints I*: One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying dat a in children from one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long- term clinical outcomes II: One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in children with long - term clinical ou tcomes II*: One or more well -designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in adults with long - term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in children from one or more smaller nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data III: Expert opinion Studies that include children or children/adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescents CONCEPTS CONSIDERED IN THE FORMULATION OF PEDIATRIC TREATMENT GUIDELINES The following concepts were considered in the formulation of these guidelines. Prenatal HIV testing and counseling should be the standard of care for all pregnant women in the United States [11-13]. Identification of HIV -infected women before or during pregnancy is critical to providing optimal therapy for both infected women and their infants and for reduction of perinatal transmission. Access to prenatal care is essential for all pregnant women. Enrollment of pregnant HIV- infected women; their HIV -exposed newborns; and infected infants, children, and adolescents into clinical trials offers the best means of determining safe and effective therapies. The pharmaceutical industry and the federal government should continue collaboration that assures that drug formu lations suitable for administration to infants and children are available for all antiretroviral drugs produced. Although some information regarding the efficacy of antiretroviral drugs for children can be extrapolated from clinical trials involving adults , concurrent clinical trials for children are needed to determine the impact of the drug on specific manifestations of HIV infection in children, including growth, development, and neurologic disease. However, the absence of Phase III efficacy trials addressing pediatric -specific manifestations of HIV infection does not preclude the use of any approved antiretroviral drug in children. In areas where enrollment in clinical trials is possible, enrolling the child in available trials should be discussed with the caregivers of the child.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 6 Treatment of HIV infection in infants, children, and adolescents is rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly complex; therefore, wherever possible, their treatment should be managed by a specialist in pediatric and adolescent HIV infection. If this is not possible, such experts should be consulted. Effective management of the complex and diverse needs of HIV -infected infants, children, adolescents, and their families requires a multidisciplinary team approach that includes physicians, nurses, nutritionists, pharmacists, dentists, psychologists, social workers, and outreach workers. Health care providers considering antiretrovi ral treatment for infants, children, or adolescents should consider certain factors influencing adherence to therapy, including: availability and palatability of drug formulations; impact of the medication schedule on quality of life, including number of medications, frequency of administration, ability to coadminister with other prescribed medications, and need to take with or without food; ability of the child's caregiver or the adolescent to administer complex drug regimens and availability of resources that might be effective in facilitating adherence; and potential for drug interactions. The choice of initial antiretroviral regimen should include consideration of factors that may limit future treatment options, such as the presence of or potential for t he development of antiretroviral resistance. HIV resistance assays have proven useful in guiding initial therapy and in changing failing regimens, but expert clinical interpretation is required. Monitoring growth and development, short- and long-term drug toxicities, neurodevelopment, symptom management, and nutrition are all essential in the care of HIV -infected children because they may significantly influence quality of life.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 8 Identification of Perinatal HIV Exposure (Updated August 16, 2010) Panel's Recommendations: Universal coun seling and voluntary HIV testing early in pregnancy, including opt- out testing, are recommended as standard of care for all pregnant women in the United States ( AII). Repeat HIV testing is recommended in the third trimester for women who have negative HIV antibody tests earlier in pregnancy if they are at high risk of HIV infection because of behavior or residence in a high- prevalence area (AII). Women seen at labor with undocumented HIV status should undergo rapid HIV antibody testing, and women with a pos itive antibody test should initiate intrapartum antiretroviral prophylaxis ( AII). If acute HIV infection is suspected in a pregnant woman, a virologic test (e.g., plasma HIV RNA assay) should be performed because serologic testing may be negative at this early stage of infection (AII). Women who have not been tested for HIV prior to or during labor should be offered rapid HIV antibody testing during the immediate postpartum period or their newborns should undergo rapid HIV antibody testing; if the mother or infant is HIV antibody positive, infant antiretroviral prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible and the mother advised not to breastfeed pending results of confirmatory HIV antibody testing ( AII). Appropriate treatment of HIV -infected infants requires HIV -exposed infants to be identified as soon as possible, which can be best accomplished through the identification of HIV-infected women before or during pregnancy. Universal HIV counseling and voluntary HIV testing, including consent using an opt-out approach, are recommended as the standard of care for all pregnant women in the United States by the Panel, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [1-6]. An opt-out approach notifies a pregnant woman that HIV testing will be performed as part of routine care unless she chooses not to be tested for HIV [7]. Early identification of HIV -infected women is crucial for their health and for the care of HIV -exposed and HIV-infected children. Knowledge of antenatal maternal HIV infection enables: HIV-infected women to receive appropriate antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections for their own health; Provision of antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis during pregnancy, during labor, and to the newborn to reduce the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child [8]; Counseling of HIV -infec ted women about the indications for and potential benefits of scheduled cesarean section delivery to reduce perinatal HIV transmission [8-11]; Counseling of HIV -infected women about the risks of HIV transmission through breast milk and advising against breastfeeding in the United States and other countries where safe alternatives to breast milk are available [12]; Initiation of prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) in all HIV-exposed infants with indeterminate HIV infection status or who have documented HIV infection beginning at age 4 to 6 weeks [13]; and Early diagnostic evaluation of HIV- exposed infants to permit early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in infected infants [2, 14] . August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 9 REPEAT HIV TESTING I N THE THIRD TRIMESTE R Repeat HIV testing is recommended in the th ird trimester, preferably <36 weeks gestation, for women with initially negative HIV antibody tests who are at high risk of HIV infection and may be considered for all pregnant women. A second HIV test during the third trimester is recommended for women who meet 1 or more of the following criteria: women who receive health care in jurisdictions with elevated incidence of HIV or AIDS among women 15-45 years of age; women who receive health care in facilities in which prenatal screening identifies at least 1 HIV -infected pregnant woman per 1,000 women screened; women who are known to be at high risk of acquiring HIV (e.g., injection drug users or partners of injection drug users, women who exchange sex for money or drugs, women who are sex partners of HIV- infected persons, and women who have had a new or more than 1 sex partner during this pregnancy or diagnosis of a new sexually transmitted infection during pregnancy); and women who have signs or symptoms of acute HIV infection [3-4, 15] . Women who have declined testing earlier in pregnancy should have testing offered again during the third trimester . There is evidence that the risk of HIV acquisition may be significantly higher during pregnancy than in the postpartum period [16]. If acute HIV infection is suspected, a virologic test (e.g., plasma HIV RNA assay) should be performed because serologic testing may be negative at this early stage of infection . RAPID HIV TESTING DURING LABOR IN WOMEN WITH UNKNOWN HIV STATUS Use of rapid test kits or an expedited enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) to detect HIV antibody is recommended to screen women who are seen at labor and have undocumented HIV status in order to identify HIV exposure in their infants [2-4, 14] . Any hospital offering intrapartum care should have rapid HIV testing available and should have in place policies and procedures to assure that staff are prepared to provide patie nt education about rapid HIV testing, that appropriate antiretroviral medications are available whenever needed, and that follow -up procedures for women found to be HIV infected and their infants are in place. Rapid tests have been found to be feasible, accurate, timely, and useful both in providing prompt access to intrapartum and neonatal antiretroviral prophylaxis and in reducing perinatal HIV transmission [17]. Results of rapid tests can be obtained within minutes to a few hours and are as accurate as standard ELISA antibody testing [18-19]. A positive rapid HIV test result must be followed by a confirmatory test such as a Western blot (or immunofluorescent antibody [IFA]); a standard ELISA should not be used as a confirmatory test for a rapid HIV antibody test [19]. A negative single rapid test does not need confirmation. The immediate initiation of antiretroviral prophylax is for prevention of mother- to-child transmission of HIV is strongly recommended while awaiting confirmatory testing results after an initial positive rapid HIV test [2, 6, 8, 14] . HIV COUNSELING AND TESTING DURING POSTNATAL PERIOD Women who have not been tested for HIV prior to or during labor should be offered rapid testing during the immediate postpartum period or their newborns should undergo rapid HIV antibody testing, with counseling and consent of the mother unless state law allows testing without consent [3, 8, 20 -21]. Because neonatal antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible after birth to be effective in preventing mother- to-child tra nsmission, use of rapid HIV antibody assays or expedited ELISA testing to allow prompt identification of HIV -exposed infants is critical. It is strongly recommended that infant antiretroviral prophylaxis be initiated while awaiting confirmatory testing results after an initial positive rapid test in the mother or the infant, and women with positive rapid HIV test results should be advised not to initiate breastfeeding pending results of confirmatory testing. If the confirmatory test is negative, the infant antiretroviral prophylaxis can be discontinued and the mother can initiate breastfeeding. Mechanisms should be developed to facilitate rapid HIV screening for infants who have been abandoned and are in the custody of the state.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 11 Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants (Updated August 16, 2010) Panel's Recommendations: Virologic assays that directly detect HIV must be used to diagnose HIV infection in infants younger than 18 months, because maternal HIV antibody may persist in this age group and give a false-positive antibody test in an uninfected child (AII). Virologic diagnostic testing in infants with known perinatal HIV exposure is recommended at age 14-21 days; 1 -2 months; and 4- 6 months ( AII). Virologic diagnostic testing at birth should be considered for infants at high risk of HIV infection (BIII). HIV DNA PCR and HIV RNA assays are recommended as preferred virologic assays (AII). Confirmation of HIV infection should be based on two positive virologic tests from separate blood samples (AI). Definitive exclusion of HIV infection should be based on at least two negative virologic tests (one at > 1 month and one at > 4 mont hs of age) (AII). Some experts confirm the absence of HIV infection at 12-18 months of age in infants with prior negative virologic tests by performing an antibody test to document loss of HIV antibody ( BIII). In children age 18 months, HIV antibody assays alone can be used for diagnosis ( AII). CHOICE OF DIAGNOSTIC TEST HIV infection can be definitively diagnosed through the use of virologic assays in most nonbreastfed HIV- infected infants by 1 month of age and in virtually all infected infants by 4 months of age. Tests for antibodies to HIV, including newer rapid tests, do not establish the presence of HIV infection in infants because of transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies; therefore a virologic t est should be used [1]. A positive virologic test (i.e., detection of HIV by DNA polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or RNA assays) indicates likely HIV infection and should be confirmed by a repeat virologic test on a second specimen as soon as possible after the first test result becomes available. HIV culture is not used for routine HIV diagnostic testing. The use of the currently approved HIV p24 antigen assay is not recommended for infant diagnosis in the United Sta tes because the sensitivity and specificity of the assay in the first months of life are less than that of other HIV virologic tests [2-3]. HIV DNA PCR HIV DNA PCR is a sensitive technique used to detect specific HIV viral DNA in a patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The sensitivity of a single HIV DNA PCR test performed at <48 hours of age is less than 40% but increases to more than 90% by 2-4 weeks of age [4-8]. In 38% (90% confidence interval [CI] = 29%-46%) of infected children had positive HIV DNA PCR tests by 48 hours of age [9]. No substantial change in sensitivity during the first week of life was observed, but sensitivity increased rapidly during the second week, with 93% of infected children (90% CI = 76%-97%) testing positive by HIV DNA PCR by age 14 days. By age 28 days, HIV DNA PCR had 96% sensitivity and 99% specificity to identify HIV proviral DNA in PBMCs. HIV RNA Assays HIV quantitative RNA assays detect extracellular viral RNA in the plasma and are as sensitive as HIV DNA PCR for early diagnosis of HIV infection in HIV-exposed infants. Studies have demonstrated sensitivities of 25%-40% during the first weeks of life, increasing to 90%-100% by 2 -3 months of age [7-8, 10- 16]. Similarly, specificity is comparable between the two tests, although the detection of low levels of HIV RNA August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 12 (<5,000 copies/mL) may not be reproducible and tests with low levels of HIV RNA should be repeated before they are interpreted as documenting the presence of HIV infection in an infant. An HIV RNA assay can be used as the confirmatory test for infants who have an initial positive HIV DNA PCR test. In addition to providing virologic confirmation of infection status, the expense of repeat HIV DNA PCR testing is spared and an HIV RNA measurement is available to assess baseline viral load . HIV RNA assays may be more sensitive than HIV DNA PCR for detecting HIV non-subtype B (see HIV subtype section below). However, although HIV DNA PCR remains positive even in individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy [17], it is unknown whether the sensitivity of RNA assays might be affected by maternal antenatal treatment with combination antiretroviral drugs and/or infant antiretroviral prophylaxis. HIV qualitative RNA assay (APTIMA HIV -1 RNA Qualitative Assay) is an alternative diagnostic test that can be used for infant testing [18-21]. HIV Culture HIV culture is not used for routine HIV diagnostic testing. It is generally not available outside of research laboratories. Although HIV culture has a sensitivity similar to that of HIV DNA PCR [22], it is more complex and expensive to perform than DNA PCR or RNA assays and may require 2-4 weeks for definitive results. ISSUES RELATED TO DI AGNOSIS OF NON -SUBTYPE B HIV INFECT ION Although HIV subtype B is the predominant viral subtype found in the United States, non- subtype B viruses predominate in some other parts of the world, such as subtype C in regions of Africa and India and subtype CRF01 in much of Southeast Asia [23-25]. Currently available HIV DNA PCR tests are less sensitive in the detection of non-subtype B HIV, and false- negative HIV DNA PCR assays have been reported in infants infected with non-subtype B HIV [26-29]. In an evaluation of perinatally infected infants diagnosed in New York State in 2001-2002, 16.7% of infants were infected with a non-subtype B strain of HIV, compared with 4.4% of infants diagnosed between 1998 and 1999 [30]. Some of the currently available HIV RNA assays hav e improved sensitivity for detection of non-subtype B HIV infection [31-34], although even these assays may not detect or properly quantify some non-B subtypes, particularly the more uncommon group subtypes [33, 35- 36]. When non-subtype B perinatal exposure is suspected in infants with negative HIV DNA PCR, repeat testing using one of the newer RNA assays shown to be more sensitive in the detection of non-subtype B HIV is recommended (e.g., Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor 1.5 [Roche Molecular -1 Incorporated, Des Plaines, IL] HIV- 1 RNA Qualitative Assay [Gen -Probe Incorporated San Diego, CA]). When evaluating an infant whose mother and/or father comes from an area endemic for non-subtype B HIV, such as Africa and Southeast Asia, clinicians should consider conducting initial testing using one of the assays more sensitive for non -subtype B virus (for example, one of the newer RNA assays mentioned above) [33, 37] . In a child with negative HIV DNA PCR and RNA assays but in whom non-subtype B infection is suspected, the clinician should consult with an expert in pediatric HIV infection and the child should undergo close clinical mon itoring and definitive HIV serologic testing at age 18 months. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 13 TIMING OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING IN INFANTS W ITH KNOWN PERINATAL HIV EXPOSURE Virologic diagnostic testing of the HIV -exposed infant should be performed at age 14-21 days, at age 1-2 months, and at age 4 -6 months. Virologic diagnostic testing at birth should be considered for infants at high risk of HIV infection. HIV infection is diagnosed by two positive HIV virologic tests performed on separate blood samples, regardless of child's age. A pos itive HIV antibody test with confirmatory Western blot (or IFA) at age 18 months confirms HIV infection with the exception of rare late seroreverters (see HIV antibody section below) [1]. HIV infection can be pre sumptively excluded in nonbreastfed infants with two or more negative virologic tests, with one test obtained at 14 days of age and one obtained at 1 month of age; or one negative virologic test result obtained at 2 months of age; or one negative HIV antibody test result obtained at 6 months of age [1, 38]. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for infants with indeterminate HIV infection status starting at 4 -6 weeks of age until they are determined to be HIV uninfected or presumptively uninfected with HIV [39]. Thus, initiation of PCP prophylaxis can be avoided or, if prophylaxis was initiated, can be stopped, if the infant has negative virologic tests at 2 weeks of age and at 1 month of age, or if virologic testing is negative at or beyond 2 months of age. Definitive exclusio n of HIV infection in a nonbreastfed infant is based on two or more negative virologic tests, with one obtained at 1 month of age and one at 4 months of age, or two negative HIV antibody tests from separate specimens obtained at 6 months of age. For bot h presumptive and definitive exclusion of HIV infection, the child must have no other laboratory (e.g., no positive virologic test results or low CD4 count/percent) or clinical evidence of HIV infection. Many experts confirm the absence of HIV infection in infants with negative virologic tests by performing an antibody test at 12-18 months of age to document seroreversion to HIV antibody negative status. Virologic Testing at Birth (Optional) Virologic testing at birth may be considered for newborns at high risk of HIV infection, such as infants born to HIV-infected mothers who did not receive prenatal care, prenatal antiretroviral therapy, or who had HIV viral loads > 1,000 copies/mL close to time of delivery. As many as 30% -40% of HIV -infected infants can be identified by 48 hours of age [4, 9] . Blood samples from the umbilical cord should not be used for diagnostic evaluations due to the potential contamination with maternal blood. Working definitions have been proposed to differentiate acquisition of HIV infection during the intrauterine period from the intrapartum period. Infants who have a positive virologic test at or before age 48 hours are considered to have early (i.e., intrauterine) infection, whereas infants who have a negative virologic test during the first week of life and subsequent positive tests are considered to have late (i.e., intrapartum) infection [40]. Some researchers have proposed that infants with early infection may have more r apid disease progression than those with late infection and therefore should receive more aggressive therapy [40-41]. However, data from prospective cohort studies have demonstrated that although early differences i n HIV RNA levels were present between infants with a positive HIV culture within 48 hours of birth and those with a first positive culture after 7 days of age, these differences were no longer statistically significant after 2 months of age [42]. HIV RNA levels after the first month of life were more predictive of rapid disease progression than the time at which HIV culture tests were positive [42]. Virologic Testing at Age 14- 21 Days The diagnostic sensitivity of virologic assays increases rapidly by age 2 weeks [9], and early identification of infection would permit discontin uation of neonatal antiretroviral prophylaxis and further evaluation for initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (see When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral- Na\u00efve HIV - Infected Infants Younger than 12 Months and Table 7 ). August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 14 Virologic Testing at Age 1- 2 Months Infants with negative virologic tests before 1 month of age should be retested at 1 2 months of age. Most HIV - exposed neonates will receive 6 weeks o f neonatal antiretroviral prophylaxis. Although antiretroviral agents could theoretically affect the predictive value of HIV virologic testing in neonates, the use of antepartum /intrapartum/neonatal zidovudine single -drug prophylaxis did not delay the detection of HIV by culture in infants in PACTG protocol 076 and has not decreased the sensitivity and predictive values of many virologic assays [10, 12- 13, 16, 38, 43 -44]. The affect of prenatal and neonatal combinati on antiretroviral regimens on the sensitivity of virologic tests for HIV -exposed infants needs to be examined. An infant with two negative virologic tests, one at 14 days and one at 1 month of age can be viewed as presumptively uninfected and would not need to initiate PCP prophylaxis, assuming the child has no laboratory (e.g., no positive virologic test results or low CD4 count) or clinical evidence of HIV infection. Virologic Testing at Age 4- 6 Months HIV-exposed children who have had repeatedly nega tive virologic assays at 14 -21 days of age and at 1-2 months of age should be retested at 4-6 months of age for definitive exclusion of HIV infection. Antibody Testing at Age 6 Months or Older Two or more negative HIV antibody tests performed a t 6 months of age can also be used to definitively exclude HIV infection in HIV -exposed children with no clinical or virologic laboratory evidence of HIV infection. Antibody Testing at Age 12-18 Months to Document Seroreversion Many experts confirm the absence of HIV infection in infants with negative virologic tests by performing serology repeated between ages 12 -18 months to confirm that maternal HIV antibodies transferred to the infant in utero have disappeared, if there has not been previous confirmation of two negative antibody tests. Although the proportion of infants who serorevert between 15 and 18 months of age is close to 100%, as many as 95% of infants may serorevert by 12 months of age; factors that might influence the time to seroreversion include the staging of maternal disease or the sensitivity of the assay [1, 45- 48]. Antibody Testing at Age 18 Months or Older HIV infection can be diagnosed in children 18 months of age or older with a positive HIV antibody test and a confirmatory Western blot (or IFA). On rare occasions, nonbreastfed HIV -exposed infants with no other route of HIV transmission (e.g., sexual abuse or receipt of solid food premasticated by an HIV-1-infected caregiver) and no prior clinical or virologic laboratory evidence of HIV infection may have residual antibody at 18 months of age. These infants should have monthly repeat antibody testing because they may be late seroreverters, as late as 24 months [48]. References 1. Schneider E, Whitmore S, Glynn KM, et al.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 18 Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection (Updated August 16, 2010) Panel's Recommendations : The age of the child must be considered when interpreting the risk of disease progression based on CD4 percentage or count and plasma HIV RNA level ( AII). For any given CD4 percentage or count, younger children, especially those in the first year of life, face higher risk of progression than do older children. In children younger than 5 years of age, CD4 percentage is preferred for monitoring immune status because of age -related changes in absolute CD4 count in this age group ( AII). CD4 percentage or count should be measured at the time of diagnosis of HIV infection and at least every 3-4 months thereafter (AIII). Plasma HIV RNA should be measured to assess viral load at the time of diagnosis of HIV infection and at least every 3 -4 months thereafter ( AIII). More frequent CD4 cell and plasma HIV RNA monitoring should be considered in infants younger than 6-12 months of age; in children with suspected clinical, immunologic, or virologic deterioration; to confirm an abnormal value; or when initiating or changing therapy ( AIII). An ultrasensitive viral load assay should be used to confirm that antiretroviral therapy is producing maximal suppression of viremia ( AIII). IMMUNOLOGIC MONITORING IN CHILDREN Clinicians interpreting CD4 count for children must consider age as a variable. CD4 count and percentage values in healthy infants who are not infected with HIV are considerably higher than values observed in uninfected adults and slowly decline to adult values by age 5 years [1-2]. In children younger than 5 years of age, the absolute CD4 count tends to vary more with age within an individual child than does CD4 percentage. Therefore, in HIV -infected children younger than 5 years of age, CD4 percentage is preferred for monitoring immune status, whereas absolute CD4 count can be used in older children [3-5]. In HIV -infected children, as in infected adults, the CD4 count and percentage decline as HIV infection progresses, and patients with lower CD4 values have a poorer prognosis than patients with higher values ( Tables 3-5 ). Consequently, CD4 values should be obtained as soon as possible after a child has a positive test for HIV an d subsequently every 3-4 months. Increased frequency of evaluations may be needed for children with suspected clinical, immunologic, or virologic deterioration; to confirm an abnormal value; or when initiating or changing therapy. Because young infants with HIV infection may have rapid disease progression [6-7], some experts monitor CD4 percentage more frequently (e.g., every 1-2 months) in untreated infants younger than 6 to 12 months of age. Because of the risk of rapid progression, initiation of antiretroviral treatment is now recommended for all HIV -infected infants younger than 12 months of age (see When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral -Na\u00efve Child ren). For adolescents who are adherent to therapy with sustained viral suppression and stable clinical status for more than 2-3 years, some experts monitor CD4 counts and HIV RNA levels less frequently. The prognostic value of CD4 percentage and HIV RNA copy number was assessed in a large individual patient meta -analysis (the HIV Pediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study), which incorporated clinical and laboratory data from 17 pediatric studies and included 3,941 HIV- infected children receiving either no therapy or only zidovudine monotherapy [4]. The analysis looked at the short- term (12 -month) risk of developing AIDS or death based on the child's age and selected values of CD4 percentage and HIV RNA copy number at baseline. Figures 1 and 2 and Table 3 depict a ge-associated 1 -year risk of developing AIDS or death as a function of CD4 percentage. In a separate analysis of this data set, predictive value of absolute CD4 cell count for risk of death or AIDS/death in HIV- infected children 5 years of age or older was similar to that observed in August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 19 young adults, with an increase in the risk of mortality when CD4 cell count fell less than 350 cells/mm3 (Table 4 and Figure 3 ) [3, 8]. The risk of disease progression associated with a specific CD4 percentage or count varies with the age of the child. Infants in the first year of life experience higher risks of progression or death than older children for any given CD4 stratum. For example, comparing a 1-year -old child with CD4 percentage of 25% to a 5- year-old child with the same CD4 percentage, there is an approximately fourfold increase in the risk of AIDS and sixfold increase in the risk of death in the 1- year-old child ( Figures 1 and 2 ). Children 5 years of age or older have a lower risk of progression than younger children, with the increase in risk of AIDS or death corresponding to absolute CD4 levels more similar to those in young adults ( Figure 3 ). In the HIV Pediatric Prognostic Marker Collaborative Study, there were no deaths among children 5 years of age or older with CD4 count greater than 350 cells/mm 3, although in younger children there continued to be a significant risk of death even with a CD4 cell count greater than 500 cells/mm3 (Table 4 ). These risk profiles form the rationale for recommendations on when to initiate therapy in a treatment- na\u00efve HIV-infected child (see When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral- Na\u00efve Children ). A Web site using the meta -analysis from the HIV Pediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study (HPPMCS) is available to estimate the short -term risk of progression to AIDS or death in the absence of effective antiretroviral therapy according to age and the most recent CD4 percentage or HIV- 1 RNA viral load measurement (http://hppmcs.org ) [4]. Measurement of CD4 values can be associated with considerable intrapatient variation [5]. Even mild intercurrent illness or the receipt of vaccinations can produce a transient decrease in CD4 count and percentage; thus, CD4 values are best measured when patients are clinically stable. No modification in therapy should be made in response to a change in CD4 values until the change has been substantiated by at least a second determination, with a minimum of 1 week between measurements. HIV RNA MONITORING IN CHILDREN Viral burden in peripheral blood can be determined by using quantitative HIV RNA assays. During the period of primary infection in adults, HIV RNA copy number initially rises to high peak levels and then declines by as much as 2 -3 log 10 copies to reach a stable lower level (the virologic set point) approximately 6 12 months following acute infection [9-10]. In infected adults, the viral set point correlates with the subsequent risk of disease progression or death [11-12]. On the basis of data from studies in infected adults, recommendations for the use of HIV RNA copy number in managing antiretroviral therapy have been developed for adults [13]. These recommendations also are applicable to infected adolescents. The HIV RNA pattern in perinatally infected infants differs from that in infected adults and adolescents . High HIV RNA copy numbers persist in infected children for prolonged periods [14-15]. In one prospective study, HIV RNA levels generally were low at birth (i.e., <10,000 copies/mL), increased to high values by age 2 months (most infants had values >100,000 copies/mL, ranging from undetectable to nearly 10 million copies/mL), and then decreased slowly; the mean HIV RNA level during the first year of life was 185,000 copies/mL [16]. Additionally, in contrast to the adult pattern, after the first year of life, HIV RNA copy number slowly declines over the next few years [16-19]. This pattern probably reflects the lower efficiency of an immature, but developing, immune system in containing viral replication and possibly the rapid expansion of HIV -susceptible cells that occurs with somatic growth [20]. High HIV RNA levels (i.e., >299,000 copies/mL) in infants age <12 months have been correlated with disease progression and death, but RNA levels overlap considerably in young infants who have rapid disease progression and those who do not [14, 16] . High RNA levels (i.e., levels of >100,000 copies/mL) in older children have also been associated with high risk of disease progression and mortality, particularly if CD4 percentage is <15% ( Table 5) [18-19]. The most robust data set available to elucidate the predictive value of plasma RNA for disease progression in children was assembled in the HIV Pediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study (see Immunologic Monitoring in Children ) [4]. As for CD4 percent age, analyses were performed for age -associated risk in the context of plasma RNA levels in a cohort of children receiving either August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 20 no therapy or only zidovudine monotherapy. Similar to data from previous studies [18-1 9], the risk of clinical progression to AIDS or death dramatically increases when HIV RNA exceeds 100,000 copies (5.0 log 10 copies)/mL; at lower values, only older children show much variation in risk ( Figures 4 and 5 and Table 3 ). At any given level of HIV RNA, infants younger than 1 year of age were at higher risk of progression than older children, although these differences were less striking than those observed for the CD4 percentage data. Desp ite data indicating that high plasma HIV RNA concentrations are associated with disease progression, the predictive value of specific HIV RNA concentrations for disease progression and death for an individual child is moderate [18]. HIV RNA concentration may be difficult to interpret during the first year of life because values are high and are less predictive of disease progression risk than in older children [15]. In both HIV- infected children and adults, CD4 percentage or count and HIV RNA copy number are independent predictors of disease progression and mortality risk, and use of the two markers together more accurately defines prognosis [18-19, 21- 23]. HIV RNA copy number should be assessed as soon as possible after a child has a positive virologic test for HIV and every 3 -4 months thereafter; increased frequency of evaluations may be needed for children experiencing virologic, immunologic, or clinical deterioration; to confirm an abnormal value; or when initiating or changing antiretroviral therapy (see Antiretroviral Treatment Failure in Infants, Children, and Adolescents ). Because young infants with HIV infection may have rapid disease progression, some experts monitor HIV RNA concentration more frequently (e.g., every 1 -2 months) in untreated infants younger than 6-12 months of age. Methodological Considerations in Interpretation and Comparability of HIV RNA Assays The use of HIV RNA assays for clinical purposes requires specific considerations [24], which are discussed more completely elsewhere [13]. Several different methods can be used for quantitating HIV RNA, each has a different level of sensitivity. Although the results of the assays are c orrelated, the absolute HIV RNA copy number obtained from a single specimen tested by two different assays can differ by twofold (0.3 log 10 units ) or more [25-28]. There are currently five FDA -approved viral load a ssays using one of three different methodologies: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) quantitative PCR assays: the Amplicor HIV -1 Monitor Test, version 1.5 (Roche Diagnostics), for which the lower limit of detection differs between the \"ultrasensitive\" the Real Time HIV -1 Assay (Abbott Molecular Incorporated); HIV-1 nucleic test (NucliSens HIV -1 QT, bioMerieux); and HIV-1 in branched chain nucleic acid probe assay (bDNA) (VERSANT HIV-1 RNA 3.0 Assay, Bayer). The lower limits of detection of the assays differ (<40 copies/mL for the Abbott Real Time HIV test, s/mL for Amplicor of ultrasensitive viral load assays to confirm that antiretroviral th erapy is producing maximal suppression of viremia is recommended. Because of the variability of assay techniques and quantitative HIV RNA measurements between these assays, a single HIV RNA assay method should be used consistently for monitoring an individual patient, if possible. The predominant virus subtype in the United States is B, which is the subtype for which all initial assays were targeted. Current kit configurations for all companies have been designed to detect and quantitate essentially all viral subtypes, with the exception of the uncommon O subtypes [29-30]. This is important for many regions of the world where non-B subtypes are predominant, as well as for the United States, where a small subset of individuals are infected with non-B viral subtypes [31-33]. Choice of HIV RNA assay, particularly for young children, may be influenced by the amount of blood required for the assay. The NucliSens assay requires the August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 21 least amount of blood (100 \u00b5L of plasma), followed by the RT PCR assays such as Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor (200 \u00b5L of plasma) and the VERSANT assays (1 mL of plasma). Biologic variation in HIV RNA levels within one person is well documented. In adults, repeate d measurement of HIV RNA levels using the same assay can vary by as much as threefold (0.5 log 10) in either direction over the course of a day or on different days [13, 21, 27] . This biologic variation may be greate r in infected infants and young children. In children with perinatally acquired HIV infection, RNA copy number slowly declines even without therapy during the first several years after birth, although it persists at higher levels than those observed in mos t infected adults [16-18]. This decline is most rapid during the first 12-24 months after birth, with an average decline of approximately 0.6 log 10 per year; a slower decline continues until approximately 4 - 5 years of age (average decline of 0.3 log 10 per year). This inherent biologic variability must be considered when interpreting changes in RNA copy number in children. Thus, only changes after repeated testing greater than fivefold (0.7 log 10) in infants younger than 2 years of age and greater than threefold (0.5 log 10) in children 2 years of age and older should be considered reflective of a biologically and clinically substantial change. No alteration in therapy should be made as a result of a change in HIV copy number unless the change is confirmed by a second measurement. Because of the complexities of HIV RNA testing and the age- related changes in HIV RNA in children, interpretation of HIV RNA levels for clinical decision making should be done by or in consul tation with an expert in pediatric HIV infection.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 30 Treatme nt Recommendations (Updated August 16, 2010) GENERAL CONSIDERATIO NS Treatment of pediatric HIV infection in the United States has evolved since antiretroviral therapy began in the late 1980s. Prior to the availability of antiretroviral drugs for children, care focused on prevention and management of HIV -related complications and provision of palliative care. Initial studies of monotherapy in children in the early 1990s demonstrated significant clinical and immunologic benefit with treatment [1-4]; further research demonstrated that combination therapy (initially dual- NRTI treatment) led to better clinical, immunologic, and virologic outcomes than monotherapy [5]. Currently, highly active combination regimens including at least three drugs are recommended; such regimens have been associated with enhanced survival, reduction in opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection, improved growth and neurocognitive function, and improved quality of life in children [6-10]. In the United States and the United Kingdom, significant declines (81%-93%) in mortality have been reported in HIV- infected children between 1994 and 2006, concomitant with increased use of highly active combination regimens [11-12]; significant declines in HIV -related morbidity and hospitalizations in children have been observed in the United States and Europe over the same time period [10, 12] . The increased survival of HIV -infected children is associated with challenges in selecting successive new antiretroviral drug regimens. Additionally, therapy is associated with short- and long-term toxicities, some of which are only now beginning to be recognized in children [13-14]. Antiretroviral drug -resistant virus can develop in both multidrug experienced children and children who received i nitial regimens containing one or two drugs that incompletely suppressed viral replication. Additionally, drug resistance may be seen in antiretroviral-na\u00efve children who have become infected with HIV despite maternal/infant antiretroviral prophylaxis [15-16]. Thus, decisions about when to start therapy and what drugs to choose in antiretroviral-na\u00efve children and on how to best treat antiretroviral- experienced children remain complex. Whenever possible, decisions regarding the management of pediatric HIV infection should be directed by or made in consultation with a specialist in pediatric and adolescent HIV infection. Treatment of antiretroviral -na\u00efve children (when and what to start), when to change therapy, and tr eatment of antiretroviral -experienced children will be discussed in separate sections of the guidelines. A number of factors need to be considered in making decisions about initiating and changing antiretroviral therapy in children, including: severity of HIV disease and risk of disease progression, as determined by age, presence or history of HIV- related or AIDS -defining illnesses (see pediatric clinical staging system for HIV, Table 6 ) [17-18], level of CD4 cell immunosuppression, and magnitude of HIV plasma viremia; availability of appropriate (and palatable) drug formulations and pharmacokinetic information on appropriate dosing in the child's age group; potency, complexity (e.g., dosing frequency, food and fluid requirements), and potential short- and long-term adverse effects of the antiretroviral regimen; effect of initial regimen choice on later therapeutic options; presence of comorbidity, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C virus infection, or chronic renal or liver disease, that could affect drug choice; potential antiretroviral drug interactions with other prescribed, over- the-counter, or complementary/alternative medications taken by the child; and the ability of the caregive r and child to adhere to the regimen. The following recommendations provide general guidance for decisions related to treatment of HIV- infected children, and flexibility should be exercised according to a child's individual circumstances. Guidelines for treatment of HIV -infected children are evolving as new data from clinical trials become available. Although August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 31 prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials offer the best evidence for formulation of guidelines, most antiretroviral drugs are approved for use in pediatric patients based on efficacy data from clinical trials in adults, with supporting pharmacokinetic and safety data from Phase I/II trials in children. Additionally, efficacy has been defined in most adult trials based on surrogate marker data, as opposed to clinical endpoints. For the development of these guidelines, the Panel reviewed relevant clinical trials published in peer- reviewed journals or in abstract form, with attention to data from pediatric populations when available. GOALS OF ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATM ENT Current antiretroviral therapies do not eradicate HIV infection due to the long half- life of latently infected CD4 cells [19-21]; some data suggest that the half -life of intracellular HIV pr oviral DNA is even longer in infected children than in adults (median 14 months vs. 5-10 months, respectively) [21]. Thus, based on currently available data, HIV causes a chronic infection likely requiring treatment for life once a child starts therapy. The goals of antiretroviral therapy for HIV -infected children include: reducing HIV -related mortality and morbidity; restoring and/or preserving immune function; maximally and durably suppressing viral replication; minimizing drug- related toxicity; maintaining normal physical growth and neurocognitive development; and improving quality of life. Strategies to achieve these goals require complex balancing of sometimes competing considerations. Use and selection of comb ination antiretroviral therapy: At present, the treatment of choice for HIV -infected children is at least three drugs, which include at least two classes of antiretroviral drugs. The Panel has recommended several preferred and alternative regimens (see What Drugs to Start: Initial Combination Therapy for Antiretroviral -Na\u00efve Children ). The most appropriate regimen for an individual child depends on multiple factors, including age of the child and availability of appropriate drug formulations; the potency, complexity, and toxicity of the regimen; the child and caregiver's ability to adhere to the regimen; the child's home situation; and the child's antiretroviral treatment history. Drug sequencing and preservation of future treatment options: The choice of antiretroviral treatment regimens should include consideration of future treatment options, such as the presence of or potential for drug resistance. Multiple changes in antiretroviral drug regimens can rapidly exhaust treatment options and should be avoided unless required (e.g., severe toxicity or intolerance or significant clinical, immunologic, or virologic progression). Appropriate sequencing of drugs for use in initial and second- line thera py can preserve future treatment options and is another strategy to maximize long-term benefit from therapy. Currently, recommendations for initial therapy are to use two classes of drugs two NRTIs combined with either an NNRTI or a PIthereby sparing thre e classes of drugs for later use. Maximizing adherence: As discussed in Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV -Infected Children and Adolescents , lack of adherence to prescribed regimens can lead to subtherapeutic levels of antiretroviral medications, which enhances the risk of the development of drug resistance and likelihood of virologic failure. Participation by the caregivers and child in the decision -making process is crucial. Issues related to adherence to therapy should be fully assessed, discussed, and addressed with the child's caregiver and the child (when age appropriate) before the decision to initiate therapy is made. Potential problems should be identified and resolved prior to starting therapy, even if this delays initiation of therapy. Additionally, frequent follow-up is important to provide assessment of virologic response to therapy, drug intolerance, viral resistance, and adherence. Finally, in patients who experience virol ogic failure, it is critical to fully assess adherence before making changes to the antiretroviral regimen.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 35 When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral - Na\u00ef ve Children (Updated August 16, 2010) The choice of whether to start therapy early, while an individual is still asymptomatic, versus delaying therapy until clinical or immu nologic deterioration occurs continues to generate considerable controversy among HIV experts. Some experts favor starting aggressive therapy in the early stages of HIV infection in the hope that early antiretroviral intervention will control viral replica tion prior to the onset of rapid genetic mutation and evolution into multiple quasi -species. This could result in a lower viral set point, fewer mutant viral strains, and potentially less drug resistance. Early therapy would slow immune system destruction and preserve immune function, preventing clinical disease progression. On the other hand, delaying therapy until later in the course of HIV infection, when clinical or immunologic symptoms appear, may result in reduced evolution of drug- resistant virus due to a lack of drug selection pressure, greater adherence to the therapeutic regimen when the patient is symptomatic rather than asymptomatic, and reduced or delayed adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy. Recommendations for when to initiate therapy ha ve generally been more aggressive in children than adults because HIV infection is primarily transmitted from mother to child, thereby allowing identification of the timing of infection in children; HIV disease progression in children is more rapid than in adults; and laboratory parameters are less predictive of risk of disease progression in children, particularly for young infants. As discussed in Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection , CD4 count and HIV RNA values vary considerably by age in children, and both markers are poorly predictive of disease progression and mortality in children younger than 12 months. Hence, recommendations for when to start therapy differ by age of the child. As discussed earlier, in the HIV Pediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study meta -analysis, CD4 percentage and HIV RNA levels were both independently predictive of the risk of clinical progression or death in children older than 12 months, although CD4 percentage was a stronger predictor of risk than HIV RNA levels [1]. Based on data showing that surrogate marker- based risk of progression varies considerably by age but that CD4 count- associated risk of progressio n in children age 5 years or older is similar to young adults, the Panel has moved to recom mendations for three age bands for initiation of treatment: infants younger than age 12 months, children age 1 to <5 years, and children and adolescents age 5 years. ANTIRETROVIRAL -NA\u00cfVE HIV- INFECTED INFANTS YOUNGER THAN AGE 12 MONTHS Panel's Recommenda tions (Table 7 ): Initiation of antiretroviral therapy is recommended for infants age <12 months, regardless of clinical status, CD4 percentage, or viral load (AI). Issues associated with adherence must be fully assessed and disc ussed with the HIV -infected infant's caregivers before therapy is initiated (AIII) . Data from the South African CHER Trial (Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy) demonstrated that initiation of triple -drug antiretroviral therapy prior to 12 weeks of age in asymptomatic perinatally infected children with normal CD4 percentage (CD4 >25%), compared with waiting to start treatment until the child met clinical or immune criteria, resulted in a 75% reduction in early mortality [2]. Most of the deaths in the children in the delayed arm occurred in the first 6 months after study entry. Because the risk of rapid progression is so high in young infants and based on the data from the CHER study, the Panel recommends initiation of therapy for all infants age <12 months regardless of clinical status, CD4 percentage, or viral load ( Table 7 ). It is critical that issues associated with adherence are fully assessed and discussed with the HIV - infec ted infant's caregivers and addressed before therapy is initiated. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 36 The risk of disease progression is inversely correlated with the age of the child, with the youngest children at greatest risk of rapid disease progression. Progression to moderate or seve re immune suppression is also frequent in infected infants; by 12 months of age, approximately 50% of children develop moderate immune suppression and 20% develop severe immune suppression [3]. In the HIV Pediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study meta -analysis, the 1 -year risk of AIDS or death was substantially higher in younger than in older children at any given level of CD4 percentage, particularly for infants age <12 months [4]. Unfortunately, although the risk of progression is greatest in the first year of life, the ability to differentiate children at risk of rapid versus slower disease progression by clinical and labor atory parameters is also most limited in young infants. No specific \"at-risk\" viral or immunologic threshold can be easily identified, and progression of HIV disease and opportunistic infections can occur in young infants with normal CD4 counts [4]. Identification of HIV infection during the first few months of life permits clinicians to initiate antiretroviral therapy during the initial phases of primary infection. Data from a number of observational studies in the United States and Europe suggest that infants who receive early treatment are less likely to progress to AIDS or death than those who started therapy later. Analyses from a prospective study of 360 HIV- infected children in the United States (Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study [PACTS]) showed that infants who received early treatment (prior to age 2 years, with nearly half starting in the first year of life) were significantly less likely to progress to AIDS or death compared with those who received no therapy, adjusting for year of birth and maternal disease factors [5]. In the European Infant Collaboration Group, starting antiretroviral therapy before the age of 3 months was associated with a significant reduction in progression to AIDS or death compared with deferring therapy [6]. In an analysis from the European Collaborative Study, HIV-infected children who initiated potent therapy before age 5 months were more likely to achieve CD4 recovery (defined as 20% increase in CD4 z score) than children initiating therapy at older ages [7]. Several small studies have demonstrated that despite the very high levels of viral replication in perinatally infected infants, early initiation of treatment can result in durable viral suppression and normalization of immunologic responses to non-HIV antigens in some infants. In infants with sustained control of plasma viremia, there has also been lack of detection of extra-chromosomal replication intermediates, suggesting near- complete control of viral replication. Some of these infants have become HIV seronegative and have lost HIV - specific immune responses. However, therapy is not curative; proviral HIV -1 DNA continues to be detectable in peripheral blood lymphocytes and viral replication resumes if therapy is discontinued [8-9]. There are, however, potential problems with treatment of asymptomatic infants. Vi rologic suppression may take longer in young children (given their higher viral load at the time of initiation of therapy) than in older children or adults [10], and the rates of virologic failure with therapy started early in life may be higher than when started later [11]. Incomplete viral suppression can lead to the development of drug resistance and compromise future treatment options [12]. Possible reasons for the p oor response in infants include very high viral loads in young infants, inadequate antiretroviral drug levels, and poor adherence due to the difficulties in administering complex regimens to infants. However, with currently available drug regimens, rates of viral suppression of 70%-80% have been reported in HIV-infected infants initiating therapy at age <12 months [13- 15]. In a 5 -year follow -up study of 40 HIV- infected children who initiated treatment at age <6 month s, 98% had CD4 >25% and 78% had viral load with median follow-up of 5.96 years [13]. Information on appropriate drug dosing in infants younger than age 3-6 months is limited. Hepatic and renal functions are immature in the newborn undergoing rapid maturational changes during the first few months of life which can result in substantial differences in antiretroviral dose requirements between young infants and older children. When drug concentrations are subtherapeutic, either because of inadequate dosing, poor absorption, or incomplete adherence, antiretroviral drug resistance can develop rapidly, particularly in the setting of high levels of viral replication in young infants. It is particularly critical to discuss fully the importance of treatment adherence with the caregivers and to identify and resolve potential problems prior to initiation of therapy, even if this delays starting treatment. Frequent follow-up and continued assessment and support of adh erence are especially important in the treatment of young infants (see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV -Infected Children and Adolescents ). August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 37 Finally, the possibility of toxicitiessuch as lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, osteopenia, and mitochondrial dysfunctionwith prolonged therapy is a concern [16]. Concerns about toxicities are particularly relevant because life -long administration of therapy may be necessary. Whether it might be possible to stop therapy begun in early infancy after a defined period of treatment (e.g., 1-2 years) that protected the child during the period of greatest risk of HIV disease progression and mortality, and then restart therapy when the child meets standard age- related criteria, is under assessment in clinical trials in South Africa and Kenya. ANTIRETROVIRAL -NA\u00cfVE HIV- INFECTED CHILDREN AGE 1 YEAR OR OLDER Panel's Recommendations (Table 7 ): Initiation of antiretroviral therapy is recommended for children age 1 year with AIDS or significant symptoms (Clinical Category C or most Clinical Category B conditions), regardless of CD4 percentage/count or plasma HIV RNA level (AI*). Initiation of antiretroviral therapy is also recommended for children age 1 year who have met the age - related CD4 threshold for initiating treatment (CD4 <25% for children age 1 to <5 years (AII) and <350 cells/mm3 for children age 5 years (AI*) , regardless of symptoms or plasma HIV RNA level). Initiation of antiretroviral therapy is also recommended for children age 1 year who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms (Clinical Categories N and A or the following Clinical Category B conditions: single episode of serious bacterial infection or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis) and have CD4 25% for children age 1 to <5 years or 350 cells/mm3 for children age 5 years and have plasma HIV RNA 100,000 copies/mL (BII). Initiation of antiretroviral therapy may be considered or deferred for children age 1 year who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and who have CD4 25% for children age 1 to <5 years and 350 cells/mm3 for children age 5 years and have plasma HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL (CIII). The ri sk of disease progression slows in children age 1 year. It is clear that children with clinical AIDS or significant symptoms (Clinical Category C or B Table 6) [17] are at high risk of disease pr ogression and death; treatment is recommended by the Panel for all such children, regardless of immunologic or virologic status. However, children age 1 year with mild clinical symptoms (Clinical Category A) or who are asymptomatic (Clinical Category N) are at lower risk of disease progression than those with more severe clinical symptoms [18]. It should also be noted that some Clinical Category B conditions a single episode of serious bacterial infection or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis are less prognostic of the risk of disease progression. Consideration of CD4 count and viral load may be useful in determining the need for therapy in children with these conditions. In adults, considerations related to initiation of antiretroviral therapy are based primarily on risk of di sease progression as determined by baseline CD4 count [19]. In adults, both clinical trial and observational data support initiation of treatment in individuals with CD4 count <350 cells/mm3. In HIV -infected adults in Haiti, a randomized clinical trial found significant reductions in mortality and morbidity with initiation of treatment when CD4 count fell to <350 cells/mm3 compared with deferring treatment until CD4 count fell to <200 cell/mm3[20]. In observational data in adults, a collaborative analysis of data from 12 adult cohorts in North America and Europe on 20,379 adults starting treatment between 1995 and 2003, the risk of AIDS or death was significantly less in those who started treatment with CD4 count of 200-350 cells/mm 3 compared with those who started at <200 cells/mm3 [21]. There are no randomized trial data to address the comparative efficacy of starting versus deferring treatment at higher CD4 thresholds in HIV-infected adults or children. Two observational studies in adults, the ART Cohort Collaboration (ART- CC) and NA -Acco rd, suggest a higher rate of progression to AIDS or death in patients deferring treatment until CD4 count <350 cells/mm3 compared with starting when CD4 count was 351 to 450- 500 cells/mm3 [22-23]. However, although the relative risk was increased, the overall number of events was small. The NA -Accord study demonstrated a benefit of starting treatment when CD4 count was >500 cell/mm3 August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 38 compared with starting when CD4 fell below this threshold [22]; however the ART -CC cohort found no additional benefit for patients starting antiretroviral therapy with CD4 counts greater than 450 cells/mm3 [23]. The HHS Adult Antiretroviral Guidelines Panel w as split on recommendations regarding starting therapy in HIV-infected adults with CD4 count 350-500 cells/mm3 (moderate to strong recommendation) and >500 cells/mm3 (moderate recommendation to optional) [19]. In children, the prognostic significance of a specific CD4 percentage or count varies with age [4, 24] . Data from pediatric studies also suggest the immune response to treatment in children is better when treatment is initiated at higher CD4 percentage/count levels [11, 25] . In data Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study meta -analysis, derived from 3,941 children with 7,297 child- years of follow -up, the risk of mortality or progression to AIDS per 100 child-years is significantly higher for any given CD4 count among childr en age 1 -4 years than among children age 5 years ( Tables 3-4 and Figures 1 -2). Data from the HIV Pediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study suggest that absolute CD4 cell count is a useful prognostic marker for disease progression in children age 5 years, in whom the estimated risk of disease progression increases when the count falls below 350 cells/mm 3, similar to data in adults ( Table 4 ) [1, 4] . For children age 1 to <5 years, a similar increase in risk of AIDS or death is seen when CD4 percentage drops below 25% ( Table 3 ). The level of plasma HIV RNA may provide useful information in terms of risk of progression, although its prognostic significance is weaker than CD4 count [4]. Several studies have shown that older children with HIV RNA levels 100,000 copies/ mL are at high risk of mortality [26-27]; similar data have been reported in adults [28]. Similarly, in the HIV Pediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study meta -analysis, the 1- year risk of progression to AIDS or death rose sharply for children age >1 year when HIV RNA levels were 100,000 copies/mL ( Table 3 and Figures 4 -5) [4]. For example, the estimated 1 -year risk of death was 2 3 times higher in children with plasma HIV RNA of 100,000 copies/mL compared with 10,000 copies/mL and 8 10 times higher if plasma HIV RNA was >1,000,000 copies/mL. Based on these data, the Panel has the following recommendations for treatment of children age 1 to <5 years. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy is recommended for children age 1 to <5 years who have AIDS or significant HIV -related symptoms (CDC Clinical Categories C and B, except for the following Category B conditions: single episode of serious bacterial infection or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis [ Table 6 ]), regardless of CD4 percentage/count or HIV RNA level. Additionally, treatment is recommended for children in this age group if they have a CD4 percentage <25%, regardless of clinical symptoms or HIV RNA level. Treatment is also recommended for children who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms (Clinical Categories N and A, or Clinical Category B disease due to a single episode of serious bacterial infection or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis [ Table 6 ]) with CD4 percentage 25% if plasma HIV RNA is >100,000 copies/mL. Antiretroviral therapy may be considered or deferred in asymptomatic children age 1 to <5 years who have CD4 25% and who also have plasma HIV RNA levels <100,000 copies/mL. For children who are age 5 years or older, initiation of antiretroviral therapy is recommended if they have AIDS or significant HIV -related symptoms (CDC Clinical Categories C and B, except for the following Category B conditions: single episode of serious bacterial infection or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis [ Tabl e 6]), regardless of CD4 percentage/count or HIV RNA level. Additionally, treatment is recommended for children in this age group if they have CD4 <350 cells/mm3, regardless of clinical symptoms or HIV RNA level. Treatment is also recommended for children who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms (Clinical Categories N and A, or Clinical Category B disease due to a single episode of serious bacterial infection or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis [ Table 6 ]) with CD4 >350 cells/mm3 if HIV RNA is >100,000 copies/mL. Antiretroviral therapy may be considered or deferred for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children age 5 years who have CD4 350 cells/mm3 and who also have plasma HIV RNA levels <100,000 copies/mL. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 39 If therapy is deferred, the health care provider should closely monitor virologic, immunologic, and clinical status (see Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection ). Factors to consider in deciding when to initiate therapy in children in whom treatment was deferred include: Increasing HIV RNA levels (e.g., HIV RNA levels approaching 100,000 copies/mL); Rapidly declining CD4 count or percentage to values approaching the age-related threshold for consideration of therapy; Development of clinical symptoms; and The ability of caregiver and child to adhere to the pr escribed regimen. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 40 Table 7. Indications for Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV -Infected Children This table provides general guidance rather than absolute recommendations for an individual patient. Factors to be considered in decisions about initiation of therapy include the risk of disease progression as determined by CD4 percentage or count and plasma HIV RNA copy number, the potential benefits and risks of therapy, and the ability of the caregiver to adhere to administration of the therapeuti c regimen. Issues associated with adherence should be fully assessed, discussed, and addressed with the child, if age appropriate, and the caregiver before the decision to initiate therapy is made.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 43 What Drugs to Start: Initial Combination Therapy for Antiretroviral -Na\u00efve Children (Updated August 16, 2010) Panel's Recommendations: Antiretroviral drugs initiated for chemoprophylaxis of maternal -child HIV transmission should be discontinued in infants who are identified as HIV infected (AI ) and treatment initiated with combination therapy as described below . Antiretroviral drug -resistance testing is recommended prior to initiation of therapy in all treatment- na\u00efve children ( AII infants; AIII children). The goal of therapy in treatment -na\u00efve children is to reduce plasma HIV RNA levels to below the limits of quantitation on ultrasensitive assays and to preserve or normal ize immune status ( AI). Combination therapy with at least three drugs, including either a non -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or protease inhibitor plus a dual nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone, is recommended for initial treatment of HIV -infected children ( AI). GENERAL CONSIDERATIO NS As of August 2010, 22 antiretroviral drugs are approved for use in HIV-infected adults and adolescents; 17 of these have an approved pediatric treatment indication and 15 are available as a pediatric formulation or capsule size. These drugs fall into several major classes: nucleoside analogue or nucleotide analogue reverse -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), entry inhibitors (including fusion inhibitors and CCR5 antagonists), and integrase inhibitors. Brief information on drug formulation, pediatric dosing, and toxicity for the individual drugs and detailed information on drug interactions can be found in Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information . It is likely that new drugs and drug combinations that demonstrate sustainable viral load suppression and acceptable toxicity and dosing profiles will become available over time, which will increase treatment options for children. Combination antiretroviral therapy with at least three drugs from at least two classes of drugs is recommended for initial treatment of infected infants, children, and adolescents because it provides the best opportunity to preserve immune function and delay disease progression [1-4]. The goal of antiretroviral therapy is to maximally suppress viral replication, preferably to undetectable levels, for as long as possible while preserving and/or restoring immune function and minimizing drug toxicity. Combination therapy slows disease progression and improves survival, results in a greater and more sustained virologic and immunologic response, and delays development of virus mutations that confer resistance to the drugs being used [3-5]. Because antiretroviral therapy will need to be administered lifelong , considerations related to the choice of initial antiretrov iral regimen should also include an understanding of barriers to adherence, including the complexity of schedules and food requirements for different regimens; differing formulations ; palatability problems; and potential limitations in subsequent treatment options should resistance develop. Monotherapy and two-drug therapy with the currently available antiretroviral drugs are not recommended to treat HIV infection [1, 6] . Use of zidovudine as a single agent is appropriate only when used in infants of indeterminate HIV status during the first 6 weeks of life to prevent perinatal HIV transmission. Infants confirmed as HIV infected while receiving chemoprophylaxis should have prophylactic antiretroviral drugs discontinued and treatment initiated with a combination regimen of at least 3 drugs ( which may include zidovudine as part of the regimen if sensitive ). The choice of regimen should be based on results from August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 44 antiretroviral drug resistance testing. Treatment should onl y be initiated following assessment and counseling of the caregivers regarding adherence to therapy [1, 6] . Antiretroviral drug -resistance testing is recommended prior to the initiation of therapy in all treatment -na\u00efve children. Treatment -na\u00efve children with perinatal HIV infection can acquire drug- resistant virus from their mothers (because the mothers were initially infected with drug -resistant virus or acquired drug resistance during treatment or during use of antiretroviral drugs for prevention of mother- to-child transmission of HIV [PMTCT] ), or the infant can develop resistance during the period of infant antiretroviral prophylaxis prior to diagnosis of HIV infection. Drug- resistant virus has been identified in 6%16% of antiretroviral- na\u00efve adults and 18% of behaviorally infected adolescents with recent infection in United States and Europe [7-11]. Data from children are limited. In a study in New York State, genotypic drug resistance was identified in 12% of 91 HIV-infected infants born from 1998 to 1999 and 19% of 42 infants born from 2000 to 2001 [12-13]; detection of resistance in the infants was not signficantly associated with a history of maternal and infant antiretroviral prophylaxis. Similarly, following initiation of treatment, 24% of 21 infants (median age 9.7 weeks) were found to have mutations associated with drug resistance, most of which were not associated with mater nal/infant prophylaxis regimens; resistant virus was found to be persistently archived in the resting CD4 cell reservoir [14]. Thus, the prevalence of infants infected with antiretroviral drug- resistant virus may be increasing and may not necessarily be predicted by the drug prophylaxis regimen received by the mother. In a recent trial, pretreatment detection of nevirapine resistance mutations was associated with a significantly higher rate of virologic failure of a nevirapine -based regimen among infants exposed to peripartum nevirapine used as maternal -infant prophylaxis [15]. For antiretroviral -na\u00efve children beyond infancy, limited a vailable data do not demonstrate that resistance testing prior to initiation of therapy correlates with greater success of initial antiretroviral therapy [16]. Nevertheless, the prevalence of resistance in HIV -infected children is sufficiently high that, based on expert opinion, the Panel recommends resistance testing prior to initiation of therapy in all treatment -na\u00efve children and use of resistance testing r esults to refine selection of drugs for inititial combination therapy, similar to recommendations for HIV- infected adults [17]. Infants exposed to peripartum nevirapine as part of maternal -infant prophylaxis should not use nevirapine-based regimens for initial combination therapy, even if baseline resistance testing with standard commercial assays fails to demonstrate mutations associated with nevirapine resistance because the presence of minor resistance variants may be associated with virologic failure of NNRTI -based therapy [18]. REGIMENS RECOMMENDED FOR INITIAL THERAPY OF ANTIRETROVIRAL - NA\u00cfVE CHILDREN ( TABLES 8 AND 9) Criteria Used for Recommendations There are few randomized, Phase III clinical trials of combination antiretroviral therapy among pediatric patients that provide direct comparison of different treatment regimens; most pediatric drug data come from Phase I/II safety and pharmacokinetic trials and nonrandomized, open-label studies. The Panel reviews both pediatric and adult clinical trial data published in peer -reviewed journals, data prepared by manufacturers for FDA review, and data presented in abstract format at major scientific meetings. In general, even in studies in adults, assessment of efficacy and potency is primarily based on surrogate marker endpoints, such as CD4 cell count and HIV RNA levels. Recommendations on the optimal initial therapy for children are continually being modified as new data become available, new therapies or drug formulations are developed, and late toxicities become recognized. Criteria used by the Panel for recommending specific drugs or regimens include: Data demonstrating durable viral suppression, immunologic improvement, and clinical improvement (when such data are available) with the regimen, preferably in children as well as adults; The extent of pediatric experience with the particular drug or regimen; Incidence and types of short- and long- term drug toxicity with the regimen, with special attention to toxicity reported in children; August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 45 Availability and acceptability of formulations appropriate for pediatric use, including palatability, ease of prepar ation (e.g., powders), volume of syrups, and pill size and number; Dosing frequency and food and fluid requirements; and Potential for drug interactions. Drugs or drug combinations are classified in one of several categories as follows: Preferred: Drugs o r drug combinations are designated as preferred for use in treatment-na\u00efve children when clinical trial data in children or, more often, in adults have demonstrated optimal efficacy and durability with acceptable toxicity and ease of use, and studies have been performed to demonstrate safety and surrogate marker efficacy in children; additional considerations are listed above. Alternative: Drugs or drug combinations are designated as alternatives for initial therapy when clinical trial data in children or adults show efficacy but there are disadvantages compared with preferred regimens in terms of more limited experience in children; the extent of antiviral efficacy or durability is less well defined in children or less than a preferred regimen in adults; there are specific toxicity concerns; or there are dosing, formulation, administration, or interaction issues for that drug or regimen. Use in Special Circumstances: Some drugs or drug combinations are recommended for use as initial therapy only in special circumstances, when preferred or alternative drugs cannot be used. Not Recommended: A list of drugs and drug combinations that are not recommended for initial therapy in children is shown in Table 9 . These drugs and drug combinat ions are not recommended either because of inferior virologic response, potential serious safety concerns (including potentially overlapping toxicities), or pharmacologic antagonism. Insufficient Data to Recommend: For a number of drugs and drug combinations approved for use in adults, pharmacokinetic or safety data in children are not available or are too limited to make recommendation on use of the drugs as initial therapy in children. Some of these drugs and drug combinations may be appropriate for consi deration in the management of the treatment -experienced child, even though they are not recommended for initial therapy in children (see Antiretroviral Treatment Failure in Infants, Children, and Adolescents ). The most extensive clinical trial data on initial therapy regimens in adults and children are available for three types of regimens based on drug class: NNRTI based (two NRTIs plus an NNRTI); PI based (two NRTIs plus a PI); and NRTI only (three NRTI drugs). NNRTI- or PI -based regimens are preferred for initial therapy; decisions about which type of regimen to choose should be individualized based on patient characterisitics. Each class -based regimen has advantages and disadvantages that are delineated in more detail in the sections that follow and in Tables 10 13. Choice of NNRTI - Versus PI-Based Initial Regimens for Children Younger Than 3 Years of Age One special scenario is the choice of initial therapy for children < 3 years of age. The only preferred regimens for children < 3 years are coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy and nevirapine-based therapy. Infants exposed to nevirapine in the peripertum period as part of PMTCT strategy should not be tre ated with nevirapine-based combination therapy because of the established higher risk of treatment failure due to nevirapine resistance [15, 19] , and lopinavir/ritonavir -based combination therapy would be the only recommended, preferred initial regimen. In addition, many experts in the United States recommend coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir -based therapy over nevirapine-based therapy even in the absence of peripartum nevirapine exposure because of concern about grea ter potential hepatotoxicity, lower barrier to resistance, and higher rate of virologic failure with nevirapine compared with lopinavir/ritonavir [20-22]. However, evidence is lacking for increased toxicity of nevir apine compared with lopinavir/ritonavir in infants [15] and some experts prefer nevirapine-based therapy because of the poor palatability of liquid lopinavir/ritonavir. Ongoing studies are expected to provide clearer evidence about the relative superiority of NNRTI - versus PI-based regimens in infants and children. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 46 PREFERRED REGIMENS F OR INITIAL THERAPY O F CHILDREN ( TABLE 8) NNRTI -Based Regimens (one NNRTI + backbone) Panel's Recommendations: Preferred NNRTI : o Nevirapine in combination with two NRTIs for children age <3 years who have not been exposed to nevirapine as part of maternal -infant prophylaxis or who require a liquid formulation ( BI*). o Efavirenz in combination with two NRTIs for child ren age 3 years ( AI*). Alternative NNRTI : o Nevirapine in combination with two NRTIs (for children age 3 years) ( BI*). The Panel does not recommend the following NNRTIs as part of initial therapy in children: Etravirine is not recommended due to lack of pediatric formulation, pediatric pharmacokinetic data, efficacy or safety data in children, and lack of data in antiretroviral- na\u00efve patients ( BIII). Nevirapine is not recommended for infants exposed to nevirapine as part of maternal-infant prophylaxis (AI). Nevirapine is not for postpubertal girls with CD4 count >250/mm3 (AII*). Efavirenz is not recommended for sexually active female adolescents when reliable contraception cannot be assured (BIII). Efavirenz is not recommended for children <3 yea rs age (BIII). Summary: NNRTI -Based Regimens Nevirapine and efavirenz both have an approved pediatric indication. Nevirapine is available in a liquid formulation, but efavirenz is not available in a liquid formulation in the United States. Advantages and disadvantages of different NNRTI drugs are delineated in Table 11. Use of NNRTIs as initial therapy preserves the PI class for future use, and less dyslipidemia and fat maldistribution have been reported with the NNRTI cla ss than with the PI class. Additionally, there is generally a lower pill burden with these agents when compared with PI-based regimens for children taking solid formulations. The major disadvantages of the current NNRTI drugs approved for use in children arethat a single viral mutation can confer drug resistance, and cross resistance develops between nevirapine and efavirenz. In infants exposed to nevirapine as part of PMTCT, higher virologic failure rates have been demonstrated with nevirapine- based regimens compared with lopinavir/ritonavir -based regimens [15]. Rare but serious and potentially life -threatening skin and hepatic toxicity can occur with all drugs in this class, but is most frequent with nevirapine, at least in HIV -infected adults. NNRTI drugs have the potential for drug interactions due to metabolism via hepatic enzymes; however, these are less frequent than those of boosted PI regimens. Efavirenz, in combination with two NRTIs, is the preferred NNRTI for initial therapy of children age 3 years based on clinical trial experience in children and because higher rates of toxicity have been observed with nevirapine in clinical trials in adults. Results of studies c omparing virologic response to nevirapine- versus efavirenz -based regimens in adults are conflicting, and no randomized studies have been done in children. Because nevirapine therapy is associated with the rare occurrence of significant hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and rare but potentially life- threatening hepatitis [23-24], nevirapine is recommended as an alternative, rather than a preferred , NNRTI for initial treatment of antiretro viral-na\u00efve children age 3 years. In infants and children <3 years who require a liquid NNRTI -based regimen, nevirapine is preferred. Efavirenz as preferred NNRTI: In clinical trials in HIV -infected adults, a PI -sparing regimen of efavirenz in combinatio n with zidovudine and lamivudine was associated with an excellent virologic response, with 70% of treated individuals having plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL at 48 weeks [25]. In randomized controlled trials in treatme nt-na\u00efve adults, superior or similar virologic activity has been demonstrated in efavirenz- treated August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 47 patients compared with individuals receiving PI- or triple NRTI -based regimens [26-29]. Clinical trials in adults ar e conflicting in terms of comparative efficacy of efavirenz and nevirapine (see discussion below) [30- 34]. No comparative trials have been conducted in children. However, an analysis of children and adults starting first -line antiretroviral therapy in Uganda has demonstrated the superiority of an efavirenz- based regimen compared with a nevirapine-based regimen in 222 children and adolescents (mean age, 9.2 years) [22]. Efavir enz has been studied in HIV-infected children in combination with two NRTIs or with an NRTI and a PI [35-41]. Results are comparable to those seen in adults. At this time, no pediatric formulation of efavirenz is available in the United States. The appropriate dose of efavirenz for children age <3 years has not been determined, and it is therefore not recommended for this age group. Some clinicians would recommend opening the capsules and adding the contents to food or liquid for children age 3 years who cannot swallow pills; however, there are no pharmacokinetic data on use in this fashion and it is not recommended. The major limitations of efavirenz are central nervous system side effects in both children and adul ts; reported side effects include fatigue, poor sleeping patterns, vivid dreams, poor concentration, agitation, depression, and suicidal ideation. Although in most patients this toxicity is transient, in some patients the symptoms may persist or occur mont hs after first initiating efavirenz. In several studies, the incidence of such side effects was correlated with efavirenz plasma concentrations and occurred more frequently in adult patients with higher levels of drug [42-45]. In patients with pre -existing psychiatric conditions, efavirenz should be used cautiously for initial therapy. Rash may also occur with efavirenz treatment; it is generally mild and transient but appears to be more common in children than adult s [39, 41] . Additionally, efavirenz is potentially teratogenic to the fetus if taken by a pregnant woman during the first trimester of pregnancy (see Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information). Unless adequate contraception can be ensured, it is not recommended for initial therapy in adolescent females who are sexually active and may become pregnant. Nevirapine as alternative NNRTI: Nevirapine has extensive clinical and safety experience in HIV -infected children and has shown antiretroviral efficacy in a number of different combination regimens ( see Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed in formation) [46]. Nevirapine has been studied in HIV-infected children in combination with two NRTIs or with an NRTI and a PI [47-49]. In a large adult trial (2NN trial), although virologic efficacy was comparable between nevirapine and efavirenz (plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks in 56% of those receiving nevirapine vs. 62% of those receiving efavirenz), serious hepatic toxicity was more frequent in the nevirapine arm than the efavirenz arm (hepatic laboratory toxicity in 8% 14% of those on nevirapine, compared with 5% on efavirenz) [34]. Other studies in adults have indicated potentially increased risk of hepatic toxicity with nevirapine- based compared with efavirenz -based regimens [50]. Additionally, data in adults indicate that symptomatic hepatic toxicity is more frequent in individuals with higher CD4 count and in women, particularly women with CD4 >250 cells/mm3 and men with CD4 >400 cells/mm3. This may be less of an issue for prepubertal children. In the published literature, hepatic toxicity appears to be less frequent in children receiving chronic nevirapine therapy than in adults [48-49, 51] . In an FDA review of 783 HIV-infected pediatric patients, there was only 1 case of hepatitis, which was reported in a 17 -year-old; there was no evidence of a serious hepatic event associated with nevirapine use in any child prior to adolescence [51]. In contrast, skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in children [52]. The safety of substituting efavirenz for nevirapine in patients who have experienced nevirapine- associated hepatic toxicity is unknown; efavirenz use in this situation has been well tolerated in the very limited number of patients in whom it has been reported but should be attempted with caution [53]. Because of the higher potential for toxicity and possibly an increased risk of virologic failure, nevirapine- based regimens are considered as alternative rather than preferred NNRTI in children age 3 years. Because appropriate dosing information for nevirapine in young children is available and there is a liquid formulation, nevirapine is the preferred NNRTI for children who are age <3 years or those who require a liquid formulation. Nevirapine should not be used in infants exposed to nevirapine as part of PMTCT [15]. Similar to recommendations in adults, nevirapine also should not be used in postpubertal adolescent girls with CD4 August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 48 count >250/mm3 due to the increased risk of symptomatic hepatic toxicity, unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk [24]. PI-Based Regimens (PIs two backbone) Panel's Recommendations: Preferred PI : o Lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with two NRTIs ( AI*). Alternative PI (listed alphabetically) : o Atazanavir combinatio n with low -dose ritonavir and two NRTIs for children age > 6 years (AI*). o Darunavir in combination with low -dose ritonavir and two NRTIs for children 6 years (AI*). o Fosamprenavir in combination with low -dose ritonavir and two NRTIs for children age > 6 year s (AI*). Use in special circumstances : o Atazanavir unboosted (for treatment -na\u00efve adolescents age >13 years and >39 kg who are unable to tolerate ritonavir) in combination with two NRTIs (unboosted atazanavir should used with tenofovir) (BII*). o Fosam prenavir unboosted (for children age > 2 years) in combination with two NRTIs ( BIII). o Nelfinavir in combination with two NRTIs (for children age >2 years) (BI*). The Panel does not recommend including the following PIs in initial therapy in children because of insufficient data, data related to toxicity or potency, or inconvenient dosing: Indinavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir (full- (AIII). Full- dose ritonavir or use of ritonavir as the sole PI ( AIII). Unboosted atazanavir fosamprenavir (AII). Summary: PI -Based Regimens Nine PIs are currently approved for use, 7 of which are approved for use in children and have pediatric drug formulations. Advantages and disadvantages of different PIs are delineated in Table 12. Advantages of PI- based regimens include excellent virologic potency, high barrier for development of drug resistance (requires multiple mutations), and sparing of the NNRTI drug class. However, the drugs have potential for multiple drug interactions due to metabolism via hepatic enzymes and may be associated with metabolic complications such as dyslipidemia, fat maldistribution, and insulin resistance. Factors to be considered in selecting a PI- based regimen for treatment -na\u00efve children include virologic potency, dosing frequency, pill burden, food or fluid requirements, availability of palatable pediatric formulations, drug interaction profile, toxicity profile (particularly related to metabolic complications), and availability of data in children (see Table 12 for advant ages and disadvantages and Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed pediatric information on each drug). Ritonavir acts as a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme, thereby inhibiting the metabolism of other PIs, and has been used in low doses combined with another PI as a \"pharmacokinetic booster,\" increasing drug exposure by prolonging the second drug's half-life. Boosted PI- based regimens are commonly used in treatment of adults, but adequate pediatric data are only available for coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir in children older than 6 weeks of age [54] and for atazanavir, fosamprenavir, darunavir, and August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 49 tipranavir with low -dose riton avir in children age > 6 years. Additionally, the use of low-dose ritonavir increases the potential for hyperlipidemia [55] and drug-drug interactions. The Panel recommends coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir as the pr eferred PI for the treatment -na\u00efve child based on virologic potency in adult and pediatric studies, high barrier to development of drug resistance, excellent toxicity profile in adults and children, availability of appropriate dosing information for childr en as young as age 6 weeks, and extensive experience as initial therapy in both resource-rich and resource- limited areas . However, data comparing the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir to other PIs are not available in children. Three PIs can be considered as alternative PIs for use in children age >6 years when used in combination with low- dose ritonavir: atazanavir, darunavir, and fosamprenavir. Other PIs that can be considered in special circumstances when preferred and alternative drugs are not available or are not tolerated include fosamprenavir without boosting ritonavir in children age > 2 years, atazanavir without boosting ritonavir in adolescents age >13 years and >39 kg, and nelfinavir in children age > 2 years . A saquinavir/ritonavir (1,000/100 mg twic e daily) -based regimen compared with a lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen demonstrated comparable virologic and immunologic outcomes when used as initial therapy in treatment- na\u00efve adults [56] and is recommended as an alternative PI for initial therapy in the guidelines for adults and adolescents [24]. However, saquinavir is not recommended for initial therapy in children because there is no pediatric formulation and there are limited dosing and outcome data in children. Although good virologic and immunologic responses have been observed with indinavir -based regimens in adults, there is no liquid formulation and there has been a high rate of hematuria, sterile leukocyturia, and nephrolithiasis reported in pediatric patients with this drug [57-60]. The incidence of hematuria and nephrolithiasis with indinavir therapy may be higher in children than adults [57, 60]. Therefore, indinavir alone or with ritonavir boosting is not recommended as initial therapy. Additionally, tipranavir is not recommended for initial therapy at the present time due to limited experience in treatmen t- na\u00efve children, but it may be considered for use with treatment failure. Due to the limited data on pharmacokinetics of full-dose dual PI combination regimens in children (e.g., saquinavir plus coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir or plus nelfinavir) [61-63], these combinations are not recommended as initial therapy in children, although they may have utility as components of secondary regimens for children who have failed initial therapy. Lopinavir/ritonavir as pref erred PI: In clinical trials in adults, regimens containing lopinavir/ritonavir plus 2 NRTIs have been found to have potent virologic activity in treatment- na\u00efve patients. In a comparative trial of lopinavir/ritonavir versus nelfinavir (both combined with stavudine/lamivudine), lopinavir/ritonavir had superior virologic efficacy to nelfinavir (plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL in 84% vs. 66% of patients, respectively), and drug- resistant virus in patients with detectable plasma viral load at 48 weeks was detect ed in none of 51 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients, compared with 45% of 43 nelfinavir- treated patients [64-65]. The rate of toxicity was similar between the groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir has been studied in both a ntiretroviral - na\u00efve and -experienced children and has demonstrated durable virologic activity and low toxicity [5, 15, 54, 66- 68]. In a study of 44 treatment-na\u00efve children, 84% plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and 71% <50 copies/mL after 48 weeks of therapy (see Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information) [68]. In addition, dosing and efficacy data in infants as young as 6 weeks of age are available [5, 54, 69] . Although once- daily lopinavir/ritonavir is FDA approved for initial therapy in adults, pharmacokinetic data in children do not support a recommendation for once-daily dosing in children [70-71]. Atazanavir with low -dose ritonavir alt ernative PI (for children > 6 years): Atazanavir is a once- daily PI that was approved for use in children > 6 years of age in March 2008. It has equivalent efficacy to efavirenz- based and lopinavir/ritonavir -based combination therapy when given in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine in treatment -na\u00efve adults [72-73]. Seventy -three percent of 48 treatment -na\u00efve South African children achieved viral load <400 copies/mL by 48 weeks when given atazanavir with or without low-dose ritonavir in combination with 2 NRTIs [74]. Among 41 treatment- na\u00efve children age 6 -18 in IMPAACT/PACTG P1020A who received the capsule formulation of atazanavir with or without ritonavir, 68% and 59% achieved viral load <400 copies/mL and <50copies/mL, respectively, by 48 weeks [75]. When given with low -dose ritonavir boosting, atazanavir achieves enhanced concentrations compared with the unboosted drug in adults and children > 6 years of age [76-77] and in antiretro viral-na\u00efve adults appears to be associated with fewer PI resistance mutations at virolo gic failure compared with atazanavir given without August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 50 ritonavir boosting [78]. The main adverse effect associated with atazanavir/low -dose ritonavir is indirect hyperbilirubinemia, with or but without concomitant hepatic transam inase elevations. Although atazanavir is associated with fewer lipid abnormalities than other PIs, lipid levels are higher when using low-dose ritonavir boosting than atazanavir alone [55]. Darunavir with low -dose ritonavir as alternative PI (for children > 6 years): Darunavir combined with low- dose ritonavir boosting is approved for antiretroviral- na\u00efve and -experienced adults and for children age > 6 years. Darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) has been found to be noninferior to lopinavir/ritonavir (once or twice daily), both in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine, in an adult randomized, open- label trial. Plasma HIV RNA levels were <50 copies/mL in 84% of darunavir/ritonavir recipients and in 78% of lopinavir/ritonavir recipients (p <0.001). Adverse events were also less common in the darunavir/ritonavir group (p <0.01) [79] . There are no published data about use of darunavir as part of initial treatment in children or use of once-daily darunavir in children. In a study of treatment- experienced children (6 -17 years of age), twice -daily darunavir/ritonavir-based therapy was well tolerated and resulted in 48% achieving HIV- 1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL, by 48 weeks [80]. Darunavir with low- dose ritonavir is recommended as an alternative initial therapy in HIV -infected children based on data from one study in treatment- experienced children and the finding of high potency and low toxicity in adults. Some experts would only recommend boosted darunavir for treatment -experienced children and reserve its use for patients with PI resistant mutations. Once- daily dosing of darunavir is not recommended for children. Fosamprenavir with low -dose ritonavir as alternative PI (for children > 6 years): Fosamprenavir (the prodrug of amprenavir) is now available in a pediatric liquid formulation and a tablet formulation. Amprenavir is no longer manufactured. In June 2007, fosamprenavir suspension was approved for use in pediatric patients > 2 years of age. The approval was based on two open-label studies in pediatric patients between 2 and 18 years of age [81-82]. Overall, fosamprenavir was well tolerated and effective in suppressing viral load and increasing CD4 cell count (see Appe ndix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information). There is less pediatric experience with fosamprenavir than with lopinavir/ritonavir. In an adult clinical trial, fosamprenavir with low-dose ritonavir was demonstrated to be noni nferior lopinavir/ritonavir r [83]. In children age >6 years, fosamprenavir should be used in combination with low-dose ritonavir boosting to ensure adequate drug levels. Data on appropriate dosing of fosamprenavir in combination with low-dose ritonavir in children age <6 years are not available; therefore, this combination cannot be recommended in that age group. Once-daily dosing of fosamprenavir is not recommended for pediatric patients. PIs for use in special circumstances Atazanavir without ritonavir boosting in children age >13 years: Although unboosted atazanavir is approved for treatment -na\u00efve adolescents age > 13 years and >39 kg who are unable to tolerate ritonavir, data from the ongoing IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A study indicate that higher doses (on a mg/m2 basis) are required to achieve adequate drug concentrations (see Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information on dosing used in IMPAACT/PACTG P1020A). If using unboosted atazanavir in treatment -na\u00efve patients, clinicians should consider using a dual-NRTI combination other than didanosine/emtricitabine because of inferior virologic response demonstrated for this combination in adults in ACTG 517 5 [84]. If these agents are to be used in combination, patients should be instructed to take them at least 2 hours apart, to take atazanavir with food, and to take didanosine on an empty s tomach. Fosamprenavir without ritonavir boosting in children age >2 years: Fosamprenavir without ritonavir boosting has been studied in children age > 2 years but is only recommended in special circumstances when preferred or alternative PI -based regimens cannot be used. Nelfinavir for children > 2 year) : Nelfinavir in combination with two NRTIs is an acceptable PI choice for initial treatment of children age > 2 years in special circumstances. There is extensive pediatric experience with nelfinavir -based re gimens in antiretroviral- na\u00efve and -experienced children, with follow-up in children receiving the regimen for as long as 7 years [85]. The drug has been well tolerated, with diarrhea as the primary side effect, but virologic potency has been highly variable between studies, with reported rates of virologic suppression ranging 26%-69% (see Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 51 detailed information). Several studies have shown a correlation between nelfinavir trough concentrations and virologic response in treatment- na\u00efve pediatric patients [86]. In one such study, virologic response at Week 48 was observed in 29% of children with subtherapeutic nelfinavir troughs mg/L) [86]. There is large interpatient variability in plasma concentrations in children, with lower levels in younger children [87-92]. The optimal dose of nelfinavir in younger children, particularly those age <2 years, has not been well defined, and higher doses of nelfinavir (relative to body siz e) are required to achieve adequate drug levels in infants than in older children [87]. Pharmacokinetic parameters in adolescent patients have not been well studied, and doses higher than those recommended in adults may be required for some patients. These data, combined with data in adults showing lesser potency of nelfinavir compared with other protease inhibitors and efavirenz , balanced against the advantage of a protease inhibitor that is not coadminstered 93- 96], make nelfinavir an agent for use in special circumstances in treatment -na\u00efve children age > 2 years and not recommended for treatment of children age <2 years. The pediatric powder formulation of nelfinavir has a poor acceptance rate when mixed with food or formula, and the pharmacokinetics of the drug is extremely variable in children. To overcome the problems associated with this formulation, tablets are dissolved in water or other liquids to make a slurry that is then ingested by children unable to swallow whole tablets. Dissolving nelfinavir tablets in water and swallowing whole tablets resulted in comparable pharmacokinetic parameters in a study in adults [97]. Triple -NRTI Regimens Panel's Recommendations: Preferred: None Alternative: None Use in special circumstances : o A three -NRTI -based regimen consisting of zido vudine + lamivudine + abacavir should be used only in special circumstances when a preferred or alternative NNRTI- based or PI -based regimen cannot be used as first -line therapy in treatment -na\u00efve children (e.g., due to significant drug interactions or adhe rence concerns) ( BI*). The Panel does not recommend any other triple -NRTI regimens as initial therapy in children due to inferior virologic potency or lack of comparative -NRTI Regimens Triple -NRTI regimens are attractive for use in HIV- infected pediatric patients as initial therapy because of the ease of administration, availability of palatable liquid formulations, demonstrated tolerance, and avoidance of many drug interactions. Data on the efficacy of triple- NRTI regimens for treatment of antiretroviral -na\u00efve children are limited; in small observational studies, response rates of 47% 50% have been reported [98-99]. In adult trials, these regimens have shown less potent virologic activity when compared with NNRTI- or PI- based regimens. Based on the results of these clinical trials, the Panel recommends that a three- NRTI -based regimen consisting of zidovudine + lamivudine + abacavir should be used only in special circumstances when a preferred or alternative NNRTI -based or PI -based regimen cannot be used as first- line therapy in treatment - na\u00efve children (e.g., due to significant drug interactions or concerns r elated to adherence). Following is a discussion of findings in clinical trials of triple -NRTI regimens: Zidovudine + lamivudine + abacavir: In a triple -NRTI combination of zidovudine + lamivudine + abacavir was shown to reduce viral load to <400 copies/mL in 51% of treatment- na\u00efve adults at 48 weeks of therapy, results equivalent to those of the PI-based comparison arm of zidovudine + lamivudine + indinavir [100] . In a study of this regimen in previously treated children, the combination showed evidence of only modest viral suppression, with only 10% of 102 children maintaining a viral load of <400 copies/mL at August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 52 48 weeks of treatment [101] . Additionally, a clinical trial (ACTG 5095) in antiretroviral- na\u00efve adults that compared initial therapy abacavir + zidovudine + lamivudine to efavirenz + lamivudine found that the triple- NRTI regimen was inferior to the efavirenz -based regimens, with a higher incidence of and an earlier time to virologic failure; after 48 weeks of therapy, 74% of adults receiving the triple-NRTI regimen had HIV RNA <200 copies/mL, compared with patients 102] . Other triple -NRTI regimens: trials in adults also have investigated triple -NRTI regimens consisting of stavudine + The virologic response to all these regimens was inferior to viral suppression achieved in comparator regimens. In addition, the M184V lamivudine drug- resistanc e mutation was seen more frequently in patients treated with triple -NRTI regimens containing lamivudine. Triple-NRTI regimens containing tenofovir abacavir + lamivudine and tenofovir + didanosine + lamivudine demons trate significantly increased rates of virologic failure and are not recommended [105 -107]. Tenofovir + zidovudine + lamivudine combination demonstrated antiviral activity in adults but no comparative data are avail able and the regimen is not recommended [108] . Selection of Dual -NRTI Backbone as Part of Initial Combination Therapy Panel's Recommendations (listed alphabetically): Preferred two -NRTI backbone combinations : o Abac avir + (lamivudine or emtricitabine) ( AI). HLA -B*5701 genetic testing should be performed prior to initiating abacavir -based therapy, and abacavir should not be given to a child who tests positive for HLA- B*5701 tenofovir + (lamivudine or emtricitabine) (A-I*). Alternative two : o Zidovudine + (abacavir or didanosine) ( BII). Use in special circumstances : o Stavudine + (lamivudine or emtricitabine) ( BII). The Panel does not recommend the following dual -NRTI backbones for initial therapy in children: Stavudine + didanosine due to increased toxicity (AII didanosine, ab acavir + tenofovir, tenofovir due to insufficient data (BIII). Tenofovir as part of any dual- NRTI backbone in children in Tanner stages 1 -3 due to lack of pediatric dosing data and formulation and concerns related to bone toxicity ( BII). Summary: Selection of Dual -NRTI didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, abacavir, and emtricitabine) are FDA approved for use in children younger than 13 years of age. Dual-NRTI combinations form the \"backbone\" of combination regimens for both adults and children. Dual-NRTI combinations that have been studied in children include zidovudine in combination with abacavir, didanosine, or lamivudine; with in combination didanosine [6, 37, 85, 91, 109- 110]. Advantages and disadvantages of different dual-NRTI backbone options are delineated in Table 10 . August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 53 The preferred dual -NRTI combinations for initial therapy in children consist of abacavir, didanosine, or zidovudine combined with either lamivudine or emtricitabine. The most extensive experience in children is with zidovudine in combination with lamivudine. This combination has extensive data on safety in children and is generally well tolerated. The major toxicities are bone marrow suppression, manifested as macrocytic anemia and neutropenia. Minor toxicities include gastrointestinal toxicity and fatigu e. The combination of zidovudine and didanosine had the lowest rate of toxicities in a large retrospective study of children [111] . Both lamivudine and emtricitabine are well tolerated with few side effects. Although there is less experience in children with emtricitabine than lamivudine, it is similar to lamivudine and can be substituted for lamivudine as one component of a preferred dual-NRTI backbone (i.e., emtricitabine in combination with abacavir, didanosine, or zidovudine). The advantages of emtricitabine are once- daily administration, ability to be coadministered with didanosine as a once-daily NRTI backbone option, and availability as an oral solution. Both lamivudine and emtricitabine select for the M184V resistance mutation, which is as sociated with high - level resistance to both drugs; a modest decrease in susceptibility to abacavir and didanosine; and improved susceptibility to zidovudine, [112 -113]. Abacavir in combination with lamivudine has been shown to be as potent or possibly more potent than zidovudine in combination with lamivudine in both children and adults [114 -115] but has the potential for abacavir -associated life -threatening hypersensitivity reactions in a small proportion of patients. In 5 years of follow -up, abacavir plus lamivudine maintained significantly better viral suppression and growth in children than did zidovudine plus lamivudine and zidovudine plus abacavi r [115] . Abacavir hypersensitivity is more common in with certain HLA genotypes, particularly HLA-B*5701 (see Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ); howev er the prevalence of HLA -B*5701 is much lower in African American and Hispanic than white individuals in the United States (2%-2.5% compared with 8%) [116] . Pretreatment screening for HLA -B*5701 prior to initiation of abacavir treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction in HIV -infected adults (from 7.8% to 3.4%) [117] . Genetic screening for HLA -B*5701 should be performed for HIV- infected children prior to initiating abacavir - based therapy and abacavir should not be given to those who test positive for HLA-B*5701. Didanosine in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine are also preferred dual -NRTI combinations. The combination of didanosine and emtricitabine allows for once-daily dosing. In a study of 37 treatment- na\u00efve children age 3 to 21 years, long-term virologic suppression was achieved with a once-daily regimen of didanosine, emtricitabine, and efavirenz; 72% of subjects maintained HIV RNA suppression to <50 copies/mL through 96 weeks of therapy [37]. Prescribing information for didanosine recommends administration on an empty stomach. However, this is impractical for infants who feed frequently and may decrease medication compliance in older children by increasing regimen complexity. A comparison of didanosine given with or without food in children found that systemic exposure was similar but with slower and more prolonged absorption with food [118] . To improve compliance, some practitioners recommend administration without regard to timing of meals for young children. However, data are inadequate to allow a strong recommendation at this time, and it is preferred that didanosine be administered under fasting conditions when possible. Tenofovir has been studied in HIV-infected children in combination with other NRTIs and as an investigational oral sprinkle/granule formulation [119 -122]. Tenofovir in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine is a preferred dual -NRTI combination for use in adolescents in Tanner stage 4 or who are postpuberty. The fixed-dose combinations of tenofovir + emtricitabine and tenofovir + emtricitabine + efavirenz are both administered as 1 pill once daily and may be part icularly useful to improve adherence in older adolescents. In studies in adults, tenofovir when used with lamivudine or emtricitabine in combination with efavirenz had potent viral suppression for up to 3 years and was superior to zidovudine/lamivudine/efa virenz in viral efficacy [123- 124]. In ACTG 5202, were randomly assigned to tenofovir + emtricitabine versus abacavir + lamivudine in combination with boosted atazanavir versus efavirenz (in factorial design) . Among those with screening HIV- 1 RNA 100,000 copies per mL, the times to virologic failure and to first adverse event were both significantly shorter in patients randomly assigned to abacavir + lamivudine than in those assigned to tenofovir + emtricitabi ne. Results for patients with lower entry viral loads and for comparisons by assignment to efavirenz or boosted atazanavir are not yet available [125] . In other nonrandomized studies, 48- week virologic efficacy of t enofovir + emtricitabine in combination with August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 54 lopinavir/ritonavir was similar to that seen in trials with other dual- NRTI backbones in treatment -na\u00efve adults [126] . However, decreases in bone mineral density have been shown in both adults and children taking tenofovir for 48 weeks in some, although not all, studies [119 -122, 127] . At this time data are insufficient to recommend use of this drug for initial therapy in infected children in Tanner stages 1-3, in whom the risk of bone toxicity may be greatest [119, 122] (see Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for more detailed pediatric infor mation). Renal toxicity has been reported in children as well as adults receiving tenofovir; in 1 single- center study, the rate of beta-2-microglobulinuria was higher in children receiving tenofovir than children receiving other antiretroviral agents (12/44 compared with 2/48, respectively), although creatinine clearance did not differ between groups [128] . Because of potential bone toxicity and renal toxicity, the drug may have greater utility for treatment of children in whom other antiretroviral drugs have failed than for initial therapy of treatment-na\u00efve children. There are numerous drug-drug interactions with tenofovir and other antiretroviral drugs, including didanosine, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, and tipranavir, that complicate appropriate dosing of this drug. Alternative dual-NRTI combinations include zidovudine in combination with abacavir or didanosine. There is considerable experience with use of these dual -NRTI regimens in children [111] . However, both zidovudine + abacavir and zidovudine + lamivudine had lower rates of viral suppression and more toxicity leading to drug modification than did abacavir + lamivudine in one European pediatric study [91, 115] . The dual -NRTI combination of stavudine with lamivudine or emtricitabine is recommended for use only in special circumstances because stavudine is associated with a higher risk of lipoatrophy and hyperlactatemia than other NRTI drugs [129 -131]. Children receiving dual-NRTI combinations containing stavudine had higher rates of clinical and laboratory toxicities than those receiving zidovudine- containing combinations [111] . In children with anemia in w hom there are concerns related to abacavir hypersensitivity and who are too young to receive tenofovir, stavudine may be preferred to zidovudine for initial therapy because of its lower incidence of hematologic toxicity. Certain dual -NRTI drug combinations are not recommended. These include zidovudine + stavudine due to pharmacologic interactions that can result in potential virologic antagonism. The drug structure of emtricitabine is similar to lamivudine and the same single resistance mutation confers cr oss resistance, so these drugs should not be used in combination. The dual-NRTI combination of stavudine + didanosine is also not recommended for use as initial therapy. In small pediatric studies, stavudine + didanosine demonstrated virologic efficacy and was well tolerated [109- 110, 132] . However, in studies in adults, stavudine + didanosine- based combination regimens were associated with greater rates of neurotoxicity, pancreatitis, hyperlactatemia and lactic acid osis, on zidovudine + lamivudine -134]; lactic acidosis with pancreatitis/hepatic steatosis have been reported in receiving this combination during pregnancy [129, 135] . are not recommended as dual-NRTI backbones in initial therapy on the basis of insufficient data in children. Not Recommended for Initial Therapy for Children Because of Insufficient Data Panel's Recommendations: Because of insufficient data for use as initial therapy, the following regimens (in addition to those already discussed in previous sections) should not be offered to children for initial therapy ( AIII): Triple -class regimens, number of antiretroviral drugs and drug regimens are not recommended for initial therapy of antiretroviral- na\u00efve children because of insufficient pediatric data. These are summarized below. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 55 Regimens containing three drug classes: Data are insufficient to recommend initial regimens co ntaining agents from three drug classes (e.g., NRTI plus NNRTI plus PI). Although efavirenz plus nelfinavir plus one or two NRTIs was shown to be safe and effective in HIV -infected children with prior NRTI therapy, this regimen was not studied as initial therapy in treatment -na\u00efve children and has the potential for inducing resistance to three drug classes, which could severely limit future treatment options [38-40]. New agents without sufficient pediatric data for use as initial therapy ( Tables 13 and 14 ): At this time several new agents appear promising in adults but do not have sufficient pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety data to recommend their use as components of an initial therapeutic regimen in children. These include maraviroc (a CCR5 antagonist), raltegravir (an etravirine (a new NNRTI) . Raltegravir is being evaluated in treatment -experienced children, but pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy data are not yet available and no pediatric formulation is commercially available. Tipranavir boosted with ritonavir was approved (June 2008) by the FDA for use in treatment-experienced children age 2 -18 years, but data are insufficient to address use as initial therapy. Enfuvirtide (T -20), a fusion inhibitor, is approved for use in children age 6 years in combination with other antiretroviral drugs in treatment- experienced patients with evidence of HIV replication desp ite ongoing antiretroviral therapy. The drug must be administered subcutaneously twice daily and is associated with a high incidence of local injection site reactions (98%). Data are currently insufficient to recommend use of enfuvirtide for initial therap y of children. Antiretroviral Drug Regimens that Should Never be Offered ( Table 9) Panel's Recommendations: The following regimens or regimen components should never be offered to HIV -infected children: Monotherapy ( AII) Two NR TIs alone ( AI) Certain two -NRTI combinations as part of a combination regimen: o Lamivudine + emtricitabine due to similar resistance pattern and no additive benefit (AIII) o Zidovudine + stavudine due AI*) Several antiretroviral drugs and drug regimens are not recommended for use in therapy of children or adults. These are summarized below. Clinicians should be aware of the components of fixed-drug combinations so that patients do not inadvertently receive a double dose of a drug contained in such a combination. Monotherapy: Therapy with a single antiretroviral drug is not recommended because it is unlikely to result in sustained viral suppression, leading to the development of viral resistance to the drug being used and cross resistance to other drugs within the same drug class. The exception is for prophylaxis for the newborn infant born to an HIV-infected mother, in which case 6 weeks of monotherapy with zidovudine is recommended for the infant (unless the infant is identifie d as HIV infected, in which case zidovudine should be discontinued and standard triple therapy instituted) [24]. Dual- nucleoside regimens alone: Dual -NRTI therapy alone is not recommended for initial therapy because it is unlikely to result in sustained viral suppression, leading to the development of viral resistance to the drugs being used and cross resistance to other drugs within the same drug class. For children previously initiated on a August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 56 dual-NRTI regimen who have achieved viral suppression, it is reasonable to either continue on this therapy or to add a PI or NNRTI to the regimen. If a child is to stay on a two-NRTI regimen, the plan should be to change to a three or more drug combination if viral rebound should occur (see Antiretroviral Treatment Failure in Infants, Children, and Adolescents ). In special circumstances of children with treatment failure associated with drug resistance and persistent nonadherence, there may be a role for use of single- or dual-NRTI regimens as holding or bridging regimens, while intensively working on improving adherence in preparation for initiation of a new, suppressive combination antiretro viral regimen (see section on Approach to the Management of Antiretroviral Treatment Failure ). Certain dual- nucleoside backbone combinations: + stavudine, emtricitabine + lamivudine) are not recommended for therapy at any time because of pharmacological antagonism or inferior virologic response. Emtricitabine should not be used in combination with lamivudine because the drug structure is similar and the same single resistance mutation (M184V) induces resistance to both drugs. Dual non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): An adult study (2NN) demonstrated increased toxicity with the combination of nevirapine plus efavirenz [34]. Certain PIs: The combination of darunavir, and tipranivir have low bioavailablity and do not achieve adequate drug levels, and therefore should not be used without ritonavir boosting. Three -NRTI regimen of tenofovir + (didanosine or abacavir) + (lamivudine or emtricitabine): The - combinations tenofovir with (didanosine or abacavir) plus (lamivudine or emtricitabine) have a high rate of early virologic nonresponse when used as initial therapy in treatment-na\u00efve adults and are not recommended as combination therapy for children at any time [105- 107].

Antiretroviral R egimens Recommended for Initial Therapy for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection in Children Page 1 of 2 A combination antiretroviral regimen in treatment -na\u00efve children generally contains 1 NNRTI plus a 2 -NRTI backbone or 1 PI plus a 2- NRTI backb one. A 3 -NRTI regimen consisting of zidovudine, abacavir, and lamivudine is recommended only if a PI or NNRTI regimen cannot be used. Regimens should be individualized based on advantages and disadvantages of each combination (see Tables 11-13).

Unless adequate contraception can be ensured, efavirenz-based therapy is not recommended for adolescent females who are sexually active and may become pregnant. 2 With the exception of lopinavir/ritonavir at all ages and atazanavir /ritonavir, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, and darunavir/ritonavir in children > 6 years of age, use of other boosted PIs as a component of initial therapy is not recommended, although such regimens have utility as secondary treatment regimens for children who ha ve failed initial therapy. 3 For children <3 years of age, nevirapine is the preferred NNRTI when NNRTI -based therapy is used. However, lopinavir/ritonavir is preferred to nevirapine by many experts. Nevirapine should not be used in infants who have been exposed to nevirapine as part of maternal -infant prophylaxis. 4 Nevirapine should not be used in postpubertal girls with CD4 count >250/mm3, unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 75 Monitoring of Children on Antiretroviral Therapy (Updated August 16, 2010) Panel's Recommendations: Children who start a new antiretroviral regimen should be evaluated in person or by phone within 1 to 2 weeks of starting medication to screen for clinical side effects and to ensure patient adherence to the regimen ( AIII). Children should be evaluated within 4 to 8 weeks to assess for possible side effects and to evaluate i nitial response to therapy ( AIII). More frequent evaluation may be needed following initiation or change in therapy to support adherence to the regimen ( AIII). Subsequently, children should have a monitoring evaluation at least every 3 to 4 months to asses s both efficacy and potential toxicity of their antiretroviral regimens ( AII*). Children who start a new antiretroviral regimen or who change to a new regimen should be followed to assess effectiveness, adherence, tolerability, and side effects of the regimen. Frequent patient visits and intensive follow -up during the initial months after a new antiretroviral regimen is started are necessary to support and educate the family. The first few weeks of antiretroviral therapy can be particularly difficult for children and their caregivers. They must adjust their schedules to allow for consistent and routine administration of medication doses. Children may also experience side effects of medications, and the child and caregivers need assistance in determining wh ether the effects are temporary and can be tolerated or whether they are more serious or long- term and necessitate a visit to the clinician. Thus, it is prudent for the clinician to assess the child within 1 -2 weeks of initiating therapy, either in person or with a phone call, to assure proper administration of medications and to evaluate clinical concerns. Many clinicians will plan additional contact (in person or by telephone) with the child and caregivers during the first few weeks of therapy to support adherence. Baseline laboratory assessments should be done prior to initiation of therapy; these include CD4 count/percentage and HIV RNA level; complete count chemistries evaluations (amylase, lipase) if therapy is being initiated with a drug with potential pancreatic toxicity, such as didanosine; and serum lipid evaluation (cholesterol, triglycerides). The child should be seen within 4-8 weeks after initiating or changing therapy to obtain a clinical history, with a focus on potential adverse effects and to assess adherence to medications; perform a physical examination; evaluate efficacy of therapy (measurement of CD4 count/percentage and HIV RNA levels); and obtain a laboratory evaluation for toxicity. More frequent evaluation may be needed following a change in therapy to support adherence to the regimen. At a minimum, laboratory assessments should include a complete blood count and differential, serum chemistries, and assessment of renal and hepatic function. Assessment of initial virologic response to therapy is important because an initial decrease in HIV viral load in response to antiretroviral treatment should be observed after 4- 8 weeks of therapy. Subsequently, children taking antiretroviral medication should have assessments of adherence, toxicity, and efficacy at least every 3 4 months. Table 1 5 provides one proposed monitoring schema, which will require adjustment based on the specific therapy the child is receiving. Assessments should include basic hematology, chemistry, CD4 count/percentage, and HIV viral load. Monitoring of drug toxicities should be tailored to the particular medications the child is taking; for example, periodic monitoring of pancreatic enzymes may be desirable in children receiving didanosine, or of serum glucose and lipids in patients receiving PIs. Children who develop symptoms of toxicity should have appropriate laboratory evaluations (e.g., evaluation of serum lactate in a child receiving NRTI drugs who develops symptoms suspicious for lactic acidosis) performed more frequently until the toxicity resolves. For further details of adverse effects associated with particular August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 76 antiretroviral medications, please see Table s 17a -17h .

Many clinicians will plan additional contacts (in person or by telephone) with the child and caregivers to support adherence during the first few weeks of therapy. Some clinicians also recommend an HIV RNA measurement within the initial weeks of therap y for an early assessment of response/adherence to therapy. 3 Chemistries may include electrolytes, glucose, liver function tests (hepatic transaminases and bilirubin), renal function tests (BUN, creatinine), calcium, and phosphate. Additional evaluations should be tailored to the particular drugs the child is receiving; for example, pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) may be considered if the child is starting drugs with potential pancreatic toxicity, such as didanosine. 4 Some clinicians do not recommend a CD4 cell count/percentage at this time, considering it too early to expect an immunologic response. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 77 Specific Issues in Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV -Infected Adolescents (Updated August 16, 2010) Panel's Recommendations : Antiretroviral therapy regimens must be individually tailored to the adolescent because those with perinatal exposure generally have a very different clinical course and treatment history than those who acquired HIV during adolescence ( AIII). Appropriate dosing of antiretroviral medications for adolescents is complex, not always predictable, and dependent upon multiple factors, including body mass and composition and chronologic age ( AII). Effective and appropriate contraceptive methods should be selected to reduce the likel ihood of unintended pregnancy and prevent transmission of HIV (AI). Providers should be aware of potential interactions between antiretroviral drugs and hormonal contraceptives, which could lower contraceptive efficacy ( AII*). Efavirenz should be avoided for the adolescent girl who desires to become pregnant or who does not use effective and consistent contraception ( AII). Efavirenz also should be avoided throughout the first trimester of pregnancy (AII). Pediatric and adolescent care providers should work with older adolescent patients to prepare them for transition into adult care settings ( AIII). BACKGROUND An increasing number of HIV-infected children who acquired HIV infection through perinatal transmission are now surviving into adolescence. They generally have had a long clinical course and extensive antiretroviral treatment history. Adolescents with behaviorally acquired infection (i.e., infection acquired via sexual activity or intravenous substance use) generally follow a clinical course that is similar to that of adults; they are in an earlier stage of infection, making them potential candidates for early intervention [1]. DOSING OF ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY FOR HIV -INFECTED ADOLES CENTS Puberty is a time of somatic growth and sexual maturation, with females developing more body fat and males more muscle mass. These physiologic changes may affect drug pharmacokinetics, which is especially important for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are used in combination with protein-bound medicines or hepatic enzyme inducers or inhibitors [2]. Dosages of medications for HIV infection and opportunistic infections traditionally have been prescribed according to Tanner staging of puberty [3] rather than strictly on the basis of age [1]. Using this method, adolescents in early puberty (Tanner stages I and II) are administered doses using pediatric schedules, whereas those in late puberty (Tanner stage V) are administered doses using adult schedules. However, Tanner stage and age are not necessarily directly predictive of drug pharmacokinetics. In addition, puberty may be delayed in perinatally HIV -infected children [4], adding to discrepancies between Tanne r stage -based dosing and age-based dosing. Many antiretroviral medications (e.g., abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir, and some PIs) are administered to children at higher weight- or surface area -based doses than would be predicted by direct scaling of adult doses, based upon reported pharmacokinetic data indicating higher oral drug clearance in children. Continued use of these pediatric weight- or surface area -based doses as a child grows during adolescence can result in medication doses that are higher than the usual adult doses. Data suggesting optimal doses for every antiretroviral medication for adolescents are not available; Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information includes discussion of data relevant to adolescents for individual drugs and notes the age listed on the drug label for adult dosing, when available. Other factors, such as toxicity, pill August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 78 burden, adherence, and virologic and immunologic parameters, may also help determine when to transi tion adolescents from pediatric to adult doses. ADOLESCENT CONTRACEP TION, PREGNANCY, AND ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY Adolescents with HIV infection, regardless of mode of acquisition, may be sexually active. Contraception methods and safer sex techniques for prevention of HIV transmission should be discussed with them regularly (see Incorporating HIV Prevention into the Medical Care of Persons Living with HIV ) [5]. The possibility of planned or unplanned pregnancy should be a consideration when selecting an antiretroviral regimen for the adolescent girl. The most vulnerable period in fetal organogenesis is early in gestation, often before p regnancy is recognized. Sexual activity, reproductive plans, and use of effective contraception should be discussed with the patient. Efavirenz-containing regimens should be avoided in adolescent girls who are trying to conceive or are not using effective and consistent contraception because of the potential for teratogenicity with fetal exposure to efavirenz in the first trimester. Contraceptive-Antiretroviral Drug Interactions Several PI and NNRTI drugs are known to interact with oral contraceptives, resulting in possible decreases in ethinyl estradiol or increases in estradiol or norethindrone levels (see t he Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Ad ults and Adolescents ) available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov [6]. These changes may decrease the effectiveness of the oral contraceptives or potentially increase the risk of estrogen - or progestin-related side effects. Providers should be aware of these drug interactions and an alternative or additional contraceptive method should be considered in cases in which there are documented interactions. It is unknown whether the contraceptive effectiveness of progestogen- only injectable contraceptives (such as depot methoxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA]) would be compromised because these methods produce higher blood hormone levels than other progestogen-only oral contraceptives and combined oral contraceptives. In one study, the efficacy of DMPA was not altered among women receiving concomitant nelfinavir- , efavirenz-, or nevirapine-based treatment, with no evidence of ovulation during concomitant administration for 3 months, no additional side effects, and no clinically significant changes in antiretroviral drug levels [7-8]. The re is minimal information about drug interactions with use of newer hormonal contraceptive methods (e.g., patch, vaginal ring). Adolescents who express a desire to become pregnant should be referred for preconception counseling and care, including discussi on of special considerations with antiretroviral therapy use during pregnancy (see Health and Human Services [HHS] Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV -1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov [9]). Pregnant Adolescents Pregnancy should not preclude the use of optimal therapeutic regimens. However, because of considerations related to prevention of mother- to-child transmission and to maternal and fetal safety, timing of initiation of treatment and selection of regimens may be different for pregnant women than for nonpregnant adults or adolescents. Details regarding choice of antiretroviral regimen in pregnant HIV -infected women, including adolescents, are provided in HHS Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV -1- Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov [9]. TRANSITION OF ADOLES CENTS INTO ADULT HIV CARE SETTINGS Facilitating a smooth transition for adolescents with any chronic health condition from the child or adolescent health system to one devoted to the care of adults can be difficult and is especially so for adolescents infected with HIV. Transition is described as \"a multifaceted, active process that attends to the medical, psychosocial, August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 79 and educational or vocational needs of adolescents as they move from the child- focuse d to the adult-focused health -care system\" [10]. HIV care models for children and perinatally infected adolescents tend to be family centered, with input from members of a multidisciplinary team that often includes pediatric or adolescent physicians, nurses, social workers, and mental health professionals. These providers generally have long- standing relationships with patients and their families, and care is rendered in discreet, more intimate settings. Although expert care is also provided in the adult HIV care medical model, the adolescent may feel unfamiliar with the more individual -centered, busier clinics typical of adult medical providers and uncomfortable with providers who often do not have a long-standing relationship with the adolescent. Providing support and guidance to the adolescent and to the adult medical care provider as to what is expected from each may be helpful. Some general guidelines about transitional plans and who might best benefit from them are available [11-12]. Pediatric and adolescent programs may benefit from the establishment of formal programs to introduce adolescents to the adult care setting. References 1.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 80 Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV - Infected Children and Adolescents (Updated August 16, 2010) Panel's Recommendations: Strategies to maximize adherence should be discussed prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy and again when changing regimens ( AIII). Adherence to therapy must be stressed at each visit, along with continued exploration of strategies to maintain and/or improve adherence ( AIII). At least one method of measuring adher ence to antiretroviral therapy (e.g., quantitative and/or qualitative self -report, pharmacy refill checks, pill counts) should be used in addition to monitoring viral load (AII). When feasible, once- daily antiretroviral regimens should be prescribed (AI*). Maintain a nonjudgmental attitude, establish trust, and identify mutually acceptable goals for care (AII*). BACKGROUND Medication adherence is fundamental to successful antiretroviral therapy. Adherence is a majo r factor in determining the degree of viral suppression achieved in response to antiretroviral therapy [1-4]. Poor adherence can lead to virologic failure. Prospective adult and pediatric studies have shown the risk of virologic failure to increase as the proportion of missed doses increases [2, 5 -7]. Subtherapeutic antiretroviral drug levels resulting from poor adherence may facilitate the development of drug resistance to one or more drugs in a given regimen as well as possible cross resistance to other drugs in the same class. Therefore, in addition to compromising the efficacy of the current regimen, suboptimal adherence has implications for limiting future effective drug regimens for patients who develop drug- resistant viral strains. Evidence indicates that adherence problems occur frequently in children and adolescents. Multiple studies have reported that fewer than 50% of children and/or caretakers reported full adherence to their regimens. Rates of adherence varied with method of ascertainment (parent/child report, pharmacy records), antiretroviral regimens, and study characteristics [3-4, 8-11]. A variety of factors, including medication formulation, frequency of dosing, child age, and psychosocial characteristics of the child and parent, have been associated with adherence, but no clear predictors of either good or poor adherence in children have been consistently identified [7-8, 10, 12- 16]). These findings illustrate the difficulty of maintaining high levels of adherence and underscore the need to work in partnership with families to make adherence education, support, and assessment integral components of care. SPECIFIC ADHERE NCE ISSUES IN CHILDREN Adherence is a complex health behavior that is influenced by the regimen prescribed, patient factors, and characteristics of health care providers [14-15]. Limited availability of palatable formulations for young children is especially problematic [5, 17] . Furthermore, infants and children are dependent on others for administration of medication; thus, assessment of the capacity for adherence to a complex multidrug regimen requires evaluation of the caregivers and their environments as well as the ability and willingness of the child to take the drug. Barriers faced by adult caregivers that can contribute to nonadherence in children include forgetting doses, changes in routine, being too busy, and child refusal [18]. Some caregivers may place too much responsibility on older children for managing medications before they are developmentally able to take on such tasks [19]. Many other barriers to adherence exist for children with HIV infection. For example, caregivers' unwillingness to disclose the child's HIV infection status to others may create specific problems, including reluctance of caregivers to fill prescriptions locally, hiding or relabeling medications to maintain August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 81 secrecy within the household, reduction of social support, and a tendency to skip doses when the parent is away from the home or when the child is at school. SPECIFIC ADHERENCE ISSUES FOR ADOLESCENT S HIV-infected adolescents also face specific adherence challenges [7, 20 -22]. Several studies have identified pill burden as well as lifestyle issues (not carrying medication, change in schedule) as barriers to complete adherence [7, 20] . Denial and fear of their HIV infection is common, especially in recently diagnosed youth; this may lead to refusal to initiate or continue antiretroviral therapy. Distrust of the medical establishment, misinformation about HIV, and a lack of knowledge about the availability and effectiveness of antiretroviral treatments can all be barriers to linking adolescents to care and maintaining successful antiretroviral therapy. Perinatally infected youth are famil iar with the challenges of taking complex drug regimens and with the routine of chronic medical care; nevertheless, they may have long histories of inadequate adherence. Regimen fatigue has also been identified as a barrier to adherence in adolescents [23]. Regardless of the mode of acquisition of HIV infection, HIV- infected adolescents may suf fer from low self -esteem, may have unstructured and chaotic lifestyles and concomitant mental illnesses, or may cope poorly with their illness due to a lack of familial and social support. Depression, alcohol or substance abuse, poor school attendance, and advanced HIV disease stage all correlate with nonadherence [21, 24] . In a study of 833 HIV- infected Medicaid beneficiaries age 12 -17 years, youth diagnosed with a psychiatric comorbidity (substance abuse, conduct disorder, or emotional disorder) were less likely to be receiving combination therapy; however, for those on therapy, only a conduct disorder diagnosis was associated with lower adherence [25]. A review of published papers on adherence among HIV -infected youth, however, suggests that depression and anxiety have been consistently associated with poorer adherence [24]. Adherence to complex regimens is particularly challenging at a time of life when adolescents do not want to be different from their peers. Further difficulties face adolescents who live with parents or partners to whom they have not yet disclosed their HIV status and those who are homel ess and have no place to store medicine. Treatment regimens for adolescents must balance the goal of prescribing a maximally potent antiretroviral regimen with realistic assessment of existing and potential support systems to facilitate adherence. Interve ntions to promote long- term adherence to antiretroviral treatment have not been rigorously evaluated in adolescents . In clinical practice, reminder systems, such as beepers and alarm devices, are well accepted by some youth. Small, discreet pillboxes in which to store medications in an organized fashion may be useful [26]. In a pilot study evaluating peer support and pager messaging in an adult population, peer support was associated with greater self -reported adherence post intervention but the effect was not sustained at follow-up. Pager messaging was not associated with reported adherence but improved biologic outcomes were measured [27]. Another study evaluating the efficacy of a 4 -session, individual, clinic -based motivational interviewing intervention targeting multiple risk behaviors in HIV -infected youth demonstrated an association with lower viral load at 6 months among youth taking antiretroviral therapy at 6 months. However, reduction in viral load was not maintained at 9 months [28] . ADHERENCE ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING The process of adherence preparation and assessment should begin before therapy is initiated or changed, and a routine adherence assessment should be incorporated into every clinic visit. A comprehensive assessment should be instituted for all children in whom antiretroviral treatment initiation or change is considered. Evaluations s hould include nursing, social, and behavioral assessments of factors that may affect adherence by the child and family and can be used to identify individual needs for intervention. Adherence preparation should focus on establishing a dialogue and a partnership in medication management. Specific, open-ended questions should be used to elicit information about past experience as well as concerns and expectations about treatment. When assessing readiness and preparing to begin treatment, it is important to obtain explicit agreement with the treatment plan, including strategies to support adherence. Adherence is difficult to assess accurately; different methods of assessment have been shown to yield different results, and each approach has limitations [29-31]. Both caregivers and health care providers often August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 82 overestimate adherence. Use of multiple methods to assess adherence is recommended. Viral load response to a new regimen is often the most accurate indication of adherence, but it may be a less valuable measure in children with long treatment histories and multidrug- resistant virus. Other measures include quantitative self - report of missed doses by caregivers and children or adolescents (focusing on recent missed doses during a 3-day or 1-week period), descriptions of the medication regimens, and reports of barriers to administration of medications. Caregivers may report number of doses taken more accurately than doses missed [32]. Also, targeted questions about stress, pill burden, and daily routine are recommended [7-8, 29] . Pharmacy refill checks and p ill counts can identify adherence problems not evident from self- reports [33]. Electronic monitoring devices, such as Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps, which record opening of medication bottles on a computer chip in the cap [34], have been shown to be useful tools to measure adherence in some settings [33, 35- 36]. Home visits can play an important role in assessing adherence and, in some cases, suspected nonadherence is confirmed only when dramatic clinical responses to antiretroviral therapy occur during hospitalizations or in other supervised set tings [37-40]. Preliminary studies suggest that monitoring plasma concentrations of PIs, or therapeutic drug monitoring, may be a useful method to identify nonadherence [41]. It is important for clinicians to recognize that nonadherence is a common problem and that it can be difficult for patients to share information about missed doses or difficulties adhering to treatment. Furthermore, adherence can change over time. An adolescent who was able to strictly adhere to treatment upon initiation of a regimen may not be able to maintain complete adherence over time. A nonjudgmental attitude and trusting relationship foster open communication and facilitate assessment. To obtain information on adherence in older children, it is often helpful to ask both the HIV-infected child and caregivers about missed doses and problems. Their reports may differ significantly; therefore, clinical judgment is required to best interpret adherence information obtained from the multiple sources [42-43]. STRATEGIES TO IMPROV E AND SUPPORT ADHERE NCE Intensive follow- up is required, particularly during the critical first few months after therapy is started; patients should be seen frequently to assess adherence and determine the need for strategies to improve and support adherence. Strategies include development of patient- focused treatment plans to accommodate specific patient needs, integration of medication administration into the daily routines of life (e.g., associating medication administration with daily activities such as brushing teeth), and use of social and community support services. Multifaceted approaches that include regimen -related strategies; educational, behavioral, and supportive strategies focused on children and families; and strategies that focus on health care providers rather than one specific intervention may be most effective [44-47]. Although quite labor intensive, programs designed to administer directly observed combination therapy to adults in either the clinic or at home have demonstrated successful results in both the United States and in international, resource-poor settings [48-52]. In particular, modified directly observed therapy (m-DOT) when one dose is administered in a supervised setting and the remaining portions are self- administered appears to be both feasible and acceptable [47]. Table 1 6 summarizes some of the strategies that can be used to support and improve adherence to antiretroviral medications. Regimen -Related Strategies Highly active antiretroviral regimens often require the administration of large numbers of pills or unpalatable liquids, each with potential side effects and drug interactions, in multiple daily doses. To the extent possible, regimens should be simplified with respect to the number of pills or volume of liquid prescribed, as wel l as frequency of therapy, and chosen to minimize drug interactions and side effects [53]. When nonadherence is a problem, addressing medication- related issues, such as side effects, may result in improvement. If a regimen is overly complex, it may be simplified. For example, when the burden of pills is great, one or more drugs can be changed to result in a regimen containing fewer pills and potentially greater adherence . Several studies in adults have demonstrated better adherence in once- daily compared with twice -daily antiretroviral regimens [54-56]. When nonadherence is related to poor palatability of a liquid formulation or crushed pills, the offending taste may be masked by a small amount of flavoring syrups or food, as long as the medication is not August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 83 one with contraindications to simultaneous administration of food (see Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ), or the child may be taught to swallow pills in order to overcome medication aversion [57]. Child/Family -Related Strategies The primary approach taken by the clinical team to promote medication adherence in children is patient/caregiver education. Educating families about adherence should begin before antiretroviral medications are initiated or changed and should include a discussion of the goals of therapy, the reasons for making adherence a priority, and the specific plans for supporting and maintaining the child's medication adherence. Caregivers should understand that the first antiretroviral regimen has the best chance of long- term success. Caregiver adherence education strategies should include the provision of both information and adherence tools, such as written and v isual materials; a daily schedule illustrating times and doses of medications; and demonstration of the use of syringes, medication cups, and pillboxes. A number of behavioral tools can be used to integrate taking medications into the HIV- infected child' s daily routine. The use of behavior modification techniques, especially the application of positive reinforcements and the use of small incentives for taking medications, can be effective tools to promote adherence [58-60]. Training children on swallowing pills has been associated with improved adherence at 6 months post- training in a small study of children age 4 to 21 [61]. Availability of mental health services and treatment of mental health disorders may also facilitate adherence to complex antiretroviral regimens. For nonadherent children who are at risk of disease progression and for whom aversion to taking medications is severe and persistent, a gastrostomy tube may be considered [62]. Home nursing interventions may also be beneficial where adequate resources are available [63]. Directly observed dosing of antiretroviral medications has been implemented in adults and pediatrics with promising results [48-52, 64] , and such an approach has been implemented in some pediatric HIV programs, using home nursing services as well as daily medication administration in the clinic setting. Other strategies to support ad herence that have been employed in the clinical setting include setting patient cell phones to alarm when medications are due to be taken, providing pill boxes and other adherence support tools, and weekly filling of pill boxes by nursing or pharmacy staff particularly for patients with complex regimens. Health Care Provider-Related Strategies Providers have the ability to improve adherence through their relationships with the families. This process begins early in the provider's relationship with the fam ily, when the clinician obtains explicit agreement about the medication and treatment plan and any further strategies to support adherence. Fostering a trusting relationship and engaging in open communication are particularly important [65-67]. Provider characteristics that have been associated with improved patient adherence in adults include consistency, giving information, asking questions, technical expertise, and commitment to follow-up. Creating an environment in the health care setting that is child centered and includes caregivers in adherence support has also been shown to improve treatment outcomes [68]. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 84 Table 1 6. Strategies to Improve Adherence with Antiretroviral Medications Initial Intervention Strategies Establish trust and identify mutually acceptable goals for care. Obtain explicit agreement on need for treatment and adherence. Identify depression, low self-esteem, drug use, or other mental health issues for the child/adolescent and/or caregiver that may decrease adherence. Treat prior to starting antiretroviral drugs, if possible. Identify family, friends, health team members, or others who can help with adherence support. Educate patient and family about the critical role of adherence in therapy outcome. Specify the adherence target: 95% of prescribed doses. Educate patient and family about the relationship between partial adherence and resistance. Educate patient and family about resistance and constraint of later choices of antiretroviral drug (i.e., explain that although a failure of adherence may be temporary, the effects on treatment choice may be permanent). Develop a treatment plan that the patient and family understand and to which they feel committed. Establish readiness to take medication by practice sessions or other means. Consider a brief period of hospitalization at start of therapy in selected circumstances for patient education and to assess tolerability of medications chosen. Medication Strategies Choose the simplest regimen possible, reducing dosing frequency and number of pills. Choose a regimen with dosing requirements that best conform to the daily and weekly routines and variations in patient and family activities. Choose the most palatable medicine possible (pharmacists may be able to add syrups or flavoring agents to increase palatability). Choose drugs with the fewest side effects; provide anticipatory guidance for management of side effects. Simplify food requirements for medication administration. Prescribe drugs carefully to avoid adverse drug-drug interactions. Assess pill swallowing capacity and offer pill swallowing training . Follow- up Intervention Strategies Monitor adherence at each visit and in between visits by telephone or letter as needed. Provide ongoing support, encouragement, and understanding of the difficulties of the demands of attaining 95% adherence with medication doses. Use patient education aids including pictures, calendars, and stickers. Use pill boxes, reminders, alarms, pagers, and timers. Provide follow-up clinic visits or telephone calls to support and assess adherence. Provide access to support groups, peer groups, or one-on-one counseling for caregivers and patients, especially for those with known depression or drug use issues that are known to decrease adherence. Provide pharmacist -based adherence support. Consider gas trostomy tube use in selected circumstances. Consider a brief period of hospitalization for selected circumstances of apparent virologic failure to assess adherence and reinforce that medication adherence is fundamental to successful antiretroviral therap y. Consider directly observed therapy at home, in the clinic, or during a brief inpatient hospitalization.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 88 Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance (Updated August 16, 2010) Panel's Recommendations: If a child has severe or life -threatening toxicity, all components of the drug regimen should be stopped immediately ( AIII). Once the symptoms of toxicity have resolved, antiretroviral therapy should be resumed with substitution of a different antiretroviral drug or drugs for the offending agent(s) (AII*). When changing therapy because of toxicity or intolerance to a specific drug in a virally suppressed individual, changing a single drug in a multi-drug regimen is permissible; if possible, an agent with a different toxicity and side effect profile should be chosen ( AI*). The toxicity and the medication presumed responsible should be documented in the medical record and the caregiver and patient advised of the drug- related toxicity to facilitate future medication choices if care is transferred (AIII). Dose reduction is not a recommended option in the setting of antiretroviral toxicity except when therapeutic drug monitoring indicates a drug concentration above the normal therapeutic range ( AII*). Side effects or intolerance of antiretroviral agents occur with moderate frequency and should prompt a re- evaluation of the antiretroviral regimen. Drug- related to xicity may be acu te, occurring soon after a drug has been administered; subacute, occurring within 1 2 days of administration; or late, occurring after prolonged drug administration. Such adverse events may vary in severity from mild to severe and life threatening ( see Table s 17a -17h . Antiretroviral Therapy -Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations ). Identification of the responsible agent may allow for substitution of a similar agent to which the patient's virus is sensitive. K nowledge of the patient's prior antiretroviral history and, if possible, viral resistance profile prior to the current course of antiretroviral therapy is essential. Any new agent used should be assessed for likely effectiveness against the patient's virus and for possible interactions with the other medications the patient will take. Experience with antiretroviral drugs has led to the recognition of several types of distinct adverse drug effects that may be most common with certain antiretroviral drugs or drug classes (see Tables 17a-17h. Antiretroviral Therapy -Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations ). The physician, patient, and caregiver should discuss the response to a medication- related toxicity, taking into account the severity of toxicity, the relative need for viral suppression, and the available antiretroviral options. In general, mild and moderate toxicities do not require discontinuation of therapy or drug substitution; symptomatic treatment may be gi ven, such as antihistamines for a mild rash. For some moderate toxicities, substituting the toxicity -associated antiretroviral drug with a drug in the same drug class but with a different toxicity profile may be sufficient and discontinuation of all therapy may not be required. Severe, life-threatening toxicity requires discontinuation of all antiretroviral drugs and the initiation of appropriate supportive therapy (depending on the type of toxicity). Another drug can be substituted for the drug associated with the toxicity once the patient is stabilized and the toxicity is resolved. When a patient experiences an unacceptable adverse effect from antiretroviral therapy every attempt should be made to identify the offending agent and replace the drug with anot her effective agent to minimize the amount of time a patient is on suboptimal therapy. For example, if therapy needs to be stopped due to a severe or life-threatening side effect, all antiretroviral drugs should be stopped. Once the offending drug or alter native cause for the adverse event has been determined, planning can begin for resumption of therapy with a new antiretroviral drug regimen that does not contain the offending drug or with the original regimen if the event is attributable to another cause. All drugs in the antiretroviral regimen should then be started simultaneously, rather than starting them one at a time and observing for adverse effects. Many experts recommend stopping August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 89 efavirenz or nevirapine several days before stopping other drugs, if possible, because these drugs have a significantly longer half -life than NRTI antiretroviral drugs. However, if a patient has a severe or life - threatening toxicity, all components of the drug regimen should be stopped simultaneously, regardless of drug half-life. When therapy is changed because of toxicity or intolerance in the context of virologic suppression, agents with different toxicity and side -effect profiles should be chosen, when possible. Clinicians should have comprehensive knowledge of the toxi city profile of each agent before selecting a new regimen. In the event of drug intolerance, changing a single drug in a multi -drug regimen is a permissible option. For a patient who is not virally suppressed, a single drug substitution with an active agent is generally not recommended due to concern for development of resistance (see Approach to the Management of Antiretroviral Treatment Failure ). Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is not available on a routine basis to most clinicians, and the settings in which TDM is useful are unclear, especially in children. One such setting, however, may be in the context of a child with mild or moderate toxicity possibly attributable to a particular antiretr oviral agent (see Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Management of Treatment Failure ). In this situation, it is reasonable for the clinician to use TDM (if available) to determine if the tox icity is due to a concentration of drug exceeding the normal therapeutic range. This is the only setting in which dose reduction would be considered appropriate management of drug toxicity, and even then it should be used with caution. Management strategies for drug intolerance include: Symptomatic treatment of mild -to-moderate transient side effects. If necessary, change from one drug to another drug to which the patient's virus is sensitive (e.g., change to stavudine for zidovudine -related anemia or to n evirapine for efavirenz -related central nervous system symptoms). Change in drug class, if necessary (e.g., from a PI to an NNRTI or vice versa) and if the patient's virus is sensitive to a drug in that class. Dose reduction only when drug levels are deter mined excessive. Tables 17a-17h. Antiretroviral Therapy -Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations describe specific adverse drug effects observed in children, including lactic acidosis, hepatic toxicity, fat osteopenia, hematological complications, and hypersensitivity reactions and skin rashes.

Consider repeat CBC at 4 weeks for higher ris k babies (exposed to ARVs in utero or as neonates, premature birth, or low birth Hgb). HIV- infected children on ARVs : Avoid ZDV in children with anemia when alternative agents are available. Monitor CBC 3 -4 times per year as part of routine care. HIV-expo sed newborns : Rarely require intervention unless Hgb is <7.0 gm/dL or anemia is associated with symptoms. Consider discontinuing ZDV if 4 weeks of 6 - week ZDV prophylaxis regimen are already completed . (see Perinatal Guidelines). HIV- infected children on ARVs : Discontinue non- ARV marrow -toxic drugs if feasible. Treat coexisting iron deficiency, OIs, malignancies. Rarely necessary to discontinue ARV therapy. For persistent anemia thought to be associated with ARVs: o change to a non - ZDV -containing regimen; o give erythropoietin 50-200 IU/kg/dose 3 times weekly.

Antiretroviral Therapy -Associated Adverse Eff ects and Management Recommendations - Hepatic Events Page 1 of 2 Adverse Effects Associated ARVs Onset/Clinical Manifestations Estimated Frequency Risk Factors Prevention/ Monitoring Management Hepatic Events: Hepatic toxicity (elevated AST, ALT, clinical hepatitis) All ARVs Onset : NNRTI and PI therapy : Within 12 weeks of initiation. NRTI therapy : Within months to years of initiation. Any antiretroviral combination regimen: Early due to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Presentation : Asymptomatic elevation of AST, ALT. May be associated with symptoms of clinical hepatitis including nausea, fatigue, and jaundice. NRTIs, especially ZDV, ddI, d4T, may be associated with lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis. Rarely, prolonged exposure to ddI is associated with non - cirrhotic portal hypertension with esophageal varicies. Uncommon in children. Frequency varies with different agents and drug combinations (NVP, TPV of particular concern). HBV or HCV coinfection Elevated baseline ALT, AST Other hepatotoxic medications Alcohol use Underlying liver disease For NVP - associated hepatic events in adults: o female with with pre-NVP CD4 cells/mm 3 Higher drug concentrations for PIs, particularly TPV Prevention : Avoid concomitant use of hepatot oxic medications. Monitoring : For ARVs other than NVP : Obtain AST, ALT at baseline and at least every 3 -4 months or more frequently in at - risk patients (e.g., HBV or HCV coinfected, elevated baseline AST, ALT). For NVP : Obtain AST, ALT at baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, then every 3 months. In asymptomatic patients with ALT or AST >5 -10 times ULN, some may consider discontinuing ARVs, others may continue therapy with close monitoring. If hepatic enzymes elevated >5 -10 times ULN, most clinicians would avoid N VP. In symptomatic patients, discontinue all ARVs and other potential hepatotoxic agents and avoid restart of the offending agent. If a symptomatic hepatic event occurs on NVP, permanently discontinue NVP (see also NVP hypersensitivity).

Although uncertain, avoiding use of d4T, PI -containing regimens might reduce risk. Monitoring : Monitor polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, change in body habitus, acanthosis nigricans. Obtain random plasma glucose (RPG) levels at: o initiation of ARV therapy; o 3-6 months later; and o annually thereafter. For RPG > 140 mg/dL, obtain fasting plasma glucose (FPG) performed after 8 - hour fast and consider referral to endocrinologist. Counsel lifestyle modification (low fat diet, exercise, no smoking).

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 97 * Insulin resistance, asymptomatic hyperglycemia, and diabetes mellitus form a spectrum of increasing severity . Insulin resistance is often defined as elevated insulin levels for the level of glucose observed; impaired fasting plasma glucose (impaired FPG) as an FPG of 100- 125 mg/dL; impaired glucose tolerance is an elevated 2-hour PG of 140- 199 mg/dL in a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); and diabetes mellitus as either a FPG > 126 mg/dL, a random PG >200 mg/dL in a patient with hyperglycemia symptoms, a HgbA1C of > 6.5%, or a 2- hour PG after OGTT > 200 mg/dL. However, the Panel does not recommend routine determinations of insulin levels, glycosylated hemoglobin A1C, or glucose tolerance without consultation with an endocrinologist; these guidelines are instead based on the readily available random and fasting plasma glucose levels.

HIV infection Poor diet Lack of exercise Obesity Hypertension Smoking Family history of dyslipidemia or premature CVD Metabolic syndrome Prevention : Low fat diet, exercise, no smoking. Monitoring : Adolescents and adults : Obtain fasting (12- hour) TC, HDL -C, TG, LDL -C prior to initiating or changing ARV therapy, 3 -6 months thereafter, then every 6 - 12 months. Children without lipid abnormalities or risk factors : Obtain nonfasting screening lipid profiles prior to initiating or changing therapy and every 6 -12 months if stable. If TG or LDL -C is elevated, obtain fasting blood tests. Children with lipid abnormalities and/or additional r isk factors : Obtain fasting (12 -hour) TC, HDL -C, TG, LDL -C prior to initiating or changing therapy and every 6 months (or more often if indicated). Children receiving lipid -lowering therapy with statins or fibrates : Obtain fasting (12 -hour) lipid profiles , liver function tests (LFTs), and creatine kinase (CK) prior to initiating lipid therapy and at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after starting lipid therapy. If minimal Counsel lifestyle modification (low fat diet, exercise, smoking cessation) for adequate trial period (3 -6 months). Switch to a new ARV regimen less likely to cause lipid abnormalities. * Pharmacologic Management : Prompt intervention is require d in patients with TG 500 mg/dL (high risk of pancreatitis).

Goal LDL -C 100 mg/dL o Moderate -risk patients : Goal LDL - C 130 mg/dL o At-risk patients : Goal LDL -C 160 mg/dL. * The risks of new treatment -related toxicities and virologic failure that could occur with changes in therapy must be weighed against the potential risk of drug interactions and toxicities associated with the use of lipid -lowering agents. Statins are teratogenic and should not be used in female patients who may become pregnant. Serious toxicities include hepatot oxicity, skeletal muscle toxicity, and rhabdomyolysis. Experience with statins limited to children >6 years of age. Multiple drug interactions with lipid -lowering agents and ARVs. Pravastatin (Pravachol) 8-13 years of mg once daily; 14- 18 years of age: 40 mg once daily Atorvastatin (Lipitor) >6 years of age: 10 -20 mg once daily It is unclear what the long -term risks of lipid abnormalities are in children receiving combination antiretroviral therapy.

However, prolonging the lead -in phase beyond 14 days may increase the risk of nevirapine resistance due to subtherapeutic drug levels. Management of children who have persi stent mild or moderate rash after the lead -in period should be individualized and consultation with an expert in HIV care should be obtained. Nevirapine should be stopped if the rash is severe or is worsening or progressing. Key to Abbreviations : ABC = abacavir; ALT = alanine O, Truffa M, et al.

Adults : 2%-84% Children : 1%-33%, perhaps more common in adolescents than prepubertal children Genetic predisposition Puberty HIV- associated inflammation Central lipohypertrophy Most associated with PIs and EFV Can occur in the absence of ART Presentation : Central fat accumulation with increased abdominal girth, which may include dorsocervical fat pad (buffalo hump) and/or gynecomastia. The appearance of central lipohypertrophy is accentuated in the presence of peripheral fat wasting (lipoatrophy). In adults, waist circumference >102 cm (men) or >88 cm (women) is associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome. For children and adolescent s, waist circumference above the 75% percentile for age is associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome. See above PIs EFV Prevention : Diet and exercise. Monitoring : Measure waist circumference, waist to height ratio, and/or BMI (increase of each associated with development of metabolic syndrome). Diet and exercise, especially strength training. Liposuction (Lipohypertrophy may reoccur after this cosmetic procedure; liposuction is not recommended for children.) Recombinant human growth hormone or growth hormone - releasing hormone (investigational). Metformin and rosiglitazone are not useful for treatment.

When complete virologic suppression cannot be achieved, the goals of therapy are to preserve or restore immunologic function (as measured by CD4 lymphocyte values), prevent clinical disease progression, and preserve future antiretroviral options ( AII). Not all instances of treatment failure require an immediate change in therapy; careful a ssessment, especially of adherence, is required to evaluate the etiology of the treatment failure and determine an appropriate management strategy ( AII). Children who experience treatment failure should be managed in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist ( AI*). Although many children can remain on stable antiretroviral therapy for several years [1-4], at some point reassessment of a therapeutic regimen will become necessary. This section will discuss the definitions, causes, assessment, and management of antiretroviral treatment failure and specific issues to consider when changing a drug regimen. Treatment failure is defined as suboptimal response or a lack of sustained response to therapy using virologic, immunologic, and clinical criteria. It is important to recognize that not all instances of treatment failure require an immediate change in antiretroviral therapy, and a careful assessment is required to evaluate the etiology of treatment failure and determine the appropriate management strategy. Although the approach to treatment failure is generally straightforward after failure of the first regimen, it is typically more complex for children who have received more than one antiretroviral regimen. However, with the recent development of new antiretroviral agents, including those directed at new viral targets, the goal of treatment regimens for all patients \u2014whether on initial, second, or subsequent regimen\u2014is complete virologic suppression, combined with the recovery or maintenance of immunologic parameters and improvement in baseline clinical condition (or maintenance of clinical condition if asymptomatic). (See Assessment of Patients with Antiretroviral Treatment Failure and Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance ). Decisions regarding changing antiretroviral therapy may need to be individualized and should take into consideration the child's treatment history and toxicities; prior and current detection of drug- resistant virus; current virologic, immunologic, and clinical status; ability to adhere to a new regimen; and available treatment options. In the context of these comple xities it is recommended that all children being evaluated for treatment failure be managed in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist. Developmental as well as behavioral characteristics distinguish adolescents from adults and affect decisions arou nd management of treatment failure (see Specific Issues in Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV -Infected Adolescents ). Drug metabolism may vary during puberty, necessitating a reassessment of medication dosing throughout adolescence. In some instances, young adults may require larger doses by weight or by surface area than older adults. In addition, dosing recommendations for adolescents have not been established for a number of new antiretroviral medications now used in adults. Dosing guidance for children and adolescents for all antiretroviral agents can be found in Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information . The Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents can provide additional information to help inform management of antiretroviral treatment failure in adolescents. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 117 Definition of Treat ment Failure ( see Table 12 ): Treatment failure is categorized as virologic, immunologic, and clinical failure. Laboratory results must be confirmed with repeat testing before making a final assessment of virologic or immunologic treatment failure. Virologic Failure: Virologic failure occurs as an incomplete response to therapy or a viral rebound after achieving virologic suppression. Incomplete viral response to therapy: Incomplete virologic response to therapy is defined for all children as a <1.0 log 10 decrease in HIV RNA copy number from baseline after 8 -12 weeks of therapy, HIV RNA >400 copies/mL after 6 months of therapy, or repeated HIV RNA greater than the level of detection using the most sensitive assay after 12 months of therapy. Children with higher HIV RNA levels at initiation of therapy, especially infants, may take longer to reach undetectable viral load. Viral rebound: For children who have previously achieved undetectable plasma viral load in response to therap y, viral rebound is defined as subsequent, repeated detection of plasma HIV RNA on ultrasensitive PCR assays. Infrequent episodes of low level viremia (<1,000 copies/mL) are common and not generally reflective of virologic failure, whereas repeated or pers istent viremia (especially if >1,000 copies/mL) more likely represents viral rebound. Immunologic Failure: Evaluation of immune response in children is complicated by the normal age- related changes in CD4 cell count discussed previously (see Immunologic Monitoring in Children ). Thus, the normal decline in CD4 values with age needs to be taken into account when evaluating declines in CD4 parameters. CD4 percentage tends to vary less with age; absolute CD4 count values in children approach those of adults at about 5 years of age. Consequently, changes in absolute count may be used in children 5 years of age. Incomplete immunologic response to therapy: This is defined as a failure to improve CD4 values by 5 percentage points in a child <5 years of age with severe immune suppression (CD4 percentage <15%) or as a failure to improve CD4 values by 50 cells/mm 3 above baseline within the first year of therapy in a child age 5 years old or older with severe immune suppression (CD4 <200 cells/mm3). Immunologic decline: This is defined as a sustained decline of 5 perce ntage points in CD4 percentage below pretherapy baseline at any age or decline to below pretherapy baseline in absolute CD4 cell count in children who are 5 years of age. Declines that represent a change to a more advanced category of immunosuppression compared with baseline (e.g., from CD4 percentage of 28% to 23% or from CD4 count of 250 cells/mm 3 to 150 cells/mm3) or to more severe immunosuppression in those already suppressed at baseline (e.g., from CD4 percentage of 14% to 9% or from CD4 count of 150 cells/mm3 to 100 cells/mm3) are of particular concern. Clinical Failure: The occurrence of new opportunistic infections and/or general clinical disease progression represents the most urgent and concerning type of treatment failure and should prompt an im mediate evaluation. Clinical findings should be viewed in the context of virologic and immunologic response to therapy; in patients with stable virologic and immunologic parameters, development of clinical symptoms may not represent treatment failure. For example, development of a new opportunistic infection in a patient who had severe immune suppression at the time of recent initiation of therapy may not reflect failure of virologic suppression, but rather persistence of immune dysfunction despite adequate virologic response. Additionally, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) should be excluded as a possible cause of clinical symptoms before it is concluded that there is suboptimal clinical response to therapy. Although clinical events occurri ng in the first several months after antiretroviral initiation should not necessarily be construed as antiretroviral treatment failure, the occurrence of significant clinical disease progression, such as noted below, requires strong consideration that the current treatment regimen is failing: Progressive neurodevelopmental deterioration: The presence of two or more of the following findings documented on repeated assessments: impairment in brain growth, decline of cognitive function documented by psychometric testing, or clinical motor dysfunction. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 118 Growth failure: Persistent decline in weight-growth velocity despite adequate nutritional support and without other explanation. Severe or recurrent infection or illness: Recurrence or persistence of AIDS -definin g conditions or other serious infections. Children who experience treatment failure do not always require an immediate change in therapy; careful assessment is required to evaluate the etiology of the treatment failure and determine an appropriate management strategy (see Assessment of Patients with Antiretroviral Treatment Failure ). Discordance between Viral, Immune, and Clinical Responses In general, effective combination antiretroviral the rapy that results in virologic suppression also leads to immune restoration or preservation as well as to prevention of new or recurrent HIV- related illnesses. Similarly, ineffective antiretroviral therapy that fails to achieve virologic suppression is commonly accompanied by concordant immunologic and clinical failure [5]. However, clinicians may also be p resented with patients in whom antiretroviral therapy is associated with failure in one domain (e.g., virologic failure) but a good response in the other domains (e.g., immunologic and clinical response). In fact, the discordance in responses to antiretrov iral therapy may occur in any of these three domains in relation to the other two. It is essential to consider potential alternative causes of discordant responses before concluding that antiretroviral treatment failure has truly occurred. A dequate Clinical and Immunologic Responses despite Incomplete Virologic Response: Some patients who are maintained on combination antiretroviral therapy may maintain immunologic and clinical benefit despite detectable viral replication for up to 3 years [6-15]. This observation is the rationale for continuing nonsuppressive antiretroviral therapy for immunologic and clinical benefit in selected patients for whom a completely suppressive regimen is not available or practicable. The risks and benefits as well as the indications for this approach are discussed in Approach to the Management of Antiretroviral Treatment Failure and Choice of Next Antiretroviral Regimen for Treatment Failure with Evidence of Drug Resistance . The proposed mechanisms for immunologic and clinical benefit without complete virologic suppression are the maintenance of a lower viral load or the selection for strains harboring drug- resistance mutations that impair viral replication or virulence. Another potential explanation is that some of these children may have host genetic and/or virologic characteristics that would have allowed them to be either \"slow -progressors\" or \"long -term nonprogressors\" without therapy. Poor Immunologic Response despite Virologic Suppression Regardless of Clinical Response: Poor immunologic response despite virologic suppression can occur in the context of adequate or poor clinical response. The first considerations in cases of poor immunologic response despite virologic suppression are to exclude laboratory error in CD4 or viral load measurements and to ensure that CD4 values have been interpreted correctly in rela tion to the natural decline in CD4 count over the first 5-6 years of life. Another laboratory consideration is that some viral load assays may not amplify all HIV groups and subtypes (e.g., HIV-1 non-M groups or non-B subtypes, HIV-2), resulting in falsely low or negative viral load results (see Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection ). Once lab results are confirmed, evaluation for adverse drug effects, medical conditions, and other factors that can result in lower CD4 values is necessary. Additionally, in patients with baseline severe immunosuppression, it is common to achieve virologic suppression weeks to months before achieving immunologic recovery, resulting in a transient early treatment period of persistent immunosuppression during which additional clinical disease progression can occur. Patients who have very low baseline CD4 valu es prior to initiating combination therapy are at higher risk of an impaired CD4 lymphocyte response to antiretroviral therapy and may be at higher risk of death and AIDS-defining illnesses, despite virologic suppression [3, 12, 16- 20]. Certain antiretroviral regimens may be associated with a blunted CD4 response. Treatment with a regimen containing tenofovir and didanosine can blunt the CD4 response, especially if the didanosine dose is not adjusted downward [21]. In adults, antiretrov iral regimens containing zidovudine may also impair rise in CD4 count but not CD4 percentage, perhaps through the myelosuppressive effects of zidovudine; fortunately, this suboptimal CD4 count response to therapy does not seem to confer an increased risk of clinical events [22]. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 119 Several drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents) and other conditions (e.g., hepatitis C, tuberculosis, malnutrition, Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis) are independently associated with low CD4 values. Occasional cases of idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia have also been reported in adults without HIV infection [23]. Differential Diagnosis of Poor Immunologic Response despite Virologic Suppre ssion: Poor Immunologic Response despite Virologic Suppression and Good Clinical Response Lab error Normal age- related CD4 lymphocyte decline Low pretreatment CD4 lymphocyte count or percentage Adverse effects of use of zidovudine or the combination of tenofovir + didanosine Use of systemic corticosteroids or chemotherapeutic agents Conditions that can cause low CD4 values: hepatitis C coinfection, Sjogren's syndrome, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis Poor Immunologic and Clinical Responses despite Virologic Suppression Lab error, including HIV strain/type not detected by assay (HIV-1 non-M groups, non-B subtypes; HIV-2) Persistent immunodeficiency soon after initiation of antiretroviral therapy but prior to antiretroviral -related reconstitution Primary protein -calorie malnutrition Untreated tuberculosis Malignancy Loss of immunologic (CD4) reserve Poor Clinical Response despite Adequate Virologic and Immunologic Responses: Clinicians must carefully evaluate patients who experience clinical disease progression despite favorable immunological and virological responses to antiretroviral therapy. Not all cases represent antiretroviral treatment failure. One of the most important reasons for new or recurrent opportunistic conditions despite achieving virologic suppr ession and immunologic restoration/preservation within the first months of antiretroviral treatment is immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which does not represent antiretroviral treatment failure and does not generally require discontinuation of antiretroviral treatment. Children who have suffered irreversible damage to their lungs, brain, or other organs, especially during prolonged and profound pretreatment immunosuppression, may continue to have recurrent infections or symptoms in those damaged organs because the damage may not be reversed by immunologic improvement [24]. Such cases do not represent antiretrovira l treatment failure and would not be expected to benefit from a change in antiretroviral regimen. Evaluation for and treatment of other causes or conditions that can occur with or without HIV-related immunosuppression, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, malnu trition, and malignancy, should also be undertaken before drawing a conclusion of antiretroviral treatment failure. Occasionally, however, children will develop new HIV-related opportunistic conditions (e.g., Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP] or esophageal candidiasis occurring more than 6 months after achieving markedly improved CD4 values and virologic suppression) not explained by IRIS, pre-existing organ damage, or another reason. Such cases may be antiretroviral treatment failure and suggest that i mprovement in CD4 values may not necessarily represent return of complete immunologic function.

Considerations for Changing A ntiretroviral Therapy for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) -Infected Children * At least two measurements (taken 1 week apart) should be p erformed before considering a change in therapy. The initial HIV RNA level of the child at the start of therapy and the level achieved with therapy should be considered when contemplating potential drug changes. For example, an immediate change in therapy may not be warranted if there is a sustained 1.5 -2.0 log 10 decrease in HIV RNA copy number, even if RNA remains detectable at low levels. Additionally, virologic suppression may take longer in young children given their higher viral load at the time of initiation of therapy than in older children or adults. Continued observation with more frequent evaluation of HIV RNA levels should be considered if the HIV RNA increase is limited (i.e., <5,000 copies/mL), especially in children with limited treatment options. The presence of repeatedly detectable or increasing RNA levels suggests the development of resistance mutations and/or nonadherence. \u00a7 Declines that represent a change to a more advanced category of immunosuppression compared with baseline (e.g., from CD4 percentage of 28% to 23% or from CD4 count of 250 cells/mm 3 to 150 cells/mm3) or to more severe immunosuppression in those already suppressed at baseline (e.g., from CD4 percentage of 14% to 9% or from CD4 count of 150 cells/mm3 to 100 cells/m m3) are of particular concern. Virologic Considerations* Incompl ete viral response to therapy: Incomplete virologic response to therapy is defined for all children as a <1.0 log 10 decrease in HIV RNA copy number from baseline after 8 -12 weeks of therapy, HIV RNA >400 copies/mL after 6 months of therapy, or repeated HIV RNA above the level of detection using the most sensitive assay after 12 months of therapy. Viral rebound: For children who have previously achieved undetectable plasma viral load in response to therapy, viral rebound is defined as subsequent, repeated detection of plasma HIV RNA on ultrasensitive PCR assays. Infrequent episodes of low level viremia (<1,000 copies/mL) are common and not generally reflective of virologic failure, whereas repeated or persistent viremia (especially if >1,000 copies/mL) more likely represents viral rebound. Immunologic Considerations* Incomplete immunologic response to therapy: Failure in a child <5 years of age with severe immune supp ression (CD4 percentage <15%) to improve CD4 values by 5 percentage points or failure in a child 5 years of age with severe immune suppression (CD4 <200 cells/mm3) to improve CD4 values by 50 cells/mm3 above baseline within the first year of therapy. Immunologic decline: Sustained decline of 5 percentage points in CD4 percentage below pretherapy baseline at any age or decline to below pretherapy baseline in absolute CD4 cell count in children who are 5 years of age.\u00a7 Clinical Considerations Progressive neurodevelopmental deterioration: Two or more of the following on repeated assessments: impair ment in brain growth, decline of cognitive function documented by psychometric testing, or clinical motor dysfunction. Growth failure: Persistent decline in weight -growth velocity despite adequate nutritional support and without other explanation. Severe or recurrent infection or illness: Recurrence or persistence of AIDS - defining conditions or other serious infections.

ASSESSMENT OF PATIEN TS WITH ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT FAILURE Panel's Recommendations: Assess adherence to therapy and barriers and interventions to improve adherence because inadequate adherence is the most common cause of antiretroviral treatment failure ( AII). Assess medication intolerance ( AIII). Assess issues related to pharmacokinetics because developmental and individual differences in drug absorption, distribution, metaboli sm, and elimination can cause inadequate antiretroviral drug exposure that results in antiretroviral treatment failure ( AII). Perform antiretroviral drug -resistance testing when virologic failure occurs and prior to changing to a new regimen ( AI*). Perform assessment in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist (AI*). Each patient with an incomplete response to therapy should be assessed to determine the cause of treatment failure because the approach to management and subsequent treatment may differ depending on the etiology of the problem. In most instances, treatment failure is multifactorial. The assessment of a child with suspicion of treatment failure should include evaluation of adherence to therapy; medication intolerance; issues related to pharmacokinetics that could result in low drug levels or elevated, potentially toxic levels; and evaluation of suspected drug resistance. The main challenge to long- term maintenance of undetectable plasma viral load in adults and children is incomplete adherence to medication regimens, with the subsequent emergence of viral mutations conferring partial or complete resistance to one or more of the components of the antiretroviral regimen. Table 13 outlines a comprehensive approach to evaluating causes of treatment failure in children, with particular attention to adherence. An extensive history should focus on the details of drug administration as well as changes in the social and psychological circumstances of the family likely to impact the child's ability to adhere to therapy. In some situations, it may be necessary to directly observe drug-taking behaviors either in the clinic, at home, or within the hospital because history alone may not fully identify the barriers to complete a dherence [1-2]. Adherence Issues (For more details, see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV -Infected Children and Adolescents and Table 11 .) When treatment failure is observed, clinicians need to assess the likely contribution of adherence problems to the failure of the current regimen. In patients on initial therapy, poor virologic response or widely fluctuating viral loads are commonly an indication of poor adherence, particularly in the presence of susceptible virus. Even small lapses in adherence can lead to antiretroviral treatment failure [3-7]. Although adherence should be addressed at each medical visit for all children receiving antiretroviral therapy, suspicion of treatment failure warrants increased scrutiny. Patterns of adherence can change over time and may be influenced by a large number of factors related to the drugs themselves as well social and psychological issues of the child and the family. Evaluation of whether adherence problems are related to drug formulation, number of pills, drug dose timing and frequency, food or fasting requirements, or drug side effects is important for determining what changes would be best suited to the individual requirements of the child and family. Intensive family education, training in the administration of prescribed medications, and discussion of the importance of adherence to the drug regimen should be reinforced. If competing family needs are identified as impediments to adherence, social issues may need to be addressed before adherence can be improved. Issues to be addressed may include achieving financial or housing security, assessing concomitant mental health problems, accessing substance abuse treatment, and August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 124 initiating a discussion around HIV disclosure. In some situations, clinicians may need to involve outside agencies such as child protective services to ensure support of the child's treatment. Various interventions should be considered if problems within the household are extreme and unlikely to resolve in favor of successfully supporting the child's treatment. Frequent patient visits and intensive follow -up may be necessary to support new adherence interventions and efforts by the child and family to improve adherence to the current or new regimen. Directly observed therapy (DOT) may be used to identify additional factors impeding adherence as well as to confirm drug administration. Pharmacokinetic Issues In addition to poor adherence, inadequate drug exposure can result in treatment failure [8]. Children consistently require higher weight-based dosing of antiretroviral drugs compared with adults because of developmental differences in absorption, body composition, and metabolic activity through the pediatric age range [9]. Causes of subtherapeutic drug levels may include failure to increase dosing for rapid growth of the child or impaired absorption because of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea. Drug exposure may be enhanced or reduced by administering medications with food; the clinician should review the food/fasting requirements of the regimen with the patient and caregiver. Drug interactions can alter drug metabolism; all concomitant medications, including over- the-counter medications and nutritional and herbal supplements, should be reviewed to evaluate whether they may be contributing to poor treatment response. (See the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .) Several recent studies suggest that genetic polymorphisms may influence pharmacokinetics and therapeutic response for a number of antiretroviral medications [10-11]. In some circumstances, therapeutic drug monitoring can be considered for children receiving selected drugs (see Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Management of Treatment Failure ). Suspected Drug -Resistance Issues (See Antiretroviral Drug- Resistance Testing .) Antiretroviral drug resistance may de velop in children with inadequate viral suppression. Genotypic resistance testing can help assess adherence to therapy. If testing reveals no resistance-associated mutations to the drugs of the current regimen, it is unlikely that the child is taking these medications. The presence of mutations supports inadequate drug exposure and failure to fully suppress viral replication. Antiretroviral resistance testing should be performed while the patient is still taking the failing regimen or within 4 weeks of its discontinuation. In the absence of the selective pressure of antiretroviral drugs, virus variants harboring resistance mutations may decrease in frequency to below the limits of detection of standard resistance assays. Resistance testing can be used to gui de current management as well as to identify active antiretroviral medications for future regimens. Other laboratory tests such as tropism assays may be indicated as well if CCR5 inhibitors are being considered for treatment in the subsequent regimen. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 125 Table 1 9. Assessment of Antiretroviral Treatment Failure Assessment Method Intervention Adherence 1. Interview child and caretaker Take 24 -hour or 7- day recall Get description of: o WHO gives medication o WHAT is given (names, doses) o WHERE medications are kep t, administered o WHEN they are taken/given Have open -ended discussion of experiences taking/giving medications and barriers/challenges 2. Review pharmacy records Assess timeliness of refills Identify or re -engage family members to support/supervise adherenc e. Establish fixed daily times and routines for medication administration. Avoid confusion with drug names by explaining that drug therapies have generic names and trade names, and many agents are coformulated under a third or fourth name. Explore opportunities for facility or home -based directly observed therapy. 3. Observe medication administration Observe dosing/administration in clinic Conduct home -based observation by visiting health professional Admit to hospital for trial of therapy o Observe admin istration/tolerance o Monitor treatment response Simplify medication regimen if feasible. Substitute new agents if single ARV is poorly tolerated. Consider gastric tube placement to facilitate adherence. Consider directly observed therapy (DOT). Use tools to simplify administration (pill boxes, reminders including alarms, integrated medication packaging for AM or PM dosing, others). Suggest relaxation techniques. 4. Conduct psychosocial assessment Make a comprehensive family -focused assessment of factors likely to impact adherence with particular attention to recent changes: o Status of caregiver, financial stability, housing, intimate relationships o School and achievement o Substance abuse (child, caretaker, family members) o Mental health and behavior o Child/youth and caretaker beliefs about antiretroviral therapy o Disclosure status (to child and others) Address competing needs through appropriate social services. Address and treat concomitant mental illness and behavioral disorders. Initiate disclosure discussions with family/child. Consider need for child protection services and alternate care settings when necessary. Pharmaco - kinetics and Dosing 1. Recalculate doses for individual medications using weight or body surface area. 2. Identify concomitant medications including prescription, over -the-counter, and recreational substances; assess for drug - drug interactions. 3. Consider drug levels for specific antiretroviral drugs (see Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Management of Treatment Failure ). Adjust drug doses. Discontinue or substitute competing medications. Reinforce applicable food restrictions. Resistance Testing 1. Perform genotypic and phenotypic resistance assays (see Antiretroviral Drug - Resistance Testing ). 2. Perform tropism assay, as appropriate.

APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF ANTIRETROV IRAL TREATMENT FAILURE Panel Recommendations: The causes of treatment failure , which include drug resistance, poor absorption of medications, poor adherence, inadequate dosing, and drug-drug interactions, should be assessed and addressed ( AII). When deciding how to treat a child with treatment failure, the probability of achieving durable suppression based on the prior treatment history, drug resistance, drug potency, and likelihood of adherence should be considered as well as the future options available should durable suppression not be achieved; in addition, the future availability and timing of novel agents should be considered ( AII). Children who experience treatment failure should be managed in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist ( AI*). General Once the causes of failure have been identified and addressed, the chil d should be assessed to determine whether a change in the antiretroviral regimen is necessary. This will depend on the urgency and likelihood of achieving and sustaining an undetectable plasma viral load. The immediacy of implementing a more effective treatment regimen depends on the immunologic status of the child, with the greatest urgency for patients with clinical disease progression or clinical failure. The likelihood of achieving and maintaining undetectable plasma viral load depends on the extent of drug resistance, the number and quality of available agents that are active against the child's virus, and the likelihood of adherence to the new regimen. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 127 Timing of Initiation of a New Regimen: Relative Importance of Virologic Suppression and Immunologic Improvement Because immunologic improvement typically results from achieving undetectable plasma viral load [1], the urgency of re-establishing virologic suppression depends on the clinical and immunologic status of a child. For example, for older children or adolescents with very low CD4 cell counts (e.g., <200 cells/mm3), a change in therapy may be critical to prevent further immunologic decline or clinical disease progression and is strongly recommended. A patien t with less immunosuppression may not be at significant risk of clinical disease progression in the near future, so an immediate change in therapy is less urgent. However, continued treatment of a child with persistently detectable viremia increases the ri sk of immunologic or clinical disease progression and leads to further accumulation of resistance mutations, possibly further limiting future treatment options [2]. Likelihood of Viral Suppression below the Limit of Detection Using the Most Sensitive Assay When deciding whether to change a child's antiretroviral regimen, a clinician must assess whether such a change is likely to achieve significantly better virologic control than the current regimen. Although compl ete virologic suppression should be the goal, this may not always be achievable in HIV- infected children. Clinical benefit may be observed with decrements in HIV RNA levels that do not result in undetectable levels [1]. However, failure to maximally suppress plasma viral load is associated with an increased probability of acquiring mutations associated with resistance. Anticipating and minimizing toxicities is central to the clinician -patient discussion. The likelihood of adherence to a new regimen plays a significant role in determining whether to change an antiretroviral regimen; if a child is unlikely to adhere to a new regimen, resistance will develop and sustainable virologic suppression will not be achieved. Although studies differ on the exact predictors of adherence, several contributing factors have been noted. These include medication characteristics [3], psychosocial stressors [4-5], health beliefs [6], and prior adherence to medication (see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV -Infected Children and Adolescents for more detail). Importantly, the pediatric patient's adherence to antiretroviral therapy may change over time as the child moves through progressive developmental stages, and any changes in these risk factors can occur rapidly and unexpectedly. Thus, a clinician may choose to target a new antiretroviral regimen to start at a time when the child is most likely to adhere to this regimen for a sustained period. Categories of Children with Treatment Failure and Approaches to Consider No Viral Resistance Identified Persistent viremia in the absence of detectable viral resistance to current medications suggests that the virus is not being exposed to the antiretroviral agents. This lack of antiretroviral drug exposure is usually due to nonadherence, but it is important to exclude other factors such as poor drug absorption, incorrect dosing, and drug interactions. If adequate drug exposure can be assured, then resuming the existing current regimen should result in undetectable plasma levels. Resistance testing should take place while the child is on therapy, because predominant plasma vi ral strains may quickly revert to wild -type and fail to reveal the drug -resistant virus that would have been detectable while the patient was receiving therapy (see Antiretroviral Drug -Resistance Testing ). Thus, if a child with prior therapy develops resistant virus and then stops therapy, sensitive virus will dominate in the absence of therapy. In this situation, resuming the prior therapy would fail to suppress the virus because the resistant vir us would again emerge. An approach to identify resistance in this situation is to restart the prior medications while emphasizing adherence and repeating the resistance testing in 4 weeks (unless undetectable plasma viral load has already been achieved). If plasma virus is undetectable by ultrasensitive assays, it is likely that the virus is susceptible to the current therapy. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 128 Viral Resistance to Current Therapy The goal in this situation is to start a new regimen in order to fully suppress and sustain plasma viral load below the limits of detection and prevent the emergence of virus with additional resistance mutations. This requires a regimen that includes at least two, and preferably three, fully active agents. The choice of new agents should be based on current and past resistance testing (see Antiretroviral Drug -Resistance Testing ), the antiretroviral history, availability of new drugs and classes of agents, and consideration of potential toxicities. Some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., NRTIs) may contribute partial antiretroviral activity to an antiretroviral regimen, despite drug resistance. Because of the potential for cross resistance of some drugs within a single class, substituting a new drug from the same previously used class does not assure that the replacement drug will be fully active. This is particularly true for the NNRTIs nevirapine and efavirenz, for which cross resistance with drug mutations is uniformly seen. The availability of multiple new antiretroviral drugs, including some with new viral targets, makes complete virologic suppression achievable for many adult patients with treatment failure. Unfortunately, the lack of pediatric formulations and dosing information for many of these agents limits the number of options available for children. Thus, it remains difficult to identify a new, active regimen for many children with extensive pr ior therapy. (See The Use of Antir etroviral Agents Not Approved for Use in Children .) If there is evidence of poor adherence to the current regimen and an assessment that good adherence to a new regimen would also be difficult, the emphasis and effort should be placed on addressing barri ers to adherence. In such cases, some clinicians may choose to continue a nonsuppressive regimen that may provide some clinical and immunologic benefit while preserving future antiretroviral choices (see Choice of Next Antiretroviral Regimen for Treatment Failure with Evidence of Drug Resistance ). Treating with the same nonsuppressive regimen in such situations should be regarded as an acceptable but not ideal short- term strategy. These patients should be followed more closely than patients with stable virologic status, and the potential to successfully initiate a fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen should be reassessed at every opportunity. Extensive Drug Resistance Such That Two Fully Acti ve Agents cannot be Identified or Administered In the case of children for whom undetectable plasma virus is not achievable because two or more fully active agents cannot be identified, the goal is to preserve immunologic function and prevent clinical dis ease progression while preserving future options for new agents that are not yet available. Adult cohort studies suggest that there may be ongoing immunologic and clinical benefit if the HIV viral load can be maintained lower than 10,000-20,000 co pies/mL [7-8]. Several cohort studies show a clinical benefit of remaining on antiretroviral therapy whether this leads to a decrease in the viral load. The principal risk associated with continuing a failing regimen is the development of additional resistance mutations that can limit future treatment options. Interrupting therapy completely, on the other hand, may cause a rapid increase in viral load, a decrease in CD4 cell count that is frequently persistent, and an increas ed risk of clinical disease progression [4]. This approach should only be considered in special circumstances when there is a low risk that therapy interruption will quickly lead to severe immunosuppression (i.e., CD4 values at the time of therapy interruption are high). The goal of continued t reatment with an incompletely suppressive regimen is to select for resistant virus with reduced viral fitness that will cause slower disease progression while reducing the risk of drug toxicity and the development of new resistance mutations to multiple classes of drugs. The overall goal of these alternative strategies is to prevent clinical and immunological progression until additional active drugs are available that can be used to design a regimen that is expected to achieve undetectable plasma viral load [1, 9-17]. This approach should be regarded as acceptable but not ideal, these patients should be followed more closely than patients with stable virologic status, and the potential to successfully initiate a full y suppressive antiretroviral regimen should be reassessed at every opportunity. When managing disease progression in a patient with advanced disease and extensive resistance, the patient's quality of life must be considered. The relative benefits (e.g., r educed viral fitness, continued clinical benefit August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 129 despite resistance, etc.) and burdens of continuing a failing antiretroviral regimen should be discussed. Decisions to continue, discontinue, or simplify antiretroviral therapy should be made collaboratively with patients, families, and clinicians and should be consistent with the patients'/families' stated values and goals for care.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 130 CHOICE OF NEXT ANTIRETROVIRAL REGIMEN FOR TREATMENT FAILURE WITH EVIDENCE OF DRUG RES ISTANCE Panel's Recommendations: Antiretroviral regimens should be chosen based on treatment history and drug- resistance testing, including past and current resistance test results ( AI*). Ideally, use three fully active antiretroviral medications in the new regimen, assessing anticipated antiretroviral activity based on past treatment history and resistance test results (AII* ). Interpretation of resistance test results showing complex combinations of mutations and assessment of future treatment options should be made in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist ( AI*). Use of novel agents with limited available pharmacokinetic and /or safety data in pediatric populations should be undertaken only in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist ( AIII). General After carefully reaching a decision that a change in therapy is needed, the clinician should attempt to identify at leas t two but preferably three fully active antiretroviral agents on the basis of resistance testing, prior antiretroviral exposure, acceptability to the patient, and likely adherence [1-5]. This often requires the use of one or more new drug classes. Substitution or addition of a single drug to a failing regimen should be avoided because this approach is unlikely to achieve and sustain an undetectable plasma viral load and frequently will result in additional drug resistance. A drug may be \"new\" to the patient but have diminished antiviral potency due to the presence of drug mutations that confer cross resistance within a drug class. In children who are changing therapy due to occurrence or progression of abnormal neurodevelopment, the new treatment regimen should include agents (such as zidovudine) that are known to achieve higher levels within the central nervous system [6-9]. A change to a new regimen must include an extensive discussion of treatment adherence and potential toxicity with the patient in an age - and development-appropriate manner and with the patient's caregivers. The clinician must recognize that conflicting requirements of some medications with respect to food a nd concomitant medication restrictions may complicate coordination of a regimen. Timing of medication administration is particularly important to ensure adequate antiretroviral drug exposures throughout the day. Palatability, pill size, pill number, and do sing frequency all need to be considered when choosing a new regimen. Choice of Therapy with Viral Resistance to Current Therapy: Goal of Complete Virologic Suppression Determination of a new regimen with the best chance for complete virologic suppression in children who have already experienced treatment failure should be made in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist. Antiretroviral regimens should be chosen based on treatment history and drug- resistance testing to optimize antiretroviral drug potency in the new regimen. A general strategy for regimen change is shown in Table 14 , although as additional agents are licensed and studied for use in children, newer strategies that are better tailored to the needs of each patient may be constructed. If a child has received initial therapy with an NNRTI -based regimen, a change to a PI- based regimen is recommended; if a child received initial therapy with a PI -based regimen, a change to an NNRTI- based regimen is recommended. R esistance to the NNRTI nevirapine results in cross resistance to the NNRTI efavirenz and vice versa; however, the newer NNRTI etravirine retains activity against nevirapine - or efavirenz -resistant virus in the presence of a limited number of NNRTI resistan ce-associated mutations. Etravirine is currently approved for use only in adults; pediatric studies are under way. Choice of the new dual-NRTI component is particularly important when constructing a regimen because the choice of an insufficiently potent N RTI may result in the selection of additional NRTI -related drug mutations. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 131 Resistance testing is essential to properly select a potent NRTI combination, and interpretation of these results should take place in collaboration with an expert in pediatric HIV infection (see Antiretroviral Drug- Resistance Testing ). In this case, use of a triple- class regimen or a novel agent may be necessary. If a patient has substantial pre -existing resistance or if the initial regimen contained drugs from all three major classes (NRTI, NNRTI, and PI), the drug- resistance profile and management approach is likely to resemble that of a patient who has had multiple antiretroviral regimen failures (see Choice of Therapy with Extensive Drug Resistance Such That Two Fully Active Agents Cannot Be Identified or Administered ). In this situation, a new regimen with only two fully active agents may be the best available option. Lopinavir/ritonavir- based regimens have shown durable antiretroviral activity in antiretroviral treatment - experienced children, including children with prior PI therapy [10-12]. Adult studies of treatment -experienced patients have shown that using one or more new class(es) of drug (e.g., integrase inhibitors, entry inhibitors), possibly coupled with a ritonavir-boosted PI (e.g., darunavir) in PI- experienced, multiresistant patients is associated with bette r virologic responses [13-14]. Appendix B: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information provides more detailed information on drug formulation, pediatric and adult dosing, and toxicity a s well as discussion of available pediatric data for the approved antiretroviral drugs, including new drugs in existing classes such as darunavir and new classes of drugs such as CCR5 antagonists integrase inhibitors. Maraviroc (CCR5 inhibitor) and raltegravir (integrase inhibitor) are approved for use in adolescents 16 years or older and can be considered for management of older adolescents with multi drug failure; pediatric trials are under way or in development. Previously prescribed drugs discontinued due to poor tolerance or poor adherence may sometimes be reintroduced. Reintroduction of the drugs is particularly possible if antiretroviral resistance did not develop and if prior difficulties with tolerance and adherence can be overcome (e.g., by swi tching from a liquid to pill formulation). Limited data in adults suggest that continuation of lamivudine can contribute to suppression of HIV replication despite the presence of lamivudine resistance mutations and can maintain lamivudine mutations (184V) that can partially reverse the effect of other mutations conferring resistance to zidovudine, stavudine, and tenofovir [15-17]. The use of new drugs that have been evaluated in adults but have not been fully evaluated in children might be justified and is ideally done in the framework of a clinical trial (see The Use of Antiretroviral Agents Not Approved for Use in Children ). Expanded access programs or cl inical trials may be available. New drugs should be used in combination with at least one, and ideally two, additional active agents. The HIV entry inhibitor enfuvirtide (T-20) has been approved for use in heavily treatment experienced patients based on potent antiretroviral activity in heavily treatment experienced adults and has been approved for use in children age 6 years [18-19]. Studies have helped establish safety, appropriate dosing, and efficacy of enfuvir tide in treatment -experienced children 6 years of age; this therapy has the disadvantage of administration by subcutaneous injection twice daily [20-21]. Enfuvirtide adherence in adolescent populations remains a un ique challenge when compared with younger children. However, this agent should be considered as an option when designing a new regimen for pediatric populations who have failed treatment with multiple classes of antiretroviral medi cations. Pharmacokineti c studies of certain dual-boosted PI regimens saquinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir with atazanavir/ritonavir) suggest that pharmacokinetic targets for both PIs can be achieved or exceeded when used in combination in adults [22-24] and in children [25-27]. Pharmacokinetic studies of other dual-boosted PI combinations are limited but suggest inadequate drug levels of one or both PIs [28-29]. A study in Thailand of 50 PI-na\u00efve but NRTI+/-NNRTI experienced children treated with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (230/57.5 mg/m2 twice daily) and saquinavir (50 mg/kg twice daily, maximum dose 1,000 mg) demonstrated trough levels of both PIs at or above therapeutic targets and complete viral suppression at 48 weeks for 50% of patients. The regimen was well tolerated but hyperlipidem ia was common. The use of multi drug regimens, sometimes including up to 3 PIs and/or 2 N NRTIs, has shown efficacy in a pediatric case series [30] but should be used cautiously due to its complexity, poor tolerability, and unfavorable drug-drug interactions. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may be helpful for confirming therapeutic PI levels when using PIs in combinations that result in complex drug interactions or when there is partially reduced PI activity August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 132 due to the presence of drug- resistance mutations (see Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Management of Treatment Failure ). When searching for at least two fully active agents in cases of extensive drug resistance, the clinician should consider the potential availability and future use of newer therapeutic agents that may not be studied or approved in children or may be in clinical development (see The Use of Antiretroviral Agents Not Approved for Use in Children ). Information concerning potential clinical trials can be found at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/clinical_trials and through collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist. Children should be enrolled in clinical trials of new drugs whenever possible. Choice of Therapy with Extensive Drug Resistance Such That Two Fully Active Agents Cannot Be Identified or Administered The creation of an effective and sustainable therapeutic regimen may not be possible with currently av ailable agents due to lack of potency in the face of extensive drug resistance or the patient's inability to adhere to or tolerate combination antiretroviral therapy. In such cases, nonsuppressive regimens (or \"holding regimens\") are sometimes used with th e overall objective of preventing clinical and immunological deterioration pending availability of additional active drugs that can be used to design a regimen that is expected to achieve undetectable plasma viral load. This approach should be regarded as acceptable but not ideal. These patients should be followed more closely than patients with stable virologic status, and the potential to successfully initiate a fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen should be reassessed at every opportunity. Even when NRTI drug- resistance mutations are present, there can be immunologic and clinical benefit despite persistent viremia when patients are treated with lamivudine monotherapy or when they are treated with lamivudine or emtricitabine in combination with one or more other NRTIs, such as zidovudine, stavudine, abacavir, or tenofovir activity against nevirapine- or efavirenz -resistant virus in the presence of a limited nu mber of NNRTI resistance -associated mutations, efavirenz or nevirapine should not be continued as part of a failing regimen if NNRTI resistance is documented. Continued use of a PI in the face of persistent viremia can lead to accumulation of additional m utations conferring resistance to that PI as well as other, newer PIs. Such acquisition of additional PI drug resistance occurs slowly, especially if the viral load is relatively low [33-35]. However, continued PI use, in the presence of resistance, may limit viral replication and be beneficial to some patients. In general, every effort should be made to avoid adding a single, new, fully active agent to these \"holding\" nonsuppressive regimens because such use of a single fully active agent will quickly lead to diminished activity of that agent. When clinical or immunologic deterioration occurs in such cases, it is often appropriate to use investigational agents or agents approved for older age groups as a second fully active drug in the new regimen (see The Use of Antiretroviral Agents Not Approved for Use in Children ). August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 133 Table 20.

This is particularly important in selecting NRTI components of an NNRTI -based regimen where drug resistance may occur rapid ly to the NNRTI if the virus is not sufficiently sensitive to the NRTIs. Regimens should contain at least two, but preferably three, fully active drugs for durable, potent virologic suppression.

THE USE OF ANTIRETRO VIRAL AGENTS NOT APPROVED FOR USE IN CHILDREN Panel's Recommendations: Some children with HIV need to use antiretrovirals that are not yet approved for their age range because many of the recently approved, more convenient, and potent agents are approved for adults before pharmacokinetic, safet y, and efficacy data are available in children ( AII). This \"off-label\" use of antiretrovirals can be risky because dosing recommendations have not yet been made and often cannot be inferred from a simple calculation using the adult dose and the child's wei ght (AII). Off-label use of antiretrovirals should always be done in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist, who may have access to unpublished data about safety and pharmacokinetics of these agents ( AI*). Whenever possible, use of antiretrovirals t hat are not yet FDA approved for children should be done in the context of clinical trials that can generate the data needed for pediatric approval ( AIII). It has long been practice for physicians, especially pediatricians, to prescribe medications in \"o ff-label\" situations, meaning for indications or populations that do not fall within the FDA's official indication [1]. The relatively small market for pediatric antiretroviral drugs and few children available for clinical trials have delayed or prevented studies to obtain an FDA pediatric label indication for some antiretroviral drugs at the same time they are approved in adults. Pediatric HIV specialists may need to prescribe these agents because of August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 136 high levels of resistance seen in heavily treated children and adolescents and improvements in tolerability and ease of adherence with newer agents with less frequent dosing. One distinct advantage of some of the newer medications is improved tolerability. Examples incl ude a reduction in the number or severity of side effects with newer PIs and the ability to create simpler regimens using fixed-dose combination tablets or once-daily preparations. The incentive to use these drugs in such instances is that these regimens will lead to improved adherence and thus better long- term outcomes. Another major factor leading to the off-label use of antiretrovirals has been the development of new drugs belonging to novel classes of agents effective against resistant virus. In the United States, many older perinatally infected children have extensive drug resistance resulting from incomplete viral suppression due to treatment with multiple nonsuppressive regimens. Cross resistance between fully approved antiretrovirals within a class complicates finding an array of agents likely to fully suppress the virus. In an effort to find a regimen likely to achieve complete virologic suppression in an individual patient, providers must find at least two and preferably three drugs with demonstrat ed activity against the patient's virus. Success is almost impossible in heavily treatment experienced children using only drugs with approved pediatric label indications; thus providers may use drugs not yet approved for children in order to provide optim al virologic response. The recent FDA approvals for adults of raltegravir and maraviroc (the first integrase inhibitor and CCR5 inhibitor, respectively) have provided new options for therapy to achieve virologic suppression in patients experiencing treatment failure with extensive antiretroviral resistance. However, the use of agents not yet approved for pediatric use causes some difficulties, and one of the major issues is lack of data on appropriate dosing in children. Agents are approved for adult use prior to pediatric use because safety and pharmacokinetic studies in children have not yet been completed. Sometimes these studies are ongoing and some data are available, but other times these studies have not yet begun. It is essential for providers prescribing agents for off- label use to consult with pediatric HIV experts to avail themselves of the latest information from ongoing studies. The possibility of age-related side effects is another concern when initiating off- label antiretroviral use. To date no antiretroviral has been found to have adverse effects that uniquely preclude use in children, but until an agent has been tested in children it cannot be considered to be free of such an effect. Additionally, adverse effects noted in adults may be of more substantial concern in the growing and developing child. Even more difficult than the potential for adverse effects has been the difficulty of dosing of antiretrovirals in pediatric patients. As absorption, hepatic metabolism and excretion change with age, so will drug levels change in children [2]. The difficulty in dosing children as they increase in weight is exacerbated by changing pharmacokinetics. The direct extrapolation of the adult dose to a pediatric dose, based either on body weight or body surface area, has been shown in clinical trials of several antiretroviral agents to underestimate the appropriate pediatric dose [3]. In summary, the use of antiretroviral agents without a pediatric indication is an absolute necessity for the treatment of some children with HIV, but it must be done with care. It is essential that the provider consult with a pediatric HIV specialist to identify any pa rticular concerns with each agent, to access any available data from clinical trials or other limited off -label pediatric use, and to investigate the availability of suitable clinical trials.

THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING IN M ANAGEMENT OF TREATME NT FAILURE Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is the use of plasma drug concentration measurements as part of a strategy to optimize drug dosing to minimize toxicity and maximize treatment benefit. TDM can be considered for use in antiretroviral treatment because [1]: There is high interpatient variability in antiretroviral exposure (plasma drug concentrations) using standard recommended doses; Low drug exposure can lead to suboptimal virologic response to therapy; and High plasma concentrations can be associated with increased risk of drug toxicity. Developmental pharmacokinetic differences contribute to greater variability and a greater frequency of suboptimal antiretroviral exposure in pediatric patients than in adults [2]. Pediatric dosing is designed to mimic adult exposure and rarely reflects the maximum tolerated antiretroviral drug dose. Even when using dose recommendations from published pediatric guidel ines, children frequently receive inadequate antiretroviral doses [3]. There are two main situations in which TDM might be useful in a child who is failing therapy. First, TDM can be used to rule out subtherapeutic drug levels as a cause of failure. Such inadequate drug levels could result from malabsorption, drug interactions, poor adherence, or increased drug metabolism or clearance. Second, drug levels can be used to optimize the dose of a drug when changing to a new regimen in a patient whose virus has a reduced susceptibility to that drug. For TDM to be useful there needs to be a clearly defined relationship between antiretroviral concentrations and anti-HIV effects [4-6]. This association is strongest with PI and NNRTI drugs [7], but maintaining a dequate NRTI serum concentrations has also been shown to be important for maximal anti- HIV activity [8]. The exposure-toxicity response relationship is less well defined for NRTI drugs but has been determined for some agents [6]. Concentration -response relationships have been established with minimum plasma concentrations (Cmin or C trough) or area under the curve (AUC), but the optimal measure is not defined for all antiretroviral drugs [9]. Table 15 presents recommendat ions for the minimum target trough concentrations of PIs and NNRTIs in patients with wild -type virus. In antiretroviral -experienced patients, the choice of minimum target trough concentration should be based on results of resistance testing [10-12]. Although it is intrinsically difficult to demonstrate benefit of TDM using double-blind studies, limited data suggest targeted concentrations can be achieved with TDM, clinical responses can be improved with increased or modified doses, and TDM information can be helpful in decision making [7, 13- 17]. The clinician should consult with a pediatric HIV specialist or pharmacologist in making these decisions. TDM is not recommended for routine use but may be considered in the following circumstances in which it is potentially useful: Patients in whom clinical response is different from that expected; August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 138 Treatment -experienced patients infected with virus with reduced drug susceptibility, where a comparison of the drug susceptibility of the virus and the achieved drug concentrations may be useful; Patients with potential drug administration difficulties, including suboptimal dietary intake, malabsorption, incorrect dose, caregiver measuring e rrors, or adherence concerns; and Patients who experience drug or food interactions, including alteration of drug formulations by crushing or mixing with various foods and liquids. Current limitations for pediatric antiretroviral TDM include: Prolonged time for laboratory processing in the face of potentially diminishing benefit the longer the patient is on inadequate therapy; Difficulties in coordinating sample collections at appropriate times make determination of true C min or AUC difficult; High intrapa tient variability from single drug concentration measurements may complicate interpretation of results [18-19]; Single trough measurements within the target range do not guarantee consistent adequacy of drug exposure or therapeutic success; Inadequate information on safety and effectiveness of dose adjustment strategies in children and adolescents; Limited availability of certified laboratories capable of assaying drug concentrations; and Lack of third party reimbur sement of costs associated with TDM.

DISCONTINUATION OR INTERRUPTION OF THERA PY General Discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy may be indicated in some situations, including serious treatment-related toxicity, acute illnesses or planned surgeries that preclude oral intake, lack of available medication, or patient or parent request. Although these events are usually unplanned, purposeful discontinuation of therapy has been widely used in the adult population to reduce toxicity, costs, and drug- related failure associated with antiretroviral therapy. At this time, there are minimal data in infants, children, and adolescents about planned structured treatment interruptions (STI). Thus, STI should not be attempted in children or adults outside of a clinical trial setting. The discussion below provides general guidance for the interruption of antiretroviral therapy and the risks and benefits in specific situations. Short -Term Therapy Interruption In the pediatric patient, short- term therapy interruptions are most often necessitated by acute illnesses that limit oral intake. These illnesses are often infectious diseases that result in vomiting and/or diarrhea. The clinician has no choice but to stop all therapy at the same time. Planned short- term interruption of therapy may also be required in the event of surgery or sedation for procedures, but when possible, the patient should be allowed to continue regular antiretroviral therapy with minimal fluid intake. If the period of restricted oral intake wil l be prolonged, then all therapy should be stopped at the same time if the medications have similar half-lives. In the case of serious or life -threatening antiretroviral therapy toxicity, all drugs should be stopped immediately. When a short- term therapy interruption is indicated, all antiretroviral therapy should be stopped at the same time in most cases. This can be problematic with agents with a long half-life. Stopping agents with different half-lives at the same time can result in functional monotherapy with the drug with the longest half- life. This is particularly concerning in the case of the NNRTIs efavirenz and nevirapine. Efavirenz and nevirapine have very long half-lives and can be detected for 21 days or longer after discontinuation [1-4]. As the other drugs with shorter half- lives are cleared, only nevirapine or efavirenz may persist, resulting in functional monotherapy, which can increase the risk of selection of NNRTI- resistant mutations. In addition, it is known that certain genetic polymorphisms may result in a slower rate of drug clearance. These polymorphisms may be more common among some ethnic groups, such as in African Americans and Hispanics [3-4]. To prevent this functional monotherapy, some experts recommend stopping the NNRTI first and continuing the other antiretroviral drugs (i.e., NRTI backbone or PI) for a period of time [2]. However, the optimal interval between stopping an NNRTI and the other antiretroviral drugs is not known. Detectable levels of NNRTIs may be present from less than 1 week to greater than 3 weeks after discontinuation [4]. An alternative is to substitute a PI for up to 4 weeks prior to the interruption of all drugs; however, there are no data to support this practice. Studies are ongoing in adults to help determine an effective August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 141 strategy. There is no information in children and, because the pharmacokinetics of these agents are different in children, the recommendations for adults may not be applicable [5-7]. An additional consideration is reintroduction of nevirapine. Currently, a 2- week, half -dose escalation is recommended in patients who are started on nevirapine. Dose escalation is necessary because nevirapine induces its own metabolism by inducing CYP3A4 metabolic liver enzymes; thus, initial administration of the full therapeutic dose will result in elevated drug levels until metabolic enzyme induction has occurred. Lower rates of rash toxicity have been observed with the 2- week dose escalation [5]. In cases where nevirapine has been discontinued for more than 2 weeks, it is recommended that another 2-week dose escalation be used when the drug is reintroduced. Long-Term Structured Treatment Interruptions Long-term STIs have been proposed to reduce toxicities and costs associated with long- term antiretroviral therapy. STIs have also been proposed in patients who have limited treatment options to allow a return to their wild-type virus, which may be more susceptible to treatment. At this time, there is only minimal information about STI in children. In 1 study, children with controlled viral load (HIV RNA <400 copies/mL for > 12 months) were subjected to increasing intervals of treatment interruption. Of 14 children studied, 4 maintained undetectable viral loads with interruptions of up to 27 days. It has been hypothesized that enhanced HIV- specific immune responses may play a role in the viral suppression [8]. However, new drug- resistance mutations were detected in 3 of 14 children in the STI study. Recently, the results of two large, randomized clinical trials in adults have demonstrated inferior responses when CD4 cell count was used as an indication to stop and start therapy. The Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy stopped antiretroviral therapy when the CD4 cell count was >3 50 cells/mm 3 and reintroduced therapy when the count was <250 cells/mm3. In comparison to the group receiving continuous antiretroviral therapy, the STI group had an increased risk of disease progression and death [9]. Similarly, in the Trivican trials, which used the same CD4 cell count triggers to stop and restart therapy, STI was shown to be inferior [10]. However, in studies in adults using a CD4 count <350 cells/mm3 as a trigger to restart therapy, no significant difference in serious disease progression or death was seen [11-12]. A large cohort study in Italy showed an increased risk of disease progression after interruption of first -line therapy [13]. Several additional trials are currently ongoing in adults. Many questions remain about STI in children and adolescents. In the United States and other developed countries, the majority of HIV- infected children began antiretroviral therapy during infancy [14-15]. Many of these children have had controlled viral replication for many years and are growing and developing normally. It is unclear if these children could discontinue therapy at some point and reinitiate based on CD4 cell decline. Although this has been speculated as plausible, there are no data to support this strategy and it should not be attempted outside of a clinical trial setting. An additional scenario that is often raised is the patient who has limited treatment options and who, despite aggressive antiretroviral therapy, cannot reach an undetectable viral load. In these cases, interruption of therapy is generally not recommended because, despite detectable viral replication, immunologic benefit has been well documented [16-19]. With either unplanned or STI therapy, the clinician should discuss the reasons and plans with the parent or guardian and, if applicable, the patient prior to proceeding. The parent and child should be made aware of the possibility of viral rebound resulting in a worsening of clinical symptoms, the risk of developing drug resistance, and the need for protection against opportunistic pathogens. The timelines and criteria for restarting therapy should be clear. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 142 References 1.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 143 Antiretroviral Drug -Resistance Testing (Updated August 16, 2010) Panel's Recommendations: Antiretroviral drug -resistance testing is recommended prior to initiation of therapy in all treatment- na\u00efve children ( AII). Antiretroviral drug -resistance testing is recommended prior to changing therapy for treatment failure (AI*). Resistance testing in the setting of virological failure should be obtained while the patient is still on the failing regimen or within 4 weeks of discontinuing the regimen ( AII*). The absence of detectable resistance to a drug does not ensure that use of the drug will be successful, especially if the antiretroviral agent shares cross resistance with drugs previously used. In addition, current resistance assays are not sensitive enough to fully exclude the presence of resistant virus. Thus, previously used antiretroviral agents and previous resistance tests should be reviewed whe n making decisions regarding the choice of new agents for patients with virologic failure ( AII). Viral coreceptor (tropism) assays should be used whenever the use of CCR5 antagonist is being considered ( AI*). Tropism assays should also be considered for patients who demonstrate virologic failure while receiving therapy that contains a CCR5 antagonist ( AI*). Consultation with a specialist in pediatric HIV infection is recommended for interpretation of resistance assays when considering starting or changing an antiretroviral regimen in a pediatric patient ( AI*). OVERVIEW OF HIV DRUG -RESISTANCE AND RESISTANCE ASSAYS HIV replication is a continuous process in most untreated patients, leading to the daily production of billions of viral particles. The goal of antiretroviral therapy is to suppress HIV replication as rapidly and fully as possible, indicated by a reduction in plasma HIV RNA to below the limit of detection of the most sensitive assays available (<50-70 copies/mL). Unfortunately, mutations in HIV RNA readily arise during viral replication because HIV reverse transcriptase is a highly error -prone enzyme. Consequently, ongoing replication in the presence of antiretroviral drugs readily and progressively selects for strains of HIV with mutations that confer drug resistance. Drug -resistance detection methods vary depending on the class of antiretroviral agents. Both genotypic assays and phenotypic assays are used to detect the presence of virus that is resistant to inhibitors of the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase, or protease (PR). Viral coreceptor (tropism) assays, a form of phenotypic assay, have been successfully employed in detecting the presence of virus with tropism that will (R5 tropism) or will not (X4 or mixed tropism) respond to CC R5 antagonists. Clinical experience with testing for viral resistance to other agents is more limited, but genetic mutations associated with resistance to integrase strand transfer inhibitors have been identified, and a commercial phenotypic assay is avail able for evaluation of resistance to the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (T20). Experience is also limited with the use of commercially available genotypic and phenotypic assays in the evaluation of drug resistance in patients infected with non-B subtypes of HIV [1]. Genotypic Assays to RT, PR, and integrase strand transfer inhibitors are based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and analysis of the RT, PR, and integrase c oding sequences present in HIV RNA extracted from plasma. Genotypic assays can detect resistance- associated mutations in plasma samples containing approximately 1,000 copies/mL or more of HIV RNA, and results are generally available within 1- 2 weeks of sam ple collection [2]. Interpretation of test results requires knowledge of the mutations selected by different antiretroviral drugs and of the potential for cross resistance to other drugs conferred by certain August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 144 mutatio ns. For some drugs, there is a low genetic barrier to the development of resistance, and a single nucleotide mutation is enough to confer high- level resistance sufficient to remove any clinical utility. This is exemplified by resistance to nevirapine resul ting from mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase. Other mutations lead to drug resistance but simultaneously impair HIV replication. Clinically useful activity of the antiretroviral agent may therefore remain, as demonstrated by evidence of continued c linical benefit from lamivudine in individuals with evidence of the high- level resistance engendered by the M184V reverse transcriptase mutation [3]. Other mutations have little direct effect on resistance but arise during HIV evolution to high- level resistance or improve the replication of virus -bearing mutations that confer high- level resistance to an antiretroviral agent. The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA), the Los Alamos HIV Drug Resistance Database, a nd the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database maintain lists of significant resistance -associated mutations relevant to currently available antiretroviral drugs (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations , http://hiv -web.lanl.gov or http://hivdb.stanford.edu ). A variety of online tools that take into account the ability of some mutations selected by one drug to cause partial or full cross resistance with other drugs are now available to assist the provider in interpreting genotypic test results . Although the response to antiretroviral therapy in children and adolescents is not always predicted by the re sults of genotypic resistance assays, clinical trials in adults have demonstrated the benefit of resistance testing combined with consultation with specialists in HIV drug resistance in improving virologic outcomes [2, 4-10]. Given the potential complexity of interpretation of genotypic resistance, it is recommended that clinicians consult with a specialist in pediatric HIV infection for assistance in the interpretation of genotypic results and design of an optimal new regimen. Phenotypic Assays Phenotypic resistance assays provide a more direct assessment of the impact of mutations acquired by mixture of virus strains present in an individual. As they are most often performed, phenotypic assays involve protease, other HIV gene sequences from patient plasma and insertion of those amplified patient sequences into the backbone of a laboratory strain of HIV. Replication of this recombinant virus at different drug concentrations is monitored by expression of a reporter gene and is compared with replication of a reference HIV strain. The drug concentration that inhibits viral replication by 50% (i.e., the median inhibitory concentration, or IC50) is calculated, and the ratio of the IC50 of test and reference viruses is reported as the fold increase in IC50 (i.e., fold resistance change). Automated, recombinant phenotypic assays are commercially available with results available in 2 -3 weeks but are more costly tha n genotypic assays. In addition, interpretation of phenotypic assay results is sometimes complicated by the paucity of information about outcomes with specific levels of resistance. Analytic techniques have also been developed to use the genotype to predict the likelihood of a drug- resistant phenotype. This bioinformatic approach, currently applicable for reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitor resistance only, matches the pattern of mutations obtained from the patient sample with a large database of samples for which both genotype and phenotype are known. Thus, the sample is assigned a predicted phenotype susceptibility (or \"virtual phenotype\") based on the data from specimens matching the patient's genotype. The primary limitation of this approach is that predictive power depends upon the number of matched phenotypic and genotypic assays, which may be limited for newer drugs. Tropism (Viral Coreceptor Use) Assays HIV enters cells by a complex multistep process that involves sequential interactions b etween the HIV envelope protein molecules and the CD4 receptor, then with either the CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor molecules, culminating in the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Viruses in the majority of untreated individuals, including infants and children infected by mother- to-child transmission of HIV, are initially CCR5 tropic. However, a shift in coreceptor tropism often occurs over time, from CCR5 usage to either CXCR4 or with extensive drug resistance are more likely to harbor detectable X4 - or D/M -tropic virus than untreated patients with comparable CD4 T -cell counts [11]. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 145 Resistance to CCR5 antagonists is currently detected using the specialized phenotypic assay methods Phenoscript (VIRalliance, Paris, France) and Trofile (Monogram Biosciences, Inc). These assays involve the generation of recombinant viruses bearing patient-derived envelope proteins (gp120 and gp41). The relative capacity of these pseudoviruses to infect cells bearing the cell surface proteins CCR5 or CXCR4 is quantified based on the expression of a reporter gene. The Trofile assay takes about 2 weeks to perform and requires a plasma viral load 1,000 copies/mL. The initial version of the Trofile assay used during the clinical trials that led to the licensure of maraviroc was able to detect X4 -tropic virus with 100% sensitivity when present at a frequency of 10% of the plasma virus population but only 83% sensitivity when the variant was present at a frequency of 5%. In initial clinical trials of CCR5 antagonist drugs, this sensitivity threshold was not always sufficient to exclude the presence of clinically meaningful levels of X4 - or D/M -tropic virus in patients initiating a CCR5 inhibitor-based regimen. A newer version of the Trofile assay with improved sensitivity able to detect X4 - or D/M -tropic virus representing as little as 0.3% of the plasma virus is now available [12-13]. Genotypic assays that may also prove useful in detection of X4 or D/M tropism are also under development. The detection of any usage of CXCR4 is a contraindication to the use of the CCR5 antagonists as part of a therapeutic regimen. Coreceptor use assays should be performed prior to the use of a CCR5 inhibitor and may be considered in patients exhibiting virologic failure on a CCR5 inhibitor such as maraviroc. Use of Resistance Assays in Determining Initial Treatment Mother-to-child transmission and horizontal transmission of drug- resistant HIV strains have been well documented and are associated with suboptimal virologic response to initial antiretroviral therapy [14-18]. Drug -resistant variants of HIV may persist for months after birth in infected infants [19] and impair the response to antiretroviral therapy [20]. Consequently, antiretroviral drug- resist ance testing is recommended prior to initiation of therapy in all treatment -na\u00efve children. Use of Resistance Assays in the Event of Virologic Failure Several studies [2, 4 -10] have been performed in adults indicating that early virologic responses to salvage regimens were improved when results of resistance testing were available to guide changes in therapy, compared with responses observed when changes in therapy were guided only by clinical judgment. Although not yet confirmed in children [21], resistance testing appears to be a useful tool in selecting active drugs when changing antiretroviral regimens in cases of virologic failure. Resistance testing also can help guide treatment decisions for patients with suboptimal viral load reduction because virologic failure in the setting of combination antiretroviral therapy may be associated with resistance to only one component of the regimen [1]. Poor adherence should be suspected when no evidence of resistance to a failing regimen is identified. Limitations of Current Resistance and Tropism Assays Limitations of the genotypic, phenotypic, and phenotype- prediction assay approaches inclu de lack of uniform quality assurance testing and high cost. In addition, drug- resistant viruses that constitute <10% -20% of the circulating virus population may not be detected by any of the currently available assays. Consequently, a review of the past us e of antiretroviral agents is important in making decisions regarding the choice of new agents for patients with virologic failure. Although drug resistance may be detected in infants, children, and adults who are not receiving therapy at the time of the assay, loss of detectable resistance and reversion to predominantly wild-type virus often occur in the first 4 -6 weeks after antiretroviral drugs are stopped [22-24]. As a result, resistance testing is of greatest value when performed before or within 4 weeks after drugs are discontinued. The absence of detectable resistance to a drug at the time of testing does not ensure that future use of the drug will be successful [25], especially if the agent shares cross resistance with drugs previously used. It may be prudent to repeat resistance testing if an incomplete virological response to a new treatment regimen is observed in an individual with prior treatment failure(s) (see Antiretroviral Treatment Failure in Infants, Children, and Adolescents ).

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 148 Conclusion The care of HIV -infected children is complex and evolving rapidly as results of new research are reported and new antiretroviral drugs and newer classes of drugs are approved. Clinical trials to define appropriate drug dosing and toxicity in children ranging in age from infancy to adolescence are critical as new drugs become available. As additional antiretroviral drugs become approved and optimal use of these drugs in children becomes better understood, the Panel will modify these guidelines. It should be noted that guidelines are only a starting point for medical decision making and are not meant to supersede the judgment of clinicians experienced in the care of HIV -infected children. Because of the complexity of caring for HIV-infected children, health care providers with limited experience in the care of these patients should consult with a pediatric HIV specialist. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious D isease Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics jointly developed and published guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-exposed and - infected children; these guidelines are available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov [1]. Similar guidelines for adults are also available at the same Web site [2]. References 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Several observational cohort studies suggest increased risk of myocardial infarction in adults with recent or current use of ABC; however, other studies have not substantiated this finding, and there are no data in children. Special Instructions Can be given without regard to food. Caution patients and parents about the risk of serious hypersensitivity reaction that can be fatal. Do not rechallenge. Test patients for the HLA -B*5701 allele prior to starting therapy to predict risk of hypersensitivity; patients with the HLA -B*5701 allele should not be given ABC. Patients with no prior HLA-B+5701 testing who are tolerating ABC do not need to be tested. Metabolism Metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyl transferase; renal excretion of metabolites 82%. ABC dosage hepatic insufficiency.

Dosing Recommendati ons for Combination Formulations Trizivir Adolescent ( 40 kg)/Adult dose : One tablet twice daily Epzicom Adolescent (>16 years)/Adult : One tablet once daily Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Abacavir does not inhibit, nor is it metabolized by, hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. Thus, it should not cause changes in clearance of agents metabolized through these pathways, such as PIs an d NNRTIs. Abacavir is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyltransferase. Alcohol increases abacavir levels by 41%. Major Toxicities: More common: Nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, diarrhea, rash, and anorexia. Less common (more severe): Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions observed in approximately 5% of adults and children (rate varies by race/ethnicity) receiving abacavir. Hypersensitivity to abacavir is a multi -organ clinical syndrome usually characterized by rash or by s igns or symptoms in two or more of the following groups: (1) fever; (2) August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 152 constitutional, including malaise, fatigue, or achiness; (3) gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain; or (4) respiratory, including dyspnea, cough, or pharnygitis. Laboratory and imaging abnormalities include elevated liver function tests, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, lymphopenia, and pulmonary infiltrates. This reaction generally occurs in the first 6 weeks of therapy and has occurred after a single dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, abacavir should be stopped and not restarted because hypotension and death have occurred upon rechallenge. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Pancreatitis may occur. Rare: Increased liver enzymes, elevated blood glucose, elevated triglycerides, and possible increased risk of myocardial infarction (in observational studies in adults). Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database of fers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/ABC.html ). Pediatric Experience: Abacavir has been studied in HIV-infected children both separately and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs [1-11]. In the PENTA -5 trial, 130 HIV- infected antiretroviral -na\u00efve children were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 different nucleoside analogue regimens: zidovudine/lamivudine, abacavir/zidovudine, and 2 abacavir -containing regimens were associated with greater mean viral load decreases after 48 weeks of therapy than the zidovudine/lamivudine regimen ( -1.71, respectively). In this study, 4 children (3%) stopped abacavir due to a possibl e hypersensitivity reaction. After 5 year s of follow -up in the PENTA-5 study, children who were treated with abacavir/lamivudine were significantly more likely to have HIV RNA levels <50 copies/mL than children treated with zidovudine/lamivudine or abacavir/ zidovudine (63% vs. 25 % or 32%, p = 0.003) and had significantly better improvement in height for age and weight for age [5]. Pharmacokinetic studies of abacavir in children <12 years of age have demonstrated that children have more rapid clearance than adults and that pediatric doses approximately twice the directly scaled adult dose are necessary to achiev e similar systemic exposure [4, 6] . Adolescents and young adults (ages 13 to 25) have clearance that is slower than younger children but still more rapid than that found in adults [12]. The PENTA -13 trial studied once- daily versus twice -daily dosing of abacavir in combination with lamivudine in 24 children age 2-13 years, with undetectable or low, stable virus load at the time of starting once-daily therapy, showing equivale nt AUC 0-24 for both drugs and improved acceptability in the once-daily dosing arm [1, 8] . However, trough concentrations were lower for both abacavir and lamivudine in younger children (ages 2 -6 years) receiving the once- daily regimen [1]. More long- term clinical trials with viral efficacy endpoints are needed to confirm that once-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine can be effectively used in children. In pediatric populations, triple- NRTI -only combinations should be used only in special circumstances. In 1 study of 205 treatment -experienced children ranging in age from 0.7 to 13 years, only 10% of 102 children receiving abacavir/ zidovudine/lamivudine had HIV RNA concentrations <400 copies/mL after 48 weeks of therapy [11]. Several studies of abacavir as part of a PI -sparing 3-drug NRTI regimen (zidovudine, lamivudine, and abacavir) have been done in adults and show decreased antiretroviral potency of the triple- NRTI J , et al.

Shake oral solution well. Keep refrigerated; admixture is stable for 30 days. When coadministered, ddI delayed- release capsule formulation and TDF may be taken under fasted condi tions or with a light meal. Metabolism Renal excretion 50%. Dosing of ddI in patients with renal insufficiency: Decreased dosage should be used in patients with impaired renal function. Consult manufacturer's prescribing information for adjustment of dosage in accordance with creatinine clearance. Dosing Recommendations for Coadministration with Other Antiretroviral Drugs ddI in combination with tenofovir (TDF) Pediatric/Adolescent dose : No data on combination in children or adolescents <18 years of age. Adult dose : <60 kg (limited data in adults): 200 mg once daily >60 kg: 250 mg once daily August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 155 Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Absorption: The presence of antacids in the didanosine suspension has the potential to decrease the absorption of a number of medications if given at the same time. Many of these interactions can be avoided by t he appropriate timing of doses. Mechanism unknown: Didanosine serum concentrations are increased when coadministered with tenofovir. Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function could decrease clearance. Enhanced toxicity: Didanosine mitochondrial toxicity is enhanced by ribavirin. Overlapping toxicities: There is increased risk of pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy with some NRTIs (e.g., stavudine). Combination of stavudine and didanosine is not recommended (unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks) because of overlapping toxicities and reports of serious, even fatal, cases of lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis with or without pancreatitis in pregnant women. Major Toxicities: More common: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Less common (more severe): Peripheral neuropathy (dose related), electrolyte abnormalities, and hyperuricemia. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Pancreatitis (dose related, less common in children than adults, more common in adults when used in combination with tenofovir), increased liver enzymes, and retinal depigmentation have been reported. The combination of stavudine with didanosine may result in enhanced toxicity (increased risk of fatal and nonfatal cases of lactic acidosis or pancreatitis); this combination should not be used unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk. Rare: Noncirrhotic portal hypertension, with increased transaminases, increased alkaline phos phatase, and thrombocytopenia, has been associated with long-term didanosine use in adults [1]. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/ddI.html ). Pediatric Experience: Didanosine has been studied in HIV-infected children as monotherapy and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs [2-24]. Recommended didanosine doses in children have traditionally been 90-150 mg per meter2 body surface area per dose twice daily. Doses higher than 180 mg per meter2 body surface area twice daily are associated with increased toxicit y [3]. In a simulation based on didanosine concentration data from 16 children, a dose of 90 mg per meter2 body surface area twice daily was predicted to result in adequate drug exposure in only 57% of pediatric patients, compared with a predicted 88% of patients at a dose of 120 mg per meter 2 body surface area [6]. This dose of 120 mg per meter2 body surface area per dose twice daily has therefore become the \"standard\" dose of didanosine for older infants and children. Data from multiple pediatric studies of didanosine alone or in combination with other drugs, including a study of long- term didanosine use (median duration of almost 2 years), show that didanosine appears safe and is associated with clinical improvement, increase in CD4 count, and decrease in viral load [5, 7 -8, 11, 13, 15, 19] . Three major areas of controversy remain in the use of didanosine in the treatment of children with HIV infection: (1) the appropriate dose to use in infants 2 weeks to 4 months of age, (2) the need to dose didanosine on an empty stomach, and (3) the potential use of enteric -coated didanosine (Videx EC) once daily in children. The \"usual pediatric dose\" of 120 mg per meter 2 body surface area per dose twice daily was used successfully in combination therapy in infants 2 to 16 months of age without significant toxicity [18]. Currently, the FDA recommends 100 mg per meter2 body surface area per dose twice daily for infants from 2 weeks to 8 months of age, increasing to 120 mg per meter2 body surface area per dose twice daily at age 8 months. However, two small studies suggest that higher AUCs are seen in infants <6 weeks of age and that a dose of 100 mg per meter 2 body surface area per day (either as 50 mg per meter2 body surface area per dose twice daily or 100 mg per meter2 body surface area once daily) achieves AUCs consistent with those of higher doses in older children [9, 12] . Therefore, because of pharmacokinetic differences in younger infants (2 weeks to 4 months) compared with older children, a dose of 50 mg per meter2 of body surface area twice daily may be more appropriate in younger infants. Although the prescribing information recommends taking didanosine on an empty stomach, this is impractical for infants who must be fed frequently and may decrease medication compliance by increasing regimen complexity. A comparison of didanosine given with or without food in children found that systemic exposure was similar, but with slower and more prolonged absorption [20]. To improve compliance, some practitioners recommend administration without regard to timing of August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 156 meals for young children. However, there are inadequate data to allow a strong recommendation at this time, and it is preferred that didanosine be administered under fasting conditions when possible. Enteric -coated didanosine (Videx EC) administered as a single dose of 240 mg per meter2 body surface area once daily has been shown to have similar plasma AUC (although lower peak plasma concentrations) compared with the equivalent dose of buffered didanosine [9]. The r esultant intracellular (active) drug concentrations are unknown. In 24 children with HIV infection, didanosine at a dose of 180 mg per meter2 body surface area once daily was compared with 90 mg per meter2 body surface area twice daily, and the AUC was act ually higher in the once-daily group than in the twice-daily group [2]. In fact, in 53 children with advanced symptomatic HIV infection, once- versus twice -daily didanosine at a dose of 270 mg per meter2 body surface area per day showed no difference in surrogate marker or clinical endpoints, except that weight gain was poorer in the children given once- daily therapy [14]. A European trial of once-daily combination therapy in 36 children 3-11 years of age that included didanosine at a dose of 200-240 mg per meter2 demonstrated safety and eff icacy with 96 weeks of follow-up data [25]. Enteric-coated didanosine is currently approved for use in children ages 6 to 18 years who are able to swallow capsules whole and have a body weight of at least 20 kg. In a study in the United States, long-term virologic suppression with a once daily regimen of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and didanosine (enteric -coated beadlet capsules) was reported in 37 treatment -na\u00efve children, 3 -21 years of age, participating in PACTG 1021 [26]. The didanosine dose used in that study was 240 mg/ meter2/dose once daily, and pharmacokinetic analysis showed no dose changes were needed to reach PK targets [26]. Eighty -five percent of subjects were able to achieve HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and 72% maintained HIV RNA suppression to <50 copies/mL through 96 weeks of therapy. References 1.

Because Atripla contains EFV, administer the drug on an empty stomach. Oral solution can be kept at room temperatures up to 77oF (25oC) if used within 3 months; refrigerate for longer term storage. Screen patients for hepatit is B virus prior to use of FTC. Severe acute exacerbation of hepatitis can occur when FTC is discontinued; monitor hepatic function for several months after therapy with FTC is stopped. Dosing Recommendations for Combination Formulations Truvada Adult d ose: 1 tablet once daily Atripla Adult dose : 1 tablet once daily Metabolism Limited metabolism: No CYP450 interactions. Renal excretion 86%: Competition with other compounds that undergo renal elimination. Decrease dosage in patients with impaired renal function. Consult manufacturer's prescribing information. Do not use Atripla (fixed -dose combination) in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min or in patients requiring dialysis. Do not use Truvada (fixed-dose combination) in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min or in patients requiring dialysis. Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Other NRTIs: Do not us e in combination with lamivudine because of the similar resistance profiles and no additive benefit. Renal elimination: Competition with other compounds that undergo renal elimination (possible competition for renal tubular secretion). Drugs that decrease renal function could decrease clearance. Major Toxicities: More common : Headache, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, rash, and hyperpigmentation/skin discoloration (possibly more common in children). Less common (more severe): Neutropenia. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred in HIV/HBV -coinfected patients emtricitabine- containing to Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/FTC.html ). Pediatric Experience: A single -dose pharmacokinetic study of emtricitabine liquid solution and capsules was performed in 25 HIV-infected children 2 -17 years of age [1]. Emtricitabine was found to be well absorbed following oral administration, with a August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 159 mean elimination half -life of 11 hours (range 9.7 to 11.6 hours). Plasma concentrations in children receiving the 6 mg/kg emtricitabine once -daily dose were approximately equivalent to those in adults receiving the standard 200-mg dose. Based on this dose-finding study, emtricitabine was given at a dose of 6 mg/kg once daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs [2-3]. In a pediatric Phase II study, 71 antiretroviral- na\u00efve children received emtricitabine plus stavudine and lopinavir/ritonavir while 45 treatment- experienced children were maintained on their initial regimens, but changed from lamivudine to emtricitabine [3]. Pharmacokinetic results were similar to the preceding dose-finding study [1]. Follow-up data extending to Week 96 indicated that 89% of the antiretroviral-na\u00efve and 76% of the antiretroviral- experienced children maintained suppression of plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL (74% and 62%, respectively, at <50 copies/mL). Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were found in 2.9% of the study population, and serious adverse events possibly related to emtricitabine were found to be 1.2% after 164 weeks of follow-up. Emtricitabine was studied in PACTG P1021 at a dose of 6 mg/kg (maximum 240 mg/day as liquid or 200 mg/day as capsules) in combination with didanosine and efavirenz, all given once daily, in 37 antiretroviral- na\u00efve HIV -infected children age 3 months to 21 years [2]. This regi men was well tolerated, and emtricitabine and didanosine concentrations met the desired target study concentrations. Eighty-five percent of subjects achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and 72% maintained HIV RNA suppression to <50 copies/mL through 96 weeks of therapy. The median CD4 count rose by 329 cells/mm3 at week 96. A study in South Africa evaluated the pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine in 20 HIV-exposed infants age <3 months, given as 3 mg/kg once daily for two 4- day courses, separated by an interval o f 2 weeks [4]. Emtricitabine exposure (AUC) in neonates receiving 3 mg/kg emtricitabine once daily was in the range of pediatric patients age >3 months receiving the recommended dose of 6 mg/kg once daily and adults receiving the once-daily recommended 200 mg emtricitabine dose (AUC approximately 10 hr*ug/mL). Emtricitabine AUC decreased with increasing age over the first 3 months of life, correlating with an increase in total body clearance of the drug. No safety issues were identified in this short pharmacokinetics study; however, extensive safety data are lacking in this age group. References 1. Wang LH, Wiznia AA, Rathore MH, et al.

The formulation and dosing of 3TC in Epivir HBV are not appropriate for patients coinfected with HIV and HBV. If Epivir HBV used in HIV -infected patients, the higher dosage indicated for HIV therapy should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. The Epivir HBV tablet could be used in a child who requires a 1 00-mg 3TC dose for treatment of HIV infection. Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Epivir (Oral Solution and Ta blets) Neonate/infant dose (<4 weeks) for prevention of transmission or treatment : 2 mg/kg twice daily Pediatric dose (>4 weeks) : 4 mg/kg (up to 150 mg) twice daily Pediatric dosing for scored 150- mg tablet (weight 14 kg): Weight (kg) AM dose PM dose Total Daily Dose 14-21 \u00bd tablet (75 mg) \u00bd tablet (75 mg) 150 mg >21-<30 \u00bd tablet (75 mg) 1 tablet (150 mg) 225 mg 30 1 tablet (150 mg) 1 tablet (150 mg) 300 mg Adolescent ( 16 years) /Adult dose : Body weight 50 kg: 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg once daily Body weight <50 kg: 4 mg/kg (up to 150 mg) twice daily Minimal toxicity Special Instructions Can be given without regard to food. Store oral solution at room t emperature. Screen patients for HBV infection before starting therapy; exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported after discontinuation of 3TC. HIV/HBV -coinfected patients should have close clinical and laboratory monitoring for at least several months af ter stopping therapy with 3TC. Metabolism Renal excretion - dosage adjustment required in renal insufficiency.

Other NRTIs: Do not use lamivudine in combination with emtricitabine because of the similar resistance profiles and no additive benefit [1]. Major Toxicities: More common: Headache, (more pancreatitis, Rare: and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (s ee http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/3TC.html ). Pediatric Experience: Lamivudine has been studied in HIV-infected children alone and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, and extensi ve data demonstrate that lamivudine appears safe and is associated with clinical improvement and virologic response [2-17]. Lamivudine is commonly used in HIV-infected children as a component of a dual-NRTI backbone, most often with zidovudine, as part of a combination antiretroviral drug regimen [3-4, 6-7, 11 -12, 14, 16- 17]. In one study, the NRTI background components of lamivudine/abacavir were superior to zidovudine/ lamivu dine or zidovudine/abacavir in long- term virologic efficacy [18]. Because of its safety profile and availability in a liquid formulation, lamivudine has been given to infants during the first 6 weeks of life [11]. Recently, weight band dosing recommendations for lamivudine have been developed [19-20]. Few data are available regarding once-daily administration of lamivudine in children. The pharmacokinetics of once- daily versus twice -daily dosing of lamivudine (8 mg/kg once daily vs. 4 mg/kg twice daily) and abacavir (16 mg/kg once daily vs. 8 mg/kg twice daily) were evaluated in 20 HIV- infected children age 2 -13 years in the PENTA- 13 trial (all were stable on twice - daily therapy prior to randomization). The plasma AUC 0-24 for both drugs was similar with once- and twice -daily administration, but trough concentration s were lower for both abacavir and lamivudine in younger children (age 2-6 years) receiving the once- daily regimen, as were peak (C max) concentrations for lamivudine [2]. No major toxicities were noted, and there was improved acceptability of the once-daily dosing regimen [2]. Lamivudine undergoes intracellular metabolism to its active form, lamivudine adolescents, the mean half-life of intracellular lamivudine triphosphate (17.7 hours) is considerably longer that of unmetabolized lamivudine in plasma (1.5-2 hours). Intracellular concentrations of lamivudine triphosphate have been shown to be equivalent with once- daily and twice -daily dosing in adults and adolescents, supporting a recommendation for once-daily lamivudine dosing in adolescents 16 years and 50 kg [21-22]. More studies are needed to confirm that once-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine can be safely used in children. References 1. Anderson PL, Lamba J, Aquilante CL, et al.

Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Neonate/Infant dose (birth to 13 days) : 0.5 mg/kg twice daily Pediatric dose (14 days and up to 30 kg) : 1 mg/kg twice daily Adolescent ( 30 kg)/Adult dose : 30 to <60 kg: 30 mg twice daily 60 kg: 40 mg twice daily Peripheral neuropathy Fat maldistribution Pancreatitis Lactic acidosis other NRTIs) Hyperlipidemia Rapidly progressive ascending neuromuscular weakness (rare) Special Instructions Can be given w ithout regard to food. Shake oral solution well. Keep refrigerated; will remain stable for 30 days. Metabolism Renal excretion 50%. Decrease dose in renal dysfunction. Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function could decrease stavudine clearance. Other NRTIs: Stavudine should not be administered in combination with zidovudine due to virologic antagonism. Overlapping toxicities : Combination of stavudine and didanosine is not recommended for initial therapy because of overlapping toxicities. Reported toxicities are more often reported in adults and include serious, even fatal, cases of lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis with or without pancreatitis in pregnant women. Major Toxicities: More common: Headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, skin rashes, hyperlipidemia, and and severe hepatomegaly with hepatic steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. The combination of stavudine with didanosine may result in enhanced toxicity (increa sed risk of fatal and nonfatal cases of lactic acidosis or pancreatitis), particularly in adults including pregnant women. This combination should not be used for initial therapy. Rare: Increased liver enzymes, rapidly progressive ascending neuromuscular w eakness. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/d4T.html ). Pediatric Experience: Stavudine has been studied in HIV- infected children as monotherapy and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Data from multiple pediatric studies of stavudine alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals demonstrate that stavudine appears safe and is associated with clinical an d virologic response [1-11] In resource -limited countries, stavudine is frequently a component of initial HAART therapy in children in combination with nevirapine or efavirenz, often as a component of fixed -dose co mbinations not available in the United States. In this setting, reported outcomes from observational studies are good; data show substantial increases in the CD4 count and complete viral suppression in 50%- 80% of treatment- na\u00efve children [12-15]. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 164 Early initiation of triple therapy with stavudine, didanosine, and nelfinavir was evaluated in 20 infants starting therapy at <3 months of age (median age at initiation, 2.5 months) [1]. Therapy was generally well tolerated; 7 infants (35%) experienced 11 events considered possibly related to study drugs, although only 3 such events (rash, diarrhea, and neutropenia) required drug modification. At least 1 episode of Grade 1 hypertriglyceridemia was observed in 19 of 20 (95%) infants; 9 of 12 (75%) infants with cholesterol measured after baseline had at least 1 episode of Grade 1 hypercholesterolemia. However, no infant had Grade 2 or higher triglyceride or cholesterol concentrations. Seventy percent of infants had incomplete viral suppression, which was associated with genotypic resistance mutations in 6 (30%) of these infants. However, only 2 infants developed resistance mutations to stavudine, and 1 of these infants had pre- existing TAMs present at baseline. Stavudine has been used as a component of a second regimen after treatment failure or as a replacement for zidovudine if the patient develops anemia. In a Phase II comparison study of stavudine and zidovudine, they were largely co mparable in terms of safety and tolerability, although neutropenia occurred significantly less often among children receiving stavudine [6]. Stavudine is associated with a higher rate of adverse events than zidovudine in adults and children receiving combination therapy [16-17]. In a large pediatric natural history study (PACTG 219C), stavudine-containing regimens had a modest but significantly higher rate of clinical and laboratory toxicities than those containing zidovudine , with pancreatitis, with stavudine [17]. Peripheral neuropathy is an important toxicity associated with stavudine but appears to be less common in children than in adults [4, 6] . Elevated hepatic transaminases are seen in about 11% and pancreatitis in 1% of adults enrolled in clinical trials of stavudine . In a small pediatric study of stavudine in combination with didanosine, no pharmacokinetic interactions were observed and there were no cases of peripheral neuropathy [5]. In PACTG 219C, peripheral neuropathy was children [17]. Lipodystrophy, and specifically lipoatrophy (loss of subcutaneous fat), are toxicities associated with the use of NRTIs, particularly stavudine, in adults and children [18-20]. Lipodystrophy developed in 28% of 39 children receiving stavudine, lamivudine, and nelfinavir after a median of 49 months of therapy with 9 demonstrating lipoatrophy [10]. Among 90 children receiving 65% dev eloped 33 months [21]. Further research concerning body habitus changes associated with NRTI use in pediatric patients is ongoing. Lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis, including fatal cases, has been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including stavudine, alone or in combination [22-23]. The combination of stavudine and didanosine in pregnant women has been associated with fatal lactic acidosi s and should be used during pregnancy only if no other alternatives are available [24]. Many of these adverse events are believed to be due to mitochondrial toxicity resulting from inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, with depletion of mitochondrial DNA demonstrated in fat, muscle, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other tissues [22, 25- 27]. (For 17h. Antir etroviral Therapy -Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations .) Although the World Health Organization has chosen to limit the maximum dose of stavudine to 30 mg (WHO guidelines at www.who.int/hiv/art/ARTadultsaddendum.pdf), these guidelines support switching to another agent rather than lowering the dose of stavudine to reduce the risk of or to manage toxicity. This recommendation is based on the availability of alternativ e antiretroviral agents in the United States and concerns of some Pan el members about suboptimal therapy with a lower dose of stavudine.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 166 Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF, Viread) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Tablet : 300 mg Combination t ablets : - With emtricitabine (FTC) : 200 mg FTC + 300 mg TDF (Truvada) - With FTC + efavirenz (EFV) : 200 mg FTC + 600 mg EFV + 300 mg TDF (Atripla) Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Neonate/Infant dose : Not approved for use in neonates/infants. Pediatric dose : Not approved for use in children <12 years of age; only commercially available preparat ion is 300- mg tablet. Investigational dose of 8 mg/kg of body weight once daily in children <12 years of age provided a lower exposure than was observed in adults. Adolescent ( 12 years and >35 kg) dose : 300 mg once daily See text for concerns about decreased bone mineral density, especially in prepubertal patients and those in early puberty (Tanner stages 1 and 2). Asthenia, headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence Renal insufficiency, Fanconi syndrome Decreased bone mineral density Special Inst ructions TDF can be administered without regard to food, although absorption is enhanced when administered with a high- fat meal. It is recommended to administer Atripla on an empty stomach because it contains EFV. When coadministered, ddI delayed- release capsule formulation and TDF may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal. Screen patients for hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) prior to use of TDF. Severe acute exacerbation of HBV can occur when TDF is discontinued; monitor hepatic function for several months after therapy with TDF is stopped. Dosing Recommendations for Combination Formulations Truvada Adult dose : 1 tablet once daily Atripla Adult dose : 1 tablet once daily Metabolism Renal excretion. Dosing of TDF in patients with renal insufficiency : Decreased dosage should be used in patients with impaired renal function. Consult manufacturer's prescribing information for adjustment of dosage in accordance with creatinine clearance. Atripla (fixed -dose combination) should not be used in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min or in patients requiring dialysis. Truvada (fixed -dose combination) should not be used in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min or in patients requiring dialysis. Dosing Recommendations for Coadministration with Other Antiret roviral Drugs TDF in combination with didanosine (ddI) ddI dose requires modification. See section on ddI. TDF in combination with atazanavir (ATV) Only ATV boosted with ritonavir (RTV) should be used in combination with TDF. See section on ATV . Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function or compete for active tubular secretion could reduce clearance of tenofovir. Other NRTIs: Didanosine tenofovir. PIs: Tenofovir decreases atazanavir plasma concentrations. dosing for atazanavir coadministered with tenofovir is atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir 300 mg, all as a single daily dose with food. Atazanavir without ritonavir should not be coadministered with tenofovir. In addition, atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir increase tenofovir concentrations and could potentiate tenofovir- associated toxicity. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 167 Major Toxicities: More common: Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and flatulence. Less common (more severe): Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Tenofovir caused bone toxicity (osteomalacia and reduced bone density) in animals when given in high doses. Decreases in bone mineral density h ave been shown in both adults and children taking tenofovir for 48 weeks; the clinical significance of these changes is not yet known. Evidence of renal toxicity, including increases in serum creatinine, blood ur ea and decreases in serum phosphate has been observed. Numerous case reports of renal tubular dysfunction have been reported in patients receiving tenofovir; patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction should be closely monitored. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford Uni versity HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/TDF.html ). Pediatric Experience: In a Phase I/II study of tenofovir for salvage therapy using an investigational 75-mg formulation in 18 heavily pretreated children and adolescents at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH) [1], the major toxicity attributable to tenofovir was a >6% decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan in 5 of 15 (33%) children evaluated at Week 48. Two of the 5 children discontinued tenofovir at 48 weeks as required by the protocol and experienced partial or complete recovery of BMD by 96 weeks [2]. Among children with BMD decreases, the median Tanner score was 1 (range 1 -3) and mean age was 10.2 years; for children who had no BMD decreases, the median Tanner score was 2.5 (rang e 1-4) and median age was 13.2 years [2-3]. In a second study of 6 patients at NIH using the commercially available 300-mg formulation of tenofovir, 2 prepubertal children experienced >6% BMD decreases. One of the 2 children, the smallest child in the study, experienced a 27% decrease in BMD, necessitating withdrawal of tenofovir from her antiretroviral therapy regimen. The child continued therapy without tenofovir and subsequently her BMD recovered [4] The data from both of these small studies suggest that tenofovir-related bone loss may be greater in less mature children (e.g., Tanner 1-2) than in those with more advanced development (Tanner 3), and other studies offer fur ther support for this conclusion [5-6]. It is also possible that the bone loss seen in the patients in the NIH studies [1-4] may have been associated with higher tenofovir exposures. All participants were treated with regimens that also contained ritonavir, which increases tenofovir exposure [7-8]. Although the median initial dose in the Phase I/II studies was 208 mg/m2 (= 7.1 mg/kg), the administered dose varied from 161 to 256 mg/m2 (3.7 to 10 mg/kg) [1]. Loss of bone mineral density at 48 weeks was associated with higher drug exposure (AUC) [3]. However, in this heavily pretreated cohort, the group with the best virologic response had statistically significantly higher AUC, suggesting that in salvage therapy tenofovir may have a relatively small therapeutic window, especiall y in children in Tanner stages 1 -2. In contrast to the NIH studies, an Italian study showed no effect of tenofovir on BMD in pediatric patients on stable therapy with undetectable viral load who were switched from stavudine and PI-containing regimens to tenofovir /lamivudine/efavirenz [9]. The different results may be explained by different patient populations, differences in concurrent medication use, and tenofovir dosing. The patients in the Italian study [9-11] included older participants (up to age 18 years), had greater height and weight z scores, and the majority were in middle to late puberty or postpubertal. The NIH study involved heavily treatment experienced patient s in need of salvage therapy while the Italian study evaluated BMD in a potentially healthier population of patients who were required to have long-lasting viral suppression prior to the switch in therapy. Finally, because the patients in the Italian study received tenofovir in the absence of ritonavir and were administered fractions of tenofovir pills to provide lower doses, the tenofovir concentrations experienced by the Italian patients may have been lower than those seen in the NIH patients. No BMD studies have been reported in treatment -na\u00efve children who initiate therapy with tenofovir. No significant renal disease was seen with tenofovir therapy in either of the 2 small NIH studies or in the Italian study. In 6/159 (3.7%) children with HIV- 1 treated with tenofovir in the Collaborative HIV Pediatric Study (CHIPS) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, renal toxicity leading to discontinuation of tenofovir was reported [12]. All 6 of those patients were taking didanosine and lopinavir/ritonavir in addition to tenofovir, and the interaction of didanosine and tenofovir [13] or the boosting of tenofovir exposure by concurrent use of lopinavir/ritonavir [7] may have caused this toxicity. Possible tenofovir- associated nephrotoxicity manifest as Fanconi syndrome, reduced creatinine clearance, and diabetes insipidus has been reported in a child receiving tenofovir as a component of salvage therapy including lopinavir/ritonavir and didanosine for 1 year [14], and irreversible renal failure has been reported in an adolescent treated with tenofovir without didanosine [15]. Increased urinary beta-2 microglobulin suggesting proximal renal tubular damage was identified in 12 of 44 (27%) children treated with tenofovir August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 168 compared with 2 of 48 (4%) children not treated with tenofovir [16]. An observational cohort study of 2,102 children with HIV in the United States suggested an increased risk of renal disease (increased creatinine or proteinuria) in children treated w ith tenofovir- containing combination antiretroviral therapy [17]. However, no significant decrease in calculated glomerular filtration rate was found in 27 HIV-infected children treated with tenofovir for 96 weeks [10]. Lipid profiles improved significantly after the switch from stavudine and PI-containing regimens to tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz [11]. The NIH study, using a 75-mg tablet formulation of tenofovir in treatment- experienced children and adolescents 6 -18 years of age, showed that a median dose of 208 mg/m2 of body surface area (range 161 -256 mg/m2 body surface area) resulted in a median single dose AUC and C max that were 34% and 27% lower, respectively, compared with values reported in adults administered a daily dose of 300 mg [1, 18] . Renal clearance of tenofovir was approximately 1.5 -fold higher in children than previously reported in adults, possibly explaining the lower systemic exposure [1]. Steady-state tenofovir exposures were higher but still less than those seen in adults and may reflect the concomitant treatment with ritonavir, which boosts tenofovir pla sma concentrations. Lower than anticip ated tenofovir exposure was also found in young adults (median age 23 years) treated with atazanavir/ ritonavir plus tenofovir [19]. The clinical impact of these low drug exposures is unknown, but in the NIH study, lower single -dose and steady- state AUC were associated with inferior virologic outcome [3]. The CHIPS cohort used a target dose of 8 mg/kg, but 18% were dosed at >120% of the target and 37% at less than 80%. In the Italian study, which only enrolled patients with undetectable viral load on current therapy, all HIV -infected children remained clinically stable and virologically suppressed after the change to a tenofovir -containing regimen [11]. In the NIH \"salvage\" study, plasma HIV RNA concentrations (log 10 copies/mL) decreased from a median pretreatment concentration of 5.4 log 10 copies/mL to 4.21 log 10 copies/mL after 48 weeks of therapy [3]. HIV RNA was <400 copies/mL <50 copies/mL in 4/16 (25%) participants at 48 weeks. In the CHIPS cohort 115 patients had outcome data available [12]. Viral load decreased to <50 copies/mL at 12 months in 38% of patients starting tenofovir for the first time; in 50% on first -line therapy; 39% of those on second-line therapy; and 13% of patients on third- line or greater therapy [12]. In March 2010, the FDA approved the use of tenofovir in adolescents > 12 years of age and weighing > 35 kg based upon data from Gilead study 321, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of tenofovir or placebo plus an optimized background regimen in 87 treatme nt-experienced adolescents between 12 and <18 years of age in Brazil and Panama [20-21]. No difference in viral load response was seen between the 2 groups. Subgroup analyses suggest this lack of response may have been due to imbalances in viral susceptibility to the optimized background regimens between the 2 groups. Importantly, impaired bone accrual was seen in the teno fovir group, manifest by declining BMD z scores over 48 and 96 weeks. In addition, 6 of 33 (18%) participants in the tenofovir arm experienced a >4% decline in absolute lumbar spine BMD in 48 weeks compared with only 1 of 33 (3%) participants in the placebo arm [20-21]. Limited pharmacokinetic data were reported from 8 participants and suggested that tenofovir exposures were higher than those seen in the NIH study, but no data on correlation of tenofovir exposure with BMD loss were provided. Given this potential for BMD loss, some experts recommend obtaining a DXA prior to the initiation of tenofovir therapy and approximately 6 months after start of tenofovir, especially in prepubertal patients and those early in puberty (Tanner stages 1 and 2). However, in view of the potential cost and difficulty in obtaining pediatric DXA in some settings, other experts t ry to avoid using tenofovir in prepubertal patients and those in early puberty, especially for initial therapy. Despite the ease of use of a once-daily drug and the efficacy of tenofovir, this potential for BMD loss during the important period of rapid bone accrual in adolescence is concerning and favors judicious use of tenofovir in this age group. There is still an urgent need for more research to develop appropriate pediatric formulations and to identify the safest uses of tenofovir in children and adole scents. An investigational liquid formulation has been studied in children 2-8 years of age; a tenofovir dose of 8 mg/kg resulted in tenofovir exposure similar to that observed in adults receiving a tenofovir dose of 300 mg, but this formulation had poor palatability and was not developed further [22]. A powder formulation is also under investigation. An investigational dose of 8 mg/kg of body weight once daily in children <12 years of age provided a lower exposure than was observed in adults, and the FDA has recommended that a higher dose be evaluated in this age group [21].

Adolescent ( 18 years) /Adult dose : 200 mg three times a day or 300 mg twice daily Bone marrow suppression: macrocytic anemia or neutropenia GI intolerance, headache, insomnia, asthenia Lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis Special Instructions Can be given without regard to food. Substantial granulocytopenia or anemia may necessitate interruption of therapy until marrow recovery is observed; use of erythropoietin, filgrastim, or transfusion may be necessary in some patients. Metabolism Metabolized to AZT glucuronide (GAZT), which is renally excreted. Dosage adjustment required in renal insufficiency. Decreased dosing may be required in patients with hepatic impairment. Combivir and Trizivir (fixed -dose combination products) should not be used in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min, patients on dialysis, or patients with impaired hepatic function. Dosing Recommendations for Combination Formulations Combivi r Adolescent (weight 30 kg)/Adult dose : 1 tablet twice daily Trizivir Adolescent (weight 40 kg)/Adult dose : 1 tablet twice daily August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 171 Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1- Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Other NRTIs: Should not be administered in combination with stavudine due to virologic antagonism. Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents including ganciclovir, interferon alpha, and ribavirin: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. Doxorubicin: Use should be avoided. Major Toxicities: More common: Hematologic toxicity, including granulocytopenia and anemia. Headache, malaise, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Less common (more severe): Myopathy (associated with prolonged use), myositis, and liver toxicity. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Fat maldistribution. Rare: Increased risk of hypospadias after first -trimester exposure to zidovudine observed in one cohort study. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://w ww.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/ZDV.html ). Pediatric Experience: Zidovudine was the first NRTI studied in adult and pediatric clinical trials and the first antiretroviral agent approved for treatment of HIV infection. Data from multiple pediatric studies of zidovudine alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals demonstrate that zidovudine appears safe and is associated with clinical improvement and virologic and immunologic effects [1-16]. Perinatal trial PACTG 076 established th at a zidovudine prophylactic regimen given during pregnancy, labor, and to the newborn reduced the risk of perinatal HIV transmission by nearly 70% [17]. Recommended neonatal zidovudine dosing for prevention of mot her-to-child transmission of HIV is 2 mg/kg orally every 6 hours or 1.5 mg/kg intravenously every 6 hours for those unable to receive oral dosing. Although not FDA approved, twice-daily dosing (4 mg/kg every 12 hours) is sometimes prescribed when concerns about adherence exist, but the efficacy of this approach for prevention of mother- to-child transmission has not been evaluated. Pharmacokinetic studies, such as PACTG 331, have shown that dose adjustments are necessary for premature infants due to decrease d zidovudine clearance compared with term newborns of similar postnatal ages [2, 6] . Resistance m utations were shown to be present in 5 of 17 (29%) newborns born to mothers who received zidovudine during pregnancy [18]. Overall, zidovudine pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients >3 months of age are similar to those in adult patients. The manufacturer's recommended oral dose in pediatric patients 6 weeks to 12 years of age is 160 mg per meter2 of body surface area every 8 hours or 240 mg per meter2 of body surface area every 12 hours, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, although the recommended dose for adults is 300 mg twice daily. Recently, weight band dosing has also been approved [19]. Zidovudine undergoes intracellular metabolism to its active form, zidovudine triphosphate. Although the mean half- life of intracellular zidovudine triphosphate (9.1 hours) is considerably longer than that of unmetabolized zidovudine in plasma (1.5 hours), once- daily zidovudine dosing is not recommended because of (CNS) penetration (cerebrospinal fluid- to-plasma concentration ratio = 0.68) and has been used in children with HIV- related CNS disease [1].

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 173 NON- NUCLEOSIDE ANALOGUE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS Efavirenz (EFV, Sustiva) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Capsules : 50 mg and 200 mg Tablets : 600 mg Combination t ablets : - with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) : 200 mg FTC + 300 mg TDF + 600 mg EFV (Atripla) Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Neonate/Infant dose : Not approved for use in neonates/infants. Pediatric dose : Children <3 years of age: There are currently no data available on the appropriate dosage for children <3 years of age. Children 3 years and 10 kg: Administer EFV once daily: Weight (kg) 250 20-<25 300 25-<32.5 350 32.5-<40 400 40 600 * The dose in mg could be dispensed in any combination of capsule strengths; dose represents the maximum recommended EFV dose for each weight band. Adolescent ( 40 kg)/Adult dose : 600 mg once daily Rash Central nervous system symptoms Increased transaminases False -positive with some cannabinoid and benzodiazepine tests Teratogenic Lipohypertrophy Special Instructions Administer EFV on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. The relative bioavailability of EFV was increased by 50% (range 11%-126%) following a high fat meal. Because there is no information on the safety of EFV when given above the recommended dose, avoid administration with a high fat meal due to the potential for increased absorption. Administer Atripla on an empty stomach. Capsules may be opened and added to liquids or small amounts of food. Bedtim e dosing is recommended, particularly during the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, to improve tolerability of central nervous system side effects. Dosing Recommendations for Combination Formulations Atripla Atripla should not be used in pediatric patients <40 kg where the EFV dose would be excessive. Adult dose : One tablet once daily Metabolism Metabolized by cytochrome P450, in patients with hepatic impairment : No recommendation is currently available; use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Adult dose of Atripla in patients with renal impairment : Because Atripla is a fixed -dose combination product, it should not be used in patients with creatinine clea rance of <50 mL/minute or in patients on dialysis. Dosing Recommendations for Coadministration with Other with EFV may require d osage adjustment or addition of RTV. See appropriate drug section. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 174 Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1- Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Metabolism : Mixed inducer/inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes; concentrations of concomitant drugs can be increased or decreased depending on the specific enzyme pathway involved. There are multiple drug interactions. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities: More common: Skin rash, increased transaminase levels. Central nervous system abnormalities (e.g., somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, abnormal thinking, impaired concentration, amnesia, agitation, depersonalization, hallucinations, euphoria) primarily reported in adults. Rare : In cynomolgus monkeys, prenatal efavirenz exposure has been associated with central nervous system congenital abnormalities in infant monkeys. Based on these data and retrospective reports in humans of an unusual pattern of severe central nervous system defects in five infants after first -trimester exposure to efavirenz -containing Walker malformations), efavire nz has been classified as FDA Pregnancy Class D (positive evidence of human fetal risk). Efavirenz use in the first trimester of pregnancy should be avoided. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing and be counseled about the risk of efavirenz to the fetus and need to avoid pregnancy before initiating and during efavirenz therapy. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/EFV.html ). Pediatric Experience: Efavirenz has been studied in HIV-infected children in combinations of efavirenz plus NRTIs or efavirenz plus NRTIs plus a PI (nelfinavir or lopinavir/ritonavir) [1-17]. An open label study (PACTG 382) of efavirenz combined with nelfinavir and 1 or 2 NRTIs was performed in 57 NNRTI - and PI- na\u00efve pediatric patients, some as young as 3 years of age [11]. In an intent- to-treat analysis, 76% of children had plasma HIV RNA concentrations <400 copies/mL and 63% had HIV RNA concentrations <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks of therapy. The median times to achieve those concentrations were 4 and 20 weeks, respectively. Therefore, children with detectable HIV RNA (>50 copies/mL by the ultra- sensitive RNA assay) after 1 month of therapy continued to accrue some virologic benefit through 5 months of treatment with this regimen [10]. Long-term virologic suppression with once- daily efavirenz therapy in combination with emtricitabine and didanosine was reported in 37 treatment-na\u00efve children, 3-18 years of age, participating in PACTG 1021 [8]. Eighty -five percent of subjects were able achieve HIV -RNA <400 copies/mL and 72% maintained HIV-RNA suppression <50 copies/mL through 96 weeks of therapy. A study of a liquid formulation of efavirenz in 19 HIV -infected children 3 -9 years of age has been reported [12]. A 20% higher dose of efavirenz liquid formulation resulted in pharmacokinetic AUC values that were similar to those observed with efavirenz capsules. Limited pharmacokinetic data in children <3 years of age or who weigh <13 kg have shown that it is difficult to achieve target trough concentrations in this age group even with very high (>30 mg/kg) doses of this investigational liquid formulation [18]. Thus, efavirenz is not recommended for use in children <3 years of age at this time and no liquid formulation is commercia lly available. Additional studies are required to determine the appropriate dose of efavirenz in infants and young children. Efavirenz metabolism is controlled by enzymes that are polymorphically expressed and result in large between patient variability in efavirenz exposure. CYP 2B6 is the primary enyzme for efavirenz metabolism and pediatric patients with the 516 T/T or G/T genotype have reduced metabolism and higher efavirenz levels compared with those with the G/G genotype alleles have been found to influence efavirenz concentrations in adults [21-22]. Long-term HIV RNA suppression has been associated with maintenance of trough efavirenz concentrations >1 mcg /mL in adults [23] . Early HIV RNA suppression in children has also been seen with higher drug concentrations. Higher efavirenz troughs of 1.9 mcg/mL were seen in subjects with HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL versus efavirenz troughs of 1.3 mcg/mL in subjects with detectible virus (>400 copies/mL) [3]. In a West African pediatric study, ANRS 12103, early reduction in viral load (12 weeks) was greater in children with efavirenz C min >1.1 mcg/mL or AUC >51 mcg*h/mL efavirenz concentrations can be suboptimal [19, 24- 25], so that some experts recommend therapeutic drug monitoring when using efavirenz and possibly using higher doses in young children, especially in select clinical situations such as virologic rebound or lack of response in an adherent patient. In 1 study that adjusted the efavirenz August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 175 dose in response to measurement of the AUC, the administered efavirenz dose median was 13 mg/kg (367 mg/m2) and the range was from 3 to 23 mg/kg (69 to 559 mg/m2) [3]. A pharmacokinetic study in 20 children age 10 to 1 6 years treated with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir 300 mg/m2 twice daily plus efavirenz 350 mg/m2 once daily showed adequacy of the lopinavir trough values but suggested that the efavirenz trough was lower than pharmacokinetic targets, and the aut hors recommend that higher doses of efavirenz might be needed when these drugs are used together [16]. Therapeutic drug monitoring might be considered when using efavirenz in combinations with potentially complex drug interactions. The toxicity profile for efavirenz differs for adults and children. In adults, a central nervous system (CNS) complex of confusion, agitation, sleep disturbance, nightmares, hallucinations, or other symptoms has been reported in >50% of patients [26]. These symptoms usually occur early in treatment and rarely require drug discontinuation but sometimes occur or persist for months. Bedtime efavirenz dosing appears to decrease the occurrence and severity of these neuropsychiatric side effects. In several studies, the incidence of such side effects was correlated with efavirenz plasma concentrations and occurred more frequently in patients with higher concentrations [23, 27 -30]. In patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, efavirenz should be used cautiously for initial therapy. Adverse CNS effects occurred in 14% of children receiving efavirenz in clinical studies [11] and in 30% of children with efavirenz concentrations >4 mcg/mL [20]. The principal side effect of efavirenz in children is rash, which was seen in up to 40% of children, compared with 27% of adults. The rash is usually maculopapular, pruritic, and mild to moderate in severity and rarely requires drug discontinuation. Onset is typically in the first 2 weeks of treatment [11]. Although severe rash and Stevens-Johnson syndro me have been reported, this is rare. Other reported adverse events in adults and children include diarrhea, nausea, and increased transaminases including liver failure [31]. There are insufficient data to recommend substituting nevirapine for efavirenz following either rash or hepatotoxicity [32]. Efavirenz should be used with caution in adolescent women of childbearing age because of the risk of teratogenicity [33]. See Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV -1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States [34]. Many clinicians choose alternative drugs for use in sexually active adolescent women in whom contraception use is sometimes erratic and the risk of unintended pregnancy is high. References 1.

Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Metabolism : Etravirine is an inducer of CYP3A4; an inhibitor of CYP2C9 substrate 3A4, and 2C19. Etravirine is also an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. There are multiple drug interactions. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Etravirine should not be coadministered with More common: Nausea, diarrhea, mild rash. Rash occurs most commonly in the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rash generally resolves after 1 to 2 weeks on continued therapy. A history of NNRTI- related rash does not appear to increase the risk of developing rash with etravirine. However, patients who have a history of severe rash with prior NNRTI use should not receive etravirine. Less common: Severe rash including Stevens -Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reactions (including constitutional findings and sometimes organ dysfunction including hepatic failure), and erythema multiforme have been reported. Discontinue etravirine immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia). Clinical status including liver transaminases should be monitored and August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 178 appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping etravirine treatment after the onset of severe rash may result in a life - threatening reaction. It is recommended that patients who have a prior history of severe rash with nevirapine or efavirenz not receive etravirine. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list o f updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/ETR.html ). Pediatric Experience: The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of etravirine in pediatric patients have not been established. There is limited pediatric experience and pediatric trials are under way. Recently reported are the results of a Phase I dose finding study involving 21 children with virologic suppression on a stable lopinavir/ritonavir-containing regimen [1]. Etravirine therapy was added for 1 week and pharmacokinetic sampling and analysis were performed. The findings from this trial were used to determine the dose in the Phase II trial in pediatric patients that is currently unde r way. At this time data are insufficient to recommend a pediatric dose and further studies are warranted to determine the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of etravirine in children. Recently reported was an analysis of genotypic and phenotypic HIV resistance profiles in 35 children from a Ugandan clinic with clinical failure of a first -line regimen containing an NNRTI other than etravirine [2]. Reduced etravirine susceptibility (fold -change >2.9) was found based on phenotypic analysis in 35% of samples. References 1. Konigs C, Feiterna -Sperling C, Exposito S, et al.

Treatment dose not defined for infants < 14 days of age. Pediatric dose ( 15 days) : (See note below about initiation of therapy.) <8 years: 200 mg/m 2 of body surface area/dose (maximum dose 200 mg) twice daily 8 years: 120-150 mg/m 2 of body surface area/dose (maximum dose 200 mg) twice daily When adjusting the dose for a growing child, the mg dose need not be decreased as the child reaches 8 years; rather, the mg dose is left static to achieve the appropriate mg - per-m2 dosage as the child grows, as long as there are no untoward effects. NVP is initiated at a lower dose and increased in a stepwise fashion to allow induction of cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzymes, which results in increased clearance of the drug. The occurrence of rash is diminished by this stepwise increase in dose. Initiate therapy with the age-appropriate dose once daily for the first 14 days of therapy. If there is no rash or untoward effect, at 14 days of therapy increase to the age- appropriate dose administered twice daily. The total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg. Adolescent/Adult dose : 200 mg twice daily Initiate therapy with 200 mg given once daily for the first 14 days. Increase to 200 mg administered twice daily if there is no rash or other untoward effects. R ash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome Symptomatic hepatitis, includ ing fatal hepatic necrosis Severe systemic hypersensitivity syndrome with potential for multisystem organ involvement and shock Special Instructions Can be given without regard to food. May be administered concurrently with didanosine (ddI). NVP -associ ated skin rash usually occurs within the first 6 weeks of therapy. If rash occurs during the initial 14- day lead -in period, do not increase dose until rash resolves (see Major Toxicities ). If NVP dosing is interrupted dosing should be restarted with once-daily dosing for 14 days, followed by escalation to the full, twice -daily regimen. Most cases of NVP -associated hepatic toxicity occur during the first 12 weeks of therapy; frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring, including liver function tests, is important during this time period. However, about one- third of cases occurred after 12 weeks of treatment, so continued periodic monitoring of liver function tests is needed. In some cases, patients presented with nonspecific prodromal signs or symptoms of hepatitis and rapidly progressed to hepatic failure. Patients with symptoms or signs of hepatitis should have liver function tests performed. NVP should be permanently discontinued and not restarted in patients who develop clinical hepatitis or hypersensitivity reactions. Shake suspension well and store at room temperature. Metabolism Metabolized by cytochrome in patients with renal failure receiving hemodialysis : An additional dose of NVP should be given following dialysis. Dosing of NVP in patients with hepatic impairment : NVP should not be administered to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Dosing Recommendations for Coadministration with Other Antiretroviral Drugs NVP in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) A higher dose of LPV/ r may be needed. See LPV/r section.

There is potential for mult iple drug interactions. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Nevirapine should not be coadministered to patients receiving atazanavir (with or without ritonavir). Major Toxic ities: (Note: These seen regimens, not single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis.) More common: Skin rash (some severe and requiring hospitalization; some life- threatening, including Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolys is), fever, nausea, headache, and abnormal hepatic transaminases. Nevirapine should be permanently discontinued and not restarted in children or adults who develop severe rash, rash with constitutional symptoms, or rash with elevated hepatic transaminases. Nevirapine -associated skin rash usually occurs within the first 6 weeks of therapy. If rash occurs during the initial 14- day lead -in period, do not increase dose until rash resolves. However, the risk of developing nevirapine resistance with extended lead-in dosing is unknown and is a concern that must be weighed against the patient's overall ability to tolerate the regimen and the current antiviral response. Nevirapine should be discontinued immediately and not restarted in patients who develop severe rash, a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms (i.e., fever, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, or blistering), or rash accompanied by elevated hepatic transaminases. Less common (more severe): Severe, life- threatening, and in rare cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure (these are less common in children than adults). The majority of cases occur in the first 12 weeks of therapy; may be associated with rash or other signs or symptoms of h ypersensitivity reaction. Risk factors for nevirapine -related hepatic toxicity in adults include baseline elevation in serum transaminase levels, hepatitis B or C infection, female gender, and higher CD4 count at time of therapy initiation (CD4 count >250 cells/mm 3 in adult females and >400 cells/mm3 in adult males). Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including but not limited to severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, and significant hepatic abnormalities. Nevirapine should be permanently discontinued and not restarted in children or adults who develop symptomatic hepatitis, severe transaminase elevations, or hypersensitivity reactions. Resistance: T he International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/NVP.html ). Pediatric Experience: Nevirapine has been studied in HIV- infected children in combination with NRTIs or with NRTIs and a PI [1-9]. Combination therapy with nevirapine, zidovudine, and didanosine in young infected infants was associated with sustained viral suppression in a small number of children [6]. A description of 15 infants initiating nevirapine-based antiretroviral treatment younger than 66 days of age in Belgium reported that complete viral suppression (<400 copies/mL) was achieved in 11 (73%) infants [10]. A larger study, PACTG 356, treated infants and young children with 3 different containing regimens: zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine, zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir/nevirapine, or zidovudine /lamivudine/nevirapine/nelfinavir of 17 infants treated with the 3-drug regimen had viral suppression to <400 copies/mL HIV RNA, compared with 10 of 17 (41%) and 15 of 18 (83%), respectively , of infants treated with 4 drugs. Children who started therapy younger than 3 months of age had a better virologic outcome compared with children who started at an older age (3.5-24 months). PACTG 377 randomized 181 PI- and NNRTI- na\u00efve mild to moderately immune suppressed children to 1 of 4 combination treatment regimens. All of the regimens contained stavudine and a PI (either ritonavir or nelfinavir ); 3 of the 4 regimens also included nevirapine as part of combination therapy. Children in the nevirapine- containing arms experienced moderate or worse skin rash more frequently than did children not receiving nevirapine. Those children receiving a 4 -drug regimen containing both nevirapine and a PI had a significantly greater increase in CD4 cell count from ba seline to Week 24 than children receiving other regimens [9]. A study of 212 children in Cambodia treated with NNRTI -based combination therapy (82% nevirapine and 18% efavirenz) reported 156 of 212 children (73.6%) having undetectable viral load (<400 copies/mL) after 12 months of treatment. Only 2 children switched regimens due to intolerabilit y of nevirapine [1]. In PACTG 403, 41 children with prior NRTI of therapy, only 28% (5/18) of those still on the nevirapine-inclusive regimen had viral suppression to <400 copies/mL compared with 65% (11/17) of children on the ritonavir -based treatment. The changes in CD4 percentage and the rates of toxicities were similar for both regimens. Three children developed nevirapine-related rashes leading to discontinuation of study treatment [2]. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 181 In infants and children previously exposed to single-dose nevirapine for prevention of mother- to-child transmission (PMTCT), nevirapine- based antiretroviral therapy is less likely than lopinavir/ritonavir -based ART to control virus load. In a small, nonrandomized study in Botswana, 6-month virologic and immunologic responses were compared between 15 SD nevirapine- exposed and 15 -unexposed infants who initiated nevirapine- based antiretroviral treatment at a mean age of 8 months (range 2 - 33 months) in follow-up from a PMTCT study [11]. Only 34% of those with a history of exposure had an undetectable viral load (<400 copies/mL) compared with 91% of the unexposed cohort. CD4 percentage was also significantly lower in the exposed group compared with the unexposed group, 23% versus 31%, respectively. In contrast, in a study in Uganda, in which children with SD nevirapine exposure started nevirapine -based treatment at an older age of 1.6 years, there was no diff erence in response to therapy between children with and without prior SD nevirapine exposure [12]. In a large randomized clinical trial, P1060, 153 children (mean age 0.7 years) previously exposed to nevirapine for perinatal prophylaxis were treated with zidovudine plus addition of At virologic endpoint (virologic failure [VF] defined as <1 log decrease in HIV RNA in Weeks 12 -24 or HIV RNA >400 copies/mL at Week 24) compared with 7% in the zidovudine/lamivudine/lopinavir/ ritonavir arm, p = 0.0009. When all primary endpoints were considered, including viral failure, death, and treatment discontinuation, the PI arm remained superior because 40% of children in the nevirapine arm met a primary endpoint versus 22% for the lopinavir/ ritonavir arm, p = 0.027. Based on these findings the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended discontinuing enrollment in this cohort. Enrollment into the comparison study of nevirapine versus lopinavir/ ritonavir in children 6-36 months of age not previously exposed to nevirapine is ongoing [13]. Body surface area has traditionally been used to guide nevirapine dosing for infants and young children. It is important to avoid underdosing of nevirap ine because a single point mutation may confer NNRTI resistance to both nevirapine and efavirenz. Younger children (< 8 years of age) have higher apparent oral clearance than older children and require a higher dosage to achieve equivalent drug exposure compared with children >8 years of age. [6-7]. Because of this, it is recommended that dosing for children younger than 8 years of age be 200 mg/m2 of body surface area per dose (maximum dose 200 mg) administered twice daily. For children 8 years or older, the recommended dose is 120 mg/m2 of body surface area per dose (maximum dose 200 mg) administered twice daily. When adjusting the dose in a growing child, the milligram dose need not be decreased (from 200 mg/m2 to 120 mg/m2) as the child reaches 8 years; rather, the milligram dose is left static as long as there are no untoward effects, and the dose is allowed to achieve the appropriate mg/m2 dosage as the child grows. Some practitioners dose nevirapine at 150 mg/m2 of body surface area every 12 hours (maximum of 200 mg per dose) regardless of age, as recommended in the FDA -approved product label. References 1.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 183 PROTEASE INHIBITO RS Atazanavir (ATV, Reyataz) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Capsules : 100 mg, 150 mg , 200 mg, and 300 mg Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Neonate/Infant dose : Not approved for use in neonates/infants. ATV should not be administered to neonates due to the risks associated with hyperbilirubinemia (kernicterus). Pediatric do se: There are insufficient data to recommend dosing in all children younger than 6 years of age or for treatment- experienced children weighing less than 25 kg. For children 6-18 years of age: Weight (kg) Once -Daily Dose* Treatment -Na\u00efve ** Children Only 15 to <25 kg ATV 150 mg + RTV 80 mg, both once daily with food Both Treatment -Na\u00efve and Treatment - Experienced Children 25 to <32 kg ATV 200 mg + RTV 100 mg, both once daily with food 32 to <39 kg ATV 250 mg + RTV 100 mg, both once daily with food 39 kg ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg, both once daily with food *Higher doses than those currently recommended may be required for some patients. See discussion under pediatric experience. **There are insufficient data to recommend this dose in treatment -experien ced children weighing less than 25 kg. For treatment-naive pediatric patients who do not tolerate ritonavir (RTV): Atazanavir boosted with RTV is preferred for children and adolescents. Current FDA -approved prescribing information does not recommend unboosted ATV in children younger than 13 years of age. If unboosted ATV is used in adolescents, higher doses than those used in adults may be required to achieve target drug levels (see pediatric experience section). Adolescent ( 16-21 years)/Adult dose : Antiretroviral -na\u00efve patients: ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg or ATV 400 mg once daily with food Antiretroviral- experienced patients: ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg, both once daily with food Indirect hyperbilirubinemia Prolonged PR interval, first degree symptomatic AV block in some patients Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increased bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Nephrolithiasis Special Instructions Administer ATV with food to enhance absorption. Unboosted ATV does not appear to increase chole sterol or triglyceride levels. However, ATV boosted with RTV may be associated with lipid abnormalities. Because ATV can prolong the electrocardiogram PR interval, use with caution in patients with pre -existing cardiac conduction system disease or with other drugs known to prolong the PR interval (e.g., calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, digoxin, verapamil). ATV absorption is dependent on low gastric pH and when administered with medications that alter gastric pH, special dosing information is indicated. When administered with buffered didanosine (ddI) formulations or antacids, ATV should be taken at least 2 hours before or 1 hour after antacid or ddI administration. Individuals with HBV or HCV infections and individuals with marked elevations in trans aminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk of further elevations in transaminases or hepatic decompensation. Metabolism ATV is a substrate and inhibitor of and an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and UGT1A1. Dosing of ATV in patients with hepatic impairment : ATV should be used with caution in patients with mild- to- moderate hepatic impairment; consult manufacturer's prescribing information for adjustment of dosage in patients with moderate impairment. ATV should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Dosing of ATV in patients with renal impairment : No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. However, ATV should not be given to treatment -experienced patients with end -stage renal disease on hemodialysis. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 184 Dosing Recommendations for Coadministration with Other Antiretroviral Drugs ATV in combination with efavirenz (EFV) in therapy -na\u00efve patients only Adult dose : ATV 400 mg + RTV 100 mg + EFV 600 mg, all once daily but at separate times Although ATV/r should be taken with food, EFV should be taken on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. EFV should not be used with ATV (with or without RTV) in treatment- experienced patients because EFV decreases ATV exposure. ATV in combination with tenofovir (TDF) Adult dose : ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg + TDF 300 mg, all once daily with food Only RTV -boosted ATV should be used in combination with TDF because TDF decreases ATV exposure. Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Metabolism : Atazanavir is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the CYP3A4 enzyme system and has significant interactions with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Atazanavir also competitively inhibits CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. There is potential for multiple drug glucuronidation enzyme of CYP2C8. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. NRTIs : Tenofovir decreases atazanavir plasma concentrations. Only ritonavir -boosted atazanavir should used combination : Efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine decrease atazanavir significantly. Nevirapine and etravirine should not be coadministered to patients receiving atazanavir (with or without ritonavir). Efavirenz should not be coadministered with atazanavir in treatment -experienced patients but may be used in treatment- na\u00efve adults with atazanavir 400 mg plus ritonavir boosting. Absorption: Atazanavir absorption is dependent on low gastric pH and when a dministered with medications that alter gastric pH, special dosing information is indicated. No information is available in children when dosing atazanavir with medications that alter gastric pH. Guidelines for dosing atazanavir with antacids, H2 receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors in adults are as follows: Antacids : Antacids and buffered medications (including buffered didanosine formulations) decrease atazanavir concentrations if administered at the same time; atazanavir should be administered 2 hours before or 1 hour after these medications. H2-Receptor Antagonists (unboosted atazanavir in treatment- na\u00efve patients) : H2-receptor antagonists are expected to decrease atazanavir concentrations by interfering with absorption. Atazanavir 400 mg should be administered at least 2 hours before or at least 10 hours after a dose of the H2-receptor antagonist (no single dose should exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg and total daily dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg). H2-Receptor Antagonists (boosted atazanavir in treatment-na\u00efve or - experienced patients) : H2-receptor antagonists are expected to decrease atazanavir concentrations by interfering with absorption. Dose recommendations for H2- receptor antagonists are either a 40 -mg dose equivalent of famotidine twice daily (treatment -na\u00efve patients) or a 20 -mg dose equivalent of famotidine twice daily (treatment -experienced patients). Dose (ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg) should be administered simultaneously with and/or 10 hours after the dose of H2 -receptor antagonist. H2-Receptor Antagonists (boosted atazanavir with tenofovir) : In treatment -experienced patients, if tenofovir is used with H2-receptor antagonists, an increased dose of atazanavir should be given: 400 mg ATV + 100 mg RTV + 300 TDF. Proton -pump Inhibitors: Coadministration of with proton-pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and decrease therapeutic effect. Dose recommendations for therapy -na\u00efve patients are Atazanavir (ATV, Reyataz) August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 185 20-mg dose equivalent of omeprazole taken approximately 12 hours prior to boosted atazanavir (ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg). Coadministration of atazanavir with proton-pump inhibitors is not recommended in treatment- experienced patients. Major Toxicities: More common: Indirect hyperbilirubinemia that can result in jaundice or icterus but is not a marker of hepatic toxicity. Headache, fever, arthralgia, depression, insomnia, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and paresthesias. Less common: Prolongation of PR interval of electrocardiogram. Abnormalities in AV conduction generally limited to first- degree AV block, but with rare reports of second- degree AV block. Rash, generally mild to moderate, but in rare cases includes life -threatening Stevens -Johnson syndrome. Fat maldistribution and lipid abnormalities may be less common than with other PIs. However, the addition of ritonavir to atazanavir is associated with lipid abnormalities but to a lesser extent than with other boosted PIs. Rare: New onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, exacerbation of pre- existing diabetes mellitus, hemophiliacs, and elevation in serum transaminases. Nephrolithiasis. Hepatotoxicity (patients with hepatitis B or C are at increased risk). Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford Unive rsity HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/ATV.html ). Pediatric Experience: IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A is an ongoing Phase II int ernational trial of atazanavir with and without ritonavir in children 3 months to 19 years of age. In addition to capsules, a powder formulation of atazanavir is also under study. In this trial, atazanavir plasma concentration monitoring is used to guide therapy and establish optimum starting doses. Both ritonavir -boosted and - unboosted atazanavir regimens are used for treatment -na\u00efve and -experienced patients. In the trial, protocol- defined AUC, C min, and C max targets were deliberately set at levels higher than those achieved in the early adult atazanavir trials to compensate for the wide interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics values seen in adults in those trials; the pharmacokinetic targets were the same for atazanavir given with and without ritonav ir boosting. In IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A, dosing for each age cohort was targeted to achieve AUC 30 \u00b5g*hour/mL and C24 60 ng/mL. To date, the results of the IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A trial in children and adolescents indicate that in the absence of ritonavir boosting, atazanavir can achieve protocol -defined pharmacokinetic targets, but only when used at higher doses of atazanavir (on a mg -per-kg body weight or mg- per-meter 2 body surface area basis) than doses currently recommended in adults. In IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A, children >6 and <13 years of age required atazanavir dosing of 520 mg per meter2 of body surface area per day of atazanavir capsule formulation to achieve pharmacokinetic targets. For older adolescents, doses required were greater than the adult approved dose of 400 mg atazanavir given without ritonavir boosting once daily: adolescents age >13 years required ATV dosing of 620 mg per meter2 of body surface area per day [1-2]. In this study, the AUCs for the unboosted arms were similar in the ritonavir -boosted atazanavir groups but the C max was higher and C min lower for the unboosted arms. Median doses of atazanavir in m g/m2 both with and without ritonavir boosting from IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A are outlined in the following table. When dosing unboosted atazanavir in pediatric patients, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to ensure that adequate atazanavir plasma concent rations have been achieved. A minimum target trough concentration for atazanavir is 150ng/mL [3]. Higher target trough concentrations may be required in PI- experienced patients. Summary of Dosing Information Obtained from IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A [2] Age range (years) Was ATV given with RTV boosting? ATV median dose in mg/m2* ATV median dose in mg* 6-13 years No 509 475 6-13 years Yes 208 200 >13 years No 620 900 >13 years Yes 195 350 *Data satisfied protocol -defined AUC/pharmacokinetic parameters and met all acceptable safety targets. These doses differ from those recommended by the manufacturer. Therapeutic drug monitoring was used to determine patient -specific dosing in this trial. A summary of the efficacy results from IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A is included in the prescribing information: In 99 patients (6 years to >18 years of age) treated with either boosted or unboosted atazanavir, the overall proportions of antiretroviral- na\u00efve an d -experienced patients with HIV RNA <50 at Week 24 were 59% (24/41) and 24% (14/58), respectively. The median increase from baseline in absolute CD4 count at 20 weeks of therapy was 171 cells/mm 3 and 116 cells/mm3 in antiretroviral -August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 186 na\u00efve patient s and antiretroviral -experienced patients, respectively [4]. Overall, 11 of 129 (8.5%) patients enrolled had a bilirubin >5 times the upper limit of n ormal. Asymptomatic electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities were observed in a small number of patients: 1 patient had a Grade 3 QTC prolongation, 9 had Grade 2 PR or HR changes, and 3 had Grade 3 PR prolongations. No significant changes in serum cholesterol or triglycerides were observed during 48 weeks of therapy in 63 children receiving unboosted atazanavir in combination with 2 NRTIs [5]. In a small single site study, 23 pediatric patients (median age 16) on combination antiretroviral therapy were switched to a once - daily ritonavir -boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) -containing regimen for virologic failure (12) or for treatment simplification (11) [6]. Twenty of the patients had previously received protease inhibitor-based regimens with the median number of 2 atazanavir mutations. Patients received atazanavir doses lower than those currently recommended and many patients received concomitant therapy with tenofovir and/or didanosine; both drugs are known to have pharmacokinetic interactions with atazanavir. In this study, atazanavir plasma concentrations were measured at 12 -15 hours after dosing: 6 patients had undetectable levels at multiple time points, and considerable interpatient variability in plasma atazanavir concentrations was noted. Four of the 13 patients with previously undetectable viral loads experienced virologic failure and 6 of the 12 patients who previously had virologic failure achieved undetectable viral loads. This study provides further evidence of the large interpatient variability in atazanavir pharmacokinetics in children, the need for higher doses, and the potential benefit of therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure that adequate atazanavir concentrations are achieved.

Hepatotoxicity Diarrhea Nausea Headaches Possible increased bleeding in patients with hemophilia Hyperlipidemia, transaminase elevation, h yperglycemia Fat maldistribution Special Instructions Administer DRV with food, which increases AUC and Cmax by 30%. Drug exposure is not significantly altered by the number of calories and fat content of the meal. DRV contains a sulfa moiety. The pote ntial for cross sensitivity between DRV and other drugs in the sulfonamide class is unknown. Use DRV with caution in patients with known sulfonamide allergy. Pediatric dosing requires administration of multiple 75 -mg or 150- mg tablets to achieve the recomm ended doses of 375 mg or 450 mg depending on weight band. Pill burden may have a negative effect on adherence. Store at room temperature (25\u00baC or 77\u00baF). Metabolism CYP 3A4 inhibitor and substrate. Dosing patients with hepatic impairment : DRV is prim arily metabolized by the liver. There are no data for dosing adult patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment; caution should be used when administering DRV to such patients. DRV is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Dosing in patients with renal impairment : No dose adjustment is required in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 -60 mL/min). There are no pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe renal impairment or end -stage renal disease. Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Metabolism: Darunavir is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Ritonavir CYP3A4, thereby increasing the plasma concentration of darunavir . There is the potential for multiple drug interactions. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions.

Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/DRV.html ). Pediatric Experience: FDA approval for use in children 6 years of age and older was based upon a randomized, open- label, multicenter study that enrolled 80 treatment- experienced pediatric subjects age 6 -<18 years and weighing 20 kg. Patients were stratified according to their weight and received darunavir/ ritonavir plus background therapy consisting of at least 2 non- PI antiretroviral drugs [1]. This was a 2 -part Phase II trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and tolerance of darunavir /ritonavir in children. In Part I, a darunavir 9-15 mg/kg and ritonavir 1.5-2.5 mg/kg twice daily, the standard adult dose of darunavir /ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily, resulted in inadequate drug exposure in the pediatric population studied with AUC 24h of 81% and C 0h of 91% of the corresponding adult pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. A pediatric dose 20%-33% higher than the scaled adult dose was needed to achieve drug exposure similar to that found in adults and was the dose selected for Part II of the study. The higher dose used for the safety and efficacy evaluation was darunavir 11- 19 mg/kg and ritonavir 1.5-2.5 mg/kg 102% and 114% of the respective PK values in adults. Patients were stratified by body weight: 20 to <30 kg and 30 to <40 kg. Doses were all given twice daily and were adjusted when pati ents changed weight categories. After the 2- week PK evaluation all patients were allowed to switch to ritonavir 100-mg capsules if desired to avoid the use of liquid oral ritonavir . Based on the findings in the safety and efficacy portion of the study, we ight band doses of darunavir/ ritonavir were as follows: 375/50 mg twice daily for body weight 20 to <30kg, 450/60 mg twice daily for 30 to <40 kg, and 600/100 mg twice daily for 40 kg. Note that 27 of the 80 participants in this portion of the study switc hed from the ritonavir liquid formulation to ritonavir 100-mg capsules. The 80 subjects had a median age of 14 (range 6 to <18 years), 71% were male, 54% white, 30% black, 9% Hispanic, and 8% other. The mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.64 log 10 copies/mL, and the median baseline CD4 cell count was 330 cells/mm3 (range: 6 -1,505 cells/mm3). Overall, 38% of pediatric subjects had baseline plasma HIV RNA 100,000 copies/mL, 79% had previous use of at least 1 NNRTI, and 96% had previously used at least 1 PI. The subjects had a median of 11 PI mutations. Only 6% of subjects discontinued the study before Week 48 (only 1 for an adverse event). The proportion of pediatric subjects with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 59% and 48%, respectively. The mean CD4 cell count increase from baseline was 110 cells/mm 3. Although darunavir is approved for once-daily dosing in antiretroviral-na\u00efve adults, it should not be used once daily in children because of more rapid clearance and absence of pediatric data.

Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Fosamprenavir has the potential for multiple drug interaction s. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions . Major Toxicities: More common: Vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, perioral paresthesias, headache, rash, and lipid abnormalities. Less common (more severe): Life -threatening rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, in <1% neutropenia, and diabetes mellitus, The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/page s/GRIP/APV_FPV.html ). Pediatric Experience: In June 2007, fosamprenavir suspension was approved for use in pediatric patients. The approval was based on two open label studies in pediatric patients 2-18 years of age [1-2]. Both studies enrolled treatment -experienced and treatment -na\u00efve subjects. In one study, twice-daily dosing regimens (with or without ritonavir) were evaluated in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Overall, fosamprenavir was well tolerated and effective in suppressing viral load and increasing CD4 cell count. In one trial, after 24 weeks 67% of PI -na\u00efve subjects in the fosamprenavir group (age 2-5 years only) and 70% of PI -na\u00efve subjects in the fosamprenavir/ ritonavir group (age 5-18 years) but only 57% of PI -experienced subjects in the fosamprenavir/ ritonavir group (age 5- 18 years) achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/ mL. Median increases in CD4 percent at Week 24 occurred in all groups and ranged from 4% to 8% [2]. In a second trial, once- daily fosamprenavir/ ritonavir was studied. Following information about suboptimal response to once-daily dosing in treatment- experienced adults, pediatric patients were allowed to switch to twice -daily therapy; however, few patients (10 of 69) opted to switch t o twice -daily therapy (median time to switch: 45 weeks). At 24 and 48 weeks of therapy, HIV RNA was <400 copies/mL in 66% and 47% among and 57% and 43% among PI- experienced subjects, respectively. Median increase in CD4 percent at Week 48 was 10% for PI-na\u00efve and 5% for PI- experienced subjects [1]. These data were insufficient to support a once-daily dosing regimen of ritonavir -boosted fosamprenavir in children and hence once -daily dosing is not recommended for pediatric patients. Toxicities from these trials included vomiting (3% -7%), diarrhea (3%-4%), and nausea (3%-4%). A trial of pediatric patients taking the parent compound ( amprenavir) demonstrated that the drug was relatively well tolerated with mild -to-moderate toxicity related mainly to the gastrointestinal system [3].

When given in combination with RTV, meal restrictions are no longer necessary. Adequate hydration is required to minimize risk of nephrolithiasis (48 oz of fluid daily in adult patients). If coadministered with didanosine (ddI), give 1 hour apart on an empty stomach. Capsules are sensitive to moisture; store at room temperature (59 - 86\u00baF) in with desiccant. Meta bolism Cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor and substrate. be used in patients with mild- to-moderate hepatic impairment (recommended dose for adults is 600 mg IDV every 8 hours). No dosing information is available for children with any d egree of hepatic impairment or for adults with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adul ts and Adolescents .): Metabolism : Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism. There is potential for multiple drug interactions. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for pote ntial drug interactions. Major Toxicities: More common: Nausea, abdominal pain, headache, metallic taste, dizziness, asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia (10%), lipid abnormalities, pruritis, and rash. Nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis with indinavir crystal deposits: cumulative frequency is higher in children (29%) than in adults (12.4%). Less common (more severe): Fat redistribution. Rare: New onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, exacerbation of pre- existing diabetes mellitus, spontaneous bleeding in hemophiliacs, acute hemolytic anemia, and hepatitis (life -threatening in rare cases). Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/IDV.html ). Pediatric Experience: Indinavir has not been approved by the FDA for use in the pediatric population. It has been studied in HIV-infected children as monotherapy and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs in dosage ranges of 300-600 mg per August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 193 meter2 of body surface area given every 8 hours [1-16]. Data in children indicate that a pediatric dose of 500- 600 mg indinavir per meter2 of body surface area given every 8 hours results in peak blood concentrations similar to those in adults; however, a significant proportion of children had trough indinavir concentrations less than the 0.1 mg/L value associated with efficacy in adults [3, 10] . Ritonavir -boosted indinavir has also been studied in children. One study evaluated 500 mg indinavir per meter2 of body surface area plus 100 mg ritonavir per meter2 of body surface area twice daily in 4 children 1 -10 years of age; in 1 child, this resulted in high concentrations of both drugs and was accompanied by symptoms of renal toxicity [11]. Another study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of 400 mg indinavir per meter2 of body surface area plus 125 mg ritonavir per meter2 of body surface area twice daily in 14 children; this dosing resulted in AUC and trough concentrations similar to those observed with standard dos es of indin avir / ritonavir in adults (800 mg indinavir /100 mg ritonavir twice daily), although the peak concentration was slightly decreased [1]. Clinical results from that trial demonstrated that virologic efficacy was good but that 4 of 21 patients developed nephrolithiasis and the overall rate of side effects and intolerance to the regimen was high [5]. In a study from Thailand a lower dose of indinavir (median 234 mg per meter2) with low dose ritonavir resulted in low trough levels of indinavir in 2 of 12 children [17]. In a study of 21 children receiving PI- containing antiretroviral therapy, all patients receiving indinavir experienced substantial incre ases in their triglyceride concentrations but no significant increases in total cholesterol occurred; blood glucose concentrations were not significantly different between baseline and follow-up evaluations [18]. In a study of 25 children toxicities observed with indinavir included flank pain and headache (16%), renal dysfunction (16%), hematuria (12%), and skin rash (12%) [10]. The cumulative frequency of nephrolithiasis is substantially higher in children (29%) than in adults (12.4%, range across clinical trials 4.7% -34.4%) [19]. This is likely due to the difficulty in maintain ing adequate hydration in children. In a study of indinavir in 54 children, 13% developed hematuria [9] Children treated with indinavir also have a high cumulative incidence of sterile leukocyturia, which may be accompanied by elevations in serum creatinine in the absence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis [13]. A large analysis of more than 2,000 HIV-infected children from PACTG 219 demonstrated a hazard ratio of 1.7 for the risk of renal dysfunction among children receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with indinavir [20].

Should not be used in preterm infants in the immediate postnatal period. Infants 14 days to 6 months: Once-daily dosing is not recommended. The recommended dose of the oral solution is 300 mg/75 mg LPV/r per m 2 of body surface area or 16 mg/4 mg LPV/r per kg of body weight twice daily. Do not administer LPV/r of age. Use of 300 mg/75 mg LPV/r per m 2 of body surface ar ea in infants <6 months of age is associated with lower LPV trough levels than those found in adults; infants should be evaluated and LPV dosing adjusted for growth at frequent intervals (see discussion). Pediatric dose (>6 months to 18 years): For individuals not NVP , FPV, or NFV: Once-daily dosing surface area dosing : 230 mg/57.5 mg LPV/r/m 2 of body surface area per dose twice daily Weight -based dosing: <15 kg: 12 mg/3 mg LPV/r/kg body weight per dose twice daily >15 kg to 40 kg: 10 mg/2.5 mg LPV/r/kg body weight per dose twice daily >40 kg: 400 mg/100 mg LPV/r per dose twice daily *Oral solution is avai lable for children age 6 months to 18 years with a Dosing for 100 mg/25 mg LPV/r Pediatric Tablets for Children/Adolescents Without Concomitant EFV, NVP, FPV, or NFV.

LPV/r tablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush or split tablets. LPV/r oral solution should be administered with food. A high fat meal increases absorption, especially of the liquid preparation, which may enhance effectiveness by increasing drug exposure. If coadministered with didanosine (ddI), ddI should be given 1 hour before or 2 hours after LPV/r. LPV/r oral solution can be kept at room temperature up to 77\u00baF (25\u00baC) if used within 2 months. If kept refrigerated (2\u00ba to 8\u00baC or 36\u00ba to 46\u00baF) LPV/r oral solution remains stable until the expiration date printed on the label. LPV resistance -associated substitutions: LPV/r can be administered once daily (800 mg/200 mg) in adults with fewer than 3 LPV resistance-associated substitutions. Once- daily administration of LPV/r is not recommended for adult patients with 3 or more of the following LPV/r in patients with hepatic impairment : LPV/r is primarily metabolized by the liver. Caution should be used when administering LPV to patients with hepatic impairment. No dosing information is August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 196 body surface area <0.6 m2 or those who are unable to reliably swallow a tablet; dosing should be calculated based on body surface area or weight as above. currently available for children or adults with hepatic insufficiency. In the coformulation of LPV/r, the RTV acts as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, not as an antiretroviral agent. It does this by inhibiting the metabolism of LPV and increasing LPV plasma concentrations. Dosing Recommendations for Coadministration with Other Antiretroviral Drugs Pediatric dose (>6 months to 18 years) : For individuals receiving concomitant NVP, EFV, FPV, or NFV. (These drugs induce reduce LPV plasma levels; increased LPV/r dosing is required with concomitant administration of these drugs and/or in treatment- experienced patients in whom reduced susceptibility to LPV is suspected [such as those with prior treatment with other PIs].) Once-daily dosing is not recommended. Body surface area dosing : 300 mg/75 mg LPV/r/m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily Weight -based dosing : <15 kg: 13 mg /3.25 mg LPV/r per kg body weight per dose twice daily >15 kg to 45 kg: 11 mg/2.75 mg LPV/r per kg body weight per dose twice daily >45 kg: Use adult dose twice daily. *Oral solution is available for children age 6 months to 18 years with a body surface area <0.6 m2 or those who are unable to reliably swallow a tablet; dosing should be calculated based on body surface area or weight as above. **The higher dose may be considered in treatment -experienced patients where decreased sensitivity to LPV is suspected due to clinical history or documented by resistance testing. Use of 230 mg/57.5 mg LPV/r per m 2 of body surface area (when not coadministered with NVP, EFV, FPV, or NFV) or use of 300 mg/75 mg LPV/r per m 2 of body surface area in children (when coadministered with NVP, EFV, FPV, or NFV) is associated with LPV levels similar to AUC achieved with stan dard doses in adults, but it is associated with lower trough levels in children than in adults. Therefore, some clinicians may choose to initiate therapy with higher doses of LPV/r when coadministered with these drugs or in PI -experienced pediatric patient s who may have reduced PI Dosing for 100 mg/25 mg LPV/r Pediatric Tablets for Children With Concomitant EFV, NVP, FPV , or NFV Body Weight (kg) Body Area (meter2)* Recommended Number of 100 mg/25 mg LPV/r Tablets Given Twice Daily 15 to 20 kg >0.6 to <0.8 m2 2 >20 to 30 kg >0.8 to <1.2 m2 3 >30 to 45 kg >1.2 to <1.7 m2 4 (or two 200 mg/50 mg LPV/r tablets) >45 kg >1.7 m2 4 or 6 (or two or three 200 mg/50 mg LPV/r adult tablets)** Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r, Kaletra) August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 197 susceptibility (see discussion). Adult (>18 years) dose : In patients with fewer than 3 LPV -associated mutations (see Special Instructions for list): 800 mg/200 mg LPV/r once daily; or 400 mg/100 mg LPV/r twice daily. Do not use once -daily dosing in children or adolescents. Once- daily dosing should not be used in patients receiving concomitant therapy with EFV, NVP, FPV, or NFV. In patients with 3 or more LPV-associated mutations(see Special Instructions for list): 400 mg/100 mg LPV/r twice daily In patients receiving concomitant NVP, EFV, FPV, or NFV): FDA -approved dose is 500 mg/125 mg LPV/r twice daily, given as a combination of 2 tablets of 200/50 mg LPV/r and 1 tablet of 100 mg/25 mg LPV/r. Most Panel members would use 600 mg/150 mg LPV/r for ease of dosing. Once-daily dosing should not be used. LPV/r in combination with saquinavir (SQV) hard gel capsules (Invirase ) or in combination with maraviroc (MVC) : SQV and MVC doses may need modification. See sections on SQV or MVC . Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adoles cents .): Metabolism : Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism. There is potential for multiple drug interactions. Before administration, the patient' s medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Fluticasone, a commonly used inhaled steroid, should not be used in patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir . Major Toxicities: More common: Diarrhea, headache, asthenia, nausea and vomiting, and rash in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir with other antiretroviral drugs; hyperlipidemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia. Less bleeding in hemophiliacs, pancreatitis, elevation in serum transaminases, and hepatitis (life threatening in rare cases). Possible increased bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia. PR interval prolongation. QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes may occur. Lopinavir/ritonavir should not be used in the immediate postnatal period in premature infants because life-threatening bradyarrhthymias and cardiac dysfunction have been described with its use in such infants [1-2]. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/LPV.html ). Pediatric Experience: Lopinavir/ritonavir has been studied in in combination with NRTIs and NNRTIs [3-16]. Ritonavir acts as a pharmacokinetic enhancer by inhibiting the metabolism of lopinavir and therefore increasing the plasma concentration of lopinavir. Abbott Laboratories Study M98-940 was a Phase I/II open label study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, safety, and efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution and either 2 NRTIs or nevirapine plus up to 2 NRTIs in 100 pediatric patients. Through 48 weeks of therapy, the proportion of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL was 37 of 44 (84%) for antiretroviral-Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r, Kaletra) August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 198 na\u00efve patients and 42 of 56 (75%) for antiretroviral- experienced patients. The mean increase from baseline i n CD4 cell count was 404 cells/mm3 for antiretroviral -na\u00efve and 284 cells/mm3 for antiretroviral -experienced patients. In patients with HIV RNA >400 copies/mL at 24 or 48 weeks, there were no detectable changes in susceptibility to lopinavir compared with baseline isolates, although there were resistance mutations to NRTIs and NNRTIs in the rebound isolates [17]. There is some controversy about the dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir in children. Children have lower drug exposure than adults when treated with doses that are directly scaled for body surface area. The \"dir ectly scaled\" dose approximation of the adult dose in children is calculated by dividing the adult dose by the usual adult body surface area of 1.73 m2. For the adult dose of 400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir, the appropriate pediatric dose would be approximately 230/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per meter2. However, younger children have enhanced lopinavir clearance and need higher drug doses to achieve drug exposures similar to those in adults treated with standard doses. To achieve similar C trough to that observed in adults, the pediatric dose needs to be increased 30% over the directly body surface area- scaled dose. For 12 children age 6 months to 12 years receiving 230 mg/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m 2 of body surface area per dose twice daily (without nevirapine), the mean C trough was 4.74 \u00b1 2.93 mcg/mL (about 67% of the adult value of 7.1 \u00b1 2.9 mcg/mL) [4]. For 15 children age 6 months to 12 years treated with 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2 of body surf ace area per dose twice daily (without nevirapine), the mean C trough was 7.91 \u00b1 4.52 mcg/mL, similar to that in adults treated with 400 mg/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily [4]. Therefore, some clinicians may choose to initiate therapy in children age 6 months to 12 years using 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily (when given without nevirapine, efavirenz, fosamprenavir, or nelfinavir) rather mended 230 mg/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily [12]. The pharmacokinetics of the oral solution at approximately 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m 2 of body surface area per dose twice daily was evaluated in infants younger than 6 weeks of age [18] and infants 6 weeks to 6 months of age [14]. Pharmacokinetic values found in these studies are compared to those in older children [4] and adults [17] in the table below. Values are means; all data shown performed in the absence of NNRTIs. Adults [17] Children [4] Children [4] mo [14] Infants <6 weeks [18] N 19 12 15 18 9 Dose LPV 400 mg 230 mg/m2 300 mg/m2 12.5 9.4 Ctrough mcg/ml 7.1 4.7 7.9 2.7 2.5 Cmin mcg/ml 5.5 3.4 6.5 2.0 1.4 Even at this higher dose, predose (C trough) levels were lower in infants than in children >6 months of age and were lower in the youngest infants at age <6 weeks compared with those between 6 weeks and 6 months. Predose (C trough) leve ls were highly variable, and lower values (median 1.37 mcg/mL; range 0.13-5.98) were found in infants without viral suppression at 16 weeks compared with the higher predose (C trough) values (median 2.28 mcg/mL; range 0.49-8.01) found in those infants with virologic suppression at 16 weeks (N = 17; p = 0.37) [14]. Because infants gain weight rapidly in the first months of life, one important way to optimize lopinavir dosing is to weigh the patient and adjust the dose for growth at frequent intervals. Some practitioners anticipate rapid infant growth and prescribe doses somewhat higher than the 300 mg/m2 body surface area dose to let the infant \"grow into\" the 300 mg/m2 body surface area amount. For children, as in adults, the lopinavir C trough is further reduced by concurrent treatment with NNRTIs or concomitant fosamprenavir or nelfinavir and, as in adults, higher doses of lopinavir are recommended if the drug is given in combination with nevirapine, efavirenz, fosamp renavir, or nelfinavir. In 14 children treated with 230 mg/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily plus nevirapine, the mean lopinavir C trough was 3.77 \u00b1 3.57 mcg/mL [4]. For 12 children treated with 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily, the mean C trough was 5.62 \u00b1 3.32 mcg/mL. Not only are these trough plasma concentrations lower than those found in adults treated with standard doses of lopinavir/ritonavir, but the variability in concentration is much higher in children than adults [4, 12] . In a study of 15 children with HIV infection treated with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir using an increased dose of 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m 2 of body surface area per dose twice daily plus efavirenz 14 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, the median 12-hour lopinavir trough was 5.7 mcg/mL, but there was 34-fold interindividual variation in lopinavir trough concentrations, and 5 of 15 (33%) children had lopinavir 12-hour trough concentrations <1.0 mcg/mL, the plasma concentration needed to inhibit wild- type HIV [5]. A pharmacokinetic study in 20 chi ldren 10 to 16 years of age treated with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir 300 mg/75 August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 199 mg per m2 of body surface area twice daily plus efavirenz 350 mg/m2 of body surface area once daily showed adequacy of the lopinavir trough values [19]. Lopinavir/ritonavir 800 mg/200 mg once daily is FDA approved for treatment of HIV infection in therapy- na\u00efve adults >18 years of age. However, once-daily administration cannot be recommended for use in children in the absence of therapeutic drug monitoring because of high interindividual variability in drug exposure and trough plasma concentrations below the therapeuti c range for wild -type virus in 21/59 (35.6%) of patients [20-23]. Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to be effective as salvage therapy in children with HIV and severe immune suppression [7, 24], although patients with greater prior exposure to antiretrovirals may have slower reductions in virus load to undetectable concentrations [10, 24] and less robust response in CD4 percentage [25]. Twice -daily doses of lopinavir used in this cohort were 230-300 mg/m2 of body surface area in 39% of patients, 300-400 mg/m2 of body surface area in 35%, and >400 mg/m2 of body surface area per dose in 4% [25]. More important than viral resistance to lopinavir is the relationship of the drug exposure (trough plasma concentration measured just prior to a dose, or C trough) to the susceptibility of the HIV -1 isolate (EC 50). The ratio of C trough to EC 50 is called the inhibitory quotient, and in both adults and children treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, virus load reduction is more closely associated with inhibitory quotient than with either the C trough or EC 50 alone [3, 26- 28]. A study of the practical application of the inhibitory quotient to guide therapy using higher doses of lopinavir/ritonavir in children and adolescents showed the safety and tolerability of doses of 400 mg/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily (without nevirapine or efavirenz) and 480 mg/120 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily (with nevirapine or efavirenz) [16]. A modeling study suggests the potential utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in children previously treated with protease inhibitors and now on salvage therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir [29].

Tablets : 250 mg and 625 mg Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Neonatal/Infant dose Not approved for use in neonates/infants. : Pediatric dose (2 -13 years) 45-55 mg/kg twice daily or 25-35 mg/kg three times daily : Adolescent/Adult dose : 1,250 mg (five 250-mg tablets or two 625- mg tablets) twice daily or 750 mg (three 250- mg tablets) three times daily (Some adolescents require higher doses than adults to achieve equivalent drug exposures. Consider using therapeutic drug monitoring to guide appropriate dosing.) Diarrhea Hyperlipidemia Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increase in bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Serum transaminase elevations Special Instructions Administer with meal or light snack. If coadministered with didanosine (ddI), administer NFV 2 hours before or 1 hour after ddI. Powder for oral suspension may be mixed with water, milk, pudding, ice cream, or formula; mixture is stable for up to 6 hours. Do not mix with any acidic food or juice because of resulting poor taste. Do not add water to bottles of oral powder; a special scoop is provided with oral powder for measuring purposes. Patients unable to swallow the tablets can dissolve the tablets in a small amount of water. Once dissolved, patients should mix the cloudy mixture well and consume it immediately. The glass should be rinsed with water and the rinse swallowed to ensure that the entire dose is consumed. Tablets can also be crushed and administered with pudding. Metabolism CYP2C19 and 3A4 substrate. Metabolized to active M8 metabolite. CYP3A inhibitor. Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Metabolism: Nelfinavir is metabolized in part by CYP3A4 and is a substrate for CYP2C19 and 3A4. However, ritonavir boosting does not significantly increase nelfinavir concentrations and coadministration is not recommended. There is potential for multiple drug interactions. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities: More common: Diarrhea (most common). Asthenia, abdominal pain, rash, and lipid abnormalities. Less common (more severe): Exacerbation of chronic liver disease, fat redistribution. Rare: New onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, exacerbation of pre- existing diabetes mellitus, spontaneous bleeding in hemophiliacs, and elevations in transaminases. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resis tance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/NFV.html ). Pediatric Experience: Nelfinavir has been extensively studied in HIV- infected children in combination with other antiretroviral drugs [1-23]. In children 2- 13 years of age receiving nelfinavir as part of triple antiretroviral therapy in randomized trials, the August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 202 proportion of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL through 48 weeks of therapy has been quite variable, ranging from 26% to 69%. Virologic and immunologic response to nelfinavir- based therapy has varied by prior antiretroviral treatment, the number of drugs included in the combination regimen, patient age, and dose used in the study. Highly variable drug exposure remains a significant problem with the use of nelfinavir in pediatric patients. Unpredictable drug exposure may be exacerbated in pediatric patients because of increased clearance compared with adults and difficulties with adherence to adequate food intake with dosing. In earlier studies, lower doses were used (20-30 mg/kg body weight per dose three times daily) than are currently recommended (45 -55 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily), accounting for some of the lower response rates. The relatively poor ability of nelfinavir to control plasma viremia in infants and children may be related in part to its reduced potency compared with other PIs or NNRTIs, as shown by studies in adults and adolescents [23-24]. Poor outcome with nelfinavir in children may be related in part to lack of palatability of the powder formulation and pharmacokinetic differences in infants, children, and adolescents compared with adults [6]. The consistency of food or formula is altered by the addition of pediatric nelfinavir powder, making the drug/admixture unpalatable to some children. These children may prefer the bitterness of the crushed tablets to the sandy consistency of food or formula containing nelfinavir powder. In the PENTA-7 trial, 7 of 20 (35%) infants who started therapy with the nelfinavir powder were switched to crushed tablets because of the difficulty of administering the powder to infants [1]. Analysis of data from PACTG 377 and PACTG 366 showed that CYP2C19 genotypes altered nelfinavir pharmacokinetics and the virologic responses to combination therapy in HIV-1- infected children. These findings suggest that CYP2C19 genotypes are important determinants of nelfinavir pharmacokinetics and virologic response in HIV-1- infected children [25]. Better control of plasma viremia has been observed in antire troviral -na\u00efve 16] . In treatment -experienced patients, better response rates have been seen with 4 -drug regimens that have included 2 NRTIs plus an 21] . When lopinavir/ritonavir was compared with nelfinavir for salvage therapy in 35 treatment -experienced patients after 18 months, 50% of children receiving lopinavir/ritonavir had HIV RNA concentrations <400 copies/mL, compared with <20% of children receiving nelfinavir [18]. Antiviral response in children <2 years of age is significantly less than in older children [16, 19, 26] . Improved virologic responses may be seen with nelfinavir-based therapy when it is used as part of a four-drug regimen in children <2 years of age [14]. Infants have even lower drug exposures and higher variability in plasma concentrations than children <25 kg; the presence of lower peak drug concentrations and higher apparent oral clearance suggests that both poor absorption and more rapid metabolism may be contributing factors [3, 15] . Even with doses of 150 mg/kg/day (given 2-3 times daily), 16.7% of children had peak concentrations and 27.8% of children had 24-hour AUC that were below the 10th percentile of adult values [13]. Although it is suggested that dosing in infants might improve if a mg/m2 of body surface area dosing regimen were used [2-3], such dosing is not recommended at this time. A population pharmacokinetic study predicts three-times daily dosing may be superior to twice -daily dosing in infants <2 months of age [27]. This mode l requires confirmation in infants. Determining an appropriate and effective dose of nelfinavir in children is complicated by highly variable drug pharmacokinetics. In children 2-12 years of age, administration of a nelfinavir 30 mg/kg/dose three times da ily achieves lower drug exposure than administration of a 55 mg/kg/dose twice daily, and this difference is most marked in children weighing <25 kg [20]. Children <25 kg may have less than half the drug exposure than children >25 kg when comparable body weight- adjusted doses are used [7]. The variability of drug exposure at any given dose is much higher for children than adults [9], which has been attributed at least in part to differences in the diet between children and adults. Two population pharmacokinetic studies of nelfinavir and its active metabolite, M8, describe the large intersubject variability observed in children [27-28]. Studies in adults and children have demonstrated an increased risk of virologic failure associated with low nelfinavir drug exposure, particularly with a nelfinavir C min <1.0 mcg/mL [29-31]. In a study of 32 children treated with nelfinavir 90 mg/kg/day divided into 2 or 3 doses a day, 80% of those with morning trough nelfinavir plasma concentration >0.8 mcg/mL had Week 48 HIV RNA concentrations <50 copie s/mL, compared with only 29% of those with morning trough <0.8 mcg/mL [32]. It is of note that the median age of the group with C trough <0.8 mcg/mL was 3.8 years, while the median age of the group with Ctrough >0.8 mcg/mL was 8.3 years [32]. Therapeutic drug monitoring of nelfinavir plasma concentrations, with appropriate adjustments for low drug exposure, results in improved outcome in adults treated with nelfinavir [29, 33] . Given the higher variability of nelfinavir plasma concentrations in infants and children, the benefits of therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment might be even greater for children. A response rate of 78% was found in a recent pediatric study in which concentrations of nelfinavir and M8 were reported to treating physicians, suggesting a benefit of pharmacokinetic August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 203 monitoring in children [28]. In PACTG 382, among 50 children 3-16 years of age receiving both efavirenz and nelfinavir, better virologic outcomes (HIV RNA <400 copies/mL) occurred in those patients when nelfinavir AUC 8h was greater than the first quartile (>10 mg*h/L) when compared with those below the first quartile: 89% versus 42%, respectively [5]. Better virologic responses were obtained when doses were adjusted to achieve target AUC values, an approach that requires therapeutic drug monitoring. References 1.

August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 205 Ritonavir (RTV, Norvir) For a dditional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/ Oral solution (contains 43% alcohol by volume): 80 mg/mL Capsules : 100 mg Tablets : 100 mg Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events RTV as a pharmacokinetic enhancer : The major use of RTV is as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of other PIs. The dose of RTV recommended var ies with the different PIs. See dosing information for specific PIs. In the unusual situation when RTV is prescribed as sole PI : See manufacturer guidelines. GI intolerance, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Paresthesias \u2014circumoral and extremities Hyperlipidemia , especially hypertriglyceridemia Hepatitis Asthenia Taste perversion Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increased bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Special Instructions Administer with food to increase absorption and help decrease gastrointestinal side effects. If RTV is prescribed with didanosine (ddI), administer drugs 2 hours apart. Refrigerate capsules only if the capsules will not be used within 30 days or cannot be stored below 77o F (25o C). Tablets are heat stable. Store ora l solution at room temperature 68-77\u00b0F (20-25\u00b0C). Do not refrigerate. Shake well before use. Oral solution has limited shelf life; use within 6 months. To increase tolerance of oral solution in children, try the following: Mix solution with milk, chocolate milk, or vanilla or chocolate pudding or ice cream. Before administration, give the child ice chips, popsicles, or spoonfuls of partially frozen orange or grape juice concentrate to dull the taste buds or peanut butter to coat the mouth. After administr ation, give the child strong-tasting foods such as maple syrup, cheese, or highly flavored chewing gum. Metabolism CYP3A4 and with hepatic impairment : RTV is primarily metabolized by the liver. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data for dosing adult or pediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment. Use caution when administering RTV to patients with moderate- to-severe hepatic impairment. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 206 Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Metabolism : Ritonavir i s extensively metabolized by and is one of the most potent inhibitors of hepatic cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). There is potential for multiple drug interactions. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions and overlapping toxicities. Avoid concomitant use of intranasal/inhaled fluticasone. Resistance: When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, resistance to ritonavir is not clinically relevant. Major Toxicities: More common: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, anorexia, circumoral paresthesias, lipid abnormalities. Less common (more severe): Exacerbation of chronic liver disease, fat mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacid in hemophiliacs, pancreatitis, and hepatitis (life-threatening in rare cases). Allergic reactions, including bronchospasm, urticaria, and angioedema. Pediatric Experience: Ritonavi r is typically used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of other PIs in children. Ritonavir acts by inhibiting the metabolism of the other PI, therefore increasing the plasma concentration of the second PI. Lopinavir/ritonavi r, a PI coformulation, has been well studied in children and is the preferred PI for initial therapy in children (see Lopinavir/Ritonavir ). Pediatric dosing regimens including boosted fosamprenavir, tipranavir, darunavir, and atazanavir are now available (see individual PIs for more specific information). Although ritonavir has been well studied, its use in children as a sole PI for initial therapy is recommended only under cert ain rare circumstances. Ritonavir is associated with a higher inciden ce of gastrointestinal toxicity and has a greater potential for drug-drug interactions than other PIs. Additionally, poor palatability of the liquid preparation and large pill burden with the capsules (adult dose is six capsules twice daily) limit its use as a sole PI. Concentrations are highly variable in children younger than 2 years of age, and doses of 350-450 mg/m 2 twice a day may not be sufficient for long-term suppression of viral replication in this age group [1-12]. Full-dose ritonavir has been shown to prolong the PR interval in a study of healthy adults who were given ritonavir at 400 mg twice daily [13]. There have been reports of potentially life threatening arrhythmias in premature newborn infants treated wi th lopinavir/ritonavir and thus it should not be used in this group of patients [14-15]. The impact on the PR interval of coadministration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (e.g., macrolides, quinolones, methadone) is not known, and coadministration should be undertaken with caution. In addition, patients with underlying structural heart disease, conduction system abnormalities, ischemic heart disease, or cardiomyopathy may be at increased ri sk of developing cardiac conduction abnormalities, and ritonavir should be used with caution in these patients.

SQV should only be used in combination with RTV or LPV/r (never unboosted). Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Metabolism: Saquinavir is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) system in the liver, and there is potential for numerous drug interactions. Before adminis tration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities: More common: Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, headache, nausea, paresthesias, skin rash, and lipid abnormalities. Less common (more se vere): Exacerbation of chronic liver disease, f at maldistribution. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 209 Rare: New onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, diabetes mellitus, hemophiliacs, pancreatitis, and elevation in serum transaminases. The combination of saquinavir and ritonavir could lead to prolonged PR and/or QT intervals with potential for heart block and torsades de pointes. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/SQV.html ). Pediatric Experience: Saquinavir has been studied with NRTIs and other PIs in HIV- infected children [1-6]. Initial studies suggested that saquinavir could not be used without boosting by ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir. A pharmacokinetic analysis of 5 children younger than 2 years of age and 13 children between the ages of 2 and 5 years using a dose of 50 mg/kg twice daily with boosting ritonavir revealed that drug exposure was lower in children <2 years whereas drug exposure was adequate in those 2 to 5 years of age [7]. For this reason, saquinavir should not be given to children younger than 2 years old until an appropriate dose is identified. In children > 2 years of age, a dose of 50mg/kg twice daily (maximum dose = 1,000 mg) boosted with ritonavir 3 mg/kg twice daily (patients weighing 5 to <15 kg) or 2.5 mg/kg twice daily (patients weighing 15 to 40 kg) resulted in AUC and C trough values similar to those in older children [8-9] and adults. Because there is no pediatric formulation, in one study saquinavir was formulated by breaking open the 200-mg hard gel capsules and mixing capsule contents with sugar syrup, jam, or baby formula. Sorbitol syrup was used for patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance [7]. Both saquinavir/ritonavir and saquinavir/lopinavir/ritonavir regimens are promising in the salvage therapy se tting [1, 3 -6, 8-10]. In a study evaluating the addition of saquinavir (750 mg/m2 of body surface area every 12 hours, maximum dose 1,600 mg) to a regimen containing lopinavir/ritonavir dosed at 400/100 mg/m2 twice daily (for patients not concurrently taking an NNRTI) or lopinavir/ritonavir 480/120 mg/m2 twice daily for patients concurrently administered an NNRTI, 18 subjects (median age 14.2 years, range 7.7-17.6) were enrolled. The addition of saquinavir at these doses was well tolerated and did not appear to alter lopinavir pharmacokinetics. Saquinavir dosing was adjusted in 4 subjects (decreased in 3, increased in 1) [10]. In a study of 50 Thai children, saquinavir/lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated as second -line therapy based on extensive NRTI resistance. In this group, saquinavir was dosed at 50 mg/m 2 and lopinavir/ritonavir was dosed at 230/57.5 mg/m2, all twice daily. After 96 weeks of treatment, 74% of the children achieved an undetectable plasma RNA load at <50 copies/ml. Therapeutic drug monitoring was used to establish adequate C min values and to aid with alterations in drug dosage based upon toxicity. Most C min values for saquinavir were above the desired trough value of 0.1 mg/l. The average C min throughout 96 weeks for saquinavir was 1.37 mg/l, and when saquinavir doses were adjusted, most were decreased by an average of 21% (8mg/kg). Median total cholesterol and HDL values increased significantly through 96 weeks from 144 to 196 mg/dl and from 44 to 57 mg/dl, respectively [8-9]. References 1.

Pediatric dose (2 -18 years) : Body surface area dosing: TPV 375 mg/m2 + RTV 150 mg/m2, both twice daily Maximum dose : TPV 500 mg + RTV 200 mg, both twice daily Weight-based dosing: TPV 14 mg/kg + RTV 6 mg/kg, both twice daily Maximum dose : TPV 500 mg + RTV 200 mg, both twice daily Adult dose : TPV 500 mg (two 250- mg capsules) + RTV 200 mg, both twice daily Intracranial hemorrhage (rare) Skin rash Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Hepatotoxicity Hyperlipidemia Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increased bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Special Instructions TPV can be taken with or without food; however, it is recommended that RTV be taken with food. Therefore, the combination may be better tolerated if taken with a meal or snack. The oral solution contains 116 IU of vitamin E per mL, which is significantly higher than the reference daily intake for vitamin E. Patients taking the oral solution should not take any supplemental vitamin E greater than a standard multivitamin. TPV contains a sulfonamide component. The potential for cross sensitivity between TPV and other drugs in the sulfonamide class is unknown. TPV should be used with caution in patients with sulfonamide allergy. Store oral solution at room temperat ure (77o F); do not refrigerate or freeze. Oral solution must be used within 60 days after first opening bottle. Capsules can be kept at room temperature (up to 77oF or 25oC) if used within 2 months. Refrigerate capsules if longer storage or warmer room temperatures anticipated. Use TPV with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery, or other medical conditions or who are receiving medications known to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agents, anticoa gulants, or high doses of supplemental vitamin E. Metabolism Cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 substrate. Renal impairment : No adjustment required. Liver impairment : No adjustment required for mild impairment; use contraindicated for moderate- to-severe impairmen t. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 212 Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Tipranavir should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery, or other medical conditions or who are receiving medications known to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, or high doses of supplemental vitamin E. Major Toxicities: More common: Diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, rash (more frequent in children than in adults), and vomiting. Laboratory abnormalities are elevated transaminases, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Less common (more severe): Lipodystrophy. Clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation, including some fatalities. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C coinfection or elevations in transaminases are at increased risk of developing further transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation (approximately 2.5- hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, exacerbation of pre- existing diabetes mellitus, spontaneous bleeding in hemophiliacs. Possible association with increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/TPV.html ). Pediatric Experience: Tipranavir is approved in children > 2 years of age; approval was based on a multicenter, pediatric study of the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of tipranavir/ritonavir in HIV- infect ed children (PACTG 1051/BI- 1182.14). This study enrolled treatment -experienced children (with the exception of 3 treatment- na\u00efve patients) 2 -18 years of age (median age 11.7 years) with baseline HIV RNA > 1,500 copies/mL. Children were randomized to 1 of 2 doses of tipranavir coadministered with ritonavir in 3 age strata: tipranavir/ritonavir 290 mg/115 mg per m2 body surface area (low dose, 58 patients) or 375 mg/150 mg per m2 body surface area (high dose, 57 patients) twice daily plus optimized background therapy. All children initially received the oral solution; patients who were > 12 years of age and received the maximum adult dose of 500 mg tipranavir/200 mg ritonavir twice daily could change to tipranavir capsules. At baseline, greater than 50% of patients were resistant to all commercially available protease inhibitors, and the number of protease resistance mutations increased with a ge the low-dose group ( tipranavir /ritonavir copies/mL and 35% <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. the higher dose ( tipranavir /ritonavir 375/150 mg/m2 body 35% <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks . proporti on of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL tended to be greater in the youngest group of patients (70%), who had less baseline resistance. Tipranavir treatment was associated with a mean increase in CD4 cell count of 100 cells/mm 3 and 59 cells/mm3 in low- and high-dose groups, respectively. Overall, side effects were similar between treatment groups. Twenty- five percent of children experienced a drug -related serious adverse event, and 9% of patients discontinued study drugs due to adverse events. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disturbances. Moderate or severe laboratory toxicity was seen in 11% of children (primarily increase in GGT and CPK). Four patients (all in the low-dose group and three-fourths in the younger age group) developed AIDS -defining illnesses through 48 weeks. A Kaplan- Meier analysis comparing AIDS -defining events in the low- dose versus the high-dose group reached statistical significance (p = 0.04). In a multivariate model, 3 variables predicted virologic outcome: greater genotypic inhibitory quotient (GIQ), greater adherence, and baseline viral load <100K copies/mL, in that order. GIQ is a ratio of the median tipranavir trough concentration divided by the number of tipranavir mutations. The G IQ was consistently greater in the high -dose group. Based on these findings and the increased number of AIDS-defining events in the low -dose group, the high-dose regimen has been recommended. Pharmacokinetics of the liquid formulation at steady state were assessed [2]. For children 2 to <12 years of age, tipranavir trough concentrations for pediatric patients receiving tipranavir/ritonavir 290/115 mg/m2 body surface area were consistent with tipranavir trough concentrations achieved in adults receiving standard tipranavir/ritonavir 500 mg/200 mg dosing. However, children 12 to 18 years of age required a higher dose (375/150 mg/m2 body surface area, 30% higher than the directly scaled adult dose) to achieve drug exposure similar to that in adults receiving the standard tipranavir/ritonavir dose. Population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that tipranavir clearance can be affected by body weight and that volume of distribution can be affected by age [2]. Based on these studies the final dose of tipranavir/ritonavir was chosen as 375/150 mg/m2 body surface area twice daily. Vitamin E is an excipient in the oral solution, with a concentration of 116 IU of vitamin E and 100 mg tipranavir per ml of solution. Use of the recommended dose of tipranavir (14 mg per kg body weight) results in a vitamin E dose of 16 IU per kg August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 213 body weight per day, significantly higher than the reference daily intake for vitamin E (10 IU) and close to the upper limit of tolerability for children. The resultant high dose of vitamin E may lead to an increase in bleeding episodes, which were seen in 5.75% of children receiving the oral solution and 14.3% of children receiving capsules [1].

Reconst itution with 1.1 mL sterile water will deliver 90 mg/mL. Convenience kit: 60 single -use vials of ENF (90 mg strength), 60 vials of sterile water for injection, 60 reconstitution syringes (3 mL), 60 administrat ion syringes (1 mL), alcohol wipes Dosage Rec ommendations Selected Adverse Events Pediatric/Adolescent dose (6 -16 years ): Children <6 years : Not approved for use in children <6 years of age. Children 6 years : 2 mg/kg (maximum dose, 90 mg [1 mL]) twice daily injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, anterior thigh, or abdomen Adolescent (>16 years)/Adult dose : 90 mg (1 mL) twice daily injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, anterior thi gh, or abdomen Local injection site reactions Increased bacterial pneumonia (unclear association) Hypersensitivity reaction \u2014symptoms may include rash, fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, rigors, hypotension, or elevated serum transaminases. Rechallenge is not recommended. Special Instructions Carefully instruct patient or caregiver in proper technique for drug reconstitution and administration of subcutaneous injections. ENF injection instructions are provided with convenience kits. Allow reconstituted vial to stand until the powder goes completely into solution, which could take up to 45 minutes. Do not shake. Once reconstituted, inject ENF immediately or keep refrigerated in the original vial until use. Reconstituted ENF must be used within 24 hours. Must be given subcutaneously; severity of reactions increased if given intramuscularly. Give each injection at a site different from the preceding injection site; do not inject into moles, scar tissue, bruises, or the navel. Both the patient/caregiver and hea lth care provider should carefully monitor for signs and symptoms of local infection or cellulitis. To minimize local reactions apply ice or heat after injection or gently massage injection site to better disperse the dose. There are reports of injection-a ssociated neuralgia and parasthesia if alternative delivery systems, such as needle- free injection devices, are used. Advise patient/caregiver of the possibility of a hypersensitivity reaction; instruct them to discontinue treatment and seek immediate medi cal attention if the patient develops signs and symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction. Metabolism Catabolism to constituent amino acids. Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): There are no known significant drug interactions. Major Toxicities: More common: Almost all patients (87% -98%) experience local injection site reactions including pain and discomfort, induration, erythema, nodules and cysts, pruritis, and ecchymosis. Usually mild to moderate in severity but can be more severe. Average duration of local injection site reaction is 3 to 7 days, but was >7 days in 24% of patients. Less common (more severe): Increased rate of bacterial pneumonia (unclear association) and local site cellulitis (up to 11% in certain subgroups of patients in pediatric studies) [1]. Rare: Hypersensitivity reactions (<1%) including fever, nausea and vomiting, chills, rigors, hypotension, and elevated liver transaminases; immune -mediated reactions including primary immune complex reaction, respiratory distress, glomerulonephritis, and Guillain- Barre syndrome. Patients experiencing hypersensitivity reactions should seek immediate August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 215 medical attention. Therapy should not be restarted in patients with signs and symptoms consistent with hypersensitivity reactions. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussio n of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/ENF.html ). Pediatric Experience: Enfuvirtide has been studied in HIV-infected children in combination with other antiretroviral drugs [1- 5]. PACTG 1005 initially studied enfuvirtide in 14 HIV- infected children age 4-12 years with incomplete viral suppression (plasma RNA >10,000 copies/ml) while on a stable antiretroviral regimen consisting of 2 NRTIs plus an NNRTI or a PI for 16 weeks [2]. Part A included a single -dose pharmacokinetic evaluation of enfuvirtide given subcutaneously at 15, 30, or 60 mg/m2 of body surface area. The dose of enfuvirtide that reliably resulted in the target trough concentration (1,000 ng/mL) was 60 mg/m2 of body surface area per dose, the approximate \"equivalent\" of a 90-mg dose delivered subcutaneously to an adult with a body surface area of 1.7 m2. This led to the recommended pediatric label dose in chi ldren age 6 -16 years of 2 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) administered subcutaneously twice daily. In a second pediatric study of 25 children age 5-16 years, the 2 mg/kg dose, with a maximum dose of 90 mg, was found to yield drug concentrations similar to 60 mg/m 2 of body surface area dose and drug exposure was found to be independent of age group, body weight, body surface area, and sexual maturation [6]. Further data are needed in children <6 years of age. No metabolic induction or inhibition of enfuvirtide has been observed in PACTG 1005 or subsequent studies, nor was there a statistical relationship, within the utilized dosing schedule, between drug exposure with this agent and virologic benefit [5]. Part B of PACTG 1005 evaluated the safety and antiretroviral activity of chronic twice-daily subcutaneous enfuvirtide administration at 60 mg/m 2 per dose in 14 children. For 7 days, the drug was added to each child's background antiretroviral regimen; at D ay 7, the background regimen was optimized and enfuvirtide was continued, and children were followed for up to 96 weeks. Two children elected to discontinue enfuvirtide within 24 weeks (1 due to injection aversion, 1 due to an unrelated surgical procedure), 4 discontinued due to virologic failure (defined as >1 log increase in viral load above baseline), and 2 discontinued due to Grade 3 toxicity (thrombocytopenia, edema). In this cohort, most children had local injection site reactions. Seventy -nine percen t of children had >0.7 log reduction in HIV RNA by Day 7. At 24 weeks of treatment, 71% had a >1.0 log reduction, 43% were suppressed to copies/mL, and were suppressed to <50 copies/mL only 36% of children maintained virologic suppression (>1.0 log decrease in HIV RNA) at Week 96 [3]. Significant improvements in CD4 percentage and height z score were observed in children receiving enfuvirtide for 48 and 96 weeks. T20-310, a Phase I/II study of enfuvirtide (2.0 mg/kg subcutaneously, maximum 90 mg, twice daily) plus an optimized background antiretroviral regimen enrolled 52 treatment- experienced children 3 -16 years of a ge for 48 weeks. Of those completing 48 weeks of therapy (64%), the median decrease in HIV RNA was -1.17 log 10 copies/mL (n = 32) and there was a median increase of 106 cells/mm3 (n = 25). Local skin reactions were common in all age groups (87%). Treatment responses at Week 8 were superior in younger (<11 years of age) children when contrasted with adolescents as measured by plasma HIV RNA change from baseline ( -2.85 vs. -0.12 log 10 copies/mL) or those maintaining HIV RNA <400 (42% vs. 4%). Median increases in CD4 count were 257 cells/mm3 in children and 84 cells/mm3 in adolescents. The observed differential responses between children and adolescents probably reflect unique challenges to adherence with the prescribed regimen [1]. An increased rate of bacterial pneumonia was observed in adults treated with enfuvirtide compared with the control arm in the Phase III clinical trials [7]. A recent French cohort study with 1,220 patients receiving enfuvirtide and 9,374 patients on optimized therapy without enfuvirtide failed to find an increased risk of pneumonia [8]. Pediatric studies have not been powered to answer this question. References 1. Wiznia A, Church J, Emmanuel P, et al.

Pediatric dose : Not approved for use in children <16 years. No data currently available on dosage for children <16 years. Adolescent (>16 years)/Adult dose : When given with potent CYP3A inhibitors (with or without CYP3A inducers) includi ng PIs (except tipranavir/ritonavir [TPV/r]) (ENF), TPV/r, nevirapine (NVP), raltegravir (RAL), are not potent CYP3A inhibitors or inducers 300 mg twice daily When given with potent CYP 3A inducers including strong CYP3A inhibitor) 600 mg twice daily Abdominal pain Cough Dizziness Musculoskeletal symptoms Fever Rash Upper respiratory tract infections Hepatotoxicity Orthostatic hypotension Special Instructions Conduct testing with HIV tropism assay prior to use to exclude the presence of CXCR4 -using or mixed/dual tropic HIV. Can be given without regard to food. Instruct patients on how to recognize symptoms of allergic reactions or hepa titis. Use caution when administering MVC to patients with underlying cardiac disease. Metabolism Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 substrate. Use caution when administering MVC to patients with hepatic impairment. Because MVC is metabolized by the liver, concentrations may be increased. No dosage recommendation in those with renal impairment, but patients with CrCL <50 mL/min should receive MVC and CYP3A inhibitor only if the potential benefits outweigh the risk. Drug Interactions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Absorption: Absorption of maraviroc is somewhat reduced with ingestion of a high fat meal; however, maraviroc can be given with or without food. a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and p-glycoprotein substrate and requires dosage adjustments when administered with CYP- or Pgp-modulating medications. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities: More common: Cough, fever, upper respiratory tract infections, rash, musculoskeletal symptoms, abdominal pain, and dizziness. Less common (more sever e): Serious adverse events occurred in less than 2% of maraviroc -treated adult patients and included cardiovascular abnormalities (e.g., angina, failure, myocardial Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.or g/resistance_mutations/index.html ). Clinical failure may also represent the outgrowth of CXCR4 -using (naturally resistant) HIV variants. Pediatric Experience: The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of maraviroc in patients <16 years of age have not been established. August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 218 INTEGRASE INHIBITORS Raltegravir (RAL, Isentress) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Tablets : 400 mg (poloxamer tablet) Dosing Recommendations Selected Adverse Events Neonate/Infant dose : Not approved for use in neonates/infants. Pediatric dose : Not approved for use in children <16 years of age. Investigational dose in c hildren > 6 years of age (and >25 kg) : 400 mg twice daily Adolescent ( 16)/Adult dose : 400 mg twice daily Nausea, diarrhea Headache Fever CPK elevation Special Instructions Can be given without regard to food. Metabolism UGT1A1 -mediated glucuronidation. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild- to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. No dosing information is available for patients with severe hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Drug I nteractions (See also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1-Infected Adults and Adolescents .): Metabolism: The major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir is mediated through glucuronidation by UGT1A1. Inducers of UGT1A1 such as rifampin and tipranavir may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir while inhibitors of UGT1A1 such as atazanavir may increase plasma concentrations of raltegravir. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities: More common: Nausea, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, and itching. Less common: Abdominal pain, vomiting. In patients with chronic active hepatitis B and/or C, worsening of laboratory abnormalities from baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin is more likely than in patients not coinfected. Rare: Creatine phosphokinase elevations (Grade 2-4) have been observed in some patients. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use raltegravir with caution in patients receiving medications associated with these toxicities. Anxiety, depression, especially in those with prior history. Rash and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Thrombocytopenia. Resistance: The International AIDS Society -USA (IAS -USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/INIResiNote.cgi). Pediatric Experience: The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of raltegravir in patients < 16 years of age have not been established. Raltegravir in combination with other antiretrovirals is currently being evaluated in IMPAACT 1066, a Phase I/II study in HIV -infected children. The study objectives include selecting an age- appropriate pediatric dose approximating the exposure (AUC and C min) achieved in adults treated with 400 mg twice daily. The intensive pharmacokinetic evaluations are performed on Day 7-12 after raltegravir is added to a stable antiretroviral backbone. After the pharmacokinetic specimens are obtained the backbone regimen is changed. Initially, intensive PK evaluations were performed in children 12 to <19 years of age, with raltegravir administered with food because there is no food or fasting requirement with its licensed use in adults [1]. However, because the effect of food made comparisons to data obtained in fasting adults difficult, the study was then amended to conduct PK evaluations in the fasted state. This led to selection of a dose of 400 mg twice daily of the approved formulation (poloxamer tablet) in children > 12 to <19 years of age for longer term evaluation of safety and efficacy [2]. Preliminary data from 43 participants in this age group after 24 weeks of treatment with raltegravir plus an optimized background regimen demonstrated that 71% had either a viral August 16, 2010 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection Page 219 load <400 copies/ml or a 1.0 log decrease in viral load; 53% had a viral load <50 copies/ml; and the median CD4 count increas e was 111 cells/mm3. There were 4 Grade 3 adverse reactions judged possibly related to raltegravir (2 neutropenic episodes, 1 liver enzyme elevation, and 1 behavioral change); no participants discontinued therapy due to toxicity [3]. Children > 6 to <12 years of age were initially treated at a dose of 8 mg/kg twice daily. Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic data in 10 participants again led to choosing a uniform dose of 400 mg twice daily for those with a weight >25 kg. At 12 and 24 weeks of therapy, 78% and 67% of 14 children in this cohort had a viral load <400 copies/ml [4]. No unusual toxicity has been seen so far [4-5]. In addition to the approved adult formulation (pol oxamer tablet) two investigational raltegravir preparations are being evaluated in IMPAACT 1066: a chewable ethylcellulose formulation in children >2 to <12 years of age [6] and an oral suspension for children <2 years of age.
