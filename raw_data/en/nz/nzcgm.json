Masks Required at All Times 27th, January , 2021 Nearly 40% of adults in America use some form of complementary and alternative medicine to maintain health. Naturopathic healing involves combining different approaches in both modern medicine and traditional healing methods. Both naturopathic and conventional medicine have their strengths, and Lifestyle Physicians provide both, all under one roof. The debate is no longer whether one is better than the other. The best benefit comes from combining the strengths of each form of medicine and using them to complement each other in your path to wellness. Our naturopathic physician, [Dr. Sheeba Asad], believes in the six benefits of naturopathic medicine that you should know about. Naturopathic medicine is an approach that emphasizes emotional, physical, and spiritual wellness, so you receive a more complete path to health. Complementary and alternative medicine recognizes the importance of psychological, social and spiritual components to your well-being. When researchers took a look at the effectiveness of naturopathic medicine, they found a positive change in thinking is an unexpected benefit. Positive thinking lowers stress, anxiety, and depression, and improves your health. Naturopathic treatment approaches enhance your outlook, boost optimism, and improve your ability to cope with health-related issues. At Lifestyle Physicians, Dr. Asad helps patients better understand their bodies. When you get to know your body, you'll better understand what it's trying to communicate in the form of symptoms. This helps you learn what your body is telling you when you experience aches and pains or other symptoms. Because the naturopathic approach treats your body as a whole, not just symptoms of disease, your overall well-being improves as a result. Naturopathic treatment improves your emotions and mood and boosts your life satisfaction. When your well-being improves, it spills over into all aspects of your life and how you interact with the people and environment around you. While conventional medicine focuses on treating symptoms once a disease process has started, disease prevention is one of the foundations of naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic doctors believe that the most effective way to combat disease is to prevent it from developing in the first place. The goal is to foster a path to a healthy lifestyle that supports vibrant health and well-being \u2014 which reduces the risk for chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. At Lifestyle Physicians, we believe you're unique in your lifestyle, habits, genetics, and health concerns. Dr. Asad is devoted to providing highly individualized care to each patient to discover underlying causes of health complaints. The ultimate goal is always to stimulate your body's natural ability to heal itself and achieve balance and harmony. As a naturopathic physician, Dr. Asad firmly believes that searching for and treating the individual root cause of symptoms is the best way to restore health. Naturopathic doctors have many healing modalities at their disposal to help patients achieve wellness. To promote health, practitioners use acupuncture, herbal medicine, chiropractic adjustment, massage, and homeopathy. In addition to this, homeopathic medicine utilizes nutrition, exercise, relaxation techniques, and life enhancement approaches to treat and prevent health complaints and restore health. Whether you're dealing with fatigue, stress, or back pain, naturopathic medicine can help.
