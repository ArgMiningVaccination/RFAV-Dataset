Box 8013 Baltimore, MD 21244-8013 Re: Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2020 for Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates, Part C and Part D Pay ment Policies and 2020 Draft Call Letter (Docket Number: CMS-2018-0154) Dear Administrator Verma: The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) is pleased to submi t our comments on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Advance Not ice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2020 for Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates, Part C and Part D Payment Policies a nd 2020 draft Call Letter (hereina fter \"Call Letter\"). Founded in 1852 as the American Pharmaceutical Association, APhA represent s nearly 60,000 pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, student pharmacists, pharmacy techni cians, and others interested in improving medication use and advancing patient care. APhA membe rs provide care in all practice settings, including community pharmacies, hospitals, l ong-term care facilities, community health centers, physicia n offices, ambulatory clinics , managed care organizations, hospice settings, and the uniformed services. APhA would like t o provide feedback on the following areas included in the Call Letter. I. Star Ratings and Display Measures APhA's members are committed to continuous quality improvement and support the development and use of meaningful measures that help patients a chieve optimal health and medication outcomes. APhA thanks CMS for the opportunity to off er our comments regarding enhancements to the Star Ratings and display measures in CY 202 0. A. Measure Updates for 2020 Star Ratings i. Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes (SUPD) (Part D). APhA supported this PQA-endorsed measure becoming a Star Rating s measure for 2019 to facilitate increased focus on the evidence-based use of stat in therapy in persons with diabetes. Accordingly, we support CMS's p roposal, for the 2020 Star Ratin gs (based on 2018 data) and 2 subsequent years, to assign a w eight of 3 (intermediate outcome s) to this measure as it is standard practice and due to the clinical importance of this me asure in improving health outcomes of persons with diabetes. ii. Improvement measures (Part C & D )- Table 1: 2020 Star Ratings I mprovement Measures. i. Annual Flu Vaccine Process Measure C (1). APhA supports adding the annual flu vaccine to the 2020 Star Ra tings for Part C plans. According to the Centers for Dis ease Control and Prevention (CD C), a 6.2 percent reduction in the adult immunization/ vaccinati on rate for flu during the 201 7-18 influenza season was a contributing factor in the record number of deaths.1 Thanks to changes in state laws, pharmacists are playing an increasingly cr itical role in increasing influen za-vaccination rat es across the United States, with an additiona l 4.1 million additional adults vaccinated in 2013 because states allowed pharmacists to administe r the flu vaccine, which would have resulted in between 81,000-134,000 fewer influenza infections among adults in that year, depending on vaccine effectiveness. Additionally, the odds that an adult would recei ve the flu shot increased by 7.8 percent in states that allo wed pharmacists to be immunizers.2 APhA urges CMS to aggregate data from MA prescription drug plan s (MA-PD) and Part D plan sp onsors to better monitor, measure and attribute the impact different providers, including pharmacists, have on vaccination rates of Medicare beneficiaries. ii. Getting Needed Prescription Drugs D (1.5) (CAHPs measure). APhA appreciates CMS recognizing the importance of patient acce ss to medications and supports the addition of this m easure. However, not only is ac cess to the product important, patient choice and their relations hip with their pharmacist is critical to optimizing the impact of prescription medications. B. New 2020 Display Measures i. Transitions of Care (Part C). APhA appreciates \"Medication Reco nciliation Post-Discharge\" is retained as one of the 4 indicators collected and reporte d under the new Transitions of Care display measures with the intent to propose this measure fo r inclusion in the Star Rating s in the future. CMS should also consider pharmacists' roles in t he Notification of Inpatient Ad mission, Receipt of Discharge Information, and Patient Engagement after Discharge indicators. As CMS understands by adding the medication reconciliation meas ure, the review can be conduc ted by a pharmacist. Pharmacists are often the first health care practitioner patien ts often encounter post-discharge and the provider generally respons ible for coordinating medicat ion-related information between the hospital and primary care physician. Accordingly, patients could benefit greatly if 1 CDC. Estimates of Influenza V accination Coverage among Adults\u2014 United States, 2017-18 Flu Season. Page last reviewed: November 5, 2018, available at: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxvie w/coverage-1718estimates.htm 2 Drozd EM, Miller L, J ohnsrud M. Impact of Pharmacist Immunizat ion Authority on Seasonal Influe nza Immunization Rates S tates. Clin 3. pii: S0149-2918(17)30771- 3, available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28781217 3 pharmacists were better include d in transitioning patients from an inpatient setting to home. However, pharmacists are frequen tly blocked from the electronic exchange of relevant clinical information, which is critical to maximize the benefit of coord inated team-based care, including transitional care services. For t he Transitions of Care measure , the medication reconciliation information must be found in the s ame medical record that is us ed for the reporting of the other three indicators within the meas ure, which should be that of th e primary care practitioner or ongoing care provider who is mana ging the patient's care. If ph armacists had access to relevant information in the patient's reco rd, including discharge inform ation, pharmacists could have a more effective role in helping a patient transition between car e settings. APhA also requests CMS clarify how the efforts of c ommunity pharmacists in deliver ing medication reconciliation services would be captured since the primary provider's databas e is the one that is used for the data in calculati ng this measure. ii. Follow-up after Emergency Department Visit for Patients with Mu ltiple Chronic Conditions (Part C). APhA supports CMS's proposal to add to the 2020 display page a new HEDIS measure assessing follow-up care provide d after an emergency department visit for patients with multiple chronic conditions. As CMS states \"[p]atients with multiple chr onic conditions are more likely to have complex care needs and fo llow-up after an acute event, lik e an emergency department visit, can help prevent the development of more severe complications.\" Pharmacists can provide several follow-up services wit h patients with chronic condition s and play a vital role in MA issuers achieving success on this measure. This measure could a lso be useful in providing information for transitional care management services. C. Changes to Existing Display Measures i. Use of Opioids at High Dosage and from Multiple Providers (OHDM P) and Antipsychotic and Use in Persons w ith Dementia (APD) (Part D). For accurate measurement, APhA supports CMS's proposal to imple ment the PQA- approved measure updates for the 2020 display page measures (ba sed on 2018 data) that calculate total days supply. We remain pleased the reporting of these measures to Part D plan sponsors is still through Patie nt Safety reports, with only the OHDMP measure added to the 2019 display page. APhA urges CMS t o continue to monitor the applica tion of these measures for unintended consequences to pati ents with legitimate pain needs using the best available scientific evidence. D. Potential Changes to Existing Star Ratings and Display Measures i. Concurrent Use of Opioids and Benzodiazepines (COB), Polypharma cy Use of Multiple Anticholinergic (ACH) Me dications in Older Adults (Pol y-ACH), and Polypharmacy Use of Multiple Cen tral Nervous System (CNS)-Activ e Medications in Older Adults (Poly-CNS) (Part D). 4 APhA supports CMS's decision to b egin reporting these three PQA -developed measures in the Patient Safety reports f or the 2018 measurement year, an d to add them to the display page for 2021 (2019 data) and 2022 (2020 data). We also support CMS considering these measures for the 2023 Star Ratings (2021 data). ii. Use of Opioids from Multiple Pro viders and/or at High Dosage in Persons without Cancer. In 2017, APhA supported CMS's proposal to implement the PQA's a pproved changes to these measures to better align wit h the CDC Guideline for Presc ribing Opioids for Chronic Pain.3 We continue to support efforts re fining these measures using th e best available scientific evidence as CMS implements these revisions in the Patient Safet y reports for the 2019 measurement year and consider s including them on the 2021 displ ay page (2019 data). APhA also recommends CMS monitor this measure for any negative and u nintended consequences to patients, such as lack of access to necessary medications. E. Potential New Measure Concepts i. Interoperability Measures (Part C). APhA appreciates CMS's effort t o gain feedback on ways to measu re health plans' progress in maximizing their cap abilities to exchange health in formation with other plans, health care providers, and others. APhA en courages CMS to review the P harmacy Health Information Collaborative's report , \"Integrating Pharmacists into Health In formation Exchanges -- Update Version\"4 to learn more about the pharmacy c ommunity's health informatio n exchange (HIE) related goals. Should CMS consider adapting Mer it-based Incentive Payment Syst em (MIPS) measures to more directly measure inter operability for Part C, APhA reco mmends explicitly including pharmacists and pharmacies in definitions and terms where their eligibility may be unclear (e.g., healthcare provider, setting of car e). For example, the Quality Payment Program electronic prescribing measure defines pr escription as \"the authorization by a MIPS eligible clinician to a pharmacist to dispense a drug tha t the pharmacist could not dis pense to the patient without such authorization.\" 5 While the Summary of Care meas ure does not explicitly include pharmacies in the term \"setting of care\" or sp ecify whether pharmacists \"healthcare providers.\"6 APhA believes clearly includi ng pharmacists and pharmacies in s uch terms and measures will 3 Changes include: The treatment p eriod for OHD and opioids at h igh doses from multiple providers must be 90 days or more.

In the Call Letter, CMS highlight s Part C and D \"interoperabili ty-sensitive\" measures (e.g., HEDIS Medication R econciliation Post-Discharge measure) which specifically reference pharmacists and therefore, facilita te their inclusion in these services. APhA encourages CMS to work with NCQA to more explicit ly include pharmacists and commu nity pharmacies in other HEDIS measures, such as HEDIS T ransitions of Care. As pharmacis ts become more involved in team-based care and implementation specifications 7 advance, it is beco ming increasingly important that interoperabilit y incentives similarly advance to include and recognize pharmacists. ii. Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (Part C). APhA agrees with CMS that \"[p]a tient engagement is key to achie ving high quality care,\" \"[p]atients are the u ltimate source of information on pa tient outcomes,\" and \"Patient- Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs or PROs) have the potential to capture aspects of quality that are best, or perhaps onl y, assessed by plan members themse lves.\" As CMS notes, a number of the CDC's over 1,800 Patient-Rep orted Outcomes Measurement I nformation System (PROMIS) measures for use in a dults, such as sleep and depressi on, are already collected through current patient survey e fforts, while others are not. A PhA urges CMS to include pharmacists as a core member of t he integrated review teams to determine PRO measures as pharmacists are easily accessibl e to patients and have importan t perspectives on how patients view their care. iii. Pain Management (Part C). The Call Letter indicates NCQA is exploring the development of new measures assessing the use of non-opioid therapie s (pharmacologic and non-pharmaco logic) for pain and PROs (e.g., functional status, quality of life) to manage care for patients with chronic pain. In assessing the use of non-opioid therapies, APhA encourages CMS through their work with measure developers to consider medication-relate d services provided by pharmacists to optimize medications and limit risks to patients.8,9,10,11 APhA believes inclusion of such s ervices in an NCQA measure may 7 See Office of the National Coordinato r for Health Information Techn ology, Interoperability Standards Advisory: Documenting and Sha ring Medication-Related Care Plans by Pharmacists, NCPDP Pharmacist eCare Plan Version 1.0 Guidan ce on the Use of the HL7 CDA Consolidated Templates for Clinical Notes R2.1 Care Plan and HL7 CDA\u00ae R2 Implementation Guide: Pharmacist Care Plan Document, Release 1 - US Realm, Volume 1, available at: https://www.healthit.gov/isa/docum enting-and-sharing-medication -related-care-plans-pharmacists , last accessed: February 20, 2018. 8 See Fan, T. & Elgourt, T.

Adherence to Antipsychotic Medic ations for Individuals with Sch izophrenia (Part C). As CMS is aware, pharmacists have extensive medication-related experience and training, and can assist in helpi ng treat seniors with schizoph renia.12 Pharmacists can also help address a number of concerns for care transitions for patients with schizophrenia (i.e., medication reconciliation, comprehensive med ication reviews, etc.). Theref ore, we reiterate our call to CMS to implement measures and policies that encourage team-based ca re, and effectively optimize pharmacists' and other practitione rs' skills to improve patient care. v. Antibiotic Utilization Measures (Part C). CMS is considering possible futu re reporting on the CMS display page measures focusing on antibiotic prescribi ng practices related to three o f the most common acute respiratory conditions (acute bronchitis, upper respiratory infections, and viral pharyngitis). Expanding antibiotic stewardship in the c ommunity is lik ely one of the mo st influential ways to battle the untoward effects of widespread ant ibiotic misuse, including res istance, superinfection, and medication-related adverse effect s. Accordingly, APhA urges CMS to consult, incorporate and acknowledge pharmacists when designing and implementing measure s and strategies for antibiotic stewardship in outpati ent settings, as well as other settings (e.g., hospitals and long- term care settings, etc.). Phar macists play a unique and essent ial role in antibiotic stewardship because of their knowledge of an timicrobial therapy, particular ly the selection of nonantibiotic symptomatic therapy alternativ es, pharmacokinetics and pharmaco dynamics, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions. Pharmacist s bring value i n the developm ent and implementation of stewardship strategies by counsel ing, providing educational res ources, and tracking, reporting, and assessing the effectiveness of services. vi. Diabetes Overtreatment (Part C). APhA is supportive of the development of a new measure for asse ssing overtreatment. For certain older adults (e.g., those with multiple comorbiditi es or functional impairment), there is growing recognition that the ha rms of pursuing intensive A1c targets may outweigh the benefits. For example, the Ameri can Diabetes Association recomm ends relaxing A1c goals for older adults with multiple coexisting chronic illnesses, cognit ive impairment, or functional dependence. 12 Hashimoto, Yasuhiko and Masami Tensho.

Published online 2016 Apr 26, available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4847190/ 7 F. Innovations in Health Plan Design i. Part D Enhanced Medication Thera py Management (MTM) Model. APhA appreciates CMS's continued support for MTM programs, whic h improve medication-related and overall he alth outcomes. Studies indicat e that for every $1 spent on MTM services, anywhere from $4 up to $12 is saved\u2014in addition to co st savings, patients also realize significant improvements in key health measures.13 Despite clear eviden ce supporting the value of pharmacist-led MTM services, t hese programs continue to be s ignificantly underutilized. While APhA appreciates CMS's ongoing efforts to expand and enha nce MTM, including the Part D Enhanced MTM model, we hope that CMS will continue to wo rk collaboratively with pharmacists, plans, and beneficiari es to improve MTM services f or greater consistency and uptake and to maximize the serv ices' benefits to both patients and the larger health care system. APhA also encourages CMS to public ly share the progress of the Enhanced MTM program beyond the brief 2017 report on spending thresholds.14 APhA has also previously expresse d concerns CMS may not appreci ate the difference between Part D MTM and medica tion management provided through c oordinated care models as well as the variability of the M TM benefit within Part D. Addit ionally, there is significant plan variability in beneficiary elig ibility for MTM services.15 Thus, a beneficiary may qualify for MTM under one Part D plan's cri teria and not under another plan , and it's not clear to providers, including pharmacists, which of t heir beneficiaries are eligibl e for MTM under a given plan. Furthermore, while eligible be neficiaries qualify for an annual comprehensive medication review, follow-up services to a ddress problems and optimize med ications vary greatly in delivery format and frequency. A ccordingly, APhA strongly recom mends any efforts to measure and improve MTM services address the current barriers to benefi ciary access and a comprehensive MTM benefit. II. Part C A. Medicare-covered Opioid Treatment Program Services Beginning in CY 2020 As noted in the Call Letter, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act (Public Law No. 115-271) establishes opioid use disorder treatment services 16 furnished by Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) as a Medicare Part B servi ce beginning in 2020. APhA is a strong proponent of accessible opioid use disorder treatment services because of th eir proven evidence in patient outcomes. APhA urges CMS to us e this law and any regulatory dis cretion to incr ease Medicare 13 Isetts, BJ. Et. al.

With nearly 90 per cent of Americans living within five miles of a community pharmacy, pharmacists are often an un derutilized health care provider.17 B. Non-Opioid Pain Management Supplemental Benefits APhA appreciates CMS's efforts t o encourage MA organizations to consider Part C benefit designs for supplemental benefits that address medicall y-approved non-opioid pain management and complementary and integrative treatments. APhA e ncourages CMS to expand upon the list of examples enumerat ed in the Call Letter to incl ude pharmacist-provided services which help patients better manag e pain or obtain treatment, suc h as medication management services focused on non-opioid medications. C. Provider Directories It is generally recognized in the health care field and verifie d by industry surveys conducted by credentials verifica tion organizations and other e ntities that bet ween 20-40 percent of the time provider director ies in both the private and public sector are inaccurate or out-of-date. To address this situation, crede ntial verificati on organization s are attempting to use a variety of strategies, including technologi cal innovations, telephonic int erventions, penalties, etc. Pharmacist and pharmacy-specific di rectories currently suffer f rom the same shortcomings as physician and other health provide r directories with missing, i naccurate or out-of-date data. As pharmacists are being recognized i n more and more states as hea lth care providers with expanded scope and authority, the maintenan ce of accurate directories of pharmacists with accurate information is critical. Howev er, presently pharmacists are fac ing challenges in effectively documenting and maintaining their professional credentials for use by public and private payer entities. To address this situation, APh A, through a subsidiary entity Ph armacy Profiles LLC, has launched a nationwide platform designed to securely centralize a database of U.S. pharmacist providers and their advanced cre dentials. The system is designe d to automate the retrieval of professional credentials inf ormation on pharmacists, verify tha t information, and engage pharmacists regularly to keep it up-to-date. Pharmacy Profiles works in collaboration with industry partners to effectivel y coordinate and share informati on leveraging and linking to existing databases. The Pharmacy Profiles system intends to ena ble pharmacists to manage all of their professional information in one place and participate as seamlessly as possible in provider directories going forward. APh A is willing to meet with CMS to further discuss Pharmacy Profiles and its benefits t o Medicare and Medicaid. 17 NCPDP Pharmacy File, ArcGIS Census Tract File. NACDS Economic s Department. 9 III. Part D A. Improving Access to Opioid-Reversal Agents and Co-Prescribing APhA appreciates CMS's recognitio n of pharmacists' abilities to improve access to naloxone by highlighting, \"49 state s permit non-patient specifi c prescriptions through pharmacy standing orders, collaborative practice agreements, or protocol orders to authorize pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a separa te prescription written from the provider.\" 18 While CMS encourages plans to consider i nnovative approaches to increase co-prescribing, such as patient- specific pharmacy messaging, APhA believes CMS should consider how to better utilize pharmacist services related to na loxone dispensing, such as scr eening and counseling, as reimbursable services. In addi tion to prescriber and patent edu cation, APhA notes it would also be beneficial for plans to educat e pharmacists regarding naloxo ne and state-specific authorities. Currently, when pharmacists co-pre scribe naloxone, patients req uire additional services, such as assessment and in-depth education. While other health c are practitioners can bill payers, such as Medicare Part B, for th ese services as part of the offi ce visit, pharmacists are precluded. Therefore, to help increase acc ess to naloxone, decrease prescr iption abandonment and increase patient understanding, APhA recommends CMS develop mechanisms t o enable pharmacists to bill for services that must be performed when furnishing naloxo ne for certain high-risk patients. B. Formulary and Benefit Designs APhA agrees that if CMS wants to improve beneficiary access to naloxone, encouraging plans to cover it at a $0 or low er cost-sharing will help remov e a significant barrier - cost. We are supportive of federal and state efforts to increase patient s' access to naloxone. C. Access to Medication-Assisted Treatment Like CMS, APhA believes Medicare beneficiaries' appropriate acc ess to medication- assisted treatment (MAT) is impe rative. APhA appreciates CMS's efforts to stop plans from implementing prior authorization (PA) criteria duplicative of r equirements in the FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strateg ies (REMS) and Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA). To discourage plans fr om developing more stringent prio r authorization criteria, APhA recommends CMS clarify its int ent to stop PA cr iteria duplicati ve of, or more stringent than the requirements of REMS and DATA. A PhA believes such clarity will help improve efficiency and minimize practitioners' administ rative burdens associated with MAT. Further, by reducing such burdens, health care practitione rs may be more willing to provi de MAT, including related services. In the Call Letter, CMS acknowle dges that additional requiremen ts (REMS and DATA waiver) must be fulfilled when providing MAT. However, these re quirements tend to be 18 See, SAMHSA. Preventing the Conseque nces of Opioid Overdose: Under standing Naloxone Access Laws. Developed under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Center for th e Application of Prevention Technologies task order. Ref erence #HHSS283201200024I/HHSS28342 002T. For training use only. January 20, 2018, available at: https://www.samhsa.gov/capt/sites/ default/files/resources/nalox one-access-laws-tool.pdf . 10 associated with the regulatory or legal components of prescribi ng and dispensing of MAT products (e.g., buprenorphine), as opposed to the patient care services which are also part of MAT. APhA urges CMS to encourag e plans to cover MAT-related ser vices provided by pharmacists in community and othe r out-patient settings. APhA b elieves such coverage would significantly improve patient acce ss to MAT, especially where p harmacists operating under collaborative practice agreements or statewide protocols have a uthority to provide a broader array of MAT services but are inaccessible to patients due to c overage barriers. D. Medication Therapy Management (MTM )-Annual Eligibility Threshold As APhA has stated previously, w e strongly encourage CMS to rev isit the cost threshold, as the current $4,044 threshold exc ludes many beneficiaries wit h complex conditions, but smaller drug spends, who could benefit from MTM services. E. Comprehensive Medication Review Summary Standardized Format CMS is proposing \"...revisions to t he standardized format with th e intent of optimizing the utility of the CMR summary for beneficiaries while reducing burden on Part D sponsors. The revised format will be availabl e for public comment through the PRA process before submission to OMB for approval in 2020.\" APh A strongly supports revisions to the standardized format so it is more user friendly for the be neficiary and the pharmacists p roviding the service and look forward to the release of the revised format for public comment . Additionally, the revisions should provide flexibilities in how the standardized format can be delivered to beneficiaries. F. Improving Access to Part D Vaccines APhA is pleased the Call Letter continues to include language e ncouraging Part D plans to offer vaccines in the $0 vaccine tier or to place vaccines o n a formulary tier with low cost- sharing. We share CMS's concern that vaccination rates remain l ow for tetanus and diphtheria with acellular pertussis (Tda p), and that approximately 70% of adults for whom the herpes zoster vaccine is recommended remain unprotected. A 2016 report by Ava lere Health found between 47 and 72 percent of the 24 million Medicare beneficiaries with Pa rt D coverage had some level of cost sharing for vaccines, ranging from $35 to $70 in 2015. 19 The variable cost sharing requirements currently imposed on the majority of Part D vaccin es discourage immunization among elderly, disabled and chronically ill populations who acc ount for a disproportionate percentage of the morbidity and mortality from vaccine preventa ble conditions. Removing this financial barrier could have a significant impact on improving beneficiary access to and utilization of vaccines and will also help drive reductions in hospitalizations and avoidable medical expenditures in other part s of the Medicare program. Im munizations are vital to public health, and higher rates of adult immunization will improve pat ient health while reducing health costs associated with preventab le conditions. Pharmacists are i mportant members of the immunization neighborhood and improve patient access to vaccina tions recommended by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Imm unization Practices (ACIP). Ther efore, CMS should 19 Pearson, Caroline. Et. al. Medicare Has the Potential to A void Preventable Illnesses by En couraging Broader Covera ge for Adult Vaccines. February 18, 2016, available at: http://avalere.com/expertise/mana ged-care/insights/medicare-has -the-potential-to-avoid- preventable-illnesses- by-encouraging-br 11 encourage plans to recognize and compensate / reimburse pharmac ists as they do physicians and other immunization providers and maximize the inclusion of phar macists as in-network clinicians providing vaccines in acc ordance with the National V accine Advisory Committee (NVAC) Adult Immunization Standards, ACIP recommendations, and as authorized under state practice acts. Additionally, as me ntioned previously, APhA urge s CMS to aggregate data from MA-PD and Part D plan sponsors to better monitor, measure and a ttribute the impact different providers, including pharmacist s, have on vaccination rates of Medicare beneficiaries. G. Improving Access to Generi c and Biosimilar Medicines of the lowest-cost preferred ther apeutic option such as generic an d biosimilar medicines. In evaluating policy options related to biosimilars, APhA notes th e variable state laws regarding the pharmacists' ability to substitute interchangeable biosimilar p roducts even though there has yet to be an interchangeable biosimilar approved by the FDA. APhA e ncourages CMS and plans provide additional education and resources to health care pract itioners to make them aware of its policy changes and steps to ease any access barriers. In addition, APhA notes, at time s, the pharmacy may spend more money to acquire the medication than the reimburseme nt amount provided through Medic are. As CMS moves forward in lowering drug costs by improving access to generic and biosi milar medicines, APhA encourages CMS to consider how pha rmacy reimbursement, acquisit ion costs and costs associated with additional services related to dispensing are i mpacted by such policies. Moreover, it is critical for CMS to consider separately the cos t of the product from any associated service. CMS is also considering disc ouraging or prohibiting plan sponso rs from placing generics and/ or biosimilars on brand formu lary tiers and brand drugs on a generic formulary tier and eliminating the non-preferred dr ug tier. CMS data reveals \"[i]n 2011, 71% of generic drugs were placed on tier 1, the lowest ti er in the formulary. By 2015, 19 % of covered generics were placed on tier 1, while 46% were placed on tier 2 and 35% were placed on tier 3 or higher.\" 20 This shift represents a 52-percentage point decrease in the number of gene rics being placed on the lowest tier between 2011 and 2015. New analysi s shows the introduction of the \"non-preferred drug\" tier in 2017 led to the percenta ge of covered generics on that tier increasing fro m 18 percent in 2016 to 25 percent in 2019, a 7-perc entage-point increase.21 Accordingly, APhA urges CMS to analyze whether issuers' placement of generics on higher cost s haring tiers affects patient access to necessary medications and public ly share plans' justificatio ns for such actions. Unfortunately, recently, pharmacists and patients have also experienced large increases in the cost of generics in the marketplace. These price spikes negatively impact patient a ccess and, in some cases, patient adherence and thus, patients' heal th outcomes. APhA appreciates any steps CMS can take to increase transparency regardi ng generic pricing and out-of-pock et cost to patients. 20 Avalere Health.

Medicare Part D Opioid Overutilization Policy. APhA appreciates CMS's decision n ot to implement new opioid saf ety edits for 2020 and encourages CMS to carefully evaluate the impact, including any unintended consequences, of current edits on prescribers' and ph armacists' workflow, and mo st importantly, on patients. For example, APhA believes CMS shoul d consider whether the safety e dits, such as the opioid care coordination edit, meaningfully i mprove care coordination and p atient treatment plans, and the amount of time devoted to resolvi ng such measures to obtain imp rovements. In addition, we encourage CMS to also use metrics beyond patients' MME to deter mine the effectiveness of the safety edits. APhA appreciates the recommenda tion to include a threshold of t wo or more opioid prescribers in these edit speci fications as we believe this wil l help reduce the frequency of alerts and better focus communications between pharmacists and prescri bers, until the effectiveness of these alerts can be evaluated. H owever, APhA wants to emphasize the difficulties pharmacists experience when trying to overrid e safety alerts, particularly the new opioid care coordination alert. APhA believes the logic underpinning these safety alerts improperly presume pharmacists and prescribers can easily comm unicate in real time. CMS may no t fully appreciate the barriers that exist when pharmacists, part icularly community pharmacists , try to obtain the needed information from prescribers t o make a clinical decision regard ing the safety alert in a timely manner. Such communications are made even more difficult when p atients attempt to fill medications outside of prescriber office hours and because phar macists often lack access to patients' electronic health reco rds (EHRs). While APhA supports clinically meaningful prescriber-pharmacist communications to imp rove patient care an d safety, we are sensitive to both the workflows and workloa d of prescribers and pharmacists. Given breadth of these ad hoc safety alerts and wide range of patients impacted, APhA is conc erned the requirements to override edits do not sufficiently recognize the current health care environment and delay patient access to medications. APhA encourages CMS to consider how opio id overutilization policies can be made more flexible to hel p pharmacists, patients and pre scribers overcome these barriers while maintaining patient safety. ii. Drug Management Programs. Consistent with our previous comme nts, APhA urges CMS to monito r the impact of drug management programs (DMPs) on patients. Failure to capture and address unintended consequences of DMPs, such as out-of-pocket opioid purchases by patients, will result in skewed quality measure results a nd negatively-im pacted patient care, among other concerns. As DMPs are currently being voluntar ily implemented, APhA believes CMS can learn from these experiences and consider mechanisms to improve DMPs before plan s are required to have them pursuant to the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act . 13 I. New Draft 2020 Call Letter Proposals to Address the Opioid Epidemic Please, refer to our comments i n the Improving Access to Opioid -Reversal Agents section, under Part D; Non-Opioid Pain Management Supplemental Benefits section, under Part C; and Enhancements to the 2020 Part C & D Star Ratings and Fut ure Measurement Concepts, under Parts C & D. J. Future Changes to the Overutilizati on Monitoring System (OMS) Criteria APhA urges CMS to prioritize st udying the impact and effectiven ess of current OMS policies before seeking methods to expand the OMS criteria to i dentify potential at-risk beneficiaries. As noted above, APh A is concerned well-intention ed policies to curb the opioid epidemic may have unintended cons equences that negatively impac t patient care, including access to opioids by patients with legitimate needs and placing patients who are dependent, not addicted, into inappropriate withdr awal from the medication. In addition, prior to developing future policies, CMS should analyze the results from the signif icant efforts underway to address the opioid epidemic. Should CMS offer any new changes, APhA rec ommends those changes be proposed to stakeholders wit h ample opportunity to provide feed back before any new requirements are implemented. K. Opioid Potentiator Drugs APhA recognizes concurrent use of some medications with opioids can pose risks to patients, including those betwee n opioids and \"potentiator\" dru gs, such as gabapentin and pregabalin. In addition, our membe rs indicated that alerts can be helpful, but that it is important to be mindful of the quantity of alerts received in the pharmac y. While CMS seeks to enhance the OMS by adding additional flag s for potentiator drugs, APhA recommends CMS develop a framework to identify potentiator drugs or clarify how the Offi ce of the Inspector General is identifying these medications as potentiator drug s. APhA believ es it is important for causation, not just correlation, to be cons idered when identifying potenti ator drugs. However, APhA does recognize patients prescribed opioids and certain other medications may be vulnerable to additional risks. APhA applauds CMS for re cognizing the importance of offering MTM services to benefici aries who are at risk of adver se events due to opioid overutilization or opioid users w ho are also taking potentiator drugs. APhA agrees these beneficiaries may benefit from M TM services including a CMR, ta rgeted medication reviews, and interventions with their pres cribers. In addition, APhA rec ommends that CMS consider requiring appropriate follow-up ser vices as part of the MTM ser vice for beneficiaries. Beneficiaries may need more rigor ous monitoring than is current ly being delivered, especially in those prescription drug plans (PD Ps) using the minimum quarterl y targeted review as the design for their MTM program. APhA encourages CMS to clarify plan cove rage of MTM services provided by pharmacists, including community pharmacists, and f or plans to provide and make clear patient eligibility for MTM services and additional cover age details (e.g., what codes to use and how to submit the claim). 14 L. Part D Mail Order Auto-Ship Modifications CMS is proposing, starting in 2020, to permit interested Part D sponsors to offer an opt-in voluntary auto-ship program for refills of established therapie s that a beneficiary has been on for at least 4 consecutive months. CMS expects sponsors implementin g an auto-ship program for refills of established therapies will include no less than two shipping reminders prior to sending. The Call Letter states \"CMS is not recommending a specific meth od for how the pharmacy provides the two reminders but recognizes that such notificatio n could be achieved by phone, email, text, direct mailing, or other comparable means of commu nication (including in an alternative language if needed) and should be based on the bene ficiary's stated preference.\" APhA recommends CMS clarify this policy further prior to consid ering implementation in order to receive appropriate feedback. While APhA believes current consent forms and procedures for au to-ship are cumbersome and difficult for patie nts to fully comprehend, more clarity is needed with regard to how or who is responsible for obt aining consent and whether the notice procedures contained in the Call Letter are sufficient. In addition, we are concerned t he term \"opt-in voluntary auto-ship program\" is misleading as it appears the patient does not parti cipate voluntarily nor do they need to \"opt-in,\" but rather the plan can enroll the beneficiary in auto-shipment without any action by the beneficiary. Further, there are laws and safety issues prev enting the return and reuse of medication. Accordingly, if CMS goes forward with this program, APhA urges the agency to provide reimbursement to pharmaci es following this policy and i ts processes for any actual cost associated with the shipped/ returned product as well as the re sources associated with processing and disposing of the returne d product by beneficiaries. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the draft Call Letter. We support CMS's ongoing efforts to continue to improve Medicare's prescri ption drug programs and look forward to continuing to work with CMS to reach that goal.
