Despite the centrality of livestock to rural livelihoods (c ontributing 50-63% of livelihoods in the impact are as in southern Oromia and Somali regions), pastoralists o ften have difficulty accessing animal health care. Traditional medicine and black market drugs may be ineffective, while private veterinary services and government services, while effective, are often not available. In an effort to improve animal health s ervices and boost rural livelihoods, Save the Children/US, working with two partner organizations (Lay Volunteers International Association and CARE), has implemented a variety of Community-Based Animal Health Projects, beginning as early as 1995. Impact areas included Dollo Ado/Hargelle Telt ele (CARE). This study aimed to review the decentralized animal health approaches and methodol ogies in the various impact areas, to assess the impacts or likely impacts of the interventions, to identify strengths and weaknesses of the respective approaches, and to make recommendations for improve ment. Methods Used A review of each impact area was conducted through a review of project documents; semi-structured interviews and discussions with field project staff , government partner departments, and private anima l health workers; performance assessment of CAHW's, a nd personal observations. In addition, communities' feedback was gathered from an extensiv e group semi-structured interview that used participatory methodologies such as 'before' and 'a fter' proportional piling, disease ranking, and mat rix scoring, and community-identified indicators. Data from community sessions was analyzed using Excel to calculate median values, and by assessing the degre e of agreement between informant groups using the Kendall coefficient of concordance (W) (SPSS Versio n 13.0). Finally, a SWOT analysis was conducted to review the strengths (S), weaknesses (W), opportuni ties (O), and threats (T) of each program. Findings and Recommendations Baseline Surveys and Participatory Dialogues: In the CARE impact area, needs identification with extensive community dialogues were carried out by project staff in each of the communities prior to p roject implementation. These dialogues helped to ensure that local priorities, opportunities, and co nstraints were taken into account, and incorporated local disease descriptions and knowledge into the trainin g. Dialogues also enhanced community understanding of and commitment to the project objectives and act ivities. In the SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area, pr eliminary assessments evaluated common livestock diseases, treatments (traditional or modern), drug availability, and general livestock conditions. How ever, there was only very limited pre-program dialogue th at informed local communities of project activities but did not solicit their input. In the SC/US Liben and the LVIA impact areas, there was no baseline surve y, and limited-pre program dialogue was used only to i nform the community of project activities. In these cases, the communities should have been engaged as partners in identifying the number of CAHW's to be trained, the criteria for selecting CAHWs and Veter ninary Supervising Committees, and program staff should have clearly defined the specific role and b enefits that CAHW individuals could expect (that th ey are part time, private operators). Training: Trainings were standardized under STI LEAP to have two phases and were generally thorough. Evaluation of individual CAHW performance showed th at in impact areas where trainers used were both well-qualified (veterinarians or Animal Health Assi stants rather than Animal Health Technicians or previously-trained CAHW's) and received sufficient training in participatory methods, more CAHW's were rated as 'good' or 'very good.' For example, i n the CARE area, where veterinarians and Animal Health Assistants conducted the training of new CAH W's after being trained in participatory methods fo r two weeks, 93% of CAHW's were rated as 'good' or 'v ery good' in their technical skills. In contrast, o nly II 70% of CAHW's in SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle, and 80% in SC/US Liben impact areas were rated as above average. All impact areas used a standardized manual that in cluded basic knowledge on animal husbandry and diseases, their treatments, and vaccinations. This was one of the strengths of the program, though the manual could be further strengthened with illustrat ions. In the CARE impact area, the manual was adapted to include local descriptions, seasonal occ urrence patterns, and other indigenous knowledge. Other impact areas would have strengthened their CA HWP by using this same approach. The training of women CAHWs deserves specific atten tion. Women were only trained as CAHWs in the CARE impact area, where there was a significant pos itive impact of their participation. Women were evaluated to be as effective as their male counterp arts, and in some cases, were perceived by the community as more responsible and committed than ma le CAHWs. In Somali region, religious and traditional beliefs were cited as constraints limit ing women's participation, but no specific accommodations were made to allow their participati on in the project. For example, the importance of their participation could have been discussed as pa rt of pre-training community dialogues, and trainin gs could have been carried out in rural areas to speci fically facilitate their attendance. In addition to facilitating women's participation, holding the tra inings in rural areas could have provided additiona l opportunities for communities' participation. Commu nities could have contributed the location, animal cases for practical learning, and would have been m ore familiar with the program from the outset. Monitoring: Ongoing field monitoring of CAHW performance and a regular schedule of refresher trainings are critica l to the success of a CAHW program. CARE was most suc cessful at implementing on-the-job field monitoring and technical support, which provided sy stematic strengthening of CAHW capacity and confidence, and identified problems that were addre ssed at regularly scheduled refresher trainings. In other areas, some problems noted in the field (some CAHWs don't have enough drugs in their kits, are doing insufficient and incomplete record-keeping, a re loosing motivation and not providing services, a nd are not providing disease reporting functions), are exacerbated by poor monitoring, which could identi fy and address these issues. In any CAHW program, ongoing training, as well as t raining of replacement CAHW's (as some CAHW's inevitably move or stop for other reasons), needs t o be planned for. However, in the one impact area where the project had ended (LVIA), no ongoing moni toring or technical support was planned for, indicating a poor exit strategy. Services Provided: In all impact areas, most CAHW's are providing a co mprehensive range of services, including treatment of external and internal parasites, infectious disease s, Trypanosomis, vaccination, hoof trimming, and dehorning. Communities said that CAHWs also mobiliz e the community for vaccination activities, create awareness about drug quality, inform pastoralists a bout disease prevention, and provide links to the l arger development community. The proportion of individual CAHWs providing comprehensive services ranges from 73% (LVIA) to 93% (CARE), with the major const raints limiting service provision being drug supply. Drug supply is limited in some cases becaus e of a misuse of cost-recovery money (CARE and SC/US Dollo Ado and (SC/US Liben). cooperatives have been established in all impa ct areas, with the goals of supplying the necessary animal health drugs in sufficient quantity and qual ity in a consistent manner, liasing with NGO's and other government organizations (especially for disease re porting), and providing ongoing training, technical assistance, and information sharing for members. Ma ny of these cooperatives are too new to be evaluate d. However, the older cooperatives (the Dollo Ado Coop erative, and to a lesser extent, the Moyale-Somali Cooperative) are having issues with providing an in consistent drug supply, and with failing to meet th eir non-drug objectives. Generally, cooperative members have limited business knowledge and poor accountability and transparency. In addition, these cooperatives are operating in violation of the 176 /91 III Drug Administration and Control Proclamation, which allows only veterinarians, Animal Health Assistants, and Animal Health Technicians to be inv olved in opening and running veterinary drug shops. To address this issue and increase the long-term su stainability of the CAHW systems, it is recommended that the programs develop a relationship with priva te animal health care providers who will act as a s ingle source to provide sustainable technical support, dr ug supply, and CAHWs disease and activity reporting . This private animal health care provider could be s upervised by the government veterinary department, and would forward disease reports to the government . Meanwhile, the currently established CAHW cooperatives could be involved in livestock and liv estock product marketing, for which there is a huge potential in all impact areas. Impact On Animal Health and Pastoralist Livelihoods : All informant groups in all areas agreed that there has been a significant increase in the proportion of healthy versus unhealthy animals since the CAHWP wa s implemented. The change was attributed mostly to the availability of medicines, vaccines, CAHW tr aining and knowledge, and other project inputs. The change in incidence of specific diseases was also a nalyzed, and with two exceptions where disease pres sure had risen significantly for non-project reasons, or where drug quality was poor, there was strong agreement that the incidence of diseases handled by CAHWs had fallen. There was overwhelming support from communities for CBAHP, with a significant positive attitude change by local communities towards the use of mode rn medicine, and a high willingness to pay for services and drugs. When compared with other servic e providers (government veterinary services, black market drug dealers, traditional medicine, and othe rs), CAHWs were ranked as the most trusted in all impact areas. The use of CAHWs was higher than all other services, with other services less important than they used to be, and in some cases not used at all at present. CAHWs are ranked as highly accessi ble, even to the poorest members of the community, becau se they provide medicines to these families on a credit basis. They are said to provide high quality drugs and advice. Black market drugs were cheaper in some cases, but are of low quality. Government drug s and advice are judged to be of good quality in so me areas, and may be cheaper that CAHWs, but are not c onsistently available. In SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area, there was an increase in milk production, meat, income, and livestock numbers (camels, cattle, and especial ly shoats). Increased milk production has resulted in some additional household consumption, but most is sold as milk or butter, locally or in Kenya. In oth er impact areas, there has been increased income and l ivestock numbers, but a decrease in milk production . However, communities agreed that the decrease in mi lk production had been caused mostly by a reduction in pasture (from drought, bush encroachme nt, and ethnic conflict and ethnic-based regionalization), and not by the impact of diseases . Increased income from the sale of livestock and liv estock products has significantly increased in all impact areas during the project, due to improved livestock markets and increased prices. The money has been used for restocking, buying consumer items such as clothes and food staples, paying for medical and veterinary services, for weddings and other social purposes, and for contributions to local developmen t initiatives such as roads or school and clinic cons truction. The numbers of livestock have risen overa ll, but herd composition has also changed in the SC/US Libe n, LVIA, and CARE impact areas, because of changed market conditions favoring selling cattle, and (in Borana lowlands) the growing preference for camels because of their drought-resistance. Participation of Other Stakeholders: In all impact areas, government participation and s upport is high. The project should take advantage o f this enabling policy environment to press for furth er support in two areas: the government should be discouraged from providing occasional services at a subsidized rate, because this provides unfair competition; and the government should support the distribution of legal drugs by cracking down on the illegal drug trade. One weakness in community participation was the Vet erinary Supervising Committees, made up of community members. In all impact areas, VSC's were not effectively carrying out their duties. For IV example, they were not overseeing CAHW performance, addressing issues such as drug shortages, or questioning why inactive CAHWs were inactive. One stakeholder group that should be more fully eng aged, in impact areas where they are present, is private animal health workers. In many cases, they were not involved in the projects as stakeholders, and they view the CAHWs as competitors. Impact areas co uld engage these private animal health providers, particularly in addressing drug supply and disease reporting weaknesses in the current project. Conclusion Despite some variability in the quality of implemen tation of the CBAHW program, the program has been highly successful in meeting its goal of providing higher quality animal health services at a price th at is affordable to communities. CAHWs have improved the health of livestock in the pastoral areas where they work, and have also in many cases improved liv elihoods. Improvement to make the programs more participatory would strengthen their sustainability . Attention also needs to be paid to designing and implementing sustainable support systems for CAHWs, particularly for ongoing training and drug supply. The following are recommended to improve the progra m: Include an ethno-veterinary approach, gathering inf ormation from communities including community identification of diseases, ranking of mo st important diseases, and season of occurrence for each species of livestock. Strengthen the participatory structure of programs to include adequate pre-program and ongoing dialogue (including communities identifying their o wn criteria for selecting CAHWs), and community participation in monitoring and evaluatio n. An annual assessment should be conducted to determi ne the number and distribution of active CAHWs in each area, and this assessment should be u sed to plan for further CAHW training to fill in gaps or increase coverage where needed Trainings should be conducted by veterinarians or a nimal health assistants who have attended a participatory training techniques workshop During this evaluation, some diseases were identifi ed as priorities by communities, but not handled by CAHWs. A participatory study should be conducted to learn more about these diseases and come up with control strategies On-the-job monitoring and refresher trainings of CA HWs should be more regularly carried out, with community participation in monitoring. Trainings should be carried out in rural areas, und er pastoralist setting, to facilitate the training of woman CAHWs and community participation Drug supply should be moved from CAHW cooperatives to private animal health providers (supervised by the government), who should also tak e on technical support and disease reporting roles. Government should be discouraged from providing ser vices at a subsidized rate, because this provides unfair competition; and the government sho uld support the distribution of legal drugs by cracking down on the illegal drug trade. The projects should continue awareness-raising acti vities about the dangers of using black-market poor quality drugs 1 Section 1 Introduction 1.1 The content of the report This report describes findings regarding the effect iveness of the methodologies and approaches used by SC/US and its partner organizations (LVIA & CARE) i n the design and establishment of a sustainable community-based animal health workers system and a concurrent privatization of animal health services. The effect of the community-based animal health wor kers project on the impact of the various livestock diseases and on overall animal welfare is also disc ussed. Section 1 gives a brief introduction to the assessm ent including: 1.1 the content of the evaluation re port; 1.2 General background information and Geographical scope of the program areas; and 1.3 Consultant's TOR. Section 2 discusses the methodologies used. Section 3 looks at the relevance of the program in the respective impact areas. Section 4 presents and discusses findings regarding the various methodologies and approaches employed by the implementing organizations to establish sust ainable community-based animal health workers systems and private systems of animal health servic es in their respective impact areas. Section 5 summarizes the results of SWOT analyses c arried out in all impact areas. Section 6 depicts the influence of community-based animal health workers on disease impact and incidence, on animal health service provider use, a nd on the welfare of pastoralists. Section 7 summarizes the major conclusions and reco mmendations made under the previous sections. 1.2 General background information and context Livestock plays a major role in the livelihood of t he majority of those who live in Somali and Borana lowland areas, contributing significantly to the fi ve household capital assets (Finance, Human, Social , Natural and Physical). However, pastoral and agro- pastoral communities in these areas are highly vulnerable to various shocks, which can lead to the loss of their sustainable means of livelihood (the ir livestock), and consequently to destitution. SC/US, CARE and LVIA have been operating in these p astoral areas to ensure food security and strengthen livelihoods through livestock developmen t activities. To this end, they have been implement ing a community-based animal health workers system to i mprove animal health services, and ultimately, to increase households' supply of livestock products f or home consumption and marketing. In order to enhance their impact, the three impleme nting organizations are working in partnership unde r the Southern Tier Initiative Livelihood Enhancement for Agro-Pastoralists and Pastoralists (STI LEAP) program funded by USAID for the project period Sept ember 2002 to August 2007. 1.3 Geographical scope and duration of the program. Save the Children/US: /head2right Began implementing animal health activities in Guji zone of Oromia Region through providing direct financial and material support to the govern ment veterinary department under its Development Activity Program (DAP1). The implement ation of community-based animal health workers was continued under DAP2 following the phas e-out of DAP1. DAP2 was initially planned as a 5-year project beginning in 2002; howe ver, it was discontinued after the third year of implementation because of a change in government st rategy and policy towards supporting development interventions. There is no currently f unded CBAHP in this area, because STI LEAP is not implemented in this zone. 2 /head2right began working on animal health interventions in Lib en and Afder zones as early as 1995 and has trained and supported several CAHWs since then. Cur rently, STI LEAP is an active program in this area. CARE : has been working in Borana zone since 1984, focus ing mainly on various emergency interventions. In October 2001 they launched a comm unity-based animal health system which was implemented for one year in Yabello and Dire Woreda s through their Borana Drought Recovery Project (BDRP). The intervention continued from October 200 2 to September 2005 in the same Woredas through another project called Borana Vulnerability Reduction Initiative (BVRI). Additional work under STI LEAP was started in September 2002, providing s upport to already established CAHWs, expanding to new Kebeles (PAs) within Yabello and Dire Woreda s, and covering the whole of Teltele Woreda. LVIA : has been present in Moyale Woreda since 1995. The y started an animal health support program by training 10 CAHWs (through Debre Zeit University) f rom the Somali side of Moyale in 1998. The program was further strengthened and expanded to ot her 10 Kebeles (PAs) on the Somali side of Moyale and 8 Kebeles (PAs) on the Oromia side of Moyale th rough the STI LEAP. But unlike in SC/US and CARE impact areas, implementation under STI LEAP wa s continued in LVIA areas for just 2 years (from September 2002 - August 2004). 1.4 Terms of Reference (TOR) The overall objectives and aim of this mission was to review the decentralized animal health approache s in SC/US supported projects, to assess the impacts or likely impacts of the interventions, to identify strengths and weakness of the respective approaches , and to make recommendations where necessary. See Annex 1 for the detailed TOR. 1.5 Constraints faced during the assessment mission /head2right There was miscommunication between the SC/US Addis Office, field offices and partner organizations on the schedule of this mission. Some of the partner organizations were unaware of the mission and said they had not been informed (LV IA & PCAE). In addition, relevant staff from some of the SC/US field offices could not be m et for discussion. It was not possible to undertake the review and impact assessment in Filtu (PCAE impact area), because no one was available to facilitate this. In Moyale (LVIA impa ct area), with support from SC/US field office, it was possible to undertake the field visit and im pact assessment, though most of the staff were interviewed in Addis Ababa afterwards. /head2right The amount of time needed for the fieldwork was und erestimated in light of the extensive and in- depth assessment desired; the participatory methodo logy used; the inaccessible and dispersed geographical locations of impact areas; and the bad condition of the roads and uncomfortable vehicle. 3 Section 2 Methodology 2.1 Review of methods and approaches employed to achiev e the objective of the Program Methodologies and approaches followed by each of th e implementing organizations to achieve a sustainable community-based animal health workers s ystem and the privatization of veterinary services were reviewed. This review was carried out through: /head2right Review of documents such as project proposals, repo rts (project progress reports, CAHWs training reports, and workshop reports), and previo us reviews and evaluations (see Annex 8 for documents consulted). /head2right Semi-structured interviews and discussions were con ducted with field project staff, government partner departments, private animal health workers (Dollo Ado & Moyale) and community members (See Annex 2 for lists of persons met with) . /head2right Performance assessment of CAHWs (Annex 4) /head2right Personal observations made during visits to the pro gram areas 2.2 Assessment sites Four impact areas were defined based on the impleme nting organization, geographical location and community involved. These impact areas were: 1. SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area 2. SC/US Liben impact area 3. LVIA Moyale impact area 4. CARE Yabello, Dire & Teltele impact area For the purposes of the assessment, each of the imp act areas was considered as one project area. In e ach impact area, 10 sites having CAHWs were selected, f or a total of 40 sites (see Annex 3). The sites wer e first categorized according to their proximity to t he district town as 'close' (maximum 20km), 'modera te' (maximum 45 km) and 'distant' (more than 50km), and then sites were randomly selected within each category. 2.3 Impact assessment methodologies Participatory methodologies such as semi-structured interviews (SSI), 'Before' and 'After' proportiona l piling, disease ranking, and matrix scoring were us ed . A total of 683 community informants (602 men and 81 women) participated in the impact assessment exe rcises. Simple drawings on cards and locally availa ble materials (stones) were used for the proportional p illing exercise. The facilitator first explained ea ch exercise to the informants, and asked the community to identify locally relevant indicators. The indic ators were represented pictorially on cards, and the faci litator confirmed that all community participants understood what each picture represented. Each grou p of informants was then asked to select representative individuals from among the group to place the counters (stones) during the proportional pilling, ranking and scoring activities. Using brai nstorming and probing questions, explanation and additional information was generated out of the pro portion of stones placed on the different indicator s. Afterwards, the other informants were asked whether they agreed with the placement of the counters and justifications given by their representative. Info rmants who did not agree on the distribution of the counters were given a chance to redistribute the co unters and explain their reasoning. The process continued until a consensus has been reached by all informants. Each impact assessment exercise with a given informant group took a minimum of 3 hours. 2.4 Data analysis Data derived from proportional pilling (including m eans of livelihood, factors affecting livelihood activities, changes in the impact of animal disease s, and matrix scoring of service providers) were fi rst analyzed using Excel spread sheet to calculate medi an values. Second, the amount of agreement between informant groups was assessed using the Kendall coe fficient of concordance (W) (SPSS Version 13.0). 4 2.5 SWOT analysis In addition to the methodologies described above, a SWOT analysis was conducted to review of the strengths (S), weakness (W), opportunities (O) and threats (T) of each of the programs. This analysis was carried out through discussions with the various st akeholders in the project areas, project staff, CAH Ws, and through the personal observations of the consul tant. 5 Section 3 Relevance of the Community-based Animal Health program 3.1 Community livelihoods and vulnerability in the assessment areas Livestock-keeping in arid and semi-arid areas is a rational approach to utilizing scarce vegetation, a s livestock are efficient at converting this vegetati on into highly nutritious foodstuffs for people. Wh en effectively managed, livestock represents the only ecologically and economically sustainable domestic land use of arid lands. In these areas, livestock and li vestock-related activities contribute to over 50 pe rcent of household gross revenue, and livestock contribute 2 0 percent or more of overall household food energy (Otte and Chilonda, 2002 quoted by Knips, 2004). The Sustainable Livelihoods (SL) Framework approach is used to understand and highlight the role of livestock in Somali and Oromia pastoral and agro-pa storal areas (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Sustainable livelihood framework A household depends on five capital assets: human c apital, physical capital, social capital, financial capital and natural capital, portrayed in the shape of a fi ve-axis graph (pentagon). Access to all five types of capital is required for a sustainable livelihood. Communities in all impact areas have identified sev eral different livelihood activities, including liv estock keeping, crop cultivation, petty trade, casual labo ur, and the selling of firewood & charcoal or incen se. The proportion of each livelihood activity occurrin g in all impact areas has been identified using the proportional pilling score for each activity (Annex 6). Livestock ranked as the most important source of livelihood in all areas, accounting for 50% in Doll o & Hargelle; 63% in Liben; 52% in Moyale; and 52% in Yabello, Teltel & Dire impact areas. Livestock are central to the Somali and Oromo pasto ral communities. Their role is defined by the vario us ways they contribute to a poor household's capital assets, as represented by the pentagon. They serve as subsistence food (milk, meat & blood), as a food re serve, and as a key source of cash, which is used t o pay for veterinary & medical costs and for other non-pa storal consumer items. Livestock also play a signif icant role in individuals' and households' social activit ies, through determining marriage chances and as a means to correct or prevent wrong doings. The various con tributions of livestock species to household assets among Somali and Oromo pastoralists and agro-pastor alists are detailed in Table 1. The same SL approach was used to review the vulnera bility context in which people seek to build the different kinds of capital assets available to them . Informants in all impact areas identified a numbe r of vulnerabilities which are affecting their livelihoo d activities. These include drought, animal diseas es, conflict, bush encroachment, seasonal floods, pests , and predators.

It is beyond the TOR of th is work to discuss and present the status of the ta rget communities as regards each of the vulnerability fa ctors. Rather, the basic interest of this work is t o assess the extent to which animal disease is a threat to a sustainable livelihood. The results in all impact areas revealed that animal disease was the second most im portant threat after drought. Poverty can be reduced through sustainable improvem ents in people's livelihoods, amongst other strategies. \"...where sustainable livelihood is defined as \"capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) and activities required for a mea ns of living. A livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stress and shocks an d maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets both now and in the future, while not underm ining the natural resource base.\" (Carney, 1998 1). As described by Carney (1998) sustainable livelihoo ds are derived from access to five types of assets: natural, physical, financial, human and social capi tal. The greater the access to these five types of assets, the more secure the livelihoods. Thus, an approach that aims to improve pastoral livelihoods should fo cus on increasing the production of livestock, as this is pastoralists' key asset base. In terms of liveli hood outcomes, improvements in livestock production have the potential to generate more income, increase social well being, reduce vulnerability, improve fo od security and encourage more sustainable use of natural resources. In light of this fact, SC-US and its partners are t ackling the right issues through improving animal h ealth services. 1 Carney, D., (Ed.) 1998 Sustainable Rural Livelihoo ds: What contribution can we make?

Under e ach sub-heading, qualitative and quantitative informati on gathered during the review process is presented and discussed. This review is focused on assessing the quality of the design and establishment of the CAHW s program. The national minimum standards and guideli nes for design and establishment of Community- based Animal Health Workers Systems have been used as the basis for this assessment. 4.1 Designing and planning of the CAHWs system Participatory baseline surveys and community dialog ues are important components of the design and establishment of a CHAWs system. Therefore, under t his section of the report, the designing and planning process followed by each respective organi zation is assessed and discussed. 4.1.1 SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area SC/US CBAHP in Dollo Ado and Hargelle W oredas in 1997, and it continued implementation through various projects. There was no evidence as to how the previous programs were initiated, and therefore, it was impossible to determine whether p roper baseline surveys and community dialogues were carried out. The STI LEAP animal health program has continued to work in the same areas with the same CAHWs, but has also expanded CAHWs into new PAs. It has been noted that preliminary assessments were carried out in all target PAs where new CAHWs were to be trained. These preliminary assessments evaluated common livestock diseases, treatments (tr aditional and modern), veterinary drug availability , and general livestock conditions, but did not include a ny pre-project dialogue with the community. There are currently 40 CAHWs in Dollo Ado & Hargell e, out of which 20 in Dollo Ado and 10 in Hargelle were trained in previous programs, and onl y 10 (5 from each Woreda) were trained under the current program (STI LEAP). There were no records o f community dialogues carried out in the process of training of the previous CAHWs. Under the STI LE AP program, only one pre-training community dialogue was carried out in areas where new CAHWs w ere trained. Community discussions and evaluation of CAHWs activity were carried out in other areas, but after CAHWs had been active for quite some time , in response to poor performance. 4.1.2 SC/US Liben & Liben and LVIA Moyale impact areas, no baseline survey was done. Thus, identification of local problems, descriptions of important diseases, and disease rankings were not carried out. Three communities, namely Borana, Guji, and Arsi and Geri , were covered during this mission in the two impac t areas, and it was found that each of them have diff erent local vernacular for describing diseases. Und er such circumstances, a participatory baseline survey would have been critical to identify locally impor tant problems, to understand local indigenous knowledge, and to prepare training based on the specific loca l descriptions of diseases. However, in Liben and Moy ale, in most cases, English names of diseases were used during the training. With regard to community dialogues, only one pre-tr aining community dialogue was carried out to inform local communities about the program and select cand idates for CAHW training. Neither post-training nor subsequent dialogues were conducted as part of the ongoing CAHWs performance monitoring. 4.1.3 CARE impact area In addition to the conventional baseline survey car ried out by STI LEAP in all its impact areas, CARE conducted a community needs identification and prio ritization workshop in each target PA. The workshop occurred over three consecutive days and w as carried out jointly with teams from other components of STI LEAP. Government counterparts wer e also involved in the exercises. Following general awareness-raising activities covering all c omponents of the STI LEAP, the following activities were accomplished regarding the more specific anima l health component during the 3-day workshops in each PA: /head2right Community needs identification and prioritization o f animal health problems /head2right Identification of appropriate solutions to address animal health constraints 9 /head2right Community identification of selection criteria for community committees (VSC and HAC) and CAHW candidates /head2right Community identification of animal diseases for eac h species of livestock, ranked according to their importance and with season of occurrence desc ribed In addition to this, minutes of community dialogues carried out in each target PA were properly compil ed and documented for reference. Generally speaking, the information gathering, the community dialogues and the time spent in each PA a s a part of the CAHW project design and establishment was very satisfactory. However, besides the rankin g done for each disease identified, it would have bee n good to identify the disease's impact on the anim al health and production. The status of existing anima l health service delivery in terms of accessibility , availability, quality etc. should also have been as sessed. Discussion Participatory baseline surveys and community dialog ues are important aspects in the design and establishment of a Community-Based Animal Health Pr ogram. However, this has not been carried out to the level required for meeting the national minimum standards in the cases of the Somali, Liben and Moyale impact areas. STI LEAP conducted a baseline survey for all sector s, including livestock, to assist in developing indicators and establishing performance targets for project monitoring and evaluation. However, the baseline survey was conducted using the conventiona l approach of a structured questionnaire, rather th an a more participatory approach. Pastoralists are usu ally suspicious about questions asked by outsiders, particularly when it comes to asking about how many livestock they own and how much income they get, as this is associated with tax collection and / or a traditional belief that counting animals is bad. Thus, it is common to face non-cooperation or to get erroneous information, leading to unreliable results. An additional constraint of the conventional survey is that it only explores pre-defined variables, and important variations or details can be missed. It a lso hinders community participation because of its inflexible nature. Participatory baseline surveys have multiple advant ages: they ensure that local problems, prioritizati ons, opportunities and constraints are taken into accoun t; they enhance community understanding of project objectives and activities and so create increased c ommitment to the project; and they are useful for identifying locally relevant indicators. In the design of a CAHW program a participatory (et hno-veterinary) baseline survey is an important component, serving the following purposes: Gathering information on existing indigenous veteri nary knowledge such as ethno description of disease, symptoms, and seasonal occurrences; and on the existing use and knowledge of conventional veterinary services and medicines Identifying and prioritizing common animal diseases that should be included in the CAHWs training manual Identifying and documenting community indicators th at can be used as milestones to measure the impact of the CAHW program. It has been determined that the required level of c ommunity dialogues were not facilitated, particular ly in Somali and Liben impact areas. At the beginning of the program, communities were simply told to selec t one person for the CAHW training. Community dialogu es should be a continuous process through which the community and development agents interact, disc uss, exchange ideas, and form opinions, so that the y can agree on the necessary modalities required for community development. In this case, dialogues hav e not been facilitated to this level. The demand for more CAHW training (in Dollo Ado & H argelle, Liben and Moyale impact areas), and the issues of salary / employment raised by some CA HWs (in Hargelle) likely reflect the poor pre-train ing 10 community dialogues, where communities were not inv olved in deciding the number of CAHWs to be trained per PA, and the role and benefits of the CA HWs were not communicated clearly. Therefore, considerable time should be devoted to p re-training community dialogues, to make sure that the communities are fully aware of the expected rol es of CAHWs and what incentives they might receive. If it is not made clear during the selection proces s that the CAHWs are part-time, private operators, they easily develop mistaken expectations and may even d emand salary from or employment with the project. In fact, this is one of the reasons that a CAHW dro pped out of service in Hargelle Woreda. 4.2 Selection of CAHWs All partners identified standard criteria for selec tion of CAHWs. However, the process used to facilit ate selection was different for each partner. In the ca se of Dollo, Hargelle, Liben & Moyale impact areas, communities were asked to select candidates based o n pre-defined criteria, rather than being given an opportunity to identify locally-relevant criteria. In contrast, in the case of CARE, a process was use d in which the communities and staff were each asked to identify what they perceived to be good criteria. In some of the PAs in Dollo Ado and Hargelle, polit icians and local administrators interfered to influ ence the selection process, and therefore, some of the C AHWs were selected without community support. Discussion The success of a community-based animal health prog ram depends on the careful selection of the candidates to be trained as community animal health workers. The strategy that the STI LEAP partners used was to come up with standard criteria for sele cting all training candidates. These selection crit eria were used in all impact areas, whether or not the c ommunity was consulted. Unfortunately, this approac h does not allow the community to determine the crite ria for selecting CAHWs. Project staff may have the ir own opinions about what criteria should be used to select successful CAHWs, based on standard criteria they have developed, or on successful experiences w ith CAHWs elsewhere. However, their views should not dominate the communities' opinions in determini ng the selection process. It was only in CARE impact area that communities were facilitated to id entify their own selection criteria, with the proje ct staff opinions being incorporated. This approach enhances community participation and commitment to the project, and gives the community greater influence over development work that affects their lives. Ability to read and write and good educational back ground was one of the criteria included in the list of CAHWs selection criteria. Although being literate is an advantage in some respects, field experience showed that literate CAHWs may use their training a s a stepping stone to obtaining better employment, and therefore are more likely to leave the communit y when they get a job opportunity. A good example o f this is the case of a CAHW from El Gof PA (Moyale-S omali) who joined a political party and is now based in Addis Ababa. Another issue that could be addressed more fully is equal gender representation. It is believed that t raining women as CAHWs will raise their profile within the society. However, it was only in the CARE impact area that women were trained as CAHWs. In Somali im pact area, religion was mentioned as a constraint making it difficult or impossible to take women awa y from their home areas for training. The fact that the training in all impact areas was carried out in tow ns could have discouraged the community from select ing women. Performance evaluation of the CAHWs in the C ARE impact area revealed that women are as competent as men. In fact, in some cases they are more competent than the male CAHWs, and are perceived to be more responsible and committed than the male CAHWs. Therefore, training of women as CAHWs should be encouraged through enhancing commun ity awareness about gender issues and, more practically, through conducting training in venues that are chosen by the community and that facilitat e women's involvement. There is a need to revisit the selection procedures of the CAHWs, and to involve the community in this process. Community-based approaches, where the init iation, planning, implementation and evaluation are controlled by the local communities, should be emph asized. If the communities are well-informed about the negative consequences of making wrong selection s, they will do all they can to select the right pe rson through a participatory system. 11 4.3 CAHWs training and technical support 4.3.1 SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area SC/US began implementing Community-Based Animal Hea lth services in the region in 1997. In Dollo Ado and Hargelle Woredas, 25 CAHWs (20 CAHWs traine d during the previous programs and 5 through STI LEAP) and 15 CAHWs (10 CAHWs trained during pre vious programs and 5 through STI LEAP) were trained, respectively. The total duration of CAHW training has been standa rdized and accepted by all STI LEAP partners. Initially, the training of CAHWs was to be given in three phases. After completing one phase, CAHWs were required to deliver services at least for 2-3 months, and successful performance (evaluated with a job performance assessment) was required in order to be allowed for the following training phase . At the end of the cycle, those who successfully completed all three phases of training were to be given a certifi cate. However, based on suggestions from the MOA/PACE thi s approach has recently been reduced to two phases. The trainings carried out during the LEAP p eriod are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

From Table 2 above it seems refresher trainings were not planned properly and w ere carried out haphazardly. In some cases, no refresher was given for over a year, and in one sit uation (Hargelle), two refresher courses were conducted over a very short time period for the sam e group. The number of CAHWs participating in the various refresher courses also varies, meaning that not all CAHWs attended all refresher courses. Consistency in the training duration and the method s for ensuring CAHW attendance should be given more consideration in the future. In addition, the number of participants per training session, particularly in refresher courses, was too large. L arge numbers do not allow for participatory trainin g to be conducted, and therefore the maximum recommen ded number of CAHWs per training session is 20. /head2right Training content and its relevance: Most of diseases mentioned as important by the com munity during the impact assessment were included in the t raining curriculum, and therefore, the training content was relevant to the problems of the livesto ck producers in the impact area. However, there were some additional diseases identified as importa nt by the community which should be included in the training in the future. /head2right The training approach and quality of the trainer: It seems that the trainings used lecture-based methods much more than hands-on-experiences. Most o f the CAHWs interviewed had their lecture notes and referred to their notes periodically when asked questions. Although the trainers- SC Animal Health Officers (AHO) and staff from the Department of Agriculture (DOA)- were trained as trainers (TOT) of CAHWs before conducting the trainings, the level of skill, particularly that of the Animal Health Technicians (AHT), is not sufficient for the m to conduct quality training. /head2right Training manual: STI LEAP partners have developed a standard trainin g manual providing basic knowledge about animal husbandry and diseases, thei r treatments, and about vaccinations. This was one of the strengths of the program; however, the m anual was not adapted to take local descriptions, seasonal occurrence patterns, and other local indig enous knowledge into consideration. The training manual was not also supported by illustrations wher e needed. /head2right Supply of starter kit after training: In Dollo Ado new CAHWs trained under STI LEAP progr am were not issued with starter kits following the com pletion of their training. Because of this, they ha d to wait for long time to start delivering services. This wait may have contributed in some cases to poor technical performance of the CAHWs. In additi on, it certainly delayed their ability to begin addressing the animal health demands of their commu nities. 4.3.2 SC/US Liben impact area SC-US started its animal health programme initially through providing direct financial and material support to government veterinary department during its Development Activity Program (DAP1). Direct implementation of animal health activities through training and support of Community-based animal health workers was started under DAP2 after DAP1 ph ased out. Nineteen CAHWs selected from Borona, Guji and Arsi communities have been trained under this programme. The assessment of the overall training and support provided to the CAHWs is summarized as follows: /head2right No. of active CAHWs and dropouts: all CAHWs are operational although some as in the c ase of the CAHW from Bul Bul Kebele /PA who is not available most of the time. This CAHW has his second family leaving in Negele town and consequent ly he was not available to provide services for livestock keepers regularly. The selection of this CAHW is against the selection principle for successful CAHWs. /head2right Duration of training, no. & frequency of refresher trainings & no of participants: Duration of the initially training and the number of participan ts were in line with the recommended standard. This review was conducted shortly after the CAHWs have c ompleted their second phase of the training to complete their CAHWs training, and refresher traini ng is planned to be conducted with in the next couple of months. 13 /head2right Training content and its relevance: Most of the diseases identified by the community du ring the impact assessment exercise of this mission have bee n included in the training of the CAHWs curriculum, and thus relevant to the animal health needs of the community. /head2right The training approach and quality of the trainer: the training approach was participatory by large although the use of training aids were limited. The trainers were Veterinarians who have been trained themselves on Participatory Training Techniques. /head2right Training manual: training manual that was standardized and implement ed by STI LEAP partners have been used in this case. The training manual wa s prepared based on the local names and description of diseases used among Borana community and English. However, the adoption of the manual did not take in to consideration the differe nces in local disease vernacular and description of the three communities from which the CAHWs have bee n selected and trained. Basically the three communities in the project (Borana, Guji and Arsi) speak the same language (Oromiffa), however, it has been noticed during this review that they use d ifferent local name and description for some of the diseases. /head2right Supply of starter kit after training: it was found that all CAHWs were issued with starte r kit following the completion of each phase of the train ing, except that supply of accaricides have been delayed for long time due to logistical reasons. It has been also found that some equipment supplied to the CAHWs (e.g. Burdizzo) were not of good quali ty and not functional. /head2right Training venue: the trainings were conducted in Negele town and thi s is not in line with the recommended approach. 4.3.3 LVIA impact area LVIA started implementing an animal health program in Moyale Woreda in 1998. Since then, 28 CAHWs (20 on the Somali side and 8 on the Oromia side of the Woreda) have been trained. Out of the 20 CAHWs from the Somali side, 7 were trained in the F aculty of Veterinary Medicine of Addis Ababa University under a previous program. The remaining 13 on the Somali side and the 8 CAHWs on the Oromia side were trained locally under STI LEAP fun ding, based on the three phase training approach adopted by STI leap partners. An inventory of the n umber of CAHWs trained and the duration of the trainings is shown in Table 3 below. 14 Table 3. Summarized number and type of CAHW trainings in LV IA impact area.

Seven PAs out of 20 in Moyale-Somali a nd 3 PAs out of 8 in Moyale-Oromia have been included in this assessment. Unfortunatley, only 3 CAHWs from Moyale-Somali side, two of them working in the CAHWs association drug shop in Moyal e & El lay, and the third running a personal veterinary drug business in El lay, were reached du ring this assessment. The remaining 4 CAHWs were not in their PA. Through community discussion s it was discovered that one CAHW (from Bede PA) left the community and settled in another PA, l eaving all his veterinary equipment and drugs behind. Another CAHW (from El Gof) joined a politic al party and during this assessment he was in Addis Ababa. The community in both affected PAs not ed that there has been no veterinary service delivery for over a year. In the other 3 PAs, altho ugh the CAHWs were said to live within their respective areas, they were said to be inactive bec ause they did not have the needed drug supply. In Moyale-Oromia side all 3 CAHWs visited seemed to be active. /head2right Duration of training, no. & frequency of refresher trainings & no. of participants: The first CAHWs (7) from Somali side were trained continuousl y for 3 months. Later, following the initiatives taken by STI LEAP partners to standardize CAHW trai ning, LVIA also adopted the three-phase approach of training. In this case, the number of t raining days covered for basic trainings seems to b e within the agreed-upon range (15-20 days), except f or one occasion in which the 3 rd Phase for Moyale-Somali training was conducted in only 10 day s. All participants attended all consecutive training phases. It seems that there was no refresher course organiz ed for the CAHWs trained under STI LEAP program. This has definitely contributed to the poo r performance of these CAHWs. /head2right Training content and its relevance: Most of the diseases identified by the community du ring the impact assessment exercise of this mission were inc luded in the training curriculum, and thus the training was relevant to the animal health needs of the community. /head2right The training approach and quality of the trainer: The training of the first 7 CAHWs (trained under the previous program) was carried out by prof essors from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Addis Ababa University for three months. In the awareness of the consultan t, this is 15 the first training of this kind (within the Univers ity) in the history of CAHW training. It is obvious that training methodology and approaches are excell ent in such institutions, but participatory trainin g approaches cannot be expected. Training of the following CAHWs (13 CAHWs in Somal i and 8 in Oromia side) was carried out locally by the LVIA Animal health officer and by th e previously trained CAHWs. It has been noted that a 3-day TOT was given to the trainers before t hey conducted the CAHW training. However, in consultant's experience, there is no effective TOT for CAHW trainers that can be given in 3 days, and the minimum number of days required to conduct TOT for a CAHW trainer is 7 days. Therefore, it is impossible to say that the trainers acquired the sk ills, knowledge and attitudinal change required to implement a participatory approach. Moreover, it ha s been uncovered through discussion with one of the previously trained CAHWs who attended the 3 day TOT (Ali Shi Kero from Dokio PA) that most of the training sessions during the later training of the 13 Moyale-Somali CAHWs were taught by the previous CAHWs rather than by the veterinarians. Th erefore, the training approach and the quality of the trainer did not meet the minimum standards. /head2right Training manual: LVIA has adopted training manual that was standardi zed and used by STI LEAP partners to train all CAHWs except those trained in the University. /head2right Supply of starter kit after training: All CAHWs were issued with starter kits following t he completion of each phase of training. /head2right Training venue: Some CAHWs were trained in the University and other s in Moyale and pre-urban towns such as El Lay and Tuka . 4.3.4 CARE impact area One hundred and four CAHWs (Dire -44, Yabello- 38 a nd Teltele - 22) have been trained and supported by CARE. In Dire, out of the 44 CAHWs, 16 were trai ned under CARE-BVRI Program, 11 by GTZ, and 17 by STI LEAP; in Teltele all 22 CAHWs were traine d under STI LEAP; and in Yabello, out of the 38 CAHWs 12 were trained under AFD operation area, 14 under CARE-BVRI program and 12 under STI LEAP. All CAHWs had completed all phases of the tra ining except in Teltele Woreda, where phase III training of 15 CAHWs was about to start when this a ssessment was undertaken (see further discussion below). The recommendation from AU/IBAR and the National Ve terinary Department to reduce the number of training phases to 2 has not been accepted by the g overnment counterpart in Oromia Region until recently. Therefore, all CAHWs completed all three phases of the training except in Teltele where trai ning of 15 CAHWs was delayed due to the government requi rement that a CAHW be able to read and write before he/she continues on to the next phases of th e training. CARE has been giving adult literacy training to illiterate CAHWs in order to qualify th em to complete the trainings. Training of the remai ning 15 CAHWs in Teltele Woreda was underway during this mission to complete the 2 nd and last phase of the training (based on the recent change made to requir e only two phases). Issues that arose from the training and technical s upport assessment: /head2right No. of active CAHWs and dropouts: Out of the total of 104 CAHWs trained and supported by CARE, 2 CAHWs dropped out. One dropped out due to poor performance, and the other was forbidden to work and expelled from the PA by the c ommunity because of his involvement in a traditionally forbidden pre-marital sexual affair. In addition, one female CAHW passed away due to a natural illness. All of these cases were in Dire W oreda. /head2right Duration of training, no. & frequency of refresher trainings & no. of participants: It was found that all CAHWs except those in Teltele completed al l phases of the basic training and the training duration was 15-20 days. 16 /head2right Training content and its relevance: Most of the diseases identified by the community du ring the impact assessment exercise of this mission were inc luded in the training of the CAHWs curriculum, and thus training was relevant to the animal health needs of the community. /head2right The training approach and quality of the trainer : The training used in the CARE implementation area was fully based on a participatory approach. T raining aids such as illustrative pictures /drawing s, photos, live animals, etc., were used. Trainers fro m the government and CARE, including Veterinarians and Animal Health Assistants, attende d a 2-week TOT prior to conducting the CAHW training. The training was organized and facilitate d by the Pan-African Campaign for the Control of Epizootic and Ministry of Agriculture (PACE/MOA) an d AU/IBAR/CAPE. The training of the CAHWs was therefore facilitated by trainers experie nced with participatory training techniques (PTT). /head2right Training manual: The standard training manual developed by STI LEAP partners and government counterpart in Oromia region was adapted to take in to account local animal health needs and problems, indigenous knowledge, and commonly-used d isease vernacular and descriptions. /head2right Supply of starter kit after training: All CAHWs interviewed during this mission noted tha t they were issued starter kit following the completion of each of the training phases and were able to immediately begin delivering services to their resp ective communities. /head2right Training venue: In all cases, the CAHW trainings were carried out i n towns (Dubuluk, Yabello- SORDU meeting hall, Teltele town etc...). Communities were not consulted or involved in the venue selection. The advantages and disadvantages of hold ing CAHWs training in town were discussed with CARE STI LEAP staff during this mission, and as a r esult all have agreed that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Absences and latenesses fo r the training sessions, getting drunk and chewing chat, poor participation, and a lack of sufficient animal disease cases for practical purposes were so me of the problems observed during the trainings held in town. Proximity to the office and other facilities was mentioned as a logistical advantage of the town venues. Discussion A certain number of drop-outs is inevitable and as the program learns more about the areas in which it is working, gaps in coverage will emerge. It is necess ary for each program area to reassess the number an d distribution of active animal health workers on an annual basis. Gaps should be verified through community dialogue, inactive CAHWs formally dismiss ed, and additional individuals selected for CAHW training as appropriate. A balance needs to be reac hed between meeting the community's demand for new personnel and the practical and efficiency needs of the program. In Dollo Ado, Hargelle and Moyale, communities and CAHWs have both expressed the need for more training and refresher courses of CAHWs in all PAs. Currently, there is only one CAHW per PA, and most of the PAs are too vast to be covered by one C AHW. Thus, most CAHWs are not able to provide services throughout their respective communities. T herefore, there appears to be a need to train addit ional CAHWs, particularly in areas where the CAHWs have d ropped out and service provision has stopped completely, as in the case of Bergel PA (Hargelle W oreda) and Bede PA (Moyale Woreda) where the CAHWs are not living with their respective communit ies any more. Although all STI LEAP partners have agreed to stand ardize the duration of training, it seems there is still a lack of consistency. It is also clear that in mos t cases, there has been a limited number of refresh er trainings, and in the case of LVIA, there has been none. On-the-job support and capacity-building at t he field level were insufficiently carried out in all impact areas except CARE. Personal experiences of CAHWs show that it is not necessary to have trainin g that is divided into 2 or 3 phases. CAHW training should be given for 15-20 days, focusing on the 5 m ost important animal diseases for each species according to previously completed community ranking s. It is essential that refresher trainings be plan ned and conducted in a timely fashion, based on finding s and problems observed during the regular field monitoring. Regular on-the-job monitoring and techn ical support in the field is a key strategy that ne eds to be used to build the technical capacity and conf idence of the CAHWs, and provide immediate solution s to any problems encountered by CAHWs. Field monitor ing also enables staff to identify CAHW training 17 gaps, problems, and additional diseases, which can be addressed in the refresher training. Overall, we ll- planned regular field monitoring and refresher trai nings need to be given more attention in the future . It is recommended that a veterinarian, or at least an animal health assistant, should facilitate CAHW training, and it is essential that these individual s be well-trained and experienced in participatory training techniques. Contrary to this recommendation, in Som ali impact areas, animal health technicians (Dollo & Hargelle), and even CAHWs (Moyale), have been given major roles in carrying out the training. Their contribution as support providers should not be und ermined or discouraged, but they should not take pa rt in facilitating key portions of the training. The initiative taken by STI LEAP partners to standa rdize the CAHW training manual is commendable. However, some of the partners have adopted the manu al without adapting it to include the specific loca l disease situation, the indigenous knowledge, and th e local disease vernacular and descriptions. In gen eral, the manual is of good standard, though the introduc tions to each topic could be improved, and the manual should include easy-to-understand illustrati ons and drawings where possible. Failure to supply starter kits at the end of the CA HWs training session has been a problem in Dollo Ad o. If CAHWs are not able to start delivering services immediately following their training they forget so me knowledge and lose some of the techniques and skill s they have learned. Thus, their confidence and competence is reduced, and they can lose respect an d support from the community. Such problems were directly observed in the field during this mission. In future, attention should be given to these logi stical issues so that CAHWs go back to their communities w ith starter kits after their training. It is highly recommended that CAHW training be carr ied out in an area close to the community and in their natural environment and traditional settings, rather than in towns or universities. The disadvan tage of bringing trainees to town was clearly observed in C ARE's experience, and their experience was similar to that of other partners. In addition to avoiding the problems mentioned above, conducting the training in a location close to the community and the livestock g razing areas provides an opportunity for the community to participate in the training process th rough lending their animals for practical use. When trainings are conducted within the community, the c ommunity will contribute towards training costs in- kind and will be able to see the training process. This will enhance communities' confidence in the CAHWs' skills and will help develop community owner ship of the program. 4.4 CAHW performance Technical competence, the extent of CAHW coverage, and the range of services provided by CAHWs were assessed during this mission. Drug kits and CA HW records were also inspected. At least one CAHW was interviewed in each PA visited, and their perfo rmance was assessed on the basis of pre-prepared checklists (Annex 4). Secondary information was col lected from the clients, from a review of records o f services provided, and from soliciting the views of project staff. 4.4.1 Technical competence 4.4.1.1 SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area 30% of the interviewed CAHWs rated below average (p oor or very poor) in their capacity to demonstrate skills and knowledge taught during their training ( Figure 2). The fact that the training was mainly le cture- based is a likely reason for such poor technical pe rformance, given that skills and knowledge acquired through a participatory and practical training appr oach are not as easily forgotten. The poor particip atory training skill of the trainers is therefore an impo rtant factor. Most of the training was conducted by Animal Health Technicians (6 month Agarfa-trained p rofessionals). Although they attended a TOT course (facilitated by a SC/US animal health officer), the y are not skilled enough to train CAHWs. A second problem that contributed to poor technical competen ce was the long delay in starter kit supply, particularly to the CAHWs in Dollo Ado Woreda, a de lay that likely further reduced the confidence and competence in some of the techniques learned. A thi rd factor contributing to the reduced skill level o f the CAHWs was the lack of planned and regular monitorin g and refresher training. Despite these constraints , 70% of the CAHWs were found to be fully competent ( good or very good) in the skills and techniques taught. 18 0 1 2 3 4 5 6Assessment level No. of CAHWs Very poor Poor Good Very good Figure 2. Relative technical competence of CAHWs in Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area. 4.4.1.2 SC/US Liben impact area 20% of the interviewed CAHWs rated below average (p oor or very poor) in their capacity to demonstrate skills and knowledge taught during their training ( Figure 3). The CAHWs in this impact area were selec ted from three different ethnic groups, namely the Bora na, Guji and Arsi, and were trained together. Altho ugh the three communities basically speak the same lang uage, they have different local vernacular and description of diseases. The training manual did no t take into consideration these variations; instead , all CAHWs were forced to learn the names of diseases an d their descriptions using the Borana dialect or English. There is no question that major difference s in local naming of disease would lead to confusio n and ultimately, to poor understanding. In such case s, it is advisable to conduct the training locally. Limited refresher courses and on-the-job technical support were additional factors resulting in poor performan ce. However, 80% of the interviewed CAHWs were found to be competent (good or very good). 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7Assessment level No. of CAHWs Very poor Poor Good Very Good Figure 3. Relative technical competence of CAHWs in Liben impact area. 4.4.1.3 LVIA impact area Out of the 10 PAs (7 in Moyale-Somali & 3 in Moyale -Oromia) visited only 6 CAHWs (3 from each side) were reached during this mission. The 3 CAHWs inter viewed from Moyale -Somali side were all working in drug shops (2 of them in CAHW cooperative drug s hops in Moyale and El lay, and the third working in his own drug shop in El lay town). Most of the CAHW s from Moyale-Somali side were not reached for the interview. Therefore, a representative sample s ize was not obtained, and it is therefore impossibl e to 19 generalize about the technical competence of CAHWs in the impact area. However, the technical competence of those contacted CAHWs varied from poo r (as in the case of the CAHW in Mudhiambo PA, Oromia side, who was not able to explain dosage s of antibiotics properly), to very good (as in the case of the two CAHWs working in the cooperative drug sh ops in Moyale & El Lay). 4.4.1.4 CARE impact area Fifteen CAHWs were interviewed in the CARE impact a rea because there are 3 CAHWs trained per PA and all CAHWs who were present in their PA during t he visit were contacted. 93% of the interviewed CAHWs rated above average (good or very good) in th eir technical competence (Figure 4). No CAHW in this impact area was evaluated as very poor in his/ her technical skills. All interviewed CAHWs were ab le to answer questions asked from memory, without the need to refer to notes. For that matter, no CAHW was seen to be carrying lecture notes. This indicat es that the training approach, monitoring and techn ical support in the field was carried out properly. 0 2 4 6 8 10 Assessment level No. of CAHWs Very poor Poor Good Very good Figure 4. Relative technical competence of CAHWs in CARE impact area. 20 4.4.2 Ranges of services provided by CAHWs CAHWs are having a significant impact on the level of treatment and vaccination services used by livestock herders in their respective communities. In all impact areas most CAHWs are providing a comprehensive ranges of services that includes trea tment of internal and external parasites, infectiou s diseases, Trypanosomosis, vaccination against vario us diseases, and and Hargelle impact area 80% of CAHWs were perceived to offer most of the se rvices covered in their training curriculum, whereas the remaining 20% were offering a more limi ted range of services (see Figure 5). The main constraint, mentioned by both the CAHWs and the com munities, was the supply of veterinary drugs; this was particularly a problem in Dollo Ado Woreda, eit her because drugs were not supplied as a starter ki t, or because CAHWs have failed to restock their kit. The drug kits were inspected during the visit, and most of them did not have sufficient drugs. From interv iews, it seems that some CAHWs do not have the cost recovery money needed to buy more drugs. In spite o f their limited drug supply, CAHW activities are no t limited to treatment and vaccination. They also pr ovide advice and create awareness and community mobilization for vaccination campaigns. With regard to coverage, the CAHWs provide services to all species of animals except donkeys and poultry, because both the community and the CAHWs h ave only very limited knowledge of donkey and poultry diseases. All members of the community, irr espective of their wealth, location, gender or ethn icity, use the services provided by the CAHWs. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6Assessment level No. of CAHWs Very poor Poor Good Very good Figure 5. Range of services provided by CAHWs in Do llo Ado & Hargelle impact areas. 4.4.2.2 SC/US Liben impact area 80% of CAHWs were perceived to offer most of the se rvices covered in their training curriculum, while the remaining 20% were offering a more limited rang e (see Figure 6). Shortage of drug supply was mentioned overwhelmingly as a major constraint. Mos t of the CAHWs have very few drugs, both in quantity and type. All CAHWs have been supplied wit h starter kits and almost all were ready to restock their kits, but there was no drug source, either th rough the project or through other means. During this mission, it was learned that SC/US had established a revolving fund for drugs managed by t he government veterinary department (through DAP 1). H owever, it seems, according to a discussion with the government veterinarian (animal health section head), that the amount of money in the revolving fu nd has diminished from the initial capital due to mism anagement of the fund. Moreover, procurement of drugs was usually constrained by government bureauc racy. Occasionally, even when drugs were available , animal health officers working in the government di spensaries were not willing to sell drugs to CAHWs. 21 0 1 2 3 4 5 6Assessment level No. of CAHWs Very poor Poor Good Very Good Figure 6. Range of services provided by CAHWs in Li ben impact area. 4.4.2.3 LVIA impact area In the case of LVIA, the range of services provided by the CAHWs was assessed on the basis of information given by the community since CAHWs in m ost of the PAs visited were not reached and could not be interviewed. According to the communit y, 70% of the CAHWs were offering most of the services covered in their training curriculum, whil e the remaining 30% were offering more limited serv ices (Figure 7). Shortage of drugs was mentioned as the major problem limiting the activity of CAHWs, whil e other issues mentioned included poor quality drugs (for example acaricide) and faulty equipment (for example large animal burdizzo) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6Assessment level No. of CAHWs Very poor Poor Good Very good Figure 7. Range of services provided by CAHWs in LV IA impact area. 4.4.2.4 CARE impact area More than 93% of the CAHWs were perceived as offeri ng most of the activities covered in their training , including disease reporting, providing advice, and creating community awareness about disease preventi on (Figure 8), while the remaining 7% offered a more l imited range of services. The reason given for off ering more limited services was that some of the CAHWs fa iled to buy more drugs upon finishing their initial supply. 22 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Assessment level No. of CAHWs Very poor Poor Good Very good Figure 8. Range of services provided by CAHWs in CA RE impact area. 4.5 CAHWs Cooperatives Establishment of CAHW cooperatives has been used as a strategy to ensure continuity of the community animal health activity. SC/US and its partners have facilitated the establishment of CAHW cooperatives in all target Woredas and provided start up capital (b oth in-kind and in-cash), including veterinary drug s and equipment, office furniture and other minor costs. Cooperatives visited during this mission included Dollo Ado, Hargelle, Moyale-Somali, Dire and Yabell o. All of these cooperatives have been registered and issued certificates by their respective governm ent departments to operate to support community- based animal health activities. Capacity-building t raining (covering business and cooperative manageme nt) has been given to members of executive committees. It has been noted that a CAHW cooperative in the rest of Somali impact area (outside of Moyale) has been established, and two cooperatives, one in Moy ale - Oromia side and one in Teltele Woreda, in LVIA an d CARE impact areas respectively, are in the process of being established. The cooperatives were established to undertake the following main activities: Consistently supply necessary animal health drugs, in sufficient quantity and quality Liaise with NGOs and other government organizations Provide technical assistance to members, and upgrad e the capacity of members through training and information sharing Serve as a discussion forum for members Identify and solve members' problems Each cooperative was assessed in light of these obj ectives, and the results are presented as follows: 4.5.1 SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area The Dollo Ado Cooperative is the oldest cooperative (more than 5 years of age), and yet it still isn't operating independently. Despite the strong technic al, financial and material inputs provided by SC/US , this cooperative seems behind in development. It i s too early to comment conclusively about the Harge lle Cooperative because it was very recently establishe d. But generally speaking, it seems that it is not undertaking, even partially, the activities it was established to carry out. Some of the observed cons traints of the two cooperatives include: Drug supply: The cooperatives still depend on SC/US to identify drug sources from Addis Ababa or Gode, to buy the drugs, and to transport them to th e area. The cooperatives are not paying any portion of the cost of transporting the drugs, and thus they are receiving a hidden subsidy. This hinders future financial sustainability of the syst em and the cooperative will certainly disintegrate upon withdrawal of the implementing organization's suppo rt. Meanwhile, a drug supply shortage by CAHWs cooperative has created a serious drug shorta ge in the field, most critically in Dollo Ado Woreda. 23 Technical support: The cooperatives are established by CAHWs and all have basically the same limited level of technical skills and knowledge. Th erefore, they still depend on SC/US for technical advice and support. The DOA is incapable of taking on this responsibility because of structural instability, and a lack of logistical and financial inputs. Accountability: Despite several cooperative managem ent trainings given to the executive committees, this mission found that the two cooperatives lack t ransparency: there were no meetings of the members, and members of the executive committee wer e usually not available in their office to support the CAHWs. By-laws are not strictly follo wed and several issues were mentioned as critical problems, including a lack of trust among members, a lack of regular financial auditing, and poor communication between members and executive members . These were more serious problems in Dollo Ado. The Hargelle cooperative is very new and it is therefore too early to comment on issues of accountability. 4.5.2 SC/US Liben impact area In the Liben impact area, the CAHWs are in the proc ess of establishing their cooperatives, and therefo re, there is nothing to report. 4.5.3 LVIA impact area LVIA supported the establishment of two CAHW cooper atives, one for CAHWs in Moyale-Somali side and one for Moyale-Oromia side. The Oromia CAHWs' c ooperative was in the process of being established and registered during this mission. The refore, there is nothing to report except that they have received training on various aspects of cooperative management. The Moyale - Somali CAHW Cooperative was establishe d in June 2004. The cooperative is well-organized and financial management systems are in place and f unctioning properly. The cooperative has opened two drug shops, in Moyale and El lay towns, both purcha sing drugs from Addis Ababa. It is clearly independent of LVIA and other institutions in terms of drug sourcing, and there are no hidden cost subsidies. The fact that they are working effectiv ely on a free market basis is an indicator of stren gth. The CAHWs are linked to the cooperatives for activi ty and disease reporting, although this was very irregular and decreasing over time as a result of r educed CAHW activity in the field (see concerns, be low). Despite their overall strength, there are some inte rnal and external concerns constraining the achievements of the Moyale-Somali cooperative. Thes e are as follows: /head2right Both drug shops in Moyale and El lay town were well -equipped with the necessary drugs and had a consistent supply; however, the CAHWs were not rest ocking upon finishing their stock of drugs. Instead, many CAHWs had used the cost recovery mone y from their initial starter kit for personal use. The major clients of the cooperative are indiv iduals from the communities who buy drugs directly from the cooperative drug shops. The cooperative's prices are the same for the community and the CAHWs. Thus, for the community, it is more expensiv e to purchase drugs from the CAHWs (with a profit margin for the CAHW added on the top of the cooperative price), and the community refuses to buy from the CAHWs. With no business, the CAHWs have become less motivated, and many have gradually stopped working. The second concern is that the handling and use of drugs by untrained community members poses unwanted risks such as misuse and mishandling of dr ugs, which could lead to drug resistance, among other problems. It seems that the CAHW cooperative is focused on buying and selling drugs for profit, at the expense of supporting service delive ry through CAHWs. Obviously, this conflicts with the objectives of the project. /head2right The two drug shops are currently managed by members who rotate in turn for one month each, receiving a paid allowance of 10 Birr per day for t heir efforts. The problem with this structure is th at animal health services are interrupted for one mont h in a given community while the CAHW is managing the shop. During this mission, for example , the community in Dokiso PA complained about the absence of their CAHW, who was in Moyale drug shop on duty. There is only one trained 24 CAHW per PA, and particularly in larger PAs, there is little chance of the service being covered by a CAHW in a neighboring PA. /head2right The CAHWs have not had any technical support for ov er a year, since the LEAP program implemented by LVIA was phased out. There has been no system created to provide ongoing technical support and supervision, and therefore, t here is no technical sustainability within the CAHW group. Unfortunately, the cooperative has not tried to address the problem of inactive CAHWs who are neither buying drugs nor providing services to their communities. /head2right Circulation of cheap and illegal drugs, lack of tra nsport facilities for distributing drugs, and lack of capital for expanding the business were mentioned b y members as major constraints affecting their business. /head2right There has been no general meeting of the members to date, and consequently, members do not have information about the financial status or progress made by the cooperative. This leads to similar problems as in the case of Dollo Ado and Hargelle. 4.5.4 CARE impact area Two CAHW cooperatives in Dire and Yabello have been established and are operational. In addition to providing each cooperative with start-up capital in the form of in-kind drugs and equipment, CARE buil t and provided a drug store. Both the Yabello and Dir e cooperatives started to operate relatively recent ly, within the past 6 months. Thus, the cooperatives ar e still in the process of setting up operational sy stems such as financial procedures and record keeping, am ong other structures. Initially, members agreed that the drug shops would be managed by members of the executive committees on a monthly rotation, with an allowance of 30 Birr per day for the 2 days per week which are market days. After considering the work load on the execu tive members, and in order to avoid their absence from their villages and ensure continuous availabil ity of veterinary services, they later agreed to em ploy an outsider to manage each drug shop for a salary of 2 00 Birr per month. The CAHW cooperatives have made a contractual agree ment with a locally operating private animal health worker to ensure a drug supply. Under this a greement, they order their drugs through the privat e business establishment, and in turn sell to the CAH Ws. The cooperative and the private business worker agreed that drugs would be supplied to the cooperat ive at a lower price when they were bought in bulk. The cooperative then sells the drugs to CAHWs with a small profit margin added for the cooperative. Even with this profit margin added, the unit price is lower that the price of the private business own er. This discourages the livestock producers from buyin g directly from the private business worker. It therefore maintains the CAHWs' business incentives and motivates them to continue their services. Technical support is still linked with the project and veterinary department (SORDU). The CAHWs also still submit activity reports to the project unlike in the case of the Somali impact areas, where CAHW s report to their respective cooperatives. Discussion The CAHW cooperatives visited at the three impact a reas are at different stages of development. Given that the Dollo Ado cooperative is the oldest, it is surprising that it hasn't achieved the objectives for which it was established: to provide sustainable communit y based animal health services (including a consist ent drug supply) to the community. On the contrary, bes ides its inability to ensure sustainable drug suppl y, it is facing many of the challenges which contribute t o cooperatives' failure. These include poor accountability, lack of transparency and poor commu nication about financial issues between members, lack of trust, and a prioritization of individual i nterest over group interest. Currently, these prob lems were not observed in the other cooperatives, but this is likely because all of the rest were established le ss than a year ago, and have only just started operating. Ho wever, sooner or later, it is inevitable that all cooperatives will experience similar problems, and these issues may cause a total failure in meeting o verall program objectives. An approach based on the involv ement of the private sector is recommended (see section 5.4) 25 4.6 Monitoring and Evaluation of the CBAHWs Program SC/US and its partners have standardized the CAHW p erformance monitoring format. The content of the format largely satisfies the information needs of the various stakeholders of the community-based animal health projects. However, it was prepared ba sed on structured questionnaire leading to a 'yes' or 'no' response, and therefore does not encourage the participation of the person being interviewed. Consequently, important details may be missed. Vete rinary Supervising Committees (VSCs) have been established and trained to monitor and assist the C AHW activities in all impact areas. In this assessment, whether monitoring was carried out, the number and frequency of monitoring visits, who was involved in the monitoring and evaluation, and the performance of the VSCs have been assessed. Assessment was carried out through discussion with the community and CAHWs, through examination of the technical competence of CAHWs' skills, and thro ugh a review of record keeping and reporting, including completed CAHW monitoring forms. The find ings are outlined below. 4.6.1 SC/US Dollo and Hargelle, and Liben impact ar eas In general, there was no clear monitoring and evalu ation system designed or implemented as part of the project management system. Although participants s aid that the standardized CAHW performance monitoring form was being used, there was no indica tion that this had been done. Monitoring visits had been planned on a monthly basis initially following the training of CAHWs, and on a quarterly basis afterwards. Monitoring sheets for individual CAHWs were supposed to be completed during each of these monitoring visits and kept for future follow-up and tracking of improvements. However, during this mission, it was not possible to see a completed rec ord for any of the CAHWs, suggesting that monitorin g had not been done (or had not been done consistentl y). Treatment and financial records of most of the CAHWs visited in the field were not up to date or c onsistent. In addition, most of them did not have drugs and their equipment (Burdizzo) is not functio ning. Monitoring and evaluation of CAHWs is carried out haphazardly in response to problems observed in a workshop setting, rather than being done regular ly through observations of CAHWs who are on-the-job. The community was not aware of their role within th e monitoring of the project. Although VSCs had been selected and given a mandate to monitor CAHWs, in most places they were not undertaking their responsibilities properly. They had never questione d why CAHWs were not active. Community participation in the monitoring of the project scor ed very low (see section 4.7.2.1.1), indicating a l evel of monitoring that is insufficient. This remains a gr eat concern and a weakness of the program. 4.6.2 LVIA impact area Monitoring of CAHWs was carried out through occasio nal visits to the CAHWs in their respective areas and through discussions with the community. The sta ndardized monitoring format developed by partners had not been introduced at all. There was no clearl y defined M&E system designed or established. In fa ct, following the completion of the STI LEAP-funded pro ject there was no monitoring and technical support provided to the CAHWs in the field. The fact that s ustainability of monitoring and technical support a fter the project period was not ensured is an indication of a poor exit strategy. Final evaluations and impact assessments were carri ed out from 15-25 of June 2004. The impact assessment was carried out in only 3 PAs (Kebeles); namely Lagasurie (Ormia side), El Gof and Arda-ola (both Somali side) out of the total 28 PAs (8 in Or omia and 20 in Somali Region) covered under the program. Because the number of PAs was so small, it may not be a representative sample. A minimum of 10 PAs (informant groups) should be covered in a sp ecified project area to reach any valid conclusions . The current participatory impact assessment was car ried out in 10 PAs (3 in Oromia and 7 in Somali sid e), and communities and CAHWs were appreciative that th ey were being asked about the project and the problems they were having. Lack of veterinary drugs in the field, personal use of cost recovery money by almost all CAHWs, and inconsistent and incomplete record keeping by CAHWs all indicate insufficient ongoing monitoring. In the case of one CAHW (Guyo Godo - in Mudhiambo PA, Moyale -Oromia), drugs issued as a starter kit 26 had not been used and were found expired, indicatin g that monitoring even during the life of the proje ct was not strong enough. 4.6.3 CARE impact area A monitoring and evaluation structure for the Commu nity-based Animal Health System, along with a CAHW performance monitoring sheet, has been develop ed and implemented by CARE. The monitoring and evaluation system and CAHW performance monitori ng form have been annexed in the \"Community- based Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) Training Manual for Borana and Guji Lowlands,\" reviewed in December 2004. While the system of M&E used was goo d compared to the other STI LEAP partners (where M&E didn't exist at all) some limitations we re observed, including: /head2right The various information needed by each of the range of stakeholders was not included in \"what to monitor & evaluate\"; /head2right It seems as though the community & private animal h ealth workers were not included in the M&E, despite the fact that they were identified as stakeholders by the project. As an indication of this, in the stakeholders' participation analysis, community and private animal health workers' participation in monitoring was rated as moderate a nd low, respectively. /head2right The M&E method does not indicate the use of partici patory methodologies. Similarly, the CAHWs' performance monitoring format included the major indicators for assessing whether or not CAHWs were successful; however, issu es or information needs for each of the indicators, the sources of information, the methodologies to be used to collect the information, and how and who was to analyze and use the information were not cle arly defined. Despite the limitations, there was evidence that mo nitoring was undertaken in the project. CAHW performance monitoring was carried out every month for three months following the completion of each phase of the training and on quarterly basis therea fter. Each monitoring visit was carried out jointly with the veterinary department, the performance monitori ng form for each CAHW was completed, and records were kept in the project office. Discussion In the STI LEAP proposal it says that \"The M&E offi cer will be responsible for the design and implementation of the monitoring and evaluation sys tem that is consistent with SC/US Ethiopia's overal l M&E system.\" However, there was no clear M&E system designed and implemented in Somali and Liben impact areas for the CBAHP. Reduced performance of CAHWs, failure of the CAHWs to replenish their drug kits, inconsistent record-keeping and poor rep orting of CAHWs, and weakening of CAHW cooperatives have been noted as some of the consequ ences of a lack of regular monitoring and field supervision in some of the impact areas. In contras t, in the CARE impact area, there has been an initi ative to design and implement an M&E system, although it needs some improvement. Participatory M&E and impact assessment is part and parcel of the Project Management Cycle (PCM) in community-based projects. Project M&E is part of th e learning process, in which the lessons learned fe ed back into improvement and development of the projec t. Therefore, in the future, an M&E system that addresses the following issues should be designed a nd implemented: /head2right Who should be involved in M&E (all stakeholders)? /head2right What information should be collected to address the needs of the various stakeholders? /head2right What methods should be used to collect the informat ion? /head2right How frequently should the information be collected? /head2right Who should analyze the information, and when? /head2right Who will use the information? Skills and knowledge of staff and partner organizat ions regarding M&E seems to be poor in some of the impact areas, and unsatisfactory in others. Therefo re, attention should be given to enhance this capac ity in the future. 27 4.7. Sustainability and exit strategy of the CBAHWs Program In this section, factors that affect the sustainabi lity of the Community-Based Animal Health Workers system have been assessed, including the appropriat eness of the exit strategy. Policy environment, community participation, CAHWs' technical competenc e, financial sustainability and other factors have been identified and examined extensively. 4.7.1 Policy issues There has been a significant improvement in governm ent policy at both the Federal and Regional levels regarding CAHWs and veterinary privatization. At th e Federal level a community-based animal health workers and participatory epidemiology unit has bee n established with the aim to standardize, monitor, and provide support to community-based animal healt h programs in the country. The same approach has been adopted in Somali Nation al Regional State, and therefore, CAHWs have been recognized as part of the veterinary service d elivery system in the region. The government has realized that it is incapable of reaching livestock herders in remote areas, and therefore has started using CAHWs to bring veterinary drugs and vaccines closer to these communities. The fact that the government sells drugs to CAHWs in Dollo Ado & Hargelle Woreda s is one indicator of their acceptance of the CAHW system. Similarly, in Oromia National Regional State, CAHWs have been accepted in principle as the lowest animal health service providers. However, there is still a lot to be done to ensure their integration at the grassroots level. The fact that the government vete rinary service is still involved in direct service delivery at a subsidized rate creates unfair competition and discourages the CAHWs and the private animal healt h workers. The government needs to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the different actors to ens ure a sustainable animal health delivery system in the re gion. With regard to drug retailing and distribution, the 176/91 Drug Administration and Control Proclamatio n allows only Veterinarians, Animal Health Assistants and Animal Health Technicians to be involved in opening and running veterinary drug shops. There is no provision made in any form (individually or as a group) for CAHWs to run drug shop businesses. There fore, the currently envisaged approach to ensuring drug supply through the CAHW cooperatives contradic ts the proclamation, and should be reviewed. 4.7.2 Stakeholders' participation The lack of community and other stakeholder (such a s government and private animal health worker) participation in the design and establishment of CA HWs services has a negative implication for the sustainability of services. Thus, measuring the lev el of the stakeholders' participation has been give n due consideration in this assessment. A Project Managem ent Cycle (PCM) framework has been used (Annex 5) to assess participation levels at different stag e of the project cycle. Community, government and private animal health ser vice providers have been identified as the main stakeholders by project implementers. Consequently, the level of participation of these stakeholders i n the program has been assessed in the respective impact areas through a review of documents and discussions with the communities, government counterparts, CAHW s, and project staff. 28 4.7.2.1. Community participation 4.7.2.1.1 Dollo Ado, Hargelle, Moyale and Liben imp act areas The community involvement in the projects was found to be low to medium (Figure 9). The community involvement in need identification was ranked low s ince the communities should have been asked to identify and prioritize locally important diseases to be included in the training content. Community participation in selection of the CAHWs was ranked medium, because in some of the PAs (Dollo and Hargelle) local politicians influenced the communit ies to select an unsuitable candidate. In all cases , selection criteria were developed by outsiders (pro ject staff & government counterparts), and communit ies were only asked to select their chosen candidates b ased on these pre-defined criteria. This is in con trast to a more participatory approach, whereby communities would have been given an opportunity to identify their own criteria (with input from others). There is a huge demand for the training of more CAH Ws in all the PAs visited (there is currently one CAHW per PA in all of these impact areas). This dem and indicates that communities were not consulted on the number of CAHWs to be trained. One main chal lenge of consulting the community is that they may propose more CAHWs than necessary for training. However, by referencing the geographical area to be covered by each CAHW and the number of animals l ocated in that area, it would be possible to arrive at an acceptable estimate for the number of CAHWs n eeded . CAHW trainings were carried out in town in all impa ct areas. Communities were not consulted or involved in the venue selection. Therefore, besides the negative consequences noted previously for CAHWs, an opportunity for community participation i n the implementation of training was missed. Community participation in CAHW monitoring was low in all cases. The role of the community was not clear in the M&E of the CBAH Program. Only PA chair men or vice-chairmen and a few elders were involved in monitoring. In Dollo Ado, Hargelle and Liben impact areas Veterinary Supervising Committees (VSC) have been established in all PAs a nd trained to monitor activities of CAHWs, mobilize the community for vaccinations and support CAHWs ac tivities; however, most of them were not undertaking their roles and responsibilities proper ly. Figure 9. Level of community participation at diffe rent stages of the CBAHWs project in Dollo Ado, Har gelle, Moyale and Liben impact area. PROJECT MANAGEMEN T CYCLE Preliminary assessment carried out by project staff, livestock disease ranking was not carried out by the community Low participation Need Assessment Design and planning Community agreed on CAHWs selection criteria; community dialogues on CAHWs operational system & no. of CAHWs decided by project staff Moderate participation Implementation Community selection of CAHWs, cost recovery implemented & training venue in town. Moderate participation Monitoring Monitoring framework designed by project staff, information collected & analyzed by project staff, no feedback to the community, VSC involved in some PAs. Low participation Impact assessment In the past participatory impact has been carried out in Dollo Ado & thus community participated; in the current IA community participation was High in all target areas 29 4.7.2.1.2 CARE impact area The community participation in the project ranged f rom low to high (Figure 10). Community involvement in monitoring was perceived to be low by both the p roject staff and community members. The role of community was not clear in the M&E of the CBAH prog ram. Although VSCs have been trained and are operational in most of the PAs, their role is limit ed. In the implementation phase of the project communit y participation was rated as moderate. The fact tha t the training venues were selected by the project an d the trainings were carried out in towns limited community participation. Missed opportunities incl uded that the community could have provided the training venue, offered their livestock to supply s ufficient practical cases, and made other contribut ions. Community participation in the needs assessment, de sign and planning was perceived as high by the project staff and the community. Impact assessment had not been carried out in this impact area before; however, in the current impact assessment, the community and the project staff rat ed community participation as high. 4.7.2.2 Government counterpart participation Project staff in Dollo Ado, Hargelle and Liben impa ct areas rated the participation of government counterparts such as the veterinary department and the local administration as high at all level of th e project. This was confirmed through discussions and interviews with government staff in both areas. Similarly, in CARE and LVIA impact areas, the parti cipation of government counterparts was rated as high at all level of the project except in the curr ent impact assessment, where participation was rate d as very poor. All agricultural development staff in Mo yale, Yabello, Dire and Teltele were completing an awareness-raising training on the current political environment in the country at the time of this mis sion, and therefore, they were not available to participa te in the impact assessment exercise. Generally speaking, participation of the government counterparts was rated as very high despite the continuous restructuring process and re-location of staff, which constrained the continuity of their involvement. 30 Figure 10. Level of community participation at diff erent stages of the CBAHWs project in CARE impact a rea. 4.7.2.3 Private animal health workers' participatio n Private animal health workers were identified as a stakeholder group only in the CARE impact area. The re are two drug shops (in Yabello and Dire) owned by o ne private animal health worker, and a strong linka ge was established with the CAHWs in the area. Due to his unavailability, the private animal health worke r did not participate in the stakeholders' participat ion analysis session organized at the CARE office; however, CARE staff rated his involvement as very l ow in assessing initial need, very low in monitorin g and impact assessment, moderate in the design & pla nning, and high in the implementation phase. The private animal health worker was not involved in th e current impact assessment because he was unavailable. Although there were legalized private animal health workers running veterinary drug businesses in Doll o Ado and Moyale impact areas, they were not consider ed as stakeholders by the respective projects, and consequently were not involved in the projects. Two private animal health workers (one in Dollo Ado an d the second in Moyale) were interviewed to find out their perceptions and understanding about CAHWs system. They said that they have perceived CAHWs as opponents, competing with them for business. The person interviewed in Moyale felt particularly stro ngly, describing the CBAH system as \"inappropriate and dangerous.\" There were also negative perceptions be tween the CAHW program implementers and the private animal health workers. There are no private animal health workers operatin g in Hargelle and Liben impact areas and therefore, there is nothing to report from this area. Discussion Several community-based animal health projects have failed to meet their objectives because of lack of participation of relevant stakeholders. Low partici pation of community members in decisions that affec t their lives has a major implication for the sustain ability of a project such as this. Livestock owners ' participation could have added considerably in term s of reducing unnecessary costs. Generally, if community participation is high the cost of the pro ject will be low. It is more likely that a project will be sustainable if the community participates in joint problem identification and analysis, development an d implementation of action plans, and finally, monito ring and evaluation of the program. It is important that in the future great emphasis be placed upon involvi ng local people fully in the decision-making and th e management of the program. This is an expression o f the mainstreaming of a 'rights based approach' an d PROJECT MANAGEMENT CYCLE Community identified & prioritized local needs; livestock disease ranking was carried out by the community High participation Need Assessment Design and planning Implementation Community selection of CAHWs, cost recovery implemented & training in town. Moderate participation Monitoring Monitoring framework designed by project staff, information collected & analyzed by project staff, no feedback to the community, VSC involved in some PAs. Low participation Impact assessment No impact assessment carried out before, during this mission High participation Pre-training community dialogues on CAHWs system carried out, Community identified CAHWs selection criteria; no. of CAHWs decided by the community High participation 31 'entitlement' concept. In simplest terms, these con cepts say that people are entitled to participate f ully in things that concern them. The various stakeholder groups may have different i nterests at different stages of the project cycle. Therefore, all stakeholders should be involved full y in the project cycle as necessary. The ultimate objective of all animal health service providers is to improve animal health service deli very. Therefore, in future, proper stakeholder analysis s hould be facilitated. Through this process, the ro les and responsibilities of each of the stakeholders should be identified and all should agree to work togethe r to achieve common objectives. 4.7.3 Social sustainability The level of community support for CAHWs is another indication of the sustainability and impact of the CAHWs within their respective communities. The leve l of community support to CAHWs varies from one PA to another, but generally speaking it is rat ed as average. Although VSCs have been established in all the PAs and trained to support CAHWs, most of t he committees are not carrying out their roles and responsibilities. Consequently, most of the CAHWs, particularly in Dollo Ado Woreda, are not deliverin g services because of shortage of drugs. In Liben, Ya bello, Dire and Teltele impact areas the CAHWs are enjoying relatively higher levels of community supp ort. In some of the PAs the community members have constructed drug stores and have supported the CAHW 's family in farming activities and looking after livestock when the CAHW was on training or away del ivering services outside his PA. There is a significant attitudinal change among com munity members towards the use of modern medicine, with a high willingness to pay for services and dug s used, and CAHWs have generally been accepted and cherished by their respective communities. The use of cheap, illegal, and poor quality drugs i n some of the impact areas has indicated that there are some community members who still have not changed t heir behavior. Therefore, there is a need to continue community awareness activities about the c onsequences of using poor quality drugs. To support awareness-raising, government controls of the illeg al drug trade should be put in place. 4.7.4 Technical sustainability Drawing on the experiences of similar CAHW systems in other countries, it appears that technical monitoring and drug re-supply of CAHWs are the most significant constraints to the sustainability of t he programs. The CAHWs need to maintain high levels of technical competence to ensure sustainability of the animal health program after the withdrawal of t he implementing organization. The current technical competence has been assessed (section 4.4.1) and th e majority of the CAHWs are above average in their level of skills and knowledge. They are offering ap propriate services based on the community demand (section 4.4.2) and provide service to their commun ities irrespective of the wealth status, gender, et hnicity and location. However, technical support such as training of new CAHWs to replace dropouts, refresher courses for existing CAHWs, and ongoing support and supervision should continue after the termination of the project. The inability of the project to consistent ly maintain a regular supply of veterinary drugs of sufficient quality and quantity and the current ins ufficient field supervision both have negative implications for the long-term sustainability of CA HWs. To this end, the approaches followed by SC/US and its partners to ensure future sustainability of technical support, drug supply, and activity and d isease reporting have been specifically assessed. Drug supply : It was hoped that drug supply would be ensured th rough CAHW cooperatives. Therefore, CAHWs have been linked to their respective cooperat ives in all impact areas (except in Liben where the y are linked to government). The relative failure of cooperatives to ensure drug supply has been reviewe d under section 4.5, and generally, the current appro ach does not seem likely to ensure a stable and sustainable drug supply. Furthermore, the current government proclamation for drug administration and control (Proclamation 176/91) allows only Veterinar ians, Animal Health Assistants and Animal Health 32 Technicians to open and run drug shops. Therefore, CAHWs do not have the legal grounds to act as drug vendors, either individually or in groups/cooperati ves, unless they employ eligible professionals. Technical support : In SC/US Dollo Ado, Hargelle, Liben and CARE the projects have been providing technical support to CAHWs through regular monitori ng and refresher courses in collaboration with thei r government counterparts. In the future, it is envis aged that the government will continue offering technical support by itself. In Moyale, however, th e project phased out a year ago, and although it wa s hoped that the government counterpart would take on the responsibility for providing continued monitoring and field technical support to CAHWs, th is has not happened. All implementers have provided sufficient training to government staff to refresh their technical skil ls and knowledge of animal health, and their understanding of the Community-based Animal Health Workers approach, in order to enhance their capacity to pro vide technical support and monitoring of CAHWs in the long term. However, past experiences have shown that in other locations the government has not continued providing technical support and monitoring of CAHWs after withdrawal of the implementing NGO. This situation has been observed in Moyale, where monito ring and follow up did not continue after phasing out of the LVIA project. As usual, lack of transpor t, lack of operational funds and lack of commitment were mentioned as the major hindrances preventing t hem from undertaking this role. This is by no means an unusual finding, and it is one that has been obs erved commonly in the past. CAHWs activity and disease reporting: CAHWs report their activities to their respective cooperatives in Moyale, Dollo and Hargelle impact areas; while i n the case of CARE they report to the project with a future plan to report to the government. In SC/US L iben, the report is occasionally forwarded to the government. In the case of Dollo Ado where cooperatives were no t supplying drugs in a sustainable way, it is not possible to expect reports from CAHWs. Even where t here is sufficient drug supply through the cooperative, as in Moyale-Somali side, CAHWs are no t restocking themselves and have decreased their level of service delivery due to lack of monitoring . Thus it is unreasonable to expect activity repor ts from CAHWs. Some of the problems observed in the field because of insufficient technical support & monitoring and drug supply are summarized as follows: Most CAHWs do not have enough drugs in their kits CAHWs are losing their credibility because without drugs there are few services offered, and thus the community looses trust in the service. There are no reports coming from CAHWs in some area s CAHW's are doing insufficient and incomplete record -keeping CAHWs and community members are sometimes sourcing drugs from the black market CAHWs losing motivation in some of the areas The fact that CAHWs are linked to different institu tions for different purposes hinders the sustainabi lity of the Community-Based Animal Health Program. To ad dress this issue, a system that ensures accountability and provides strong linkage between the three elements of sustainable technical support , drug supply, and CAHW disease and activity reportin g should be established. The best strategy for ensuring sustainable technica l support, drug supply and CAHW disease and activit y reporting would be through a linkage established wi th a private animal health worker in each area who is supervised by the government veterinary department. See Figure 11 for this suggested model of sustainable community-based animal health delivery. Currently, there is a favorable policy environment (section 4.7.1) in both Somali and Oromia national regional states in support of a privatized CAHW net work. SC/US and its partners should use this opportunity to support Veterinarians or other anima l health workers (such as Animal Health Assistants) to 33 set up private veterinary businesses and establish a privatized network of CAHWs. The private animal health worker could provide technical monitoring an d ensure sufficient drug supply, collect reports of treatments and vaccination from CAHWs, compile the reports on regular basis and distribute them to stakeholders. He/She could also assume other respon sibilities for the CAHWs under his/her direction. This approach would provide better sustainability i n terms of technical monitoring, drug supply and reporting than either government or CAHW cooperativ es. Two private animal health workers interviewed (from Dollo Ado and Moyale) expressed an interest i n creating such a linkage with CAHWs in their areas . Meanwhile, CAHW cooperatives should be strengthened and involved in other marketing opportunities besides the resale of drugs. There is a huge potent ial for livestock and livestock products marketing in all impact areas. For example, in the case of Dollo & H argelle, cooperatives could be organized for the collection and marketing of milk and small stock as there is high demand in Mandera (Kenya). Figure 11. An example of community based privatized animal health network 4.7.5 Financial sustainability There is high level of understanding and awareness among the community and stakeholders on how the financial system of CAHWs functions. They have clea r understanding about CAHW incentives and they are willing to pay for drugs, vaccines and services . CAHWs in all impact areas were provided with star ter kits, although this was delayed in some impact area s (Dollo Ado). The initial drug supply was used as start- up capital. Therefore, upon finishing the drugs in the startup kit CAHWs were supposed to buy replacement drugs with the cost recovered, utilizin g only the profit margin for personal use. As described previously, CAHW cooperatives were est ablished with start-up capital donated from project s and they have opened drug shops. However, some conc erns have been identified related to financial sustainability, in the cases of both the individual CAHWs and the cooperatives. These concerns are described below: /head2right In most of the impact areas (Dollo Ado, Hargelle an d Moyale) the initial principle money given as a starter kit for CAHWs is declining. In some of the areas, CAHWs have stopped buying drugs and have completely used the start-up money. /head2right The quantity of drugs initially issued to CAHWs was insufficient. /head2right Cheap, inefficient and illegal drugs are available and are still used by some community members. NGOs Government Private Animal Health worker (PAHW) CAHWs Training * Credit to set up business Initial training of CAHWs; Supply starter kit Link with PAHWQuality control Compile monthly report & send to the woreda Vet. Office CAHWs status report Drug & Vaccine supply Technical support & advice Monthly activity reports Disease outbreak reports Control quality of services provided Technical support when possible Report disease outbreaks Monitor CAHWs activity Service delivery Community participation & awareness raising Illegal drug control Monitor CAHWs activity Facilitate marketing CAHWs Cooperatives Livestock keepers 34 /head2right The government is opening some drug shops at the PA -level (Oromia side) /head2right In the case of Moyale - Somali, the CAHW cooperativ e sells drugs to the community at the same price it sells drugs to CAHWs. This pushes the CAH Ws out of the business. /head2right CAHW cooperatives in Dollo Ado & Hargelle still dep end on SC/US for drug sourcing, buying and transporting from Addis or Gode to the sites, and t he associated costs are still covered by SC/US. A system has not been put in place for the cooperativ es to cope with full cost recovery and running costs, which puts the cooperatives' sustainability in jeopardy. /head2right Cooperatives have limited working capital. Poor understanding about private business and finan cial management contributes to poor financial performance and poor financial sustainability of in dividual CAHWs. Therefore, in the future, CAHWs should be trained i n small business skills and attention should be giv en to the scaling-up of the business and financial man agement capacity of the cooperatives. Due to an improved market for animals and animal products, th e involvement of the CAHWs and cooperatives in this activity as an additional income source is hig hly realistic and could be facilitated to secure th e long- term financial sustainability of the system. 4.7.6. Conflict Conflict and insecurity have a significant negative impact on the sustainability of community-based an imal health worker systems. The community animal health worker system in Borana lowlands has suffered from the sporadic conflict that has occurred betwee n different ethnic groups in the area. CAHWs have lost their drug kits and cost recovery money and co nsequently, have been forced to limit or stop their services in most PAs. See Annex 7 for a case study of a CAHW who lost her drugs, cost recovery money and livestock due to the recent conflict between th e Guji and Gebra communities in Yabello Woreda. 35 Section 5: SWOT analysis The projects' Strengths (S), Weakness (W), Opportun ities (O) and Threats (T) were analyzed as a part o f the review. This analysis was carried out based on the discussions held with the various stakeholders in each impact area, the impact assessment exercises, and the consultant's own perceptions. The results are summarized below: 5.1 SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area Table 4. Summary of SWOT analysis carried out in SC /US Dollo Ado & Hargelle impact areas.

The absence of accurate baseline data for v arious species poses a significant constraint to quantification. Nevertheless, livestock herders are constantly exposed to the dynamics of animal healt h and production, and are very aware of any changes. Participatory methodologies such as 'Semi-structure d interviews', and 'Before and after' proportional pi ling were used to determine communities' perception s of changes in the general health status of all livesto ck species, and changes in the incidence and mortal ity caused by specific diseases. Findings are outlined below: 6.1.1 Change in general livestock health status 'Be fore' and 'After' the project. All informant groups were first asked to score the proportion of healthy and unhealthy animals (cattle , sheep & goats, and camels) 'before' the CAHW progra m started in their area using 10 stones. Then, the y were asked to score changes in the proportion of he althy and unhealthy animals 'after' the project (no w) by increasing or decreasing the number of stones (o r leaving it as it was if there were no changes). All informant groups in all areas agreed that there has been a significant increase in the proportion of healthy animals since the CHAW project was implemen ted, and that the change is dues mostly to the increased availability of medicines, vaccines and o ther project inputs. Results for specific impact a reas are shown below: 6.1.1.1 SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area Figure 12.

More than 12 dise ases were mentioned by each of the informant groups ; however, for the purposes of statistical analysis o nly the diseases which were mentioned by all 10 informant groups were selected, and the incidence a nd mortality impact for each disease was assessed using the 'Before and After' proportional piling me thod with 10 stones. At the same time, the informan ts were asked whether each of these diseases was handl ed by CAHWs, and asked to explain the reason for any change in disease incidence. The findings in e ach impact area for each species of animal are pres ented below: 0123456789 Healthy Unhealthy Healthy Unhealthy Healthy Unhealthy Cattle Sheep & Goat Camel Median livestock health impact score Before the project After the project 42 6.1.2.1 SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area a) Change in Cattle disease incidence 'Before and A fter' the project Nine of the most important diseases affecting cattl e, and the community perception of changes in disea se incidence after the CAHW project was implemented ar e illustrated in Figure 16. The diseases handled an d not handled by CAHWs are shown in Table 8. There is strong agreement between informant groups that the incidence of diseases handled by CAHWs has been significantly reduced. Garabgoye (Black leg), Goryan (Internal parasite) and Kud (Anthrax) were a mong the diseases significantly reduced. Figure 16.

However, the impact of Tuma (MCF) & Shilmi (Tick infestation) didn't reduce very much, although these diseases were handled by CAHWs. This was because of insufficient knowledge about the disease in the case of Tuma , and reduced mobility and a ban on bush burning re sulting in an increased tick population and therefore increased disease pressure in the cas e of Shilmi . The list of diseases and their English equivalents is shown in Table 9 below. 45 Figure 19.

Number of informants =10; W = 0. 56 (p < 0.001). b) Change in Sheep and Goats disease incidence 'Before and After' the project. Since the implementation of the CAHW project, there was a significant reduction in the impact of the various sheep and goat diseases handled by CAHWs (F igure 20). The impact of Kenxo/Cito (Mange) and Ramo (Internal helminthosis) was among those highly reduced. However, in the ca se of Shilmi (Tick infestation ), disease impact reduction was not significant althou gh it was handled by CAHWs. This was because of higher tick populations, as explained in the Cattle section. The list of diseases and their English na mes were shown in Table 9 below. -8 -6 in median disease impact score Handled by CAHWs Not handled by CAHWs 46 Figure 20 .

Number of info rmants = 10; W = 0.53 (p < 0.001 ). c) Change in Camel disease incidence 'Before and After ' project Informant groups identified thirteen major diseases affecting camels. Of the 7 diseases handled by CAHWs (Table 9), only the impact of 4 diseases such as Qufa (Coughing -Pneumonia), Cito (Mange ), Furri Upper Respiratory infection ) and Chita (Anthrax) was reduced since the CBAHP implementation. The impact of the other three disea ses was not reduced. Of those three, Shilmi (Tick infestation ) didn't reduce due higher tick populations, as exp lained in the Cattle section. Among diseases not handled by CAHWs, Dhukana (Trypanosomosis ) was reduced significantly due to increased availa bility of medicines from black market. Although Dhukana was included in the training of the CAHWs, the medicine to treat the disease was not included in t he drug kit, because the Oromia regional government policy did not allow the use of trypanocidal drugs by median disease impact score Handled by CAHWs Not handled by CAHWs 47 Figure 21 .

There was a significant reduction in the impact of all diseases handled by CAHWs except in the case of Nekersa / Jikawo (Mastitis) (Figure 22). The impact of this disease wasn't red uced due to the shortage of drugs in some of the PAs and the high cost of the m edicine in others. One CAHW had not used the medicine (Intera -mammary injection) that was suppl ied as starter drug, and it had expired. Figure 22. Community perceptions of changes in catt le disease impacts after CBAHP implementation in LV IA impact area. Number of informants = 10; W = 0.52(p < 0.0001). b) Change in Sheep and Goats disease incidence 'Before and After' the project. Fifteen major sheep and goat diseases were identifi ed, out of which 8 were handled by CAHWs and the rest were not handled by CAHWs (Table 10). There wa s a significant reduction in the impact of most of the diseases handled by CAHWs after the project was implemented (Figure 23). Chito (Mange), Ramo gera / Goryan and Marared were among those highly reduced, the last due to a vaccination campaign carried out jointly with government veterinary department. On the other hand Shilmi / Chini (Tick infestation ) did not reduce because of the poor quality of the acaricide supplied and used. CAHWs in all PAs complained about the ineffectiveness of the Change in median disease impact score Handled by CAHWs Not handled by CAHWs 49 Figure 23.

For those diseases handled by CAHWs, a significant reduction in the impact of the most important diseases was observed (Figure 24). Shilmi (Tick infestation) was not reduced because of the poor quality of aca ricide used, as explained in the Sheep and Goats section. Figure 24.

Significant reduction in the impact of all diseases handled by CAHWs was observed (Figure 25). Gendi (Trypanosomosis ) was included in the training but medicine was not included in the drug kit for more than 2 years due to the regional government's policy of not allowing CAHWs to handle and use trypanocidal drugs.

Other contribu ting factors could include the quality of governmen t veterinary services, good rainfall and better avail ability of pasture during the project period, as we ll as other factors. It was, therefore, important to dete rmine the importance of the project inputs and acti vities relative to other non-project factors in reducing d isease impact. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the same informant groups that condu cted disease impact scoring to identify factors tha t had contributed towards the change in livestock dis ease impact during the project period. Identified contributing factors were ranked by the community i n order of their importance. The degree of agreemen t between the 10 informant groups within each respect ive impact area was assessed using the Kendal coefficient of concordance (W). The results of the assessment are described below: 54 6.1.3.1 SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area Table 12.

In this section, the relative strengths and weaknes s of CAHWs as a group are assessed and compared to other service providers based on indicators includi ng service accessibility and availability, quality of services provided, quality of advice provided, rang e of services covered, affordability, and community trust in service provider. Changes in community service usage since the CAHW project started was also assessed. Semi-structured interviews with the 10 informant gr oups were used to identify the different service providers. These were: Government veterinary services, which occasionally undertake vaccination campaigns and bring drugs. Kiosk (black market), and drug shops in Dollo Ado t own and across the border in Mandera town (Kenya), which supply veterinary drugs Religious and traditional healers who are available CAHWs trained by the project, who provide services when they have the necessary drugs. Some livestock herders treat their own animals and also assist others when requested. After animal health service providers were categori zed into the five groups described above, the 10 informant groups were asked to measure the relative strength of each service provider against each indicator using 30 stones. The level of agreement b etween the 10 informant groups was then assessed using the Kendal coefficient of concordance (W). Figure 28. Matrix scoring of animal health service providers in Fiko PA in Dollo Ado Woreda. The service providers and i ndicators were represented with simple drawings on pieces of card. 56 The findings of the matrix scoring for each impact area are presented below: 6.2.1 SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area Table 16.

The findings f rom the discussions in all the impact areas are summari zed below: Accessibility: Whether the livestock herders can reach the service or not is measured by accessibility of the service in terms of distance and other geograph ical barriers. On the basis of this measure, commun ity- based animal health workers were considered to be h ighly accessible compared to other service provider s by all informant groups in all impact areas. \"Nure (the CAHW of the PA) lives with us so that we can reach him always; he is willing to travel for more than 5 hours to help the community and he does not need transport.\" (Muktar Mohammed from Godbokol PA Dollo Ado) Beyond the service that the CAHWs are providing dir ectly to their respective communities, their close contact with the livestock herders has facilitated communities' access and linkage with wider developm ent service providers. Availability: This measures whether the service exists or not. Al l informant groups in all impact areas confirmed that there is a community animal health w orker in their respective area. With regard to medicine availability in Dollo Ado & Borana, inform ant groups were in agreement that medicines were more often available from CAHWs than from other ser vice providers, although shortages were reported in Dollo & Hargelle. In the case of Liben and LVIA impact areas, however, medicines were more availabl e through drug dealers (on the black market) than thr ough the CAHWs. Quality of medicine and services : The informants were in agreement that better qual ity medicines were available from the CAHWs than from other service pr oviders, and that their animals usually recovered when they used CAHWs. They mentioned that the quali ty of medicine and services provided by government is also good, when they are available. T here are a lot of cheap medicines of unknown source and brand circulating in all impact areas, some com ing from Somalia and others from Kenya. The informants indicated these drugs are not of good qu ality although they are cheaper in price; therefore , they do not use these drugs unless they cannot get drugs from the CAHWs. Advice: Informants agreed that the best advice comes from the CAHWs and the government. However, CAHWs are better in providing advice regularly as t hey are closer to the community, whereas the government comes only when there is a disease outbr eak. The informants noted that besides providing treatment and vaccination activities, CAHWs also mo bilize the community for vaccination campaigns, create awareness on the use of quality drugs, and i nform the community about disease prevention methods. Range of activities : all informants were in agreement that the CAHWs h andle most of the animal health problems they encounter. This finding was confirmed by the interviews with the respective CAHWs (section 5.4.2). The community identified the activities of CAHWs as : 1) Treatment of internal parasites, external parasi tes and major infectious diseases, 2) Vaccination, 3) Advice on quality drug use, disease prevention a nd reporting 4) Castration and hoof trimming Affordability: The CAHWs' services are less affordable than the dr ug dealers and traditional healers in Dollo Ado & Hargelle. However, all informants agree d that the quality of medicines from the drug deale rs is not good. Because their animals do not recover when they use drugs from the drug dealers, informan ts do not use drugs from this source. There is agreeme nt among informant groups in Liben & LVIA impact areas that the CAHW service is more affordable than other service providers. In the CARE impact area, government medicine is cheaper than that of the CAH Ws, and therefore the medicine from CAHWs is 61 seen as less affordable. However, the community sai d that they use medicines from CAHWs because drugs are not normally available from the governmen t. They also pointed out that drugs from CAHWs are more accessible because the poorest of the poor in the community can get medicines from CAHW on a credit basis. Trustworthy and community support : All informant groups in all impact areas agreed t hat CAHWs are the most trusted and supported of all service provi ders. Service usage: All informants agreed that the use of CAHWs servic es is higher than that of the rest of the service providers. Since the CAHW system was in troduced, the use of services from other service providers has been significantly reduced, and in so me cases some service providers are not being used at all at present. 6.3 Impact on livestock herders' welfare As with any other animal health service delivery pr oject, the ultimate objective of the CAHW program i s to bring a sustainable livelihood to the livestock producer's household through improving income and welfare. Therefore, it is important to assess how t he change in disease impact has affected the lives of the livestock producers in the project area. Considering disease reduction as a project benefit, the communities were asked how this benefit had affected their livelihoods. Informant groups were a sked to identify specific benefits resulting from improved animal health, selecting from among the va rious benefits derived from livestock (Section 3.1) . The relative importance of these benefits was then assessed using 'before' and 'after' proportional pi lling, similar to the method used to assess changes in dis ease incidence and impact. 6.3.1 SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area In the SC/US Dollo Ado and Hargelle impact area, th e perception of the informant groups was that milk, meat, income and livestock number are the most impo rtant benefits derived from livestock, and their relative importance 'before' and 'after' the projec t is illustrated in Figure 28. There was significan t increase in milk and meat production as well as an increase in livestock number. The income derived from livestock and livestock product sales has also more than doubled. Figure 29. Benefits derived from improved animal he alth during the CAHW Program in Dollo Ado & Hargelle impact areas. 0246810 Milk Meat Income Increased livestock number Benefits Median benefit score Before After 62 Increase in livestock number and increase in milk c onsumption creates a direct benefit to household fo od security, and are important indicators of the proje ct's impact. Therefore, the use of milk within household (Figure 30) and livestock ownership 'before and after the project' (Figure 32) were more closely examined usi ng the proportional pilling method. All informant groups in this impact area agreed tha t in some cases there was an increase in the amount of milk consumed by members of household after the pro ject. The amount of excess milk left after household consumption has increased significantly s ince implementation of the project. This coincides with community perception of an increased milk bene fit from the CAHW project. Figure 30. Household milk distribution 'before' and 'after' project implementation in Dollo Ado & Harg elle impact areas. All informant groups were asked what they do with t he excess milk, and they responded that they sell a ll excess milk in the form of milk or butter. In fact, during the five day stay in Dollo Ado & Hargelle t he team saw a pick-up truck carrying milk to Mandera t own (Kenya) every day (Figure 31 below). Milk was also sold locally in Dollo and Hargelle towns. Women were said to be responsible for collecting and selling milk. The proceeds from the sale of milk are also managed by women. Figure 31. A pick up transporting milk for sale to Mandera (Kenya ). Livestock ownership was assessed to triangulate the finding that livestock population had increased as a positive consequence of the project. All info rmant groups agreed that the proportion of the population owning livestock increased after the project 0246810 12 Children Girls & boys Husband & Wife Elderly Excess Median household milk usage score Before After 63 implementation (Figure 32). In particular, the in crease in the number of people owning cattle and sh oats is very high. Figure 32. Livestock ownership 'before' and 'after' the project in Dollo Ado & Hargelle impact areas. 6.3.2 SC/US Liben impact area In the SC/US Liben impact area, milk, income from t he sale of livestock and livestock products, and an increased livestock population were identified as i mportant benefits derived from livestock. In spite of the reduced impact of the major livestock diseases as a result of the CAHWs' activity, there has been no improvement in the production of milk. There has, h owever, been a significant increase in the level of income and an increase in the number of livestock ( Figure 33). Reasons for these changes are discussed later in this section. Figure 33. Benefits derived from improved animal he alth during the CAHW Program in Liben impact areas. 0123456789 Population with livestock Population witout livestock Population with livestock Population witout livestock Before the project After the project Median livestock ownership score Cattle Sheep & Goat Camel 0123456789 Milk Income Livestock number Benefits Median benefit score Before After 64 The change in milk production was further investiga ted by assessing the relative milk consumption with in a household 'before' and 'after' the project. Ther e was a significant reduction in the amount of milk consumed by members of the household during the pro ject period (Figure 34). This coincides with the findings of changes in benefits above. 'Before' the project was implemented, excess milk was kept as a reserve food for the family and given to guests. Cu rrently, excess milk is being sold in the form of e ither milk or butter. Figure 34 . Household milk distribution 'before' and 'after' pr oject implementation in Liben impact area. Increased livestock number was mentioned as a benef it of the animal health program due to control of diseases that used to cause high mortality of anima ls. This was further triangulated by assessing live stock ownership 'before' and 'after' the project. The pro portion of people keeping more cattle has decreased 'after' compared to 'before'. On the other hand th e number of people owning more sheep, goats and camel has increased 'after' compared to 'before' (F igure 35). Figure 35.

Milk production has redu ced since project implementation compared to 'before' the project, while income derived from sale of livestock and livestock products and livestock number has increased 'after' compared to 'before' (Figure 36). These findings were confirmed by the results of fur ther investigation into 'before' and 'after' household milk consumption (Figure 37) and communit y perception of change in livestock ownership (Figure 38) . All informant groups agreed that the proportion of milk consumed by all members of a household is reduced compared to what it was before the CAHW project implementation. On the other hand, the proportion o f people keeping cattle and camel has been slightly increased, while proportion of people keep ing sheep & goats has been reduced. Figure 38.

There has been a drop in milk pr oduction compared to before the project, while income derived from sale of lives tock and livestock products, and livestock number has increased (Figure 39). The findings of further investigation into househol d milk distribution (Figure 40) and community perception of change in livestock ownership (Figure 41) confirmed this. All informant groups agreed that the amount of milk consumed by all memb ers of household has been reduced since implementation of the project. On other hand, the proportion of people with large numbers of cattle is slightly reduced. The proportion of peopl e with and without sheep and goats has not changed, while the proportion of people keeping cam els has increased significantly. Figure 41.

Benefits deriv ed from improved animal health during the CAHW Program in CARE impact area. 68 There is agreement between informant groups in Libe n, LVIA and CARE impact areas that there has been a drop in the amount of milk benefits deri ved from livestock, despite the significant reduction in major livestock diseases which has bee n achieved as a result of the CAHW project. Through probing questions and discussion with the c ommunity, it was uncovered that the community attributes the reduction in milk producti on to a lack of pasture, and not generally to the effects of diseases. One exception to this fin ding is that severe Tick challenge (Shilmi ) was also mentioned as a factor contributing to reduced milk production (in Liben and LVIA impact areas). This latter coincides with the earlier find ing that there was no change observed in the impact of Tick (Shilmi ) in Liben and LVIA impact areas. Frequent drought and reduced access to seasonal grazing areas due to intra-ethnic conflict were mentioned by all informant groups as major constraints creating the shortage of pasture. They also stated that loss of grazing land to neighboring ethnic groups as a consequence of ethni c based regionalization, and bush encroachments were major factors. This coincides w ith the findings of the vulnerability analysis (Section 3.1). Income from the sale of livestock and livestock pro ducts has significantly increased during the project period in all impact areas and informants a ttributed this change to the improvement in livestock markets and increased prices. The informa nt groups in all impact areas were asked what they do with the proceeds from the sale of livestoc k and livestock products, and responded that they use the money for: /head2right Restocking (they sell camel and buy oxen for farmin g in Dollo & Hargelle; while they sell cattle and buy camels in Borana and Moyale) /head2right Buying consumer items such as clothes, sugar, coffe e, rice, etc. /head2right Paying for their medical and veterinary services /head2right Use for weddings (to buy clothes and other gifts fo r the bride) and other social purposes /head2right Contributions for local development initiatives (ro ad, school and clinic construction). With regard to livestock number, in Borana and Moya le impact areas the informant groups agreed that there has been a slight reduction in th e number of cattle since project implementation. They attributed this change to impr oved market situation for cattle, which means that more cattle are sold 'now' than 'before' . This coincides with the increased income level from sale of livestock and livestock products . It was also uncovered that people sell cattle to buy camels, and therefore, the proportion of people keeping camel is increasing 'now' compared to 'before', while that of people keeping cattle is decreasing. The preference for camel over other livestock is increasing in Borana lowlands due to t he camel's tolerance to the effects of drought. Overall, the community-based animal health program has contributed to the welfare of the pastoralists through reducing the livestock mortali ty and morbidity, and thus securing household milk supply and income from sale of livestock and l ivestock products. 69 Section 7: Conclusion and Recommendations I strongly believe that the findings in this report will provide relevant feedback for the implementers of the program, particularly for field based-staff, and that the feedback will help to advance their efforts to improve animal health deli very and ultimately, to ensure food security in the program target areas. Livestock-keeping remains the major livelihood stra tegy contributing to households' capital assets in this area. Animal disease is on the top of the l ist of major problems affecting the livelihood activities of the livestock owners in all impact ar eas, and therefore, the project is highly relevant because it addresses animal health issues to reduce poverty through livestock development. Within this framework, significant results have bee n achieved in reducing the impact of the various diseases, particularly through annual and b iannual vaccination interventions. SC/US and its partners have laid a good foundation for the community-based animal health worker programs in their respective operational are as, although one organization has been better than the others at implementing a strong CBAHP. All organizations should strengthen the components of their programs to meet the national m inimum standards set for design and establishment of community-based animal health prog rams. Specific suggestions for addressing identified weaknesses have been made in the previou s sections. The summary of the major suggestions of the consult ant is as follows: The participatory methodology used in this review a nd impact assessment was a positive experience for the project staff, the community and the consultant. It facilitated experience sharing, the identification and learning from the communities' indigenous knowledge, and the ability of pastoralists to ident ify specific diseases and to describe trends in disease patterns over a 3-year period. Th erefore, this approach should be used in the regular and periodic monitoring and evaluati on of the program. Participatory baseline surveys should be conducted in the future to identify community priority needs and issues, to increase understandin g of indigenous knowledge, and to identify diseases that should be included in the CA HW training curriculum. Community dialogue should be facilitated regularly to review performance of CAHWs and enhance community participation in the monitori ng of the program. The community should identify its own selection cri teria for successful CAHW candidates. Staff can give their views, based on st andardized criteria, but they should not dictate that the community use pre-defined criteria that might not be relevant. An annual assessment should be conducted to determi ne the number and distribution of active CAHWs in each program area, and this assessm ent should be used to plan for further CAHW training to fill in the gaps or increa se coverage when required. The standardized training manual should be strength ened by including easy-to- understand illustrations and drawings where necessa ry. The standardized manual should also be adapted to address specific local needs bas ed on the findings of the baseline survey, and should include local disease vernacular and descriptions. Veterinarians or animal health assistants who have attended a participatory training technique (TOT) workshop and who have a positive at titude, behavior and knowledge towards pastoralism and towards the participatory a pproach should facilitate CAHW trainings. CAHWs should not be trained by animal h ealth technicians or previously trained CAHWs. Basic CAHW training should be completed in one phas e of 15 - 20 days. At a minimum, the training curriculum should cover the 5 top animal diseases per species, as identified and ranked by the community. The other l ess important diseases should be included during refresher trainings. 70 During impact assessment, some diseases were priori tized by the livestock herders but not handled by CAHWs, and thus it was not possible to offer solutions through the project. A participatory study should be conducted to learn more about these diseases and to come up with control strategies. The number of CAHWs trained during one session shou ld not be more than 20, to allow enough participation and one-on-one interaction wit h the trainer. The training venue should be in an area close to th e community and to livestock grazing areas, under the pastoral set up. CAHWs should be supplied with starter drug kits imm ediately after the training is completed. Refresher training should be planned and carried ou t in a regular fashion, rather than in the irregular way it is currently being carried out . A community-based monitoring and evaluation system that ensures the participation of all stakeholders and defines the role and responsib ilities of each should be established and implemented. Project staff and stakeholders should be trained in establishing and implementing community based monitoring and evaluation approache s. The CAHW monitoring format should be properly desig ned, taking into consideration the information needs of all stakeholders. The meth ods of data collection, who will collect the information, frequency, analysis and us e of the information should all be clearly determined. The project should seek to facilitate veterinary pr ivatization through support to private animal health workers, who could link with CAHWs to establish a privatized community-based animal health network in order to e nsure drug supply, technical support and reporting. Lobbying and influence on government should be stre ngthened, with a goal of having government withdraw from direct dispensing of subsi dized drugs and competing with the private animal health workers (including CAHWs) . The government should also be motivated to increase control of illegal drug deale rs. CAHW cooperatives should be encouraged to participa te in livestock and livestock products marketing, to monitor the activity of CAHW s and to enhance community participation in the program, rather than running d rug shops, which will not be sustainable. Community awareness and sensitization on the negati ve consequences of the use of poor quality drugs should continue. 71 Annexes Annex 1. Terms of Reference for an Animal Health R eview and Impact assessment as part of the LEAP Mid-Term Review General SC/US wants to conduct a review of its animal healt h interventions in pastoral areas in order to document the lessons learned and to start a process of harmonization. SC/US will use the review as a basis for re-orientating as necessary i ts own decentralized animal health work and that of the partner organizations with which it is worki ng. To this effect SC/US is looking for a consultant to carry out a review and impact assessment of SC/US's animal health interventions and those of it s partner organizations, based on the following TOR. The projects to be reviewed are the animal health c omponent of LEAP and DAP projects in selected districts of Somali (4 districts) and Orom iya (5 districts) Regional States. Overview of SC US Pastoral Program SC/US has a long history of working in both pastora l areas to improve pastoral livelihoods and improving animal health which it is recognized can result in significant improvements in pastoral livestock production - more milk, faster weight gai n and reduced vulnerability from drought. It is perhaps not surprising that the upsurge of in terest in animal health has resulted in both Government and NGOs initiating community animal hea lth programs, though not all adopt the same approach. The result has been confusing and wa steful of scarce resources. It is for this reason that the MoARD has produced a National Minimum Standards and Guideline for Design and Establishment of Community-Based Animal Health Work ers System publication, 2004 to begin the process of harmonizing approaches. SC/US welcomes this initiative and seeks to support efforts by bringing its own animal health portfolio under external review, with the view to h armonizing its own approaches. Project areas to be covered during the review During the review the team will visit each of SC/US 's target districts in pastoral areas in Somali and Oromiya regional states. Cluster representative woreda could be selected from the target districts in: Somali State Oromiya and aim of the review: /square4 To undertake a review of the decentralized animal h ealth approaches in SC/US supported projects. /square4 To identify strengths and weaknesses of the respect ive approaches. /square4 To make recommendations resulting in a phased harmo nization of approaches to decentralized animal health based on the MoARD's Mi nimum Standards /square4 To document the findings and recommendations in a d etailed report, which can be shared with partner NGOs and relevant Government de partments. Specific Objectives: 72 /square4 To analyze how effective the different strategies a nd approaches adopted in achieving improved and sustainable animal health service are at the herding household level /square4 Assess the realistic prospect for future sustainabi lity of project concepts and practices by partner organizations as well as by herding communi ties after termination of the various projects. /square4 To evaluate the impact or likely impacts of the pro jects in reducing vulnerability amongst the respective pastoral community. /square4 Assess the process applied in project implementatio n and identify strong and weak points. /square4 Finally to identify problems that are constraining project implementation and suggest ways and means to alleviate them. Methods /square4 Review methodology and sample site selection In addition to reviewing project documents in Addis it is anticipated that the reviewer will visit each of the target woreda to meet project staff, CAHWs, beneficiaries and woreda administrative and animal health staff. Randomly s elected PAs in each woreda will be used as sample sites, where more detailed information regar ding the impact of the animal health intervention on local livelihoods will be sought. /square4 Information collection and data analysis The review will be carried out by one consultant in volving SC/US veterinarian, key partners at various levels, project staff, and target commun ities. The generated data should be analyzed using spread sheet and Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) latest version. /square4 Participatory assessment methodologies The Review should employ a set of participatory ass essment methodologies such as semi structured interviews with key stake holders, focus group discussions and key informants discussions, etc. Presenting the results /square4 The consultant will produce and submit the first dr aft of the finding within 15 days of completion of the field work for comment to SC/US. Food security COP and SC/US veterinarian will comment on the draft document and submit back to the consultant to produce finished document. It is anticipated that t he final report will be ready by 10 days after receiving comment on the draft report. As per the requirement from SC/US, the consultant and SC/US veterinarian will present the findings and transfer the experience to other NGOs and GOs. Organization and Logistics /square4 One consultant from AU/IBAR will join the SC/US vet erinarian to lead the whole review process. The consultant will be responsible to faci litate, coordinate, and write the review reports to the required level and standard. The con sultant should have demonstrated understanding of pastoralist livelihood and demonst rated commitment to participatory processes. SC/US anticipates that the field work wi ll be carried out in a period of 21 days in the field, with an additional 10 days for report wr iting. /square4 SC/US will arrange one vehicle to and from the pro ject sites and in the field during the review exercise. 73 Contact person at the project site /square4 Regional Pastoral Program Managers will ensure the reviewers receive every possible support from SC /US and its program partners. Professional fees and logistics /square4 SC/US pays professional fees to undertake the revie w based on the current market situation and negotiation made with the consultant. There wil l be no additional per diems and accommodation expenses for the consultant. Per diem s for GO staffs that are anticipated to join the review team will be covered by the regiona l pastoral program offices as required. Specific duties and responsibilities of the consult ant After official agreement with SC/US the responsibil ity of the consultant will be: /square4 Reviewing project documents and setting time table to conduct the field work. /square4 Developing detailed animal health interventions rev iew methodology such as: /head2right Defining the project in terms of its geographical c overage and period of operation through time line, participatory mapping, before an d after proportional piling of disease incidence, mortality and morbidity rates. /head2right Participatory ranking methodologies of factors inf luencing livestock health during the project interventions /head2right Develop methods to assess impacts of CAHWs on veter inary service in terms of accessibility, availability, quality and other indi cators /square4 Based on the review methodology developed the consu ltant will work to meet all the pre set overall objectives and specific objectives of the r eview. /square4 Generate representative report of target districts from the representative woredas /square4 Forward professional recommendations and suggest be tter intervention strategies for pastoral development in future to promote decentral ized animal health service in pastoral areas. /square4 Submit the findings of the review in a timely manne r to SC/US for comment and then produce the final document to the required level of quality and standard. /square4 Present the finding to GO partners and SC/US staff as required. 74 Annex 2.

The invaders have also raided her 10 cat tle, 21 sheep and goats and more than 25 camels of her community. Adijo has been working efficiently and was also ack nowledged by the community as a CAHW. Nevertheless, the conflict changed this situation a nd she has suffered from a major economic and moral e loss. During vulnerability context analysis informant gro ups have identified conflict as one of the major problems affecting their livelihood activities in t hese areas (see annex 6 above). Therefore, CARE sho uld continue its conflict resolution and peace building activities using a more extensive and participator y approach. Otherwise, there is a strong fear that co nflict will erupt and this continues to be a major factor affecting the sustainability of the community-based animal health workers system. 83 Annex 8.
