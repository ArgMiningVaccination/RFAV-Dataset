Ambulatory Patient Groups (APGs) Part 599 use s APGs as t he basis for M edicai d fee -for se rvice and M edicaid managed ca re1 payments for M HOTRS. The APG pay ment methodology i s base d on the Enhanced Ambulatory P atient Groups classification sys tem, a product o f the 3M H ealth Information Systems, Inc. In t he context of m ental heal th se rvices, APGs a re a def ined group of out patient procedures, en counters or ancillary s ervices gr ouped for payment pu rposes. In an A PG paym ent environment, pay ments ar e determined by m ultiplying a dollar base rate (varies b y peer group) by t he w eight assigned for each procedure. The weight i s a num eric value that r eflects t he relative expect ed resource utilization for each procedure as co mpared t o the expected r esource utilization for al l other pr ocedures. Procedure w eights a re the same f or all M HOTRS p roviders r egardless of pee r group. The current service weights, diagnosis w eights a nd APG peer gr oup base r ates ca n be f ound at the OMH MHOTRS Fiscal/Billing Resources website APG Peer Groups For r ate se tting purposes, OMH has g rouped al l MHOTRS providers into o ne of ei ght pee r groups and es tablish ed a base rate f or ea ch. A provider's base rate is d ependent on t he peer group they a re in. Providers w ithin each peer g roup have a co mmon bas e rate. OMH peer gr oups ar e differentiated by l ocation a nd licensing status. MHOTRS pr oviders a re w ithin peer gr oups as follows: 1.U pstate Hospital - All hospital Broome, Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua, Chemung, Clinton, Columbia, Franklin, Fulton, Genesee, Greene, Hamilton, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Livingston, Madison, Ulster, Warren, Washington, Wayne, Wyoming and Yates counties. 2.Downstate Hospital - All hospital -based MHOTRS providers in Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, Richmond, Nassau, Suffolk, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and W estchester counties. 3.Upstate D&TC - All MHOTRS diagnostic and Fulton, Genesee, Greene, Hamilton, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Livingston, Tioga,Tompkins, Ulster, Warren, Washington, Wayne, Wyoming and Yates counties. 1 Medicaid managed care in this guidance includes Mainstream Medicaid Managed Care Plans, Health and Recovery Plans (HARPs), HIV Special Needs Plans (HIV SNP s), and Medicaid Advantage Plus (MAP) Plans .

Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) Part 599 M HOTRS r egulations apply t o FQHC MHOTRS pr oviders l icensed by OMH. However, the APG pay ment methodology i s not appl icable to FQHCs exce pt when the FQHC ha s voluntarily agr eed to par ticipate in the A PG reimbursement system. A dec ision by an FQHC to participate i n the A PG sy stem w ill appl y to all the services they del iver, not j ust mental heal th services.

These procedure codes are updated annually. The codes u sed for m ental heal th service s could c hange; OMH w ill update these c odes and weights as appropriate. Payment Modifiers MHOTRS p roviders m ay bi ll Medicaid FFS and M edicaid managed car e for ce rtain supplemental payments described below. Off-s ite Services MHOTRS may be provided at l ocations away from the program site, i ncluding in t he community or the individual's pl ace of residence. The need for o ff-site services m ust be documented i n the individual's t reatment pl an. Off- site services a re billed using a separate rat e code that reimburses a t 150 % of the on- site r ate. S ervices p rovided at a satellite location (i.e., a physi cally separate si te that p rovides se rvices, full or par t time, on a r egularly and routinely scheduled basis) are not reimbursed using the off -site rate c odes. The off -site services rate codes are exempt f rom the utilization threshold count. Tel ehealth cannot be ut ilized during the pr ovision of off-site services ; billing f or off-site services m ust be for i n-person service delivery i n the community. See Telehe alth Services webpage for m ore details on providing services via telehealth. The off -site r ate co mpensates p rovider agencies for s taff travel co sts di rectly related t o service provision. The of f-site service rate m ust onl y be used when services a re delivered off -site in a community l ocation and can only be r eimbursed i n conjunction with a completed service claim. The off -site r ate ca nnot b e used when se rvices ar e delivered at an agency licensed site or in situations when providers travel off-s ite but a service was not delivered. Language other than English (LOE) Eligible procedures provided in languages o ther t han English may be claimed using t he U 4 modifier. Thi s modifier w ill pay an additional 10 % for each eligible service. This modifier is available for se rvices pr ovided both on and of f-site. This m odifier i s appl icable when the se rvice to the r ecipient or c ollateral i s provided in a language other t han E nglish, i ncluding sign language. Translation m ay be pr ovided by a st aff New York State Office of Mental Health 8 person fluent in t he language or by a pai d translator. It i s expected that t he individual pr oviding language assistance services w ill have sufficient l evel of fluency to ensu re effective communication. MHOTRS pr oviders sh ould devel op a process to assess or ve rify the language competency of those persons w ho will be providing language assistance services. Resources might i nclude local o rganizations, universities, or schools w here t he relevant l anguages ar e taught. In al l instances, the confidentiality of i nformation and r espect for those serve d and for their c ulture m ust be maintained, e specially whe re services ar e provided using translation services. The LOE bi lling modifier may no t be use d when translation is pr ovided by a friend or f amily member of t he recipient . Although the use of friends or f amily members a s interpreters i s not generally r ecommended, i t is not pr ohibited. The decision to do so should be reviewed for clinical appr opriateness and be documented. Provider m ust document t he use of language assistance services and the method of providing the service in a progress note. After-H ours The purpose of the after-hours procedure co de (99051) is t o encourage providers t o make services av ailable at times t hat a re more co nvenient for t he individuals t hey se rve. There does not need t o be a sp ecial justificati on for t he provision of se rvices after hours. The procedure code is appl icable w hen services to adults o r children are provided weekdays before 8AM, weekdays 6PM or l ater, and all day on weekends. To qualify, w eekday services m ust begin before 8A M or at or af ter 6PM. Services p rovided on holidays during normal business hours a re not eligible for t he af ter-hours m odifier . This modifier is available for se rvices pr ovided bot h on and off -site. Additionally, the service must be provided duri ng the extended hours of op eration listed on the MHOTRS p rovider oper ating certificate. If t he pr ovider cu rrently has ext ended hours, the modifier ca n be claim ed during these times. Providers currently w ithout ex tended hours that wish to bill t his co de must have an approved ch ange to their oper ating certificate before bei ng able to bill f or after-hours service provision. Procedure co de 99051 i s reported in additi on to the service procedur e code. Only one 99051 will be reimbursed by Medicaid per cl ient, pe r day . Currently 99051 is w eighted at .0759 of the APG peer group base rate. MD/NPP Modifiers MHOTRS providers may cl aim one of t he following modifiers: AF (psychiatrist), AG ( physician), or SA (Nurse Practitioner) w hen a psych iatrist, p hysician practicing in li eu of a psych iatrist with approval by O MH, or psy chiatric nu rse practitioner sp ends at l east 15 minutes participating in the provision of se rvices being provided by anot her p ractitioner o r when the service is provided fully by a psychiatrist , other physi cian, o r NPP, r espectively .

New York State Office of Mental Health 10 Medicaid Utiliz ation Thresholds ar e calculated using \"countable service days\" claimed to Medicaid FFS by a MHOTRS pr ovider f or each Medicaid beneficiary . These counts reset t o zero each April 1 (beginning of stat e fiscal ye ar). When an individual receive s services in exce ss of the utilization threshold, pay ment r eductions w ill occu r. The payment reductions linked to utilization thresholds ar e: For individuals whose age on April 1 of each state fiscal year was LESS than 21 years old, Medicaid payments for \"countable\" services will be reduced by 50% beginning wit h t heir 51st service day during the fiscal year. This count will reset to zero at the beginni ng of each SFY thereafter (April 1st). For individuals whose age on April 1 of each state fiscal year was 21 years old or gr eater , Medicaid payments for countable services will be reduced by 25% for their 31st t hrough 50th service days during the state fiscal year. Payments for MHOTRS will be r educed by 50% beginning on their 51st service day d uring the fiscal year. This count will reset to zero at the beginning of each SFY thereafter. Note: A \"countable service day\" is the accumulation of all procedures provided in one day that have been claimed to Medicaid using rate codes 1504 and 1516. The UT applies to MHOTRS claims that are paid in whole or in part by Medicaid on aFFS basis (i.e., Medicare/Medicaid duals, individuals with primary third -party coverage and Medicaid secondary). Services Exempt from the Utilization Threshold Count The following types of se rvices a re exempt from the UT count w hen su bmitted under t he appropriate r ate codes (listed above): C ourt Order /Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT)/Strict and Intensive Supervisi on and Tr eatment (SIST)/Other (as specifically approved by OMH ) O ff-site Health Services/Peer Supports Crisis Intervention Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) Integrated Outpatient Services ( IOS; OMH host) Medicare/Medicaid Crossover Billing For individuals w ith bot h Medicaid and Medicare c overage, M edicai d will pay t he \"higher o f\" what Medicare or Medicaid would pay f or the visit. Medicaid will not pay f or Medicare co -pays or deduc tibles f or non -Medicai d covered services. If one procedure must be billed t o Medicare f irst, t he MHOTRS program must wait to submit the claim f or the rest of the procedures pr ovided on that day unt il Medicare pay s for the crossover procedure. If t he claim i s then su bmitted t o Medicaid outside of the 90 -day w indow f or claiming but w ithin 30 days of receipt of t he ad judication by M edicare, i t is considered by CMS to be an acceptabl e reaso n for de lay. The claim w ill require the use of del ay reason code 7 : Third P arty Processing Delay. New York State Office of Mental Health 11 For M MCPs wit h an i ntegrated M edicaid and M edicare product line, t he provider w ould submit one claim w ith al l the relevant Medicai d and M edicare information. Please refer t o the Mainstream/HARP/HIV -SNP B ehavioral H ealth Billing and Coding Manual or t he Medicaid Advantage Plus B ehavioral H ealth Billing and Coding Manual for m ore information on submitting MHOTRS claims for services that are covered under Medicaid and Medicare. National Provider Identifier (NPI) Affiliation MHOTRS p roviders, ho spitals and other f acilities that bi ll Medicaid FFS an d Medicai d managed care are required to maintai n an up -to-date r oster o f Attending Providers ( practitioners). The NPIs of al l practitioners p roviding Medicai d reimbursable services i n the MHOTRS pr ogram must be affiliated wit h the clinic in the eM edNY system. C laims containing NPIs o f licensed practitioners not affiliated wit h the facility will result in a d enial of payment. Practitioners may be affiliated with more than one program or pr ovider . To ent er affiliated practitioner i nformation, visit t he eMedNY N PI affiliation page . Additionally, there i s a batch Facilities Practitioner's NPI Reporting ( FPR) submissi on method, which was deve loped t o accommodate f acilities that have a large quantity of af filiations to record wit h NYS M edicaid. For more i nformation, pl ease refer t o the Facilities P ractitioner's N PI Reporti ng Guidance on the eMedNY webs ite. Attending/Referring Practitioners An attending practitioner NPI i s required on al l claims , except w hen al l procedures i ncluded on the claim ar e provided b y a non -licensed practitioner , where permitted by Part 599 . The N PI of a practitioner per formi ng one of t he pr ocedures i s entered as the attendi ng provider on t he claim. If the attending pr ovider r eported on the cl aim is en rolled in NYS M edicaid, t he referring field may be left blank as t he at tending will be considered the r eferring provider. Licensed Master S ocial Workers, Creative Arts Therapists, and P sychoanalysts ca nnot currently enrol l in NYS M edicaid. W hen they or a non- licensed practitioner ar e the attending provider reported on t he claim, a Medicaid- enrolled referring provider must be added to t he claim in the referring provider f ield. As appr opriate, r eport t he NPI of t he Medicai d enrolled physician or NPP who signed the t reatment pl an or the N PI of the Medicai d enrolled individual w ho supervises the attendi ng provider. Using th e agency's N PI in the referring field is not appropriate and will r esult i n overpayment l iability . Referring providers do n ot need t o be formally affiliated wit h the M HOTRS provider in eMedNY . However, referring pr oviders must be enr olled Medicaid providers on the dat e of service . Attending and r eferring providers may be enrolled wit h Medicaid as either billing providers, or as Ordering/Prescribing/ R eferring/Attending (OPRA) pr oviders. Claims wit h a n on-enrolled attending or referring provider will be denied. Claims for Services Provided by Non-L icensed Pr actitioners When claimi ng for ovided by a non- practitioner ( including t he OMH unl icensed practitioner ID ( 02249154) i s the ONLY a ttending practitioner i nformation that should be put on t he cl aim. Use the ID in place of the NPI and leave all other i nformati on fields - name, l icense, e tc., bl ank. Again, wher e the non -license d practitioner I D is use d in the attending field, t he claim MUST also include the NPI of a M edicaid enrolled practitioner i n the referring field. Failure to include a referring provider w ill result i n overpayment l iability. New York State Office of Mental Health 12 Claims for Services Provided by Medical Residents in Teaching Hospitals NYS M edicaid follows the Medicar e requirements f or teaching hospital s. Medicai d guidance with respect t o these requirements ca n be found in the June 2009 N YS Medicaid Update . CMS G uidelines for Teaching Physicians, Interns and Residents also contains i nformation with respec t to this topic. Claims for Services Provided by Students Students m ay pe rform cl inical work i n an O MH-licensed MHOTRS p rogram. They must be enrolled in a New Y ork S tate E ducation Department (NYSED) appr oved pr ogram leading to a license allowed to provide services i n an O MH-licensed MHOTRS p rogram. A pla n for the use of students and st udent supervision must be included as pa rt of t he MHOTRS pr ovider's OMH - approved staffing plan. Appropriate pr ocedures performed by students w orking i n this ca pacity are reimburs able by Medicaid. Billing Medic aid for Multiple Procedures on the Same Day Please not e the following information does no t apply to services pr ovided t o individuals enrolled in a MHOTRS Based IOP . Please refer t o the MHOTRS -Base d Intensive Outpatient P rogram Guidance for m ore information on t hat pr ogram. In order t o reduce the ne ed for the client t o make multiple visits for co mplementary services, MHOTRS p rograms m ay su bmit c laims t o Medicaid FFS and Medicaid managed care f or up t o three se rvices per client , per day , not including crisis se rvices. However, o f those three services, there is a maximum of t wo P sychi atric o r two Healt h services al lowed per da y. Psychotropic Medication Tr eatment, Injectable Psychotropic M edication Administration with Monitoring and Education and Complex C are Management se rvices may be counted as ei ther health services o r psy chiatric services ( distinguished by using ei ther t he base rate codes o r the healt h services rate co des). This f lexibility w ill allow f or these services to b e provided on the same day with any other types o f services, up t o the thr ee per day limit . Injectable P sychotropic Medicati on (injection only) is billed using the 837 -P professional claim and m ay be counted as either a psych iatric or health service. When multipl e procedure codes a re included on the same r ate coded claim, t he M HOTRS program w ill receive 100% r eimbursement for t he APG p rocedure with t he hi ghest APG w eight and a 10% di scount w ill be applied to each additional procedure w ith a l ower APG w eight. This rule does no t appl y to m ultiple services s ubmitted on an IOS r ate coded c laim, which are not subject t o discounting. All m ental heal th procedures p rovided to an i ndividual on the sa me day an d claimed using t he same rate code must be submitted t o eMedNY or Medicaid Managed C are on the same claim. Currently t here is only room for one practitioner ID on the a ttending line of t he cl aim. There is currently no NYS r equirement r egarding which NPI sh ould be pl aced on a cl aim w hen t he claim contains m ultiple procedures . The M HOTRS p rovider m ust include an NPI belonging to one of the practitioners w ho per formed one or m ore of t he procedures bei ng claimed. The N PI must match a practitioner who performed a procedure in the medical record. Billing Multiple Procedures for Individuals Covered by Medicaid/Private Insurance Medicaid regulations at 1 8 NYCRR S ection 540.6(e) r equire a pr ovider to pursue any ava ilable commercial i nsurance pr ior to submitting a claim t o Medicaid. This m eans that pr oviders must investigate and pur sue reimbursement f rom available commercial insurance but are not r equired New York State Office of Mental Health 13 to contract with all available commercial insurers. Additional information can also be found in the DOH Medicaid Update February 2008 Vol. 24, No. 2, Office of Medicaid Management. Medicaid pays the lower of either: the Medicaid rate minus the insurance payment, or the patient responsibility amount . When a provider contracts with a commercial insurance payer, the Medicaid program pays the difference between the commercial insurance payment amount and the commercial insurance patient coverage amount. Essentially, Medicaid pays the commercial insurance co- payment, deductible and/or co -insurance. When a provider does not contract with a commercial insurance payer, Medicaid pays the patient responsibility. In this case, this is the difference between the commercial insurance payment amount and the provider's usual and customary charge, up to the M edicaid rate. Where multiple services are provided on the same day, the patient responsibility depends upon whether a provider is under contract wit h a private insurer and the rules of the MHOTRS provider contract. If the MHOTRS provider contract with the insurer requires that the patient only be bill ed f or co -pays and deductibles regardless of the number of procedures provided in a day, the patient respo nsibility amount will be limited to the co -pays and deductibles. This is true even if the thir d-party insurer only paid for one procedure. For any procedure covered by Medicaid, but not fully covered by a recipient's primary insurance plan, Medicaid will pay for the patient responsibility for the uncompensatedprocedure(s) up to the Medicaid rate. The t otal patient responsibility must be ass ociat ed on t he claim with the procedure(s) it pertains to. This works for ePACES as well. The user must fill out a line level claim response. Information regarding ePACES may be found on the eMedNY ePACES website. Reimbursement for Collaborative Doc umentation/Concurrent Record Keeping For Medicaid and Medicaid m anaged care, t he time spent on co ncurrent documentation is a reimbursable par t of a pr ocedure if i t is a component of t he therapeutic encounter. This activity may or may not be reimbursable by other third-p arty payers. Service-S pecific Medicaid Billing Requirements Several M HOTRS have specific M edicaid billing limitations. Please note that w here se rvices have a minimum du ration, the duration of services m ust be documented. Providers may bi ll for se rvices co nsistent w ith app licable AMA and CMS co ding guidelines f or service durati on ranges. Wher e there i s no dur ation range def ined within t hose guidelines, the minimum duration cited in this guidance and OMH regulations must be followed. Assessments There ar e two types o f assessments - Initial A ssessments and P sychiat ric Assessments. New York State Office of Mental Health 14 Initial As sessment - No more than three initial assessment proc edures will be reimbursed. The only exception to this rule is when there has been more than 365 days since the client's most r ecent Medicaid reimbursed v isit to the MHOTRS program. Procedure codes f or Initial Assessment: 90791 - Psychiatric diagnostic evaluation 90792 - Psychiatric diagnostic evaluation with medical services Note: R egardless of the code chosen, i f a psychiatrist, other physi cian, o r NPP pr ovides or participates i n the se rvice for a t least 15 m inutes, the appr opriat e modifier must be adde d to the claim line for the 45% increase in reimbursement. Psychiatric Assessment - May be performed for admitted individuals where medically necessary w ithout l imitations. Psychiatric Assessments may al so be provided to det ermine whether an i ndividual sh ould be admitted t o the MHOTRS p rogram a nd will co unt toward t he pre-admission service limit of t hree visits ( see b elow) . MHOTRS p rograms b ill for 30 -minute or 45- minute Psychiatric Assessment s using ei ther an office E valuati on & M anagement ( E&M) co de alone, o r where psych otherapy se rvices a re also provided for the r equired m inimum time, by using and office Evaluation & Management (E &M) code on one cl aim l ine AND 90833 ( 16-37 minutes) or 90836 ( 38-52 minutes) on the se cond claim lin e. If 90833 or 90 836 add- on is use d, ps ychotherapy se rvice s must be documented i n the record al ong with P sychiatric A ssessment. Where t he add -on is use d, the provider should select the appropriate E &M co de base d on the level of medical decision making be use d without 90833 or 90836 if t he psych iatrist provides st raight m edical evaluation and management w ithout psych otherapy, o r where psychotherapy se rvices were provided, but not for t he required minimum t ime in order to bill the add- on. Where E&M co des are used w ithout t he add -on, pr oviders may select the appropriate E &M co ding as f ollows: 1.B ased on level of medical decision making (MDM). Providers billing based on MDM should document each element of their analysis even though the APG procedur e w eights and reimbursement do not differ based on the provider's selection; or 2.Based on time within the ranges established in the table below titled, \" APG Codes, Procedure Codes and Service Time \".

Payments from the Safety Net are made in accordance with payment rules established by the OMH and DOH. Periodic partial payments from the Safety Net will be made by the Department of Health. To participate, agencies must submit annual data for each of their MHOTRS locations using the OMH- 4, an OMH form included the Consolidated Fiscal Report (CFR). MHOTRS programs that fail to submit the OMH -4 will be excluded from the pool. The Safety Net uses data collected from the CFR OMH -4 from two -years prior. The percentage of uncompensated care paid by the Safety Net is dependent on the total funds available and the total value of allowable uncompensated care visits. To be eligible for an allocation of funds from the pool, MHOTRS programs must demonstrate that a minimum of three percent of total visits during the applicable period were uncompensated. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) MHOTRS programs must demonstrate that a minimum of five percent of total visits during the applicable period were uncompensated. All MHOTRS programs qualifying for a distribution from the Safety Net must undertake reasonable efforts to obtain or maintain financial support from other community and public funding sources and attempt to collect payments for services from third -party insurance payers, governmental payers, and self -paying individuals. This is subject to audit. OMH anticipates that visits can be counted toward uncompensated care volume if they meet the following conditions: 1.Self-pay, including partial- pay or no- pay visits (does not include partial payment associated with co- pays or deductibles). 2.Required or optional services provided but not covered under a program's agreement with an insurer. The service must be provided by a practitioner qualified to deliver t he s ervice under State regulations. 3.Unreimbursed MHOTRS program visit s/procedures appropriately provided to an insure d i ndividual by a program staff member not approved for payment by a third- party payer (Commercial/Medicare) under contract with the MHOTRS program. The provider must document that the program received a denial of payment. 4.Unreimbursed MHOTRS program visits/procedures appropriately provided to an insure d i ndividual by a program staff member when the procedure is not reimbursed by a third - party payer not in contract with the program. Only visits for which the program receive d a w ritten denial of payment from the insurer or a written attestation from the individual/insured that the insurer made no payment will be considered uncompensated. This documentation must be retained by the program and will be subject to an audit by the NYS Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) or other party empowered to conduct such audits. Visits will not be counted if they meet the following conditions : 1.Visits paid in whole or part by MMC or a third -party payer . 2.Visits not authorized (considered not medically necessary) by an insurer/managed car e pl an. 3.Visits provided to a recipient who has coverage from a third -party payer not in contract with the program when an insurer does reimburse the insured for the visit, irrespective of the amount of the reimbursement.New York State Office of Mental Health 23 4.Visits delivered by persons unqualified to deliver the services under NYS regulations. 5.Services provided to individuals served in forensic settings. Safety Net Calculation Methods MHOTRS P roviders ( non- FQHC) All rograms -FQHC) will r eceive a uniform r ate add- on.

Per CMS requirements, Medicaid visits include Medicaid FFS visits only. The Safety Net rate adjustment total payment for each eligible FQHC MHOTRS program, which is determined based on the tier system, will be scaled based on the ratio of the total amount that was allocated for payment, using the tier system, to the total stat ewide safety net funds available for distribution to all eligible FQHC MHOTRS programs. If the amount of eligible uncompensated care visits in the Safety Net calculation exceeds the funding available, payments to provider s are proportionately reduced.
