This package was put together for your ordering convenience. Butyrate Butyrate is produced by your gut microbes and has many important functions within the human body, particularly for digestive health, supporting brain health and protecting against disease*. Not only is Butyrate critical in repairing the lining of the gut and the health of cells within it\u2014it also supports healthy inflammation response to protect the body from disease while improving immune function.* Butyrate repairs the damage that pesticides, toxins, processed foods, drugs, etcetera has done to the lining of the gut. Butyrate helps to heal the gut lining and promotes healthy DNA to support genetic function against damage, which may lead to disease*. Why BodyBio Butyrate? Quality matters! We don't use fillers or additives. There is no way to achieve the powerful benefits of butyrate without its distinctive, fermented scent. This means it's premium quality and ready to work. All natural ingredients and free of wheat, gluten, yeast, corn, soy, dairy, artificial colors, and resins. Specially formulated to: - Support gut health* - Promote detoxification* - Maintain proper pH levels in the colon* - Reduce inflammation* - Promote healthy DNA function* - Support healthy blood sugar regulation* - Butyrate serves to close tight junctions and prevent the dysbiosis commonly known as leaky gut* TUDCA TUDCA is a bile acid naturally formed in the body that supports the digestion and utilization of fats and oils and demonstrates neuroprotective benefits* 60 Capsules TUDCA supports digestive ability by supporting healthy fat metabolism and breakdown as well as proper nutrient absorption. It is also supportive to cellular and mitochondrial health. However, the human body only produces small amounts of TUDCA (or tauroursodeoxycholic acid). In a healthy person, digestion re-circulates some 95% of the body's bile salts. But poor diet, decreased liver function, and certain medications can impair this process. This is where supplementation is key. Benefits: - Support the digestion of fats and oils* - Promotes a healthy microbiome with healthy biodiversity* - Supports a healthy inflammation response in the GI tract to help prevent leaky gut* - Helps reduce cellular stress & protect DNA* - May address fatty liver, biliary cirrhosis and hepatitis* - May be effective in supporting neurological concerns* - Assists in clearing toxins* - Stabilizes the cell membrane* - Works with other bile salts to prevent premature cell death (apoptosis)* - Eases stress on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to improve protein folding* - May provide neuroprotective benefits.* - May help regulate the immune system* - May affect genetic expression and mitochondria* - May dissolve gallstones before they are completely formed* - May cause liver and muscle to be more sensitive to insulin (high insulin sensitivity helps cells use blood glucose more effectively, which can help reduce blood sugar.)* Why BodyBio Tudca? - Quality matters. We don't use fillers or additives. There is no way to achieve the powerful benefits of Tudca without strict internal and external quality control. The raw materials of BodyBio Tudca undergo extensive testing for the presence of mold prior to encapsulation. BodyBio's Tudca supplement is free of wheat, gluten, yeast, soy, dairy, artificial colors, and resins. Specifically formulated to: - Support digestion* - Support the liver* - Neuroprotective support* BodyBio PC combines four forms of pure phospholipids for quick absorption to rebuild every cell in your body, benefitting every key system. Keeping all of the systems in the body running optimally is hard to do with diet alone. BodyBio PC works to give your cells the boost they need to work better, in turn supporting every system in your body to thrive. Since PC decreases as we age, more doctors are recommending supplementation with phosphatidylcholine to ensure we're keeping our cells, and in turn, entire body healthy at any age. Whether you're hoping to heal a current health concern like digestive, cognitive or immune function, or prevent future problems, studies show that increased levels of Phosphatidylcholine (PC) can help the body heal while also improving brain function, mental focus, and memory. Why BodyBio PC? Non-liposomal PCs, such as lecithin, are broken down by digestion, preventing the positive impact PC has on improving your cellular health. BodyBio PC is a non-GMO, pure liposomal phospholipid complex, meaning the pure phospholipids are not broken apart and are instantly utilized, re-building every cell in your body. BodyBio PC contains concentrated levels of: Phosphatidylcholine (PC) - ensures cell membrane integrity and function* Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) - vital to mitochondrial function* Phosphatidylinositol (PI) - supportive to the brain and neurotransmission* Phosphatidylserine (PS) - essential for memory* Liposomal Glutathione Levels of glutathione decrease as we age. Glutathione is the body's most powerful antioxidant protecting us from environmental toxins and pollutants.* It promotes healthy aging by clearing the body of waste products and neutralizing and eliminating toxins that cause cellular damage.* It also enhances the activity of the immune system.* While most glutathione supplements break down in the stomach and can't be absorbed in the body, with our proprietary liposomal encapsulation technology, you get maximum glutathione absorption allowing this key nutrient to work for you on a cellular level. Why BodyBio Liposomal Glutathione? Our liposomal technology is a powdered liposome--free-flowing particles that immediately form a liposomal suspension when digested. That's right, no messy liquids here. These liposomal particles stay encapsulated during the journey through your stomach, and the particles are released when they reach your large intestine, where they can be easily absorbed through the gut lining and into the bloodstream.
