In the UK food -borne Salmonella infections are most commonly caused by Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium, that give rise to symptoms of diarr hoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever . Acute symptoms may last for 1 to 2 days or may be prolonged, depending on host fac tors, ingested dose, and strain characteristics. The reported numbers of infections with S. Enteritidis in the UK rose during the 19 80s and 1990s, and then declined from 1998 onwards. Infection levels with S. Typhimurium, have been maintained at a comparatively lower level than that of S. Enteritidis from the mid-1980s, and there has been a gradual decline in reported cases. Salmone llosis has mainly been associated with the consumption of undercooked contaminated meat especially poultry, pork and beef, and from undercooked eggs and eggs containing dishes . Although less common, salmonellosis has also been associated with consumption o f contaminated ready to eat fruit and vegetables. Cross -contamination can also occur to food preparation surfaces, kitchenware, towels and other foods. Outbreaks tend to occur from the consumption of contaminated commercially manufactured or prepared food and also from infections acquired outside the UK by returning travellers. The reported incidence data of food -borne Salmonella infection in the UK in 2008 was 18.8 cases per 100,000 of the population. In comparison to other food -borne zoonoses, the inciden ce rate for Salmonella in 2008 was second to Campylobacter with an incidence rate of 9 0.9 cases per 100,000. Verocytotoxin producing Escherichia coli O157 with a rate of 1.9 cases per 100,0002 was the third most commonly reported food -borne bacterial illne ss in the UK in 2008 . Projects summarised here include those in which the genetic and physiological basis of Salmonella pathogenicity in the host animal, and the subsequent host response to infection has been investigated. The association of salmonellae w ith food continues to be examined with studies on poultry and meat production, and the egg industry. Epidemiological projects have also been crucial to understanding the relationship between food and outbreaks and consumer practices. The global concerns ab out the 1 http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/version_.PDF 2 The Community Summary Repo rt on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses and Zoonotic Agents and Food -Borne Outbreaks in the European Union in 2008, The EFSA Journal (2010) MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 3 increase in antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella have been met with research aimed at identification of antimicrobial resistant genes. Vaccination strategies targeting a reduction in Salmonella in animals have met with success and projects are on going to try to improve on current vaccinations and to optimise the immune responses in animals. Significant advances achieved through research The availability of the genome sequences for a number of Salmonella serovars, and the associated use of a wide range of molecular biology tools, have been central to the advances in our understanding of Salmonella infection. Examples of the utility of molecular methods include the identification and regulation of virulence factors, the responses of bacteria to the host environment, identification of antimicrobial resistance genes and the use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based assays for screening. As the use of molecular methods becomes more widespread they have become incorporated in large scale surveillance studies and have provided more sensitive and specific tests for the identification of salmonellae . Work on vaccines and antimicrobial resistance has also benefited enormously from genetic technology, generating increased insights into antimicrobial resis tance genes and host immune responses. Surveillance studies assessing the incidence of Salmonella serovars in the poultry, meat and egg industries have been influenced by European legislation; EU Zoonoses directive 2003/99/EC concerns the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents and regulation (EC) 2160/2003 concerns the control of Salmonella and other specified food -borne zoonotic agents. The UK implementation of these directives by regular monitoring of layer and broiler flocks and slaughter animals, an d vaccinations in flocks has contributed to a continued decline in the reported incidence on Salmonella cases and also a reduction in Salmonella levels in poultry and eggs produced in the UK. Outstanding issues The cumulative effect of the genomic research in Salmonella has led to a significant increase in the overall understanding of Salmonella infection, antimicrobial resistance and vaccination strategies. There remains a need to ensure that this knowledge is translated into the issues associated with Salmonella food-poisoning in humans. While the decline in reported Salmonella cases is encouraging, outbreaks of salmonellosis are still occurring in the UK. There is therefore a need to continue animal, food and human surveillance, epidemiology studies and studies on consumer practices and to identify patterns in the infection routes. MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 4 LAY SUMMARY This report summarises research projects in the UK funded by the MSFFG between 2004 and 2009 on Salmonella and highlights potential gaps in the research progra mmes. Salmonella enterica is the name of one of the main species of bacteria which can cause food poisoning, the symptoms of which includes diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. Most people recover but some can die from complications that occur f ollowing infection e.g. septicaemia, which can occur if bacteria enter into the bloodstream. Fatalities are more common in the very young or elderly or in people with some other underlying illness. Salmonella bacteria are commonly found in the digestive s ystem of farm animals. Meat can become contaminated from contact with faeces during its production at abattoirs. Salmonella are also found in egg contents as well as on the shells. Although less common, food poisoning from Salmonella has also been associat ed with consumption of contaminated ready to eat fruit and vegetables. Cross -contamination can also occur where Salmonella is transferred onto table -tops, kitchenware, towels or to other foods; items which themselves can be the source of further transfer. Salmonella infection occur s when a sufficient dose of the bacteria enter s the human digestive system . This can be by the consumption of undercooked contaminated meat, especially chicken, pork and beef, from undercooked eggs or egg containing dishes, or fr om the consumption of contaminated ready -made meals and/or pre -cooked cold meats which have not been prepared hygienically. Contamination tends to occur following the use of poor hygiene standards either in food preparation settings or in the home; if good standards are followed then food which is produced is unlikely to cause food poisoning. Research has been carried out in the UK to better understand how salmonellae cause food -poisoning and how to prevent infection. A range of topics are investigated wh ich include; how Salmonella are able to cause an infection, whether there are ways of reducing their levels in meat and eggs by vaccinating farm animal and how Salmonella are developing resista nce to antimicrobial agents. M olecular biology technique s that look at which genes are present in the bacteria and how they influence the behaviour of the bacteria are often used to help researchers. Other projects continue to test farm animals to see if they harbour Salmonella, and others assess the causes behind out breaks amongst groups of people. Research is key to understanding how Salmonella infects humans and animals and how it is causes food -poisoning. Knowledge in such fields may help to reduce the risk of being infected with Salmonella . As well as the researc h carried out in the UK, there are many research projects in Europe, America and across the world. In the UK there has been a decrease in the number of cases of Salmonella in humans since 1998. This has occurred MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 5 partly by the introduction of monitoring and vaccinations of farm animals which have been undertaken to comply with new regulations in Europe which aim to reduce the numbers of Salmonella infections.

BACKGROUND 1.1 The Microbiological Safety of Food Funde rs Group (MSFFG) has previously published two reports summarising Salmonella research projects in relation to the microbiological safety of food which are funded by the MSFFG member organisations. The first report UK Publicly Funded Research Relating to Salmonella3 covered research projects funded between 1990 and the end of March 2000. This report was updated in 20054 to include research projects carried out between 199 9 and 2004. The updated report is described as the \"2005 Salmonella MSFFG report\" within subsequent sections of this document. Since 2004 a number of new projects on Salmonella have been commissioned and been recorded in the MSFFG database5, and therefore it is timely to re - examine the research and highlight recent progress in the science of the pathogenicity of this organism and its importance as a hazard in the food chain. 1.2 In 2003 the EU Regulation (EC) 2160/20036 on the control of Salmonella and other s pecified food -borne zoonotic agents, was published and has led to the introduction of targets for reducin g Salmonella levels in animals used in primary production. In support of mea sures put in place to assist in meeting these targets, a number of National Control Programmes (NCP's) have been initiated (see Sections 1.14 - 1.17). (see www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/zoonoses/ncp.htm ). 1.3 Salmonella are Gram -negative, rod -shaped bacteria which live in the intestinal tracts of animals. Some serovars are ubi quitous, while others are specifically adapted to a particular host. Many species of animal including amphibians, birds, domesticated and wild mammals, insects and reptiles can carry Salmonella. 1.4 The nomenclature for Salmonella has changed in recent years as methods have become available to examine the serovars. Salmonella nomenclature was originally based upon names allocated according to the clinical role of Salmonella, with strains considered different species (and therefore italicised) when isolated fro m the clinical condition, e.g. Salmonella typhi, Salmonella cholerae -suis, Salmonella abortus -ovis. Since the host specificity suggested by some of these earlier names does not exist (e.g. S. typhimurium and S. cholerae -suis are ubiquitous), names derived from the geographical origin of the first isolated strain of the newly discovered serovars were next chosen, e.g., S. london, S. panama, S. stanleyville. Subsequently, with the adoption of serological 3 http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/researchinfo/foodborneillness/microfunders/msffg/55669 MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 9 analysis, Kauffmann (1961) defined the species as a \"gr oup of related serofermentative phage types\" with each Salmonella serovar considered as a species. 1.5 More recently it was found that all Salmonella serovars form two distinct DNA hybridization groups, i.e. that the Salmonella genus consists of two species. These are defined as Salmonella enterica (species 1), and Salmonella bongori (species 2). Of these two species Salmonella enterica , is divided into subspecies, as follows: Subspecies I - S. enterica subspecies (subsp.) enterica Subspecies II - S. enter ica subsp. salamae , Subspecies III - S. Subspecies VI - S. enterica subsp. indica Species 2 - Salmonella bongoris - was formerly called subspecies V S. enterica subsp. bongori, but this designation has now bee n superceded . Each subspecies contains various serovars defined by a characteristic antigenic formula. 1.6 There have been over 2,500 serovars of Salmonella7 characterised. Many serovars of Salmonella, which had been previously described as species fall within the species Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica including those originally referred to as Salmonella typhimurium , Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella paratyphi, and Salmone lla typhi. These are now defined as, for example, Salmonella enterica subsp . enterica serovar Typhi, which may be shortened to S. Typhi (non italicised). This is now a commonly accepted practice and is adopted in the following sections of this report. 1.7 In humans S. Typhi infection can cause typhoid fever, resulting from bacterial invasion of the bloodstream , but most food -borne Salmonella serovars cause acute gastroenteritis. Food -borne Salmonella infections are caused by ubiquitous Salmonella serovars (mos t commonly S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium). Symptoms appear (diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting, and fever ) between 6 -48 hours following ingestion of contaminated food and acute symptoms may last for 1 to 2 days or may be prolonged, depending on host f actors, ingested dose, and strain characteristics . Recovery usually occurs without the need for medication, but complications can arise which include sepsis, meningitis and reactive arthritis. Chronic and extra -intestinal infections t herapy. 7 http://www.hpa.org.uk/infe ctions/topics_az/ Salmonella /menu.htm MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 10 1.8 S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A cause typhoid (enteric fever) or typhoid -like fever and are human serovars. Salmonella organisms in these cases are transmitted through human faecal contamination of water or food. Infection tends to be limited to those countries with poor control of water or sewage systems , although travellers returning from such countries may bring these infections into the UK. 1.9 Figure 1 shows the number of reported isolates of Salmonella per 100,000 of the population in England and Wa les, Scotland and Northern Ireland between 1990 and 2008. The levels in the early 1990 's, were followed by a decline in numbers from 1998 onwards in all UK countries, a trend which has continued t o be maintained up to 2008. In 2007 the origins of the cases were distributed between those occurring in the UK (24%) those which originated from a non -UK source (21.4%) and those with an unknown source (54.6%)8. Under ascertainment of Infectious Intestinal Disease (IID) is well recognised, and the true population burden is greater than that suggested by surveillance. For every report to national surveillance for disease caused by Salmonella spp. there are estimated to be approximately three unreported cases in the community9. 0100200300400500600700 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005 2008 Year Salmonella isolations per 100,000 populationEngland and Wales Northern Ireland Scotland Figure 1: Number of laboratory repo rt of isolates of Salmonella (excluding S.

MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 11 1.10 The most common serovar associated with food -borne salmonellosis in the UK is S. Enteritidis and this can be demonstrated in the annual totals in England and Wales shown in Figure 2. The number of reported Salmonella infections in the UK during the 1990s, and the ongoing decline from 1998 onwards (Figures 1 and 2) has been due mainly to the decline in number of S. Enteritidis infections. Infection l evels with serovar S. Typhimurium, have also shown a gradual decline, and the other Salmonella serovars have remained at a stable level since the mid 1980s. 1.11 Salmonella serovars of epidemiological importance such as Enteritidis and Typimurium are subdivide d by phage typing , and within S. Enteritidis, over 80 phage types (PT) have been identified. In the early 1990's PT4 was the most commonly reported phage type of S. Enteritidis. More recently numbers have declined and are now comparable to those seen for the other phage types (Figure 3) which have remained relatively constant since 1981. 0500010000150002000025000 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 YearNumber of isolates S.

Many animals are carriers of Salmonella , and show no sign of infection, and t hese organisms can be transmitted to humans through consumption of contaminated foods. Contamination of meat may originate from animal salmonel losis, from contamination by the intestinal contents during evisceration of animals, or from the hide/fleece during removal and subsequent washing, or transportation of the carcasses. Microbiological contamination on the surface of the meat is usually of little concern providing the meat is properly cooked, although handling of contaminated meat may result in a poten tial risk of cross - contamination of hands, tables, kitch enware, towels, and other foods . However, if contaminated meat is minced, Salmonella may become incorporated within the meat product which if inadequately cooked, may lead to ingestion of Salmonella and a subsequent infection. 1.13 A variety of salad vegetables, spices, and herbs have also been implicated in outbreaks of infection10. Likewise , infection can also occur following ingestion of dairy food that could harbour Salmonella such as cream or mayonnai se, or infant formula. 1.14 Salmonellae can also be found associated with eggs and can be present on the egg shells from faecal contamination from the hen, and S. Enteriditis in particular can contaminate the egg contents from infected ovaries before the shell s are formed. 10 Zoonoses Report United Kingdom (2007) Department for Enviro nment, Food and Rural Affairs .http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/zoonoses/documents/reports /zoonoses2007.pdf MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 13 1.15 EU Regulation (EC) 2160/200311 on the control of Salmonella and other specified food -borne zoonotic agents was published in 2003 and has led to the introduction of targets for reduction of Salmonella levels in primary production. As part of the measures put in place to assist in meeting these targets, National Control Programmes (NCP's) have been initiated (see http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/zoonoses/ncp.htm ). The aim of the NCPs is to protect human health by auditing flocks against agreed targets to reduce the prevalence of certain zoonoses in animal populations at primary production level, and where necessary, other stages of the food chain. Audits cover farm a nimal species which present a potential risk of transmitting Salmonella and other zoonotic agents to humans. These are currently restricted to poultry (breeding and laying flocks of hens, broilers and turkeys) and pigs (herds of slaughter and breeding pigs ). 1.16 Surveys and investigations of eggs for the presence of Salmonella have played an important role in the UK in understanding the extent and pattern of contamination. An EU survey carried out during 2004 -2005 identified 7.9% of laying hen holdings to be p ositive for S. Enteritidis or S. Typhimurium in the UK12. A 2003 survey of UK -produced eggs indicated a level of 0.34% positive samples (boxes of six eggs) for Salmonella13. UK demand is greater than UK supply and eggs are sourced from other EU countries whe re vaccination of layer flocks may be more variable. In a 2003 -2006 survey in the UK of non -UK eggs 9% of boxes of six eggs had shell contaminated with Salmonella and 6.4% of the 9% were also contents positive14. An FSA survey in 2007 detected Salmonella spp. in 0.38% of pooled samples of egg shell15. 1.17 More recently a cross both egg production and poultry production breeding lines the estimated prevalence based upon detection of Salmonella in flocks under the requirements of the Salmonella National Control Pro gramme in breeding chickens in the UK in 2007 was reported to be 1.9% for all types of breeding flocks for the five salmonellae of public health significance , (S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S. Hadar, S. Virch ow and S. Infantis)16. 1.18 Between 2006 and 2007 studies on the prevalence of Salmonella were carried out in turkey flocks and in pigs at slaughter to establish baseline prevalence of Salmonella under Directive 2003/99/EC. In UK turkey flocks the level of Salmonella was estimated at 33.2% (EU lev el 3.7%) of http://www.eurosurveillance.org/viewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=3086 15 http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/eggsurvey2007.pdf 16 The community Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses and Zoonotic Agents in the European Union in 2007, The EPSA Journal (2009), 223. www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/223r.htm MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 14 flocks that were reared for human consumption and 4.4% in breeding turkey flocks (EU 13.6%). S. Enteriditis and S. Typhimurium (ST) were detected in 4.6% of UK flocks (ST only) in comparison to 3.8% for the EU and 0.5% of UK breeding flocks (EU levels 1.7%). The baseline incidence for pigs in the UK was obtained by sampling at slaughter houses. Salmonella was found to be present in 21.2% of lymph nodes (EU weighted prevalence 10 .3%)17. A 2007 -2008 survey of chicken at retail by the FSA fo und the level of Salmonella prevalence to be 6.6%18. 2. RESEARCH FUNDED BY O THER FUNDING BODIES Within the UK 2.1 In the UK research into Salmonella is also supported by funding bodies other than the BBSRC, FSA and Defra. A number of projects on salmo nellae are funded by the MRC and Wellcome Trust , but may have been excluded from inclusion here as they do not specifically include research into Salmonella in relation to food- borne illnesses. Similarly, projects using other model organisms or sy stems and which may have broader relevance have not been considered. 2.2 A search of projects funded by the Wellcome Trust between September 2003 and September 2008 identified eleven project titles containing the word \" Salmonella \". The main focus of th e research was the pathogenicity of Salmonella and the host immune response (5/11). Other project topics included investigations of bacterial physiology and genetics and epidemiology studies. The Wellcome Trust also funded the project 'International Partnership Research Award in Veterinary Epidemiology (IPRAVE) 19 between 1999 and 2005 during which over 7500 isolates of food-borne zoonotic bacteria including S. Typhimurium were collected and made available to the scientific community. 2.3 The Wellco me trust is also the primary funder of the Sanger Institute which carries out large scale genome sequencing of many organisms including bacterial pathogens. Eleven Salmonella serovars have been investigated and by June 2009 five sequences were completed , which include two S. Typhimurium strains, S. Hadar and S. Bongori. One serovar sequence is near completion, and five are ongoing including S. Enteritidis PT4 and S. Typhi20. The availability of the genome sequence of Salmonella serovars is of key impo rtance to the continued effort in understanding the pathogenicity of these bacteria and is reflected 17 The community Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses and Zo onotic Agents in the European Union in 2007, The EPSA Journal (2009), 223. www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/223r.htm Report 15 in the number of MSFFG projects that include a genomic aspect to the investigation. 2.4 A search for \" Salmonella \" in the Medical Research Council (MRC) research database21 identified records of six grants awarded between 2004 and May 2009, four of which address host responses to Salmonella infection with the remaining two projects focussing on antibiotic resistance. Within EU funded Europe 2.5 The Community Research and Development Information Service (CORDIS)22 holds a R&D database containing details of projects from 1986 onwards that have been wholly or partially financed from the budget of the European Communities. A database search from 2004 o nwards using the term \" Salmonella \" identified a total of 22 projects of which 16 were relevant to Salmonella as a food -borne disease. Research fields ranged from basic research on Salmonella pathogenesis, to those projects investigating prevention of Salmonella in meat and egg production and also within animal husbandry. Projects concerning standards and policies, new diagnostic tests and computer models of infection and alternatives to antibiotics were also identified in this cohort. Six of the 16 projects listed the UK as the lead participant, with Spain leading three projects, Sweden leading two projects and France, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium and Portugal each the lead participant for one project. 2.6 The European Centre for Disease Preven tion and Control (ECDC) manages a programme on food - and water -borne diseases and zoonoses (FWD). This programme was set up in 2006, covers 20 diseases and has the general objectives to improve surveillance in the EU, and increase knowledge of aetiolog y, prevention and control, early detection and co - ordinated response to outbreaks. Project activities are largely based on achievements of different surveillance networks that are, or have been, functioning at the EU level. The coordination of the forme r network Enter - net was transferred to ECDC in 2007. In 2008, a new surveillance network was set up to focus on six priority diseases: salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, VTEC/STEC infection, listeriosis, shigellosis and annual me eting with the new FWD network members was held in October 2008. 2.7 The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) funded a European Communities project: ACTION 920 Foodborne Zoonoses: a Coordinated food chain approach which was completed i n 2006. The main objective of this project was to develop and improve the coordination and communication between experts in the different food 21 http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Utilities/Documentrecord/index.htm?d=MRC002629 22 http://cordis.europa.eu MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 16 chain sectors in order to improve the coordination and control of food - borne pathogens. 2.8 In 2004 the Sixt h Framework Programme (FP6A) 'Food quality and safety' theme funded the EU MED -VET-NET network which aim ed to unite medical and veterinary expertise in the fight against zoonoses and make better use of resources by sharing facilities internationally, centralising archives of reference material and standardising procedures to enable information to be pooled. A number of EU MED - VET-NET projects relevant to Salmonella can be found in the MSFFG database and are listed in Appendix 1. Within the US 2.9 The office of Extramural Research at the National Institutes of Health maintains the CRISP (Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects) database . This database includes projects funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services (SAMHSA), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ), Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ), and Office of Ass istant Secretary of Health (OASH). 2.10 The database contained 966 recorded entries on Salmonella between January 2004 and May 2009, many of which are multiple entries of the same project. Summarising this list, there were 132 projects with either Salmonella in the title or some relevance to Salmonella as a food -borne disease. Many of the topics under investigation are in line with those captured in the MSFFG database. These include a significant amount of research on pathogenicity and virulence of Salmonella , and also the physiological and immunological response of the host. Projects describing work upon vaccination strategies and antimicrobial resistance were also identified. Global initiatives 2.11 The department of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Food -borne Diseases (FOS) at the World Health Organisation (WHO)23 is developing a comprehensive strategy on strengthening surveillance of food -borne disease. In September 2006 it convened an international consultation during which FOS and its multiple partners assessed the currently available evidence, and charted the strategic way forward to fill surveillance data gaps. This meeting prompted the launch of an initiative to estimate the global burden of food -borne diseases from all major causes throu gh the food -borne disease burden epidemiology reference group (FERG)24 which comprises over 30 internationally renowned The CRISP database has recently been superseded by the Natio nal Institute of He alth's RePORT Expenditures and Results (RePORTER) query tool . http://report.nih.gov 23 http://www.who.int/foodsafety/en/ 24 http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/foodborne_disease/burden_sept06/en/index.html MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 17 experts in a broad range of disciplines relevant to global food -borne disease epidemiology. 2.12 In 2000 the WHO also created the Glo bal Salm -Surv (WHO GSS)25 network which has close to 1100 members from 156 Member States. The objective of this network is to strengthen and enhance the capacities of national and regional laboratories in the surveillance of Salmonella, the other major food-borne pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella and Campylobacter from humans, food and animals. More than 80 countries have provided data to the Country Databank on over 1.5 million human isolates and 360 000 isolates from non -human sou rces to help provide a global overview of the epidemiology of Salmonella . The External Quality Assurance System of WHO Global Salm -Surv is one of the world's largest annual proficiency tests with more than 150 laboratories participating worldwide. 3. SCOPE AND METHODOLOG Y 3.1 This report describes those research projects within the UK funded by the MSFFG member organisations that investigate salmonellae serovars which cause food -borne, gastro -intestinal illness in humans. Projects which describe w ork on other Salmonella serovars are included where they provide additional information to the overall research effort on the organism. Additional projects on salmonellae are funded by the research councils (MRC and BBSRC) but have been excluded from th e MSFFG database where they do not specifically include research on Salmonella in relation to food -borne illnesses. Similarly, research using other model organisms or systems and which may have broader relevance is not included. Post -graduate PhD stude ntships are also excluded from the MSFFG database. 3.2 At the time of writing this report, the member organisations of the MSFFG were the Food Standards Agency ( FSA), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ), the Biotechnology an d Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ), the Department of Health ( DH), the Agency ( HPA ), the ( EA) the Medical Research Council ( MRC ) the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland ( DAR D), FSA Scotland, FSA Wales, FSA Northern Ireland, the Food Safety Protection Board ( FSPB ) and the Scottish Government26 3.3 Projects were identified for inclusion in the report by searching the MSFFG project database27 using the search term \" Salmonella \" in the 25 http://www.who.int/salmsurv/supported/en/ 26 Previously referred to as the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD). 27 The MSFFG maintains a database (www.msffg.org.uk ) containing information about research projects in the area of the microbiological safety of food that are funded by the members of the MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 18 search fields; title, key words or any component of the available text Projects that commenced from 2004 onwards were included, as were a small number of projects previously not captured in earlier reports, which were ongoing between 2004 and 2 009. Further searches using the term \"Salmonella\" identified any additional relevant projects within the BBSRC oasis28, the Defra R&D29 databases and the FSA website30. 4. SUMMARY DATA 4.1 This report is based on 80 projects identified from the database searches as defined above. The Funders of these projects are listed in the table below. A list of the projects is provided in Appendix 1. Funder Number of projects funded Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) 47 Department fo r Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) 18 Food Standards Agency (FSA) 7 Medical Research Council (MRC) 5 Health Protection Agency (HPA) 2 Food Safety Promotion Board (FSPB) 1 Table 1 : Allocation of Salmonella projects funded by the MSFFG 4.2 Research summaries are described in Sections 5 to 14. The initial sections summarise projects describing research into the biology of Salmonella . This includes studies into, for example, virulence factors present in the outer membrane of the bacteria, genomic studies and colonisation strategies. Further projects focus upon a number of areas including reduction and elimination strategies and antimicrobial resistance most often in the context of their association with the food chain. Surveillance techniques in animals and food production in the UK and EU are also discussed in a number of projects. 5. MOLECULAR BIOLOGY 5.1 A number of different mechanisms and structural components are involved in pathogenicity of salmonellae . These include the stru ctures which enable the bacteria to attach and colonise the intestine and penetrate the mucosal wall, and those involved in the bacteria's ability to survive in a hostile host cell. In some Salmonella serovars these MSFFG. Members of the Group provide the project information from their respective project record systems. 28 http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/science/grants/index.html 29 http://randd.defra.gov.uk/ 30 http://www.food.gov.uk/ MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 19 mechanisms are likely to be host spe cific, whilst other mechanisms are found across serovars. An increase in the understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenicity at the structural, metabolic and molecular level may assist in developing strategies to minimise the effect of salmonellosis i n animals and humans. The following sections describe those projects which are investigating active pathways during Salmonella infection. 5.2 Of relevance to the subfamilies which have chaperone:subunit adhesive organelles, including those of Salmonel la was an examination of the structure of the stable polypeptide capsule by X -ray crystallography, mass spectrometry and atomic force microscopy which on folding and polymerisation ( BBSRC B16926 ). 5.3 The secretion apparatus associated flagellar assembly belongs to the type III secretion (T3S) family. The mechanism by which two flagellar T3S chaperones, FlgN and FliT, in S. enterica sense the progression of flagellar assembly, and regulate flagellar gene expression was investig ated characterised mutants of FlgN and FliT and with respect to time ( BBSRC BB/D015855/1 ). 5.4 E. coli contain CreBC, a regulator of the expression of genes whose products are involved in intermediary metabolism . To determine if the role of CreBC in S. Typhimurium is similar to that in E. coli, the S. Typhimurium LT2 cre regulon was ). 5.5 Salmonella was used as a model of a system of i ron storage and release from the molecule bacterioferritin (BFR). The mechanism of iron release was investigated to determine the extent of involvement of Bfd, (a ferredoxin associated with BFR). The spec ific roles of BFR and Bfd in Salmonella were tested using growth comparison experiments. (BBSRC BB/D002435/1 and BB/D001943/1 ). 6. PATHOGENICITY 6.1 Pathogenicity is the ability of a microorganism to produce an infectious disease. Factors which are central to pathogenicity include the mechanisms and ease of colonisation of the host by the bacteria and the subsequent damage which occurs, and also the susceptibility and response of the host to the invading organism. Virulence Factors 6.2 Salmonella serovars produce virulence factors; molecules that specifically cause disease, or that influence the host' s function to allow the pathogen to thrive. Virulence factors can be structural proteins located in the outer MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 20 membrane of the bacteria, or may be a protein or metabolite involved in the metabolism of the bacteria. 6.3 Identification and characterisatio n of the virulence factors and associated genes which influence Salmonella pathogenesis, and the host response to infection, was carried out in cattle infected with wild type and mutant strains of S. Typhimiurium ( BBSRC BBSEI00001021 ). Potential novel factors associated with virulence, colonisation pathogenicity islands and egg transmission were also identified for S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi using a comparative genomic approach. The role of potential genes was investigated through th e production of specific mutant strains that were tested using in vitro and in vivo infection models (BBSRC BBSEI00001170 ). 6.4 S. Dublin, but not S. Typhimurium, is able to translocate effectively and cause severe systemic salmonellosis in calves. The fates of conserved and serovar -specific tagged mutants of serovars Dublin and Typhimurium were tracked in calves using a bovine oral inoculation model in conjunction with an efferent lymphatic ). A further investigation of inoculation of calves also used a signature -tagged transposon bank for S. enterica serovar Dublin to determine whether distinct virulence loci contribute to systemic translocation in calves ( BBSRC BBSEI00001179 ). Host susceptibility to infection 6.5 The relationship between host (pig and poultry) susceptibility to infectious diseases and colonisation as it relates to the pathogen, environment and husbandry systems was investigated in order to identify rational cost- effective control measures, to improve husbandry, and lead to a reduction in susceptibility to infections disease ( BBSRC BBSEF00042154 ). The additional factors of commensal gut flora and genetic background in pigs were included in a separate proje ct on host susceptibility; which also assessed the gene expression (particularly virulence genes), tissue distribution and host (poultry) immune responses to infection with Salmonella spp. ( BBSRC BBSEI00001160 ). Host-bacterial interactions 6.6 The i nteraction between Salmonella and a number of specific host cells including epithelium and macrophages have been investigated. The immune response of the host has also been examined by looking at the T cell population. 6.7 Surface structures derived fr om S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 were used to study the molecular basis of the interaction between the mucin layer of the gut epithelium, which is key for commensal microflora, and the surface structure of the bacterial cell wall ( BBSRC BBSEF00042240 ). Salmonella virulence was also investigated by exploring the mechanisms MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 21 by which Salmonella grow inside host cells including epithelia ( MRC G9717183 ). 6.8 Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting was used to purify sparse T cells or dendritic cells fol lowing their interaction with Salmonella . Subsequent functional studies on the cells included immunological, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses ( BBSRC BB/C511256/1 in directing the pathogen -specific T -cell response in a relevant human model was also a key objective investigated as part of a larger study on gut immunology and the interaction of food -borne pathogens (BBSRC BBSEF00041387 cells in and Mycobacte rium were used as paradigms of intracellular bacterial pathogens in genomic and bioinformatics programmes which were introduced to the Chinese Agricultural University with a China Partnership Award to study the host - pathogen interactions ( BBSRC BBSEI00 001193 ). 6.10 Screening samples for Salmonella was included as part of a study investigating the risk of Campylobacter infection from dogs. This provided added value to those studies in dogs which are already funded by Defra (Defra OZ0612 ). Response of Salmonella to stress induced neuorendocrine molecules 6.11 There is increasing evidence to suggest that enteropathogens can sense host-produced neuroendocrine hormones (e.g. norepinephrine) released by the host under stress and respond to these envir onmental cues by activating growth and the expression of virulence genes. Evidence suggests that quorum sensing molecules may also play a role in the regulation of expression of virulence genes. 6.12 The ability of S. Typhi to sense and alter its physi ology and pathogenicity in response to neuroendocrine (NE) stress hormones encountered during infection was investigated, together with the interactions between neuroendocrine hormones and the quorum sensing molecules autoinducer 2 and 3 ( MRC G0501449 ). The influence of NE and tyramine and of alpha - and beta -adrenergic receptor antagonists, which have been found to inhibit the NE -induced response in E. coli O157:H7 and S. Choleraesuis in vitro were investigated in an adherence and invasion study of E. coli O157 and S. Typhimurium in calves and pigs genome BBSRC BBC5180221 EHEC and S. Typhimurium induced enteritis and colonisation were assessed and genes res ponsive to these agents, and associated with hormone signalling were identified ( BBSRC BBSEI00001195 ). MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 22 Energy sources for metabolism 6.14 The role of sugars and fats as fuels for Salmonella during infection was investigated by blocking the manufactur e of specific enzymes and transport proteins involved in the fuel breakdown pathways and seeing whether this reduces the ability of Salmonella to survive ( BBSRC BBS/E/F/00042073 ). This relationship between the mechanisms used by Salmonella strain s to o btain their energy and colonisation ability was also investigated with inbred lines of chickens (BBSRC BBSEI00000990 ). 6.15 S. Typhimurium genes which encode enzymes involved in central metabolism show differential expression during infection, which s uggests that specific nutrients may sustain the growth of intracellular S. Typhimurium within the Salmonella Containing Vacuole (SCV) (a specialised acidic compartment inside macrophages). The invasion and colonisation ability of S. Typhimurium mutants with deletions of key metabolism genes tested this hypothesis in a mouse model ( BBSRC BBD0048101 ). Gene expression during the infection process 6.16 DNA microarray technology was a key method used by researchers to identify up and down regulation of bacterial genes during the infection process ( BBSRC BBSEF00041407 ), in BBSEF00042252 and BBSEF00041208 ) and to identify novel genes which are expressed during infection of murine macrophages by S. Typh imurium this latter study a number of gene deletions were introduced in the bacteria to compare survival and the host macrophage response in murine models. 6.17 The extent to which every non -essential gene of S. Typhimurium is required for intestinal colonisation of chickens, pigs and calves was determined using molecular genomic techniques ( BBSRC BBSEI00001255 (TMDH) in combination with oligonucleotide arrays was used to identify the function of virtually all transposable genes by simultaneously establishing the composition of mutant pools and location of insertion sites. The method has been validated in mice but required validation of the S. Typhimurium mutant libraries in chickens, pigs networks involved in invasion and survival can be referred to as Salmonella extra and intracellular virulence gene expression pro grammes (STEX and STIN respectively). Unknown regulators of the STEX and STIN virulence gene programmes were identified ( BBSRC BBF00978X1 ). MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 23 7. REDUCTION AND PREVEN TION OF SALMONELLA IN FOOD ANIMALS 7.1 A number of strategies have been put in place to r educe the impact and prevalence of salmonellosis in the EU. Vaccines in poultry have undoubtedly been effective but still require further development, and there are a number of other projects focusing on non -vaccine methods of reducing Salmonella in food animals. Vaccines 7.2 Vaccinations against Salmonella have become important in the control of Salmonella , with the majority of laying chicken flocks in the UK vaccinated against both S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium. There are a number of live va ccines available which can be given orally to create a gut-based immunity. Vaccines can be specific but in some instances vaccination will protect against other serovars in the same Salmonella group. Inactivated vaccines are given systemically but creat e an immunity which can be passively transferred to the offspring31. Vaccination is also used in the broiler chicken and breeding chicken industry sectors, in the latter, mostly in broiler breeders. 7.3 AtpA and trxA mutants of S. Typhimurium were highl y attenuated and protective when used as live vaccines and were found to induce minimal inflammation in the spleens of infected animals. The mechanisms of attenuation, virulence, inflammation and protective immunity in invasive salmonellosis were exami ned for the potential of these mutants as vaccines ( BBSRC BB/E002943/1 ). The role of complement and receptors for the Fc Fragment of Immunoglobin G (FcyR) in immunity to Salmonella was investigated ( MRC G0001245 ). 7.4 A Salmonella vaccine which present s a specific Campylobacter protein (CjaA), to the chicken immune system was also found to protect against Campylobacter colonisation. The mechanisms of protection were investigated together with an assessment of colonisation prevention from other CjaA immunodominant T cell antigen recognised during Salmonella infections, yet it is dispensable for virulence and vaccination with soluble flagellin is not protecti ve and can also impair the protection afforded by a live vaccine in part. Unravelling these mechanisms is key to developing successful vaccine regimes ( BBSRC BBF0227781 ). 7.6 The suppression of adaptive, and cell mediated immunity at the onset of sexu al maturity of laying hens was investigated using flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry to identify T and B cells. The study included 31 http://www.intervet.co.uk/binaries/92_41146.pdf MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 24 assessment of the response to Salmonella infection and to vaccination with currently available vaccines during immunit y suppression (Defra OZ0327 ). Antimicrobial agents 7.7 One alternative to the use of conventional antimicrobials is the development of other agents (small chemical entities, proteins, predatory agents) that disable specific virulence factors of the mi crobial pathogen without affecting survival or growth. 7.8 The molecular mechanism which underlies the interaction between the SPI-1 encoded Type -III pathogen S. enterica, and salicylanilides (a potential group of inhibitors) was investigated at the genomic level ( BBSRC BBD0106321 ). The effect of mutational inactivation of Salmonella gene(s) to alleviate the inhibitory effect of salicylanilides was also examined ( BBSRC BBSEI00001241 7.9 Inhibitors of the m ulti drug -resistant efflux pumps may be a way of non - antimicrobial treatment. The ability of efflux pump inhibitors found in plant extracts to prevent avian colonisation by Salmonella by inhibition of the multi drug -resistant efflux pumps was investigat ed (Defra ZM02206 ). 7.10 An important role in defence against microbial infection involves defensins. Defensins are small proteins produced by cells of the immune system which bind to the bacterial cell membrane and form pores which in turn allow efflu x of essential ions and nutrients. The mRNA levels of three new defensins were compared in cells of the immune system in the intestine and spleen of uninfected, infected and vaccinated chickens to investigate the role of the defensins to control intesti nal colonisation by Salmonella and Campylobacter . Their direct effect of defensin protein on Salmonella and Campylobacter of various serovars was also investigated (BBSRC BBSEI00001076 ). 7.11 The antibacterial effect of antimicrobial peptides present i n egg albumen upon Salmonella was investigated by studying the kinetics and mechanism of the interaction ( HPA 2004108 ). 7.12 A study to investigate the ability of orally delivered predatory Bdellovibrio to kill Salmonella colonizing the intestines of chicks was extended to study the efficacy of Bdellovibrio in Salmonella treatment regimen and any longer term effect of Bdellovibrio on bird health and also to test the behaviour of Bdellovibrio mutant strains ( BBSRC BBG0030921 ). 8. 8.1 The increase in prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella is a concern for public health, as is the increasing number of classes of antimicrobial agents involved. Complex groups of genes may encode for MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 25 resistance with little cost t o the bacterium. Antimicrobial resistant Salmonella have a selective advantage when transferred to the gut ecosystem of animals or humans treated with antimicrobials and therefore emergence of resistance and increased transmission are often linked ( Riemann & Cliver, 2006). 8.2 Much of the research described here in the area of antimicrobial resistance has focussed on the identification and further characterisation of antibiotic resistance genes using genomic studies. 8.3 A range of genomic based t ests (PCR, microarrays) were used for the identification and characterisation of specific antimicrobial resistance genes, plasmids and/or integrons in a) S. enterica with resistance to third - generation cephalosporins and mutations conferring resistance to quinolone antibiotics ( Defra VM02136 ), G0600805 and c) strains of S. Typhimurium type U288, multi drug - resistant S. Typhimurium DTs 104 and 193 and multi drug-resistant S. Paratyph i B variant Java (Defra VM02205 ). 8.4 An investigation into the resistance to the antimicrobial Triclosan, which acts as an inhibitor of fatty acid biosynthesis by binding to FabI protein, in S. Typhimurium involved identification of the genes involve d, and microarray analysis of FabI using mutants to identify differences in gene expression between strains presenting with different levels of resistance ( BBSRC BB/D020476/1 ). 8.5 The mechanism behind the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents in S. Typhimurium following exposure to disinfectants was investigated together with studies to determine whether multi drug resistance to biocide stress can occur independently of loss of virulence (Defra OD2029 ). 8.6 The relationship behind multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) and chromosomally encoded efflux pumps was investigated in non -typhoidal S. enterica . Gene expression of MAR mutants as compared with the parent strains and cloned MAR from two mutants were used for further gene charac terisation ( MRC G0501415 ). 8.7 The use and effectiveness of pre, pro and symbiotics in food producing animals for reduction in the carriage of antimicrobial resistance against bacteria including multi drug-resistant S. Typhimurium was investigated by using antimicrobial resistance gene probes in vitro (Defra VM02203 ). 8.8 The focus of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria has been on the administration of antimicrobial agents to food animals particularly when given prophylatically and/or as growth pr omoters. To assess whether pet animals may be a further source of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and the risks that this brings, a study into the prevalence of pathogenic MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 26 antibiotic -resistant bacteria, e.g. Campylobacter and Salmonella was undertaken in cats, dogs and rabbits ( Defra OD2026 ). 8.9 A comparative risk assessment was formulated on the likelihood of the development of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic salmonellas in relation to; the veterinary use of antimicrobials in the UK, and suc h usage in countries without the UK which regularly export animal food products into the UK ( Defra ZM02209 ). 9. POULTRY AND EGG PROD UCTION 9.1 The most common serovars of Salmonella associated with poultry and eggs are S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimuri um. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported the EU prevalence estimate of Salmonella - positive flocks at 23.7%, with a range of 0% to 68.2%32. In the UK prevalence is lower than the mean EU prevalence in both laying hens (7.9%) and in UK produ ced eggs (see sections 1.16 -1.17). However, since eggs and egg products are considered important sources of salmonellosis in food -borne outbreaks and control of Salmonella in chicken flocks laying eggs for human consumption is a requirement according t o the Zoonoses Regulation, there is a need to continue to monitor and control Salmonella in the UK poultry and egg industries. Monitoring and investigation of any positives is a legal requirement under the Zoonoses Directive and Regulation 2003/99/EC. 9.2 A validation procedure for elimination of S. Enteritidis (SE)/ S. Typhimurium (ST) from commercial laying flocks was described following an assessment of the level of contamination and a characterisation of the public health risks ( Defra OZ0332 ). 9.3 New S. enterica phage types (SE PTs) and other potentially egg - associated serovars were investigated in relation to the effectiveness of current vaccination strategies and outbreaks in hens and eggs. A comparative genomic study between serovars was p erformed together with an assessment of the risks posed by new SE PTs in their ability to survive and grow and thus alter the shelf life of eggs ( Defra OZ0326 ). 9.4 The molecular bases for the tropism of S. Enteritidis for hen reproductive tissues wit h a focus on the lipo -polysaccaride surface structure was investigated to determine the molecular bases underlying the survival of SE in avian macrophages ( FSA B15027 and B15028 ), in a together with projects BBSRC BBF0079731 and BBF0072211 . 9.5 A qualitative risk assessment for Salmonella in shell eggs and processed eggs in Ireland was developed ( FSPB 845). 32 http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/efsa_locale -1178620753812_1178620761745.htm MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 27 9.6 An analysis of egg contamination by Salmonella and other pathogens after moving laying hens to enriched cages and alternative housing systems was carried out in order to predict the potential risk to the consumer. In addition, genes were identified which were involved in Salmonella survival, infection, and antibiotic d rug resistance ( BBSRC BBS/E/F/00042300 ). 9.7 Changes in the immune system in maturing hens, for example the levels and function and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes and the expression of key cytokines, were measured following a) Salmonella infectio n b) vaccination and c) during point -of-lay, when it is thought there may be a suppression of immunity that may compromise protection against S. Enteritidis. A greater understanding of the immune system could lead to modifications in vaccine strategy f or a more effective protection (BBSRC BBD0075421 ). 9.8 The ability to induce innate resistance to colonisation by Salmonella by delivering a live attenuated Salmonella vaccine to newly hatched chicks was investigated by introducing attenuating mutation s and assessing the host cell responses in broilers under experimental and simulated field conditions. Other strategies for elimination of Salmonella which included use of inducible bacterial suicide genes and host defensin production were also assesse d (BBSRC BBSEI00001109 ). 9.9 Genes were identified that controlled variation in innate immune responses and the extent of genetic variability in loci that influence the innate immune response of the chicken was defined and related to resistance/suscept ibility to Salmonella and Campylobacter . This provided new opportunities for selective breeding of commercial broilers for improved resistance to enteric bacteria ( BBSRC BBSEI00001227 ). 9.10 An investigation into the extent of genetic variability of loc i that influence the innate immune response of chickens and therefore resistance /susceptibility to Salmonella (and Campylobacter ) was performed. This study aimed to show poultry breeders the potential of selective breeding of commercial broilers with improved innate resistance to enteric disease and hence improved nutrient capture and food safety ( Defra LK0665 ). 9.11 A review was undertaken to understand the contribution made by Salmonella present in animal feed to overall Salmonella infection of poultry and contamination of poultry houses and products ( Defra OZ0329 ). 9.12 The sourcing and handling of raw eggs in businesses associated with a food-borne disease outbreak of S. Enteritidis was included as part of a larger study investigating manage rial and operational risk factors associated with food -borne disease outbreaks in the catering industry (FSA B13004 ). MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 28 10. MEAT PRODUCTION 10.1 A review of current and potential alternative pig slaughter processes was carried out in combination with a practical and economic assessment to identify the highest potential to reduce contamination in pig carcasses, to meet the EU 2010 target of 50% reduction in Salmonella (FSA M01038 and M01040 ). 10.2 The level of success of implementation of disease co ntrol on live -stock farms is influenced by the tools or strategies used to promote interventions and encourage uptake. The impact of establishing \"demonstration farms\" within the English pig industry to disseminate information on disease control in pig herds were investigated ( Defra OZ0148 ). 10.3 A farm -to-fork quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) in pigs evaluated the level of exposure and the subsequent risk to human health due to S. Typhimurium (Defra OZ0331 ). 11. FRUIT AND VEGET ABLES 11.1 Although contaminated foods are often of animal origin, such as beef, pork, poultry, milk, or eggs, other food, for example vegetables and fruits, may harbour Salmonella from contamination with fertilizers of faecal origin, or if washed with polluted water or from cross -contamination from practices within the food production industry. 11.2 The mechanisms used by S. enterica and EHEC to attach to salad leaves were investigated to determine the level and pattern of adhesion and to visualize potential adhesion factors. Host factors that contribute to leaf susceptibility to colonisation were also examined using genomic approaches ( BBSRC BBG0135431 ). 11.3 The interactions between Salmonella and plant tissue was investigated in order to und erstand the mechanisms of survival and growth ( BBSRC BBSEF00042282 ); and also why attachment processes provide an environment for the bacteria that prevents a completely successful commercial decontamination ( BBSRC BBSEF00041966 ). The information was t hen used to develop intervention strategies to prevent the colonisation of ready -to-eat fruit and vegetables by bacteria together with processes for bacterial decontamination. MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 29 12. EPIDEMIOLOGY 12.1 Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of diseases within populations. Epidemiology studies are used for a number of descriptive purposes; surveillance of the occurrence of the disease, study of disease progression, identification of prognostic factors and evaluation of treatme nts (Greenberg et al., 2005). 12.2 A report on the Department of Health funded IID (Infectious Intestinal Disease) Study in England by the FSA in 2000 defined disease burden, and calibrated a national surveillance system, (an estimation of the factor by which the number of cases of infection with specified pathogens needed to be multiplied to establish the actual number of infections in the community). Since this original study was undertaken, several structural changes have occurred in the national surveillance. To repopulate the calibration with contemporary data a second IID study ( FSA B18021 ) was commissioned to estimate prospectively the burden and causative agents of IID in the po pulation and compared the results with previous national surveillance data. An archive of nucleic acid extracts were also generated, maintained and administered from IID archived gastrointestinal pathogen positive faecal specimens. Assessment of the extraction technique was performed by using PCR based techniques to detect selected pathogenic agents ( FSA B14004 ). 12.3 A UK case control study was performed to investigate if there are a specific set of risk factors for Campylobacter and Salmonella infection in infants aged less than one year ( HPA 2004132 ). 13. SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQ UES 13.1 It is not common practice for the MSFFG to consider projects involved in surveillance. The projects summarised below are included as they describe some of the bro ader aspect of suitability of new analytical methods (e.g. PCR), calculation of risk factors and development of sampling protocols. 13.2 A number of surveillance studies across the UK and Europe have been performed which together provide a substantial amount of data on prevalence of Salmonella . In addition there have been a number of projects which have looked at the robustness of those protocols which are used during identification and surveillance studies. 13.3 An epidemiological analysis generate d risk factor data from farms selected for an EU Breeding Pig Survey and identified optimum food chain control strategies for the control of Salmonella in pigs and the reduction in human salmonellosis ( Defra OZ0330 ). 13.4 Two projects have been ongoing to assist the egg industry ( Defra OZ0325) and the turkey industry ( Defra OZ0328 ) with achieving the EU MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 30 prevalence reduction targets outlined in EU Zoonoses Legislation (Directive 2003/99, Regulation 2160/2003 and relevant species specific EU legislati on). Researchers verified a number of protocols used for Salmonella monitoring (e.g. sensitivity, group sizes, sampling methods), control (e.g. time of delivery of vaccines methods for improving vaccination response), and risk reduction (adult hygiene, other vectors). 13.5 Epidemiological, risk -based and molecular data were gathered for new and emerging Salmonella serovars in farmed animal species. Resulting datasets were used to improve evidence -based sampling protocols, risk and spatial analytical models and to develop statistical theory, code and geographical information system visualisation ( Defra OZ0324 ). 14. OTHER PROJECTS 14.1 The database search revealed six projects (listed in Appendix 2) which have recently been captured in other reports from the Microbiological Safety of Food Funders Group. The relevant reports are 1) UK publicly funded research relating to risk assessment and the microbiological safety of food .33 2) UK publicly funded research on microbial antibiotic resistance in re lation to the safety of food34 and 3) UK publicly funded research relating to food preparation practices and behaviour in relation to the microbiological safety of food35 15. GAPS IN CURRENT MSFF G FUNDED RESEARCH 15.1 Genomic information is available fo r a number of Salmonella serovars and is utilised by a large number of projects. Investigations include those assessing the behaviour and growth of Salmonella mutants devoid of genes of interest, and identification of genes involved in Salmonella infec tion, for example, pathogenicity or antimicrobial resistance. Other areas of research include; effectiveness of pathogenicity, responses to environmental cues and bacterial/host interactions, for example the immune response to infection by the host. Pro jects described in this update often use microarray technologies and PCR for the identification of genes and proteins present within Salmonella ; such tools were identified in the 2005 Salmonella MSFFG report as likely to be used in future projects. As observed in this report, studies of the genetics and physiology of Salmonella continue to encompass a broad field of research into the fundamental biology of the organism. 33http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research /researchinfo/foodborneillness/microfunders/msffg/msf fgriskassessmentreport 34 http://www.msffg.org.uk/reports/antibioticresistance.html 35http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/researchinfo/foodborneillness/microfunders/msffg/ms ffgjan09 MSFFG 2009 Salmonella 31 15.2 Investigations of the bacterial genome and proteome produce large amounts o f data which require analysis by bioinformatics specialists. Such aspects of data analysis are not commonly described within the project's core delivera bles and it would be prudent to highlight that such specialists should be involved. While large amoun ts of data have been generated by projects there is a gap in the provision of an overarching central repository for the data which could perhaps identify any overlaps and common themes. While a number of projects now describe the study of Salmonella in appropriate models, commonly cattle or pigs, a gap still exists in the understanding of the relationship between data from in vitro models and findings observed in cattle, poultry and man. 15.3. This gap can be further extended to translation of the da ta observed in the genetic and physiological studies to furthering our understanding of Salmonella food poisoning; causes, reduction, prevention and antimicrobial drug resistance - described as translational research. Further information on many aspe cts of translational research may be found in the report Systems biology: a vision for engineering and medicine published by the Academy of Medical Sciences and The Royal Academy of Engineering in 2007 . This report highlights systems biology as a groun dbreaking new approach to scientific research and also calls for more support for research at the intersection of engineering and biology to ensure the UK remains competitive. 15.4 In the 2005 MSFFG report it was suggested that there was little research to address the role of phage integration in the epidemiology, survival and pathogenicity of Salmonella . The shift in recent years from less PT4 S. Enteritidis to more non -PT4 S. Enteritidis underlines the continuing need for such studies particularly on identification, integration, persistence of other phage types and their effect on pathogenicity and virulence attributes. 15.5 Current research into development of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella has focused upon identification of resistance genes. Thus there is now a need to use this genomic data and focus beyond gene identification to understanding and developing strategies to minimise development of resistance and also how changes in treatment can affect the bacterial genome. 15.6 A number of projects describe work on vaccines. While there has been a decrease in the incidence of Salmonella in the broiler and egg industries, work on effectiveness of vaccination has continued. The success of vaccination in broiler chickens suggests tha t vaccines may be a route to reduction of Salmonella in meat. Vaccine approaches have a number of caveats. There is a need for continued development of effective vaccines, and also research on the effectiveness of vaccines within tissue during meat pro duction process. While, the focus of vaccine development has been on the two main serovars, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteriditis, it may be prudent to not dismiss the need for new vaccines should the impact of other food -related Salmonella serovars change in the future. MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 32 16. CONCLUSIONS 16.1 This report demonstrates that there is continued government support for research on Salmonella in the UK and Europe, the results of which are likely to deliver a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenicity of these organism s, and also a reduction and prevention of infection with Salmonella in the context of food-borne illness. 16.2 One of the key advances has been the use of molecular biology as a conduit to understand Salmonella at the genetic level. Many research projects have utilised molecular methods to explore the genetic basis of pathogenicity, antimicrobial resistance and vaccine research. In addition many surveillance projects, including those which are more global in nature are harnessing molec ular biology techniques such as PCR as a universal method for serovar identification. The consequence of this increase in use of molecular tools is the generation of large amounts of data that require careful mining and interpretation. Researchers shoul d be cautious with respect to the level of relevance that genetic information that is obtained plays in the in vivo situation. 16.3 In the previous MSFFG Salmonella report it was suggested that a gap exists between the knowledge developed through labor atory -based studies and its application to real -life situations \"in the field\". While a number of projects described in this update have used relevant in vivo models, which go some way to address this concern, there are still many studies where the app licability to \"real -life\" Salmonella infections is still to be made. 16.4 The reduction in incidence of reported Salmonella cases in the UK is likely to be indicative of the large amounts of work to identify and reduce risk factors involved in Salmone lla infection, and the implementation of changes in working practices in the poultry meat and egg industries. This in part was precipitated in 2003 by the introduction of two EU regulations; (EC) 2160/200336 on the control of Salmonella and other specifi ed food - borne zoonotic agents, and the EU Zoonoses directive 2003/99/EC concerns the monitoring of oonoses and zoonotic agents. 16.5 Studies which aim to bridge the gap between the fundamental studies of Salmonella biology, and an understanding of th e control of behaviour of the bacteria in food animals and during meat production are likely to be of importance for moving forward in investigating this food -borne zoonoses in order to reduce its impact upon the consumer. Current research also focuses upon improvements in vaccines and vaccination strategies and immune responses in poultry and continued surveillance is also featured. 36 http://eur -lex.e uropa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2003/l_325/l_32520031212en00010015.pdf MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 33 16.6 The occurrence of salmonellosis in the UK is still important. There is therefore a continuing need for animal an d food surveillance, epidemiology studies and studies on consumer practices and to relate such data to identify patterns in the infection routes. Unification of methods for surveillance and identification of antimicrobial resistant genes is under devel opment and techniques such as PCR and use of microarrays for Salmonella identification appear more common.

Because compounds such as sulphonamides and quinolones are synthe sised chemically, they are not strictly speaking antibiotics. However, in practice the term \"antibiotic\" often encompasses such agents (ACMSF (1999)). Antimicrobial agent A substance which kills microorganisms or suppresses their replication or growth. Antimicrobial resistance The ability of a microorganism to resist the effects of an antimicrobial agent. May be an intrinsic characteristic or acquired by selection for mutation or by acquisition of a resistance gene from other microorganisms. B cells Lymphocytes which are involved in the host immune response. Their principal functions are to make antibodies against antigens , perform the role of Antigen Presenting Cells . Bacteriophage, abbreviation phage Virus tha t infects a bacterium. FACS Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting A method in which populations of cells can be separated from a heterogenous mixture using flow cytometry to isolate cells with different light scattering and fluorescent characteristics. Geno me, genomics, gene expression The genome encompasses both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA of one set o f chromosomes. Genomics is the study of the genomes of organisms and includes determining the DNA sequence of organism s and genetic mapping . Gene expression is the process by which the information contained within a gene is used to produce ribonucleic acid (RNA) which functions as a template f or protein production or as a molecule involved in regulation of the genome. Genomic Island (GI) A previously mobile element, which has subsequently become incorporated and fixed into the bacteria genome. GI's are characterised by their large size(>10 Kb), often have a different base content compared with the rest of the genome , and also carry fragments of other mobile elements such as phages and plasmids. Some genomic islands can excise themselves spontaneously from the chromosome and can be transferred t o other suitable recipients. MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 36 GFP (Green fluorescent protein) A protein which fluoresces when exposed to light and can be synthesized by a cell following insertion of the GFP gene into its genome. GFP is often inserted alongside a gene of interest. When transcription occurs to both genes, GFP is produced, can be visualized and reports that the gene of interest has also been transcribed. Integrons A DNA element that can convert exogenous gene cassettes found in plasmids, chromosomes and transposons into functional genes by ensuring their correct expression. These DNA elements contain hundreds of accessory genes and constitute a significant fraction of the genomes of many bacterial species. Microarray A multiplex technology c onsisting of an arrayed series of thousands of microscopic spots called features. Features can be for example, a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used as probes to which related cDNA or cRNA sample will anneal. Annealing is usually detected and quantified by fluorescence -based detection of fluorophore -labeled targets. PCR ( Polymerase Chain Reaction) A widely -used molecular method used to gener ate multiple copies (amplification) of a target DNA sequence. RT-PCR ( Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) A molecular method in which an mRNA target sequence is converted into a complementary DNA strand. Plasmids A DNA molecule that occurs separately from chromosomal DNA and is capable of replicating independently of the chromosomal DNA. Proteome The set of proteins e xpressed by the genome of an organism, or cell. Quorum sensing molecule A molecule which is released by one or more bacteria of a colony to trigger coordinated behaviour, e.g. gene expression, among the population as a whole. Serovars, serovar Subdivisi ons of a (bacterial) species identified by their antigenic characteristics. Translational research (translation, translate) The process of the bidirectional transfer of knowledge between basic work (in the laboratory and elsewhere) with that of the person , in health or disease37. In 37 Medical Research Council Workshop: Accelerating the Translation of medical research (2007). http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Utilities/Documentrecord/index.htm?d=MRC003642 MSFFG 2009 Salmonella Report 37 the context of this report translational may be described as transfer of knowledge from the organism on the bench to within the food industry. Translocation The movement of bacteria between and across tissues membranes e.g. from the intestines to distal organs. Transcriptome The set of all messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, or \"transcripts,\" produced in a cell. Unlike the genome, the transcriptome can vary with external environmental conditions. Type III secretion A specialised secretion system found in many Gram -negative bacterial pathogens, which can deliver virulence proteins directly into host cells. T cells Lymphocytes which are involved in the immune response. Their principal functions are in cell -mediated immunity. Unlike B cells they possess a receptor on their cell surface called T cell receptors . Several different subsets of T cells have been discovered, each with a distinct function. STM (Signature Tagged Mutagenesis) A technique where genes are altered with random insertions of small mobile DNA sequences (which are themselves tagged with a sequence for identification) into a genome. When the genes are transcribed and translated the protein structures are altered and loos es function but can be traced via the tag. This method can be used as a means of identifying virulence genes in bacteria. Virulotyping The typing of bacteria based on their virulence factors using microarrays.
