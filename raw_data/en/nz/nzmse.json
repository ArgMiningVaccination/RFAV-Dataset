See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de informaci\u00f3n www.immunize.org/vis 1 Why get vaccinated? Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are serious diseases caused by bacteria. Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through cuts or wounds. DIPHTHERIA causes a thick covering in the back of the throat. It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and even death. TETANUS (Lockjaw) causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to \"locking\" of the jaw so the victim cannot open his mouth or swallow. Tetanus leads to death in up to 2 out of 10 cases. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough) causes coughing spells so bad that it is hard for infants to eat, drink, or breathe. These spells can last for weeks. It can lead to pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring spells), brain damage, and death. Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine (DTaP) can help prevent these diseases. Most children who are vaccinated with DTaP will be protected throughout childhood. Many more children would get these diseases if we stopped vaccinating. DTaP is a safer version of an older vaccine called DTP. DTP is no longer used in the United States. 2 Who should get DTaP vaccine and when? Children should get 5 doses of DTaP vaccine, one dose at each of the following ages: 2 months 4 months 6 months 15-18 months 4-6 years DTaP may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 3 Some children should not get DTaP vaccine or should wait Children with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But children who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting DTaP vaccine. Any child who had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of DTaP should not get another dose. Any child who suffered a brain or nervous system disease within 7 days after a dose of DTaP should not get another dose. Talk with your doctor if your child: - had a seizure or collapsed after a dose of DTaP,- cried non-stop for 3 hours or more after a dose of DTaP, - had a fever over 105\u00b0F after a dose of DTaP. Ask your doctor for more information. Some of these children should not get another dose of pertussis vaccine, but may get a vaccine without pertussis, called DT. 4 Older children and adults DTaP is not licensed for adolescents, adults, or children 7 years of age and older. But older people still need protection. A vaccine called Tdap is similar to DTaP. A single dose of Tdap is recommended for people 11 through 64 years of age. Another vaccine, called Td, protects against tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis. It is recommended every 10 years. There are separate Vaccine Information Statements for these vaccines. 5 What are the risks from DTaP vaccine? Getting diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis disease is much riskier than getting DTaP vaccine. However, a vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of DTaP vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Mild problems (common) Fever (up to about 1 child in 4) Redness or swelling where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4) Soreness or tenderness where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4) These problems occur more often after the 4th and 5th doses of the DTaP series than after earlier doses. Sometimes the 4th or 5th dose of DTaP vaccine is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg in which the shot was given, lasting 1-7 days (up to about 1 child in 30). Other mild problems include: Fussiness (up to about 1 child in 3) Tiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10) V omiting (up to about 1 child in 50) These problems generally occur 1-3 days after the shot. Moderate problems (uncommon) Seizure (jerking or staring) (about 1 child out of 14,000) Non-stop crying, for 3 hours or more (up to about 1 child out of 1,000) High fever, over 105\u00b0F (about 1 child out of 16,000) Severe problems (very rare) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine. These include: - Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness- Permanent brain damage. These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine. Controlling fever is especially important for children who have had seizures, for any reason. It is also important if another family member has had seizures. You can reduce fever and pain by giving your child an aspirin-free pain reliever when the shot is given, and for the next 24 hours, following the package instructions. 6 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. 7 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. 8 How can I learn more?

I will comply with immunization schedules, dosages, and contraindications that are established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and included in the VFC Program unless: a. In the provider's medical judgment, and in accordance with accepted medical practice, the provider deems such compliance to be medically inappropriate; b. The particular requirements contradict state law, including laws pertaining to religious and other exemptions. 3. I will maintain all records related to the VFC program for a minimum of three (3) years or longer if required by state law and make these records available to public health officials, including the Chicago Department of Public Health or Department of Health and Human Services, (DHHS) upon request. 4. I will immunize eligible children with VFC-supplied vaccine at no charge to the patient for the vaccines. 5. I will not impose a charge for the administration of the vaccine to non-Medicaid VFC-eligible children that exceeds the administration fee cap of $23.87 per vaccine dose. For Medicaid VFC-eligible children, I will accept the reimbursement for immunization administration set by the state Medicaid agency or the contracted Medicaid health plans. 6. I will not deny administration of a federally purchased vaccine to an established patient because child's parent/guardian/individual of record is unable to pay the administration fee. 7. I will distribute the most current Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) each time a vaccine is administered and maintain records in accordance with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act (NCVICA), which includes reporting clinically significant adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event reporting System (VAERS). 8. I will comply with the Chicago Department of Public Health requirement for ordering, vaccine accountability, and vaccine management. 9. Should my staff, representative, or I access VTrckS (online ordering system), I agree to be bound by CDC's terms of use for interacting with the online ordering system. I further agree to be bound by any applicable federal laws, regulations or guidelines related to accessing a CDC system and ordering publically funded vaccines. 10. In advance of any VTrckS access by my staff, representative or myself, I will identify each member of my staff or representative who is authorized to order vaccines on my behalf. In addition, I will maintain a record of each staff member who is authorized to order vaccines on my behalf. If staff changes occur, I will inform CDC within 24 hours of any change in status of the current staff members or representatives who are no longer authorized to order/manage vaccines, or the addition of any new staff authorized to order/manage vaccines on my behalf.

Program implementation began on October 1, 1994. Funds are annually transferred to the program from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and awarded to 64 immunization projects. The VFC Program is one of the largest private- public partnerships in the US. The Illinois Department of Health care and Fa mily Services ( HFS) reimburses providers for the administration of each vaccine to Medicaid- enrolled children, but does not reimburse for the cost of the vaccines that ar e available through the VFC P rogram. Therefore, providers who serve Medicaid enrolled children must be enrolled in the VFC Program . The VFC Program removes vaccine cost as a barrier to immunization for eligible children, reduces referral s to public clinics for immunization, and facilitates children remaining in a medical home for comprehensive care. The program promotes implementation of new vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The federal VFC Program provides publicly -purchased vaccines from birth through 18 years of age for children who are: Medicaid enrolled (including Medicaid managed care plans) Uninsured (have no health insurance coverage) American Indian or Alaskan Native Underinsured (only at Federally Qualified Health Centers) Section 1 T The VFC Program saves parent s and enrolled providers thousands of dollars per child in out-of-pocket expenses for vaccine. VFC Program Introduction Section 1 - Page 1 (Rev. 01/2014) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Underinsured - For the purposes of determining eligibility for VFC, children are considered to be underinsured if the child has health insurance that does not pay for the cost of the vaccine. For more information about the VFC program, please visit the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/default.htm VFC Program Introduction Section 1 - Page 2 (Rev. 01/2014) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Provider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities Enrollment he VFC Provider Agreement outlines basic information about participation in the Chicago VFC Program and establishes an agreement between the provider and the VFC program. In addition, the agreement requests information about all physicians prescribing immunizations within the practice and general inform ation about the overall clinic . It is required that the physician with overall responsibility for the clinic 's use of VFC vaccine completes and sign s the forms . The practitioner will also be held accountable for compliance by the entire organization and its employed staff with the responsibilities outlined in the Provider Agreement. The physician's name should also be typed or printed in the box next to the signature. All enrolled providers are verified through HFS for eligibility to participate in the VFC Program . Medical license and National Provider I dentif ication (NPI) numbers must be submitted for this verification process. Every step of the VFC Program is intended to be as simple as possible for the provider, while ensuring that standards for eligibility and vaccine accountability are maintained. To enroll in the Chicago VFC Program, a provider is required to: 1. Com plete the VFC Provider Enrollment form 2. Agree to comply with all stated policies and procedures as outlined in this handbook by signing and dating the Provider Agreement 3. Complete the Provider List (listing of all providers with prescriptive authority treating and seeing VFC eligible children) 4. Complete the Provider Profile Form 5. Complete the Policy Acknowledgement Certification Form Section 2 T Provider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities Section 2 - Page 1 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK If a provider maintains multiple clinical sites, each sit e must be enrolled separately. Each site will order and receive vaccine separatel y and may not transfer vaccine between sites. Providers maintain control of who they accept as patients. Therefore, a private health care provider is not required to accept a child into his or her practice merely because the child is eligible for VFC vac cines. To enroll in the Chicago VFC Program , a representative from the program will schedule a visit to the provider's site. This visit has three purposes: (1) t o provide information about VFC policies and procedures, (2) to inspect the refrigerators and freezers to be us ed for vaccine storage, and (3) to provide VFC training to the on- site designated Vaccine Coordinator and the back - up Vaccine Coordinator . The site visit and the completed VFC Provider Enrollment , Provider Agreement , and P rovider Profile Form are requir ed to complete the enrollment process . The documents listed above must contain an original signature; signat ure stamps are not acceptable. Faxed copies may be used to initiate the enrollment process, but the signed originals must follow before the first vaccine order is processed. If the documents are compl eted during the site visit, the VFC representative will collect them to finalize enrollment. If the forms are not completed at this visit, the Provider Enrollment , Provider Agreement, and Provider Profile Form should be mailed to the Chicago VFC Program, where they will be kept on file. The Provider Profile Form must be completed for individual public and private facilities approved by the Chicago VFC Program for participation in the VFC Program. The Provider Profile Form helps the Chicago VFC Program determine the amount of vaccine to be supplied through the program. This form is also used to compare estimated vaccine needs with actual vaccine supply. Annual Reenrollment (Recertificati on) The Chicago VFC Program requires that the health care providers annually renew the VFC Provider Enrollment Form and the Provider Profile Form . Profile numbers are generated for each site by VFC for providers' use based on vaccines ordered the previous year by the provider. The Provider Profile Form and As of 2014, ne w providers are required to have a stand -alone freezer and one month of temperature data before receiving VFC vaccine. Provider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities Section 2 - Page 2 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Provider Agreement will be updated annually , or when there is a change in the practice and estimates of children served changes , or the status of the facility changes . Change of Status Any time there is a change in the physician(s) within the clinic , if the clinic moves to another location or if the clinic is sold to another health care facility, the current provider must notify the Chicago VFC Program with that information at least two weeks before the transition takes place. If the provider decides to close the clinic or to dis -enroll from the VFC P rogram , the provider must contact the Chicago VFC Program as soon as possible. Arrangements will be made to pick up remaining doses of VFC vaccines , retur n VFC equipment and collect any outstanding accountability information. Requirements and Responsibilities Providers participating in the VFC Program must agree to comply with the following requirements: 1. Annually submit a provider profile representing populations served by the practice or more frequently if the 1)number of children changes or 2)the status of the facility changes during the calendar year. 2. Screen all patient s (birth through 18 years of age) at each immunization encounter to determine VFC el igibility in one of the following categories: a. American Indian or Alaskan Native; b. Enrolled in Medicaid or Medicaid managed care- children who are insured by All Kids, the Illinois State Children's Healthcare Program (S -CHIP) are considered VFC eligible in 2014; c. Uninsured (no health insurance coverage) or self -pay; d. As of 10.1. 2016, S-CHIP (Title XXI) children are not VFC eligible . V accine supplied to them will need to be purchased privately and maintained separately. Children with private insurance that covers immunizations cannot receive VFC vaccines. Providers must use privately purchased vaccines. The provider is responsible for notifying the Chicago VFC Program of any changes in the enrollment information as soon as changes occur. Provider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities Section 2 - Page 3 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK e.

I -CARE is administered by the Illinois Depar tment of Public Helath as authorized by the Immunization Data Registry Act, 410 IL CS 527. Data in the I - CARE registry may only be used to assure adequate immunization, avoid unnecessary immunizations, meet immunization requirements, and for other public health purposes as determined by the Department. Participation will include, but not be limited to, documenting patients with VFC eligibility criteria and administration data for all VFC doses provided, VFC vaccine inventory, temperatures of refrigerators and freezers storing or containing VFC vaccines, primary and back -up thermometer Provider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities Section 2 - Page 5 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK certificate of calibration information, and routine use of the VFC ordering system. B) Agree to be bound by the Department's terms of use for interacting with the registry and agree to be bound by any applicable federal laws, regulations or guidelines related to accessing an IDPH system and ordering publicly funded vaccines. C) In advance of any I -CARE access by my staff, representative or myself, I will identify each member of my staff or representative who is authorized to order vaccine on my behalf. If changes occur, I will information the Department within 48 hours of any change in status of current staff members or representative who are no longer authorized to order v accines, or the addition of any new staff authorized to order on my behalf. The term of the Agreement is valid for one (1) year unless terminated earlier. To continue participating in the program the practice is required to annually re-enroll by completing a new Practice Profile Form and Provider Agreement. Re- enrollment is not guaranteed and may be denied for any reason. Failure to re-apply for enrollment will mean suspension and possible termination from the VFC program. 16. The term of the Agreement is May to April unless terminated earlier. The Chicago Department of Public Health may terminate this agreement at any time. If I choose to terminate the agreement, I will properly return any unused federal vaccines as directed by the Chicago Department of Public Health. Screening and Documenting Patient Eligibility Providers have the responsibility to ensure that VFC vaccine is administered only to eligible children. Providers are required to maintain a Patient Eligibility Screening Record on all VFC -eligible children. The screening record is typically included in the patient paper chart or Electronic Medical Record (EMR). The record can be maintained as a log if charts are not used, as in the case of mobile care vans. The records of screening must be maintained for a minimum period of three (3) years. Providers are required to screen all children and document the results from each screening at every immunization visit. This is because insurance coverage and Medicaid eligibility may change between heal th care visits. The Chicago VFC Program recommends the use of the Chicago VFC Program Patient Eligibility Screening Form , although providers may Provider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities Section 2 - Page 6 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK incor porate the information into their clinic forms if all fields are present and screening is done at each im munization visit. Documenting Vaccines Under the law, providers must document all immunizations, including the following elements: Name of vaccine (e.g., \"DTaP,\" not \"Infanrix\") Vaccine m anufacturer Vaccine lot number Date the vaccine was given Signature of person administering the vaccine Publication date on the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) Date the VIS was given Clinic name and address where the vaccine was administered Best practices in immunization documentation would also include adminis tration route (IM or SQ), and site (right deltoid). The information must be maintained in the patient's chart or as stated above for a minimum of 10 years 1, and must be available for review by Chicago VFC representatives. The Chicago VFC Program strongly encourages the use of our Vaccine Administration Record and History Form (pink form) in the patient's chart (see sample of completed form in section appendix ). This form consolidates all the required information on a single sheet and allows for rapid ass essment of a child's immunization status . Adverse Events The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 19862 was passed in response to increasing concerns regarding vaccine safety. NCVIA established a \"no- fault\" system to compensate children and their 1 (Inpatient and Outpatient) 210 ILCS 85/6.17 (c) M;12 years if litigation pending (IL Law on pending litigation involving patient files) 2 Immunization and Vaccine Permanent Records - 42 USC 300aa -25 M; National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986; record in permanent medical record. Provider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities Section 2 - Page 7 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK families following adverse events associated with childhood immunization. NCVIA also established documentation standards for immunization providers and mandated the use of Vaccine Information Statements (VIS). These standards apply to all vaccine dos es administered, regardless of the funding source (public or private). Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) Before vaccinating a patient , the provider is required by federal law to provide a copy of the VIS to the parent , legal guardian, or patient. Highlights of legal requirements regarding the use of VISs are as follows: Give a copy of the most current VIS available to the parent , legal guardian, or patient. They must be given time to read the VIS prior to administration of the vaccine. Record the d ate the VIS was given in the patient's chart. Record the publication date of the VIS ; this date appears at the bottom of the VIS. Offer th e parent , legal guardian, or patient a copy of the VIS every time , even if the child has received previous doses of th e same vaccine. Chicago VFC providers are required to obtain and make copies of the VIS of appropriate vaccines for their use. The law applies to all doses of routinely recommended childhood vaccines adm inistered by a provider, regardless of whether VFC vaccine or privately purchased vaccine is used. Copies of the most current VISs available at the time of publication of this manual can be found in the RESOURCES section of this manual . They may be copied as needed. A set of VISs or a single copy of an individual VIS may be ordered through the CDC's Immuni zation Hotline at 1- 800-232-4636 . VISs are available for download from the CDC's website: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ . Many parents/guardians speak a language other than English as their first language. VISs are available in a variety of foreign Provider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities Section 2 - Page 8 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK language translations and may be downloaded from the website of the Immunization Action Coalition: www.immunize.org . Fraud and Abuse The Chicago VFC Program has policies, procedures and processes in place t o prevent and detect instances of fraud and/or abuse and to ensure that vaccines supplied by the VFC P rogram are used an d accounted for appropriately. The Chicago VFC Program reserves the right to conduct unscheduled visits to identify probable cases of f raud and abuse; and take all necessary corrective actions. Many providers may not be aware of instances of fraud or abuse that may be occurring in their clinic. The following definitions of fraud and abuse are derived from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) and common examples are listed below : Fraud Fraud is defined as \" an intentional deception or misrepresentation made by a person with the knowledge that an unauthorized benefit could result \u2014for the entity committing the fraud, or some other entity. This includes any act that constitutes fraud under federal or state law. 3\" Possible examples of the types of fraud that may occur with respect to the VFC Program may include, but are not limited to: 1. A health care provider bills Medicaid for administration reimbursement when no vaccines were given. 2. A provider administer s VFC-supplied vaccine and then bills the child's private insurance company for the cost. 3. A provider charges a patient for the cost of the VFC - supplied vaccine. 4. A provider stop s purchasing vaccine for patients whose insurance covers immunizations, and then uses VFC- supplied vaccine for all patients, regardless of eligibility. 3 See 42 Code of Federal Regulations 455.2 Provider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities Section 2 - Page 9 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Abuse Abuse is defined as \"provider practices that are inconsistent with sound fiscal, business or medical practices, and result in an unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, or in reimbursement for services that are not medically necessary or fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care. This would include beneficiary practices that result in unnecessary costs to the Medicaid program. 4\" Possible examples of the types of abuse that may occur with respect to the VFC Program may include, but are not limited to: 1. Vaccines are w asted, allowed to expire, or used improperly. 2. A provider redistributes or divert s VFC -supplied vaccine to other clinics or persons not expressly intended by the VFC Program. 3. A provider fails to screen patients for VFC eligibility at every immunization visit . 4. A provider orders VFC vaccine (s) in quantities or patterns that do not match provider profile, or otherwise over -order s VFC vaccines . Preventing Fraud and Abuse In addition to complying with all VFC Program requirements, providers can take additional steps to prevent fraud and abuse in their clinic s. Step 1: Screen for VFC eligibility at every visit . Providers who are uncertain about which patients are eligible for VFC vaccines and which vaccines can be given, should refer to the VFC Program Vaccine Eligibility Reference Table before administering va ccines. Step 2 : Compare ev ery vaccine order to the Pr actice Profile Form before submitting the order to the Chicago VFC Vaccine Management Unit. Be prepared to justify to the Vaccine Manager any orders that exceed expected usage. Step 3 : Compare the nu mber of children serviced by elig ibility category (e.g. Medicaid- enrolled children) with other existing data (e.g. Medicaid billin g data) to ensure the 442 Code of Federal Regulations 455.2 Provider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities Section 2 - Page 10 (Rev. 01/2014 ) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK administration of VFC -supplied vaccine to eligible children only. Step 4 : Routinely compare vaccine usag e and inventory data to the VFC eligibility screening data to identify any possible discrepancies . The Public Health Administrator I (PHA I) from the Chicago VFC Program Quality Assurance Section may review this before/during a site visit. Step 5 : At a mi nimum, a VFC Practice Profile form should be updated annually, but should be revised more frequently if a provider's clinic size or vaccine needs change, or at the discretion of the Chicago VFC Program. 5 VFC Compliance Site Visits The purpose of VFC site v isits is for t he Chicago VFC Program to monitor VFC compliance, evaluate provider clinic s' conformance to program requirements , and provide information or answers to questions or concerns. Providers are required to allow VFC representatives to review the clinic 's compliance with VFC requirements and assess immunization coverage levels. These visits may be informal and unscheduled or they m ay be formal and comprehensive. Please see Section 5 for more information. 5 Fraud and abuse prevention strategies are listed in the CDC document, \"Vaccine Management and Accountability,\" mgmt acct.htm .

A clinic's vaccine need is based upon the number of VFC eligible children seen in the clinic , as reported on the VFC Practice Profile Form. Each VFC provider is expected to stock adequate amounts of privately purchased vaccine to use for their non-VFC eligible children in their practice. It is our goal, as it should be yours, to always have the right amount of vaccines in stock for your patients , both VFC and non- VFC. Here is a handy formula to use so that you will order the right amount of vaccine. Amount to order = Doses Administered (previous peri od) x Order Frequency Factor * - (subtracted from) Inventory on Hand (round all numbers to the next box size). *Order Frequency Factor 2.3 (monthly orders), or 1.6 (bi -monthly orders, or 1.4 (quarterly orders) Example: You order your vaccines every other month (bi -monthly) and you have 30 doses of DTaP in your inventory. You don't have any wastage and you used 22 doses during the past two months 22 x 1.6= 35.2. 35.2 - 30= 5.2 Round 5.2 up to nearest 10= Order 10 doses which is the right amount to order for your next ordering period. Section 3 P Ordering Vaccines Section 3 - Page 1 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HAND BOOK Purpose This is a detailed guide to help new I -CARE users with managing their vaccine inventory in I -CARE. This will cover the steps for reconciling inventory for phase I & II providers and being dose level accountabl e for the vaccines you have in stock for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. Part A: You will need to log into I -CARE. If at any time you have lost your password or your account has been locked because your password has expired, please call the I-CARE help desk at 1- 800-366-8768 opt.1/ opt.1. After logging into I -CARE, locate the vaccine module and the vaccine lots tab. See screen shot below for visuals. 1. Click \"Vaccines\" 2. Select \"Vaccine Lots\" 3. Select View radio buttons \"In Stock\" and \"VFC\" If you have questions or concerns about your provider site EOQ , please contact your PHA or the Vaccine Management Unit at 312.746. 5385. Placing a Vaccine Order VFC providers should adhere to their assigned EOQ schedule. Until f urther direction is provided by the VFC Program staff, p roviders should continue to order vaccine according to the procedures currently in place . Each provider will be informed by the VFC Program staff of when their transition onto I -CARE ordering will occur. Order according to EOQ. Ordering Vaccines Section 3 - Page 2 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HAND BOOK Orders must be submitted using the current Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability Form , along with the temperature logs, for the reporting period. Orders should be fax ed to 312. 746.6220 -or- Mailed to: Chicago VFC Program 2160 W. Ogden Avenue Chicago, IL 606 12 ATTN: Vaccine Management Unit TO AVOID DUPLICATE ORDERS, DO NOT FAX AND MAIL. The Chicago VFC Program will only process vaccine orders that have all the necessary information on the Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability Form . To ensure that an order is processed in a timely manner, make sure to follow the steps listed below: Step 1: Provider/Site information Complete the top portion of the Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability Form including: Current date Reporting period (i.e., June 1 to June 30) Name of clinic VFC PIN Number Delivery Address Name of person completing the form Office days and hours of operation Dates office closed in next 30 days The clinic's assigned Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Step 2: Inventory as of Date of Report Record the total number of vaccine doses on hand on the last day of the reporting month by lot number and the full expiration date (month/day/year). If the expiration date only states the month and the year, the day vaccine will expire is the last day of that month. We have included three ( 3) columns to record different lot numbers that you may have in stock . If you have more than 3 different lot Ordering Vaccines Section 3 - Page 3 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HAND BOOK numbers, please use another Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountabilit y Form . Step 3: Type & Number of Doses of Wasted/Expired Vaccine For each type of vaccine, record the number of doses wasted. Single doses of vaccine accidentally wasted for any reason do not need to be returned, but should be recorded on your Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability Form . Complete a Vaccine Return Form , each time vaccine is returned to the McKesson, the distributor , indicating the reason for the return of the vaccine. A copy of the Vaccine Return Form is contained at the end of this section. Providers should return ONLY EXPIRED OR SPOILED VACCINE. Step 4: Doses Administered by Year or Age All VFC practices should use the VFC Vaccine Usage Worksheet/ Tally Sheet to track vaccine s administered by age and type. Your accurate count of vaccines administered helps develop your profile and justifies the amounts of vaccine you order. Each staff person who administered VFC vaccine must be instructed to add a \"tally \" mark each time vaccine is removed from the vaccine refrigerator . Carefully record the brand of vaccine and the ages of the patients vaccinated. At the end of the reporting period, the primary person responsible should transfer the tally numbers, using whole numbers only (i.e., 2, 45, 86) , onto the Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability Form . If a particular vaccine was not used during the reporting period, write a \"0\" in that space. If your EMR system can accurately capture doses administered by age and vaccine, you may use this alternate method for y our doses administered, but only after you have verified the accuracy of these reports by comparing it with your manually tracked Doses Administered Tally Sheet. Step 5: Doses Requested Record the num ber of vaccine doses requested. Specif y the brand of vaccine desired. Indicate if you need pre- filled Ordering Vaccines Section 3 - Page 4 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HAND BOOK syringes by checking the appropriate box. Reminder: The pre-filled syringes do not come with needles. Neither the distributor nor the Chicago VFC Program will supply needl es for the pre- filled syringes. Provid ers must supply their own. If no vaccine doses are requested for a given ordering period, these providers must still submit Inventory on Hand and Doses Administered supporting documentation every three months until the next order is placed. Step 6: Temperature Log(s) to VFC Program Make a copy of temperature log(s) for the reporting period and include them with the VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability Form. For a blank copy and directions to properly complete a temperature log see Section 4: Va ccine Management . If you encounter a temperature excursion within the reporting period, please include documentation of actions taken to remedy the situation with your completed temperature log . For a blank copy of this document, the Vaccine Storage Troubl eshooting Record, see Section 4 : Vaccine Management . Step 7: Fax the order to the Chicago VFC Program at 312.746.6220. You may fax the Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Account ability Form at any time. Once your order is received, the vaccine should arrive within 10-15 business days. If it has not been received by that time, please call 312.746.5385. Reminder: Varicella vaccine will arrive by courier directly from the manufact urer within 10- 15 business days. Brand Choice VFC Providers are allowed to choose the vaccine product that is best suited to their needs. The Chicago VFC Program cannot guarantee the availability of all brands at all times and reserves the right to substitute another brand based upon available inventory. Reference to, or identification of , various brands in any of our publications or informational letters does not imply an endorsement by the Chicago VFC Program.

I mmediately contact the Vacci ne Management Unit (VMU) at 312.746. 5385 to obtain further instructions . If needed, vaccine management staff will schedule a site visit with the provider to investigate the event within 24 hours of report (or the next business day). Vaccine management staff will request a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) and a detailed written account of reported events. All emergency orders must be approved by the Vaccine Manager, and will be submitted to McKesson for shipment. E mergency orders can take from 48- 72 hours to receive. Vaccine Borrowing The Chicago VFC Borrowing and Replacement policy is no longer allowed. Providers may no longer borrow vaccines from their VFC supply to administer to non- VFC eligible children. VFC field staff will check providers' public and private inventories to assure adequate supplies.

Therefore, they need to be managed as carefully as possible to avoid unnecessary loss. It is the responsibility of participating providers to ensure that vaccine is managed in such a way that will minimize loss through wastage or spoilage. Following the procedures outlined below will ensure proper vaccine management. Written Plan s for Vaccine Management, Staff Training and Temperature Monitoring Providers are required to develop their own written plans for the following : Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Temperature Monitoring Procedures New Staff Training with topics and log of those trained with dates Providers may customiz e the Chicago VFC Program supplied templat es/sample plan s for three of the above requirements (included at the end of this section). Both the routine and the emergency plans should be simple, and the processes outlined in the plan should be presented in a clear and concise manner. Both plans should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary when staff or situations change. Copies of all plans should be made available to VFC Program staff upon request. Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan This plan should include guidance on the following aspects of routine vaccine management: 1. designating a primary vaccine coordinator and at least one back -up staff; 2. ordering vaccines; 3. controlling inventory; 4. storing vaccines, monitoring storage conditions, and vaccine handling Section 4 V Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 1 (Rev. 01/2014 ) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK 5. minimizing vaccine wastage; and 6. vaccine shipping, including receiving, packing , and transporting vaccine in emergency situations only. Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan This plan should include guidance on what to do in the event of refrigerator or freezer malfunctions, power failures, natural disasters, or other emergencies that might compromise appropriate vaccine storage conditions . The emergency plan should include the following: 1. person(s) responsible for preparing and transp orting vaccine, including contact information; 2. how this person will be notified that vaccine needs to be moved; 3. location that will receive vaccine; 4. how receiving location will be notified of transport ; 5. how to pack vaccine for transport ; and 6. worksheet to document vaccine involved in power or equipment failure. At a minimum the emergency plan must be reviewed and updated annually or when there is a change in staff who have responsibilities specified in the emergency plan. Temperat ure Monitoring Plan Providers need to have an established protocol for reviewing and recording temperature readings twice daily. They may customize the Routine Temperature Monitoring Guidelines (included at the end of this section) to meet this requirement. Temperature moni toring is the primary responsibility of the vaccine coordinator and back -up coordinator. In the Routine Temperature Monitoring Plan, providers are required to have written procedures to train staff who u se VFC vaccine. Designated staff must: Review temp eratures within each vaccine storage unit two (2) times each day (beginning and end); Document any actions that are taken if the temperature readings are out of acceptable range; Staff must also be trained to respond to unacceptable temperatures with a clearly defined set of action steps. Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 2 (Rev. 01/2014 ) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK As always, all VFC paperwork, including temperatures logs, staff training logs, routine and emergency plans must be kept and available for review for three (3) years . If the clinic is open less than for 5 days each week, the provider must use a digital data logger to assure that temperatures were maintained properly during the days the clinic was closed. If the clinic will be closed for vacation, the vaccine coordinator (or back -up) should be assigned to check the vaccine storage appliance(s) one or two days over the holiday or have a refrigerator monitoring device installed that is programmed to call a responsible party in the event of a problem. Providers can choose to monitor temperatures using Fahrenheit ( \u00b0F) or Celsius (\u00b0C) scales. The readings should be done consistently in one scale for all readings in all storage units used by the clinic/facility . The vaccine coordinator should record the exact time of each reading, the room temperature, staff initials, and m inimum and maximum temperatures since the last reading. After taking readings, minimum/maximum temperatures should be reset. If the clinic is closed on certain days, temperatures do not need to be recorded and should be marked \"closed.\" Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 3 (Rev. 01/2014 ) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Post a temperat ure log on the vaccine storage unit door nearby in a readily accessible place. Blank temperature log sheets are available from the Chicago VFC Program and at the end of this section.

Designated staff must review temperatures within each vaccine storage unit two times each day. Record CURRENT, MIN, and MAX temperatures twice a day. Keep temperature logs for 3 years. The CURRENT temp is the temperature now. The MIN (minimum) shows the coldest temperature in the refrigerator since the memory was last cleared. The MAX (maximum) shows the warmest temperature since the memory was last cleared. The MIN/MAX temperatures are important because they will tell you if temperatures were ever in the DANGER Zone since you last checked them. Temperatures below -15\u00b0C are OK. Temperatures above - 15\u00b0C are in DANGER. Follow the steps below to correctly record temperatures on your temperature log. These steps correspond to the steps listed on the temperature log.

If temps are still in DANGER Zone 2, Call Chicago VFC Vaccine Management Unit (312- 746-5385) Freezing of refrigerated vaccines aff ects vaccine potency more than any other exposure problem. It is extremely important to monitor your refrigerator for temperatures that are too cold. ALWAYS take the above action steps if your refrigerator is below 2\u00b0C. Warmer temperatures are normal if you are taking inventory or stocking vaccine. Temperatures should go back to normal within the hour. If you have a dual refrigerator/freezer unit, warmer temperatures could be a result of the freezer defrost cycle. If temps are not in the OK range within one hour, you must take the above action steps. Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 12 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK If Temperature is Out of Range Take immediate action when any temperature is outside the recommended range. Refer to the Action Steps in the Tem perature Monitoring Guidelines . Call the Chicago VFC Program Vaccine Management Unit if indicated in the Action Steps at 312.746.5385 . Temperature logs and records of responses taken to address out -of-range temperatures should be kept for three (3) years. Complete the Vaccine Storage Troubleshooting Record form (pictured below) when a temperature excursion is encountered. This form details the actions taken w hen temperatures are out of range and the outcome. This form should accompany temperature logs when faxing in a vaccine order. Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 13 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Designate and Train Personnel Each clinic must designate a primary and back -up vaccine coordinator responsible for training staff who use VFC vaccines in proper vaccine management. Training must include: 1. Elements of routine and emergency vaccine management 2. The vaccine cold chain 3. Appropriate procedures for receiving vaccines 4. Vaccine and thermometer placement 5. Temperature monitor ing and documentation 6. Responding to temperatures that are out -of-range 7. Procedures for preventing, reporting and returning expired/wasted/spoiled vaccines The primary vaccine coordinator should r eview temperature logs weekly if daily monitoring is being conducted by a back -up person to ensure proper temperature recording. The back -up staff should monitor the temperature logs if the primary coordinator is recording the daily temperatures . A simple log sheet with the staff member's name and date of training s hould be kept as documentation for three ( 3) years. Vaccine Storage Practices VFC providers should follow proper vaccine storage practices. Proper vaccine storage practices are important to ensure that every dose of vaccine given to a child is reliable and effective. It also reduces the amount of vaccine that is expired or wasted due to improper storage. Location and Placement 1. Store vaccines that require refrigeration in the middle of the refrigerator compartment away from the coils, walls, floor, and cold air vent. 2. Store vaccines that require freezer storage in the middle of the freezer compartment, away from the walls, coils, floor and sides. 3. Store vaccine to allow for cold air circulation around the vaccine. 4. Do not store vaccine in doors of the stora ge unit. CDC requires that all stored VFC vaccines must be kept separate from any other type of vaccines (private purchase, S -CHIP or 317). Unless otherwise noted, the vaccine coordinator and/or backup should be the VFC contact person for the clinic. Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 14 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Labeling 1. Keep vaccines organized. Store vaccines products that have similar packag ing in different locations to avoid confusion and vaccine administration error s. 2. Open only one vial, or box, of a particular vaccine at a time to control vaccine usage and allow easier inventory. Use all the vaccine in one multi -dose vial before opening another one. 3. Diluents should be clearly labeled, whether they are stored at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Label the boxes of corresponding vaccines and diluents from the same manufacturer so that they will be used together. Diluent s are not interchangeable. Staff should assure that they are using the proper diluent with the chosen vaccine. Storage Containers Attach labels directly to shelves or label trays according to the vaccines they contain. Note: Diluents may be stored in refrigerator door. Vaccines should not be stored in refrigerat or door Vaccines should be stored in the middle of the compartment, away from the vents, walls, coils and off the floor. Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 15 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK 1. To avoid confusion, vaccine boxes should be stored together by type and arranged in rows. 2. Boxes should be stacked according t o expiration dates. Vaccines with the shortest expiration dates should be closer to the front of the storage unit compartment for easy access. 3. Store all open and unopened vials of vaccines in their boxes inside the appropriate storage unit so that their c ontents and expiration dates are easily visible. 4. Use t rays and containers to organize vaccine boxes. Each tray or container should only store vaccine of the same type. Non-Vaccine Products 1. Never store food or beverages in the refrigerator or freezer where vaccines are stored. Frequent opening and closing of the refrigerator or freezer door can lead to marked temperature variations and decrease vaccine efficacy. Use a Reliable Refrigerator and Freezer Vaccine storage units must be selected careful ly and used properly. Refrigerators or stand- alone freezers used for vaccine storage must comply with the following requirements: 1. Be able to maintain required vaccine storage temperatures year -round; 2. Be large enough to hold the year's largest inventory (e.g. influenza season); 3. Have a working, certified thermometer stored in both stand- alone freezer and refrigerator. 4. Be dedicated to the storage of vaccines. (Food and beverages must not be stored in a vaccine storage unit because this practice results in frequent opening of the door and destabilization of the temperature.) 5. Appliance should be equipped with automatic defrost capabilities. Manual defrost appliances will only be approved if there is another location in which vaccines can be safely stored while defrosting is taking place. Providers are Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 16 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK cautioned that any amount of frost build- up over 1- 2 cm will require immediate defrosting. Three types of storage units are acceptable: 1. A refrigerator that has a separate freezer compartment with a separate exterior door (Note: only refrigerator compartment may be used for VFC vaccine storage) . 2. Stand -alone refrigerator 3. Stand -alone freezer Small single -door (dormitory -style or bar -style) combined refrigerator -freezer units should not be used for permanent vac cine storage. The freezer compartment in this type of unit is incapable of maintaining temperatures cold enough to store MMRV, varicella, and zoster vaccines. If attempts are made to cool the freezer compartment to the appropriate temperature, the temperat ure in the refrigerator compartment will fall below the recommended range, potentially freezing the refrigerated vaccines. Not Suitable Unit Refrigerator and freezer compartments must have separate external doors. Prepare Vaccine Storage Units Before any VFC vaccine can be stored in a vaccine storage unit, the temperature must be set and stabilized to the appropriate temperature ranges. Refrigerator The refrigerat or compartment should maintain temperatures between 35\u00b0 and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0C). The temperature should never fall below 35\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) or rise above 46\u00b0F (8\u00b0C). Therefore, set the temperature mid- range to achieve an average of about 40\u00b0F (5\u00b0C). This temperature setting will provide the best safety margin. Single -door refrigerators with enclosed fr eezers are not acceptable for the storage of VFC vaccine. Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 17 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Freezer The freezer should maintain an average temperature of 5\u00b0F ( -15\u00b0C) or colder. Steps to Stabilize Temperatures 1. Remove all vegetable/storage bins from the refrigerator compartment. 2. Place at least two or three large containers of water at the bottom of the refrigerator. 3. Store the water bottles against the inside walls and in the door racks of the refrigerator. 4. Store frozen ice packs along the walls, back, and bottom of the stand - alone freezer and insid e the racks of the freezer door. Not only will water bottles and frozen packs help maintain an even temperature in the compartments with frequent opening and closing of the doors, they will also help keep the temperatures stable in the event of a power failure. Allow 30 days of twice daily refrigerator and freezer temperature recordings before using a newly installed or newly repaired refrigeration unit to store vaccines. Frozen packs in freezer Frozen packs in freezer Water bottles in refrigerator In case of an emergency that causes the vaccines to have to be moved, the ice packs will be needed immediately to keep the vaccine cold inside the cooler(s). Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 18 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Vaccine Security and Equipment Maintenance It is important to routinely monitor that the vaccine storage unit is working properly in order to protect the vaccine supply. If the vaccine storage unit is not working properly, providers should refer to their clinic's emergency vaccine storage and handling plan and try to identify the cause of the problem. Below are a few basic ways to maintain the proper functioning of vaccine storage units and protect vaccines. 1. Do not use outl ets with built -in circuit switches (they have little reset buttons) for refrigerator/ freezers. 2. Avoid wall outlets that can be activated by a wall switch. 3. Use a safety -lock plug or an outlet cover to reduce the chance of the unit becoming inadvertently unplugged. Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 19 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK 4. Post a \"Do Not Unplug\" or \"Warning\" sign next to the outlet and on the electrical panel to warn people not to unplug or disconnect the refrigerator/freezers. A copy of the sign is available at the end of this section. 5. Limit access to the vaccine supply to authorized personnel only. 6. Check that doors are properly sealed each time the door they are closed. 7. Providers with a large quantity of VFC vaccines should use a back -up generator in case of a major power failure. Use Certified Thermometers All refrigerator and freezer units that are used to store VFC vaccine must be equipped with a certified and calibrated thermometer with a current certificate of calibration at all times. The Centers for Disease Control requires use of a certified, calibrated thermometer and a back -up thermometer in each storage unit used to store VFC vaccine. CDC requires that all temperature devices have probes in glycol rather than thermometers that measure air temperatures. Follow the manuf acturer's recommended schedule for recalibration of the certified thermometers. Be sure that clinic staff understands how to r ead the thermometer (s) used in the storage units. Acceptable certified thermometers include the following: Digital Thermometer s Digital thermometers have an easy -to-read screen o n which the temperature is displayed in Fahrenheit and/or Celsius. Some have optional features, including a display of the minimum and maximum temperatures, a temperature alarm that can be set to ring at a specified temperature, and a temperature probe in glycol Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 20 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Digital Data Loggers Digital data loggers are small, battery -operated, electronic devices that may be programmed to record temperatures at intervals throughout the day. They are capable of recor ding hundreds or even thousands of individual temperature readings. Digital data loggers used in vaccine storage are accompanied by special software that is installed in a computer. In order to review the temperature history, the user must download data from the digital data logger to the computer on a regular basis. When digital data loggers are used in vaccine storage, temperatures must still be manually checked and recorded twice a day. A second certified thermometer may be used for these manual temperat ure checks. The CDC and Chicago VFC strongly recommend using digital data loggers for continuous temperature monitoring in vaccine storage units. Even though it is only a recommendation at this time, Chicago VFC anticipates that all VFC providers will soon be required to have digital data loggers. The data will help to identify if storage temperatures are in proper range. The data includes important information such as minimum and maximum temperatures, alarms, and length of time that vaccines may have been stored in out of range temperatures. Information technology support technicians (IT/IS) may be needed to assist with this process. Installation and training takes about 1- 1\u00bd hours. With a data logger's continuous temperature monitoring, you will always know if proper storage conditions were maintained overnight and through weekends and holidays. By providing your practice and Chicago VFC detailed temperature excursion measurements, data loggers can prevent unnecessary vaccine loss. Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 21 (Rev. 01/20 14) The CDC recomm ends digital data loggers used for VFC vaccines should have the following features: Temperature measured by a probe in glycol bottle High/low alarm for out -of-range temperatures Current temperature display, as well as minimum and maximum temperatures Reset button Low battery indicator Calibrated with accuracy of +/ - 1\u00b0F (0.5\u00b0C) Memory storage of at least 4000 readings. The device will not rewrite over old data and stops recording when memory is full. User programmable logging interval (or reading rate). Chicago VFC suggests recording in fifteen minute intervals . The following are suggested websites where certified thermometers Thermometer Placement The thermometer should be placed in the center of the compart ment with the stored vaccine and away from the coils, walls, floor, and fan in order to obtain a true reading of the temperatures. Be sure that air can circulate around them. Refrigerator In the refrigerator, thermometers should be positioned away from the fan and not too close to the freezer. It should be placed on the middle shelf, adjacent to the vaccine, or hanging down from the upper shelf. Freezer In the freezer, the thermometer should be suspended from the ceiling of the compartment or placed on a box ( or some other item ) so that it is in the middle of the compartment , off the floor. If the thermometer indicates a temperature outside the recommended range, check that the thermometer is appropriately situated. Receipt of Vaccine Shipments All staff members who accept vaccine deliveries must be aware of the importance of maintaining the cold chain and of the need to immediately notify the vaccine coordinator or backup person of the arrival of the vaccine shipment so that it can be handled and st ored appropriately . Steps to properly inspect and store vaccine shipments are listed below: 1. Designate one staff member (and a back -up staff member) to receive vaccine shipments. Ideally, these staff members would be the VFC Vaccine Coordinator Place a thermometer in the center of each refr igerator and freezer unit. and VFC Back -up Vaccine Coordinator, but anyone who would receive vaccine shipments should be trained thoroughly in this process. 2. Upon delivery, open the shipping box immediately and inspect the contents for any potential damage that may have occurred during shipm ent. Ensure the box is not left idle and that vaccines are promptly and properly stored by you or by the appropriate designated staff member. 3. Allow sufficient time to properly unpack the vaccine, review the shipping invoice and inspect the shipment. 4. Inspect the shipment: a. Check the vaccine and diluent quantities against the vaccine order invoice to make sure they match. Diluent is shipped with MMR and varicella. b. Check the vaccine lot numbers and expiration dates to make sure no expired or short -dated vacc ines/diluents are in the shipment. c. Report any order discrepancies immediately to the Chicago VFC Program Vaccine Management Unit at 312.746.5385 5. Inspect the vaccine: a. Check the temperature indicator that is enclosed in the shipment container to determine if the vaccines were exposed to temperatures outside of the proper range for storage and handling while en route to the clinic. b. Make sure that: Inactivated vaccines are cold , but not frozen. Refrigerated packs should still be cold. Vaccine is not in direc t contact with frozen packs (e.g. crumpled br own packing paper or bubble wrap between the vaccines and the frozen packs) . Measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine is cold OR frozen. MMRV, varicella, and zoster vaccines are frozen and that gel packs are present in the shipping container. Diluent is cool or at room temperature. Diluent should not be in direct contact with refrigerated/frozen packs (e.g. crumpled brown packing paper or bubble wrap between the diluents and frozen packs) . The diluent for varicella vaccine will be shipped with its vaccine but will be located in a separate compartment on the top of the shipping container . 6. Immediately notify the McKesson Specialty Contact Center (MSCC) at 1-877- TEMP123 (1 -877-836-7123) if there is any possibility o f improper storage and handling during transportation within two (2) hours of receiving the shipment . This REMEMBER: Live vaccines are sensitive to heat and light . Inactivated vaccines are sensitive to freezing. phone number also appears on the temperature monitors included in the vaccine shipments . Any calls received by MSCC after day of delivery will result in CDC liability for vaccine replacement regardless of the cause of the temperature excursion. 7. After inspecting the shipment, place vaccines in proper storage immediately upon receipt. a. Varicella and MMR -V vaccine should go immediately in the freezer and all other vaccines in the refrigerator. b. Diluent can be stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature, but it must not be frozen. Vaccine Type Proper Temperature Range Refrigerated Vaccines 35\u00b0 - Hib-HepB HPV Inactivated Flu colder MMR* MMRV Varicella * MMR vaccine remains viable if frozen, but is usually stored in the refrigerator. 8. If there are any discrepancies in the amounts of vaccines shipped or missing product in the shipment or concerns about the shipment, place vaccine in a proper storage unit, but apart from other vaccines. Immediately contact the Chicago VFC Program V accine Management Unit at 312.746.5385. A copy of Vaccine Handling Tips and an overview of the Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit , whic h can be found on the CDC website, are contained at the end of this section. The CDC advises providers to consult the vaccine package inserts for more detailed information on vaccine storage and handling . Other Vaccine Handling Tips Use only the diluents s upplied when reconstituting MMR and varicella. Once MMR and varicella are reconstituted, they must be kept cold and protected from light. Note: Varicella and combination MMR -V must be kept frozen Discard reconstituted MMR if not used within eight (8) hours . Discard varicella containing vaccines (Varicella, MMRV) if not used within thirty (30) minutes. Discard rotavirus vaccine residue in biohazard container. Returning Shipment Boxes Empty shipment containers should be discarded/recycled appropriately. Do not attempt to returned empty shipment containers . to the vaccine manufacturer . Preventing Vaccine Loss Vaccine loss can occur due to the following errors: 1. Spoilage - vaccine damaged due to improper storage conditions or cold chain failure 2. Expirati on - vaccine not administered prior to expiration date 3. Wastage - vaccine that could not be administered once removed from storage (e.g. parent refused vaccine after the dose was drawn up, varicella vaccine could not be administered within 30 minutes of rec onstitution , or vaccine vials/syringes were are damaged/broken and could not be administered). To prevent vaccine loss, the Chicago VFC Program strongly recommends the following practices in all providers ' offices. Providers should keep enough boxes and supplies to transport entire inventory in the event of an emergency. Maintain the Cold Chain to Prevent Spoi lage Properly store all vaccine as described above. Maintain the cold chain from receipt of shipment to placement in the appropriate vaccine storage units. If cold chain failure occurs due to equipment breakdown, providers should transport the vaccines to an appropriate vaccine storage unit as soon as possible and according to their clinic's Emergency Handling Plan. Rotate Vaccine to Prevent Expiration Check expiration dates regularly. Depending upon the clinic volume, this may need to be done daily or weekly. Rotate vaccine stock by placing vaccines with shorter expiration dates in front of those with longer expiration dates . Use shortest -dated vaccine first. When new vaccines arrive, be sure to rotate stock. The vaccines with the longest expiration dates belong in the back of the refrigerator or freezer. Remember the latest received shipment could possibly have the shortest expiration dates . Order the Right Amount of Vaccines. Use the formula provided in Section 3. Vaccinate within Time to Pr event Waste Carefully screen all patients for contraindications and precautions for each scheduled immunization. Providers s hould NEVER redistribute or transpor t VFC vaccines to USE in another practice or other outside location. When providers identify vaccines that will expire within three (3) months and do not plan to use it all, fax the Vaccine Management Unit at 312.746. 6220 so arrangements can try to be made to find another provider who can use the vaccine prior to its expiration. Please include vaccine name, quantity, and expiration date on this fax, along with your name, clinic, PIN #, and phone number. Verify that parents/legal guardians/patients understand and consent to all immunizations to be given. Once reconstituted, vaccines must be admi nistered within the time guidelines provided by the manufacturer or discarded. Do not pre- draw vaccines into syringes. Pre -drawing vaccine can cause administration errors and vaccine waste. Refer to Section 6: Vaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules for more information. Reporting Vaccine Loss As participants of the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, all VFC providers are required to report the amount of vaccine in invent ory that is expired, spoiled , or wasted on the Vaccine Return Form . Once reported, ALL unopened vaccine vials and syringes that have expired or spoiled are to be returned in their original packaging to the McKesson Specialty Distribution Center. A federal excise tax is issued from vaccine manufactures for all expired and spo iled vaccines. NOTE: Privately purchased vaccines should NOT be reported to the VFC Program. Spoilage Spoiled vaccines are identified as products that were improperly stored, affected by an office power failure, affected by a failure of the appliance in which the vaccines were stored, or vaccine that was spoiled during shipment (ex. frozen, or too warm). What to do if you have SPOILED vaccine: 1. DO NOT discard any spoiled vaccine. Please keep these vaccines refrigerated (or frozen if for MMRV or Varicella), and then, 2. Call the Chicago VFC Vaccine Management Unit immediately at 312.746.5385 for instructions on how to proceed. Depending upon the manufacturer's specifications, there is a possibility that the compromised vaccines are not spoiled. NOTE: Providers should NOT assume that a temperature excursion outside of the recommended range will automatically cause vaccines to spoil. You must contact the VFC program. Only the VFC management can determine that vaccine is affected. 3. If you are informed by the Chicago VFC Vaccine Management Unit that the vaccine is deemed spoiled, you may then remove it from the refrigerator/freezer, place them in the green Expired Vaccine bag supplied by VFC labeled. 4. Document all spoiled vaccine on the Vaccine Return Form . 5. Document the number of doses of spoiled vaccines in the appropriate spaces on the Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability Form. You will be asked to provide a corrective action plan regarding how to prevent the spoilage f rom occurring in the future. Please fax this corrective action plan to the Vaccine Management Unit at 312. 746.6220. Expiration Expired vaccines are identified as products that have exceeded the printed expiration date found on the box or on the vial/syringe. What to do if you have EXPIRED vaccine: 1. DO NOT discard expired vaccines. 2. Remove expired vaccine from the refrigerator/freezer, place in the green Expired Vaccine bag supplied by VFC . NOTE: Expired vaccines should be kept together in original boxes. Unused loose vials or syringe s should be grouped with the boxes of the same vaccine. Expired multi -dose vials from which some doses were removed should be discarded by the provider in an appropriate biohazard disposal container. 3. Document all expired vaccines on the Vaccine Return Form . 4. Document the number of expired vaccine doses i n the appropriate spaces on the Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability Form. Wastage Wasted vaccines are described as the following: Used syringes, with and without needles Broken vials A syri nge that was drawn up but not used Any multi -dose vials from which some doses were removed (including IPV and influenza vaccine) Diluent Private ly Purchased Vaccine: Do NOT return any privately purchased vaccine. What to do if you have WASTED vaccine: 1. Wasted vaccines are NOT returnable. 2. Individual doses of w asted vaccines should be discarded by the provider using an appropriate biohazard disposal container at the practice/clinic. 3. Document all expired vaccines on the Vaccine Return Form . 4. Document the numbe r of wasted vaccine doses on the appropriate spaces on the Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability Form. Returning Expired and Spoiled Vaccine The Chicago Department of Health VFC Program has outlined the following steps that providers should take to return all expired and spoiled vaccines to the McKesson Specialty Distribution Center: Step 1 : Notify the Chicago VFC Vaccine Management Unit of spoiled/expired vaccines by completing and faxing a copy of the Chicago VFC Vaccine Return Form to the Vaccine Management Unit at 312.746.6220. Step 2 : Consolidate all expired/spoiled vaccines into a shipment b ox(s). The shipment box(s) should NOT be packed with cold gel packs or thermometers. Step 3 : Sign the Vaccine Return Form for accuracy. Place a copy of the Vaccine Return Form in the shipment box(s) so that it is visible. NOTE: A copy of the form must be maintained at the provider office for three years following submission. Step 4 : The provider will receive pre- paid vaccine return shipment l abels via U .S. Postal Service Mail within two weeks of submitting the Vaccine Return Form . NOTE : If the pre -paid return shipment labels have not been received within two weeks, please contact the Vaccine Management Unit at 312.746. 5385 . Step 5 : Once pre-paid vaccine return shipment labels have be received, place one label on the outside of each shipment box in a visible location. Step 6 : If the provider is on a UPS pick up route, hold all shipment box(s) for the next UPS pick up, or bring all shipment box(s) to the nearest UPS store. Return Shipment Specifications The provider must complete the Vaccine Return Form for all expired or spoiled vaccine within their designated order period. (Ex. Bi -monthly providers would submit a vaccine return form every tw o months if any vaccine was expired, spoiled, or wasted within a two month period.) All returns must be shipped in a suitable cardboard box that is in good condition, free of punctures and clean. The weight of the shipment box(s) should be such that it does not break open during shipment as a result of excessive weight. The shipment box(s) should be sealed appropriately such that the returned vaccine is not exposed or risks being damaged during shipment. The provider must e nsure that all old labeling ( ex. refrigerate upon receipt, biohazard, keep frozen etc.) on re- used shipment box(s) is crossed out and/or removed with prior to shipment.

Each VFC Provider is assigned a Public Health Adm inistrator I (PHA I) from the VFC Program Quality Assurance Section and a Public Health Administrator II (PHA II) from the VFC Program Quality Improvement Section. The PHA I from the Quality Assurance Section will review and provide techni cal assistance to meet the VFC c ompliance requirements. The PHA II from the Quality Improvement Section will provide immunization resources, guidance on best practices and conduct chart assessments to improve immunization practices . According to law, providers may discl ose patient health records to health officials with in the VFC Program without patient permission. For additional guidance, see the HIPAA Factsheet contained at the end of this section. Information obtained from patient records will be kept confidential. Quality Assurance (VFC Site Visit) Quality Assurance (QA ) involves review and evaluation of VFC provider practices and is a legal requirement of the VFC program . A PHA I from the VFC Program Quality Assurance Section will conduct at least two types of quality assurance visits throughout the year: 1) routine visits and 2) compre hensive quality assurance reviews . The purpose of both types of visits are to monitor compliance with VFC Program requirements and to determine if VFC vaccines are being distributed, handled, and given to patients according to VFC policies . Section 5 Q Routine visits are informal and generally brief . The PHA I from the Quality Assurance Section is required to check the vaccine storage unit(s) at every visit , review temperature logs and may check other areas of program compliance. The quality assurance staff may also share updated VFC inf ormation, drop off VFC Program forms , provide training and answer questions related to VFC. Every year each VFC provider is required to have a comprehensiv e quality assurance review (QAR) . This type o f visit requires a thorough evaluation of the provider's compliance with all VFC program requirements including: Verification of information in the provider profile; Review of VFC eligibility screening and doc umenting procedures; Review of vaccine storage and handling practices (including temperature logs and vaccine storage units); Evaluation of provider's written procedures related to temperature monitoring , routine vaccine storage and handling and emergency vaccine storage and handling ; Review of documentation of VIS given; Review of documentation for vaccine administration; Review of vaccine ordering and accountability ; Verification that VFC P rogram policies are being properly implemented. If pro blems are i dentified during either routine or comprehensive visits, the PHA I from the Quality Assurance Section will work with provider staff to create a corrective action plan. A provider is required to take action to correct any VFC deficiencies within the specif ied time given. Failure to do so may result in vaccine delivery suspension, termination of the VFC enrollment, or possibl e prosecution. Quality Improvement (AFIX Site Visit) The PHA II from the VFC Program Quality Improvement Section will regularly conduct quality improvement visit s, also known as AFIX. AFIX is a continuous quality improvement (CQI) process that is used for : Assessment of immunization levels; Feedback of immunization information to the provider ; Incentives to motivate/and or recog nize performance, and eXchange of information on best immunization practices. AFIX is an effective strategy to improve provider practices and raise immunization coverage rates. VFC providers should expect at least one AFIX visit every two to three year s. During this visit, the PHA II from the VFC Program Quality Improvement Section will: Use either pat ient records at the provider office or electronic records through the electronic medical record system (EMR) or I - CARE (immunization registry); Conduct a thorough, objective and systematic review of a selected sample of patient records ; Administer a brief questionnaire about immunization practices ; Provide feedback and a report of assessment findings (see Sample Report ) During the feedback session, e ngage the provider in meaningful dialogue for quality improvement planning ; Offer incentives for participation in improvement activities ; Share ideas, resources and best practices related to immunization. Using Assessment Results to Raise Provider Immunization Coverage Frequently, the AFIX chart asses sment reveals that many children's immunizations are not up- to- date for their age. The C DC's Healthy People 202 0 goal is for 8 0% of children ages 19- 35 months to have completed the 4:3:1:3:3:1 series (4 DTaP: 3 Polio: 1 MMR: 3 Hib: Hep B: 1 Varicella) by 24 months of age1. However, very few providers meet this goal and rates of 70%, 50%, and even 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy People 2010: Understanding and Improving Health. 2nd ed. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, November 2000. 30% are not uncommon. However, t he PHA II from the VFC Program Quality Improvement Section can help clinics raise even the lowest rates. Adolescent immunization coverage levels are also used to determine if providers are adequately immunizing their adolescent patients with the recommended vaccines. Providers often are surprised when they are informed that their rate is less than ideal, and desire to know why. The most common reasons for these low rates include missing opportunities to immunize, administering invalid doses, and not routinely identifying inactive patient records. Missed Opportunities Missed opportunities occur when a patient received some immunizations on their last visit, but one or more recommended shots were not given, for unknown reasons. For instance, MMR was given but not varicella, and there is no evidence of chickenpox disease documented on the im munization record. Since this vaccine was not given at subsequent visits, this counts as a missed opportunity. Quality improvement strategies to reduce missed opportunities include: Using a one page immunization summary form that prompts the provider to identify all missing immunizations ; Giving all shots needed at one visit; Updating the immunization record (to a newer version) to have room for all vaccines on the CDC's recommended schedule; Implementing use of the state's immunization registry - \"I-CARE\" (see the I-CARE flyer at the end of this section for more information). Using Reminder/Recall Techniques: Sending cards or making phone calls to parents to remind them of upcoming visits or of missed appointments. Invalid doses Invalid doses occur when a patient received vaccin es at a clinic visit but one (or more) was given before the minimum age or interval that the CDC has determined to be in effective. For instance, the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine must be given at a minimum of six months of age. If it is given more than four days before the patient's six -month birthday, it is considered an invalid dose. Invalid doses lower the coverage rate, and may contribute to the missed opportunity category (if these doses could have been repeated at a subse quent immunization visit). When vaccines are given elsewhere, providers may not notice if one or more invalid doses were administered . However, because the chart assessment includes all vaccines given, this will lower the provider's coverage rate, even though the invalid shots were not given at his/her clinic . Quality improvement strategies to reduce invalid doses include: Referring to the current immunization schedule for clarification of the minimum ages and intervals; Giving shots at the proper inter vals and ages; Obtaining the previous immunization history from parent or provider ; Transcribing past immunization record's dates to the currently used record; Repeating doses that were given too early at other clinics. Inactive patients This means that p atients who have not visited the provider's clinic in over a year were included in the assessment . A patient is considered active unless denoted as \"inactive.\" Evidence of the patient having moved away, or transferred to another clinic, is needed to exclude these patients from the analysis . Attempts should be made to recall the patients before changing their status to inactive. Quality improvement strategies to identify inactive patients : Placing stickers on the edge of chart to indicate year of patients ' last visit so that inactive patients are not included in the assessments; Labeling patients' charts as \"Inactive\" if no visits occurred in the past year, or if correspondence is returned due to \"addressee unknown\" or \"moved.\" These activities have been s hown to be effective for raising coverage rates and improving record- keeping. The quality improvement staff can explain and assist in implementing these strategies. Tips to Prepare for Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Improvement (QI) Visits 1. The pri mary vaccine coordinator in the clinic should be available for at least two hours to answer q uestions on the survey and discuss the findings. (Both QA and QI) 2. Before the review, provide a list of 100 children 0- 18 years of age who have been immunized at least once during the past year. The VFC provider list must include both VFC and non-VFC eligible children (if applicable). (Both QA and QI) 3. Before the review, l ocate the circuit breaker (s) for the vaccine storage unit(s) for inspection. (QA only) 4. Provide a space to work. (Both QA and QI) 5. Before the review, assemble all of the most recent vaccine management plans for review. (QA only) 6. The PHA I from the VFC Program Quality Assurance Section will need to review past temperature logs and inspect all vaccine s torage units (refrigerators and freezers). Before the review, assemble at least 3 months of temperature logs. If problems are observed, more temperature logs will be required for the review. (QA only) 7. Admitting or billing personnel may be needed to clarify screening and billing processes. (QA only ) 8. Current and past vaccine borrowing reports . (QA only) 9. If using electronic medical records (EMR), a provider staff person must be available to help the VFC staff navigate the EMR. (Both QA and QI) 10. Assure that the medical director (or equivalent) is present to hear the results and sign the Acknowledgement of Receipt. (Both QA and QI) VFC and AFIX site visits are required components of the VFC Program. In general, providers will be notified before a site visit , and a time and date will be agreed upon that is convenient for the provider. However, please note that the VFC Program reserves the right to conduct unscheduled visits in response to incidents of vaccine loss, improper ordering procedures, and problems wit h temperature(s) in the appliance where VFC vaccine is stored or to conduct a vaccine inventory. For more information regarding the quality assurance and quality improvement acti vities outlined in this section, please contact Marcia Levin, VFC Program M anager at 312. 746.6050. Section 5 Appendix Sample AFIX Summary Assessment Report HIPAA and Public Health Fact Sheet HIPAA and Public Health Visits - Access to Patient Records during AFIX and VFC Visits I-CARE Fact Sheet (Registry System CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Vaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules Vaccine Administration1 ppropriate vaccine administration is critical to vaccine effectiveness. The recommended site, route and dosage for each vaccine are based on clinical trials, practical ex perience and theoretical considerations. The following information provides general guidelines for administration of vaccines for those who administer vaccines, as well as those in training, education and supervisory positions. This information should be used in conjunction with professional standards for medication administration, vaccine manufacturers' product guidelines, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) General Recommendations on Immunization, the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases Red Book , and state/agency -related policies and procedures. Preparation Patient Preparation - Patients should be prepared for vaccination with consideration for their age and stage of development. Parents/guardians and patients should be encouraged to take an active role before, during and after the administration of vaccines. Screening - All patients should be screened for contraindications and precautions for each scheduled 1 Source: Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine- Preventable Diseases ( Pink Book ), February 2008, Appendix D Section 6 A Vaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules Section 6 - Page 1 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK vaccine. See sample screeni ng forms and list of Valid Contraindications at the end of this section. Vaccine Safety & Risk Communication - Parents/guardians and patients are exposed through the media to information about vaccines, some of which is inaccurate or misleading. Healthcare providers should be prepared to discuss the benefits and risks of vaccines using Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) and other reliable resources. Establishing an open dialogue provides a safe, trust -building environment in which individuals can freely evaluate information, discuss vaccine concerns and make informed decisions regarding immunization. Atraumatic Care - Vaccine safety issues and the need for multiple injections have increased the concerns and anxiety associated with immunizations. Heal thcare providers need to display confidence and establish an environment that promotes a sense of security and trust for the patient and family, utilizing a variety of techniques to minimize the stress and discomfort associated with receiving injections. Positioning & Comforting Restraint - The healthcare provider must accommodate for the patient's comfort, safety, age, activity level, and the site of administration when considering patient positioning and restraint. For a child, the parent/guardian should be encouraged to hold the child during administration. If the parent is uncomfortable, another person may assist . For more information, refer to Comforting Restraints for Immunizations at the end of this section . Pain Control - Pain is a subjective phenomenon influenced by multiple factors, including an individual's age, anxiety level, previous healthcare experiences, and culture. Consideration for these factors is important as the provider develops a planned approach to management of injection pain. Infection Control - Healthcare providers should follow Standard Precautions to minimize the risks of spreading disease during vaccine administration. All administered vaccines should be fully documented in the patient's record as previously described under \"Documenting Vaccines\" . Vaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules Section 6 - Page 2 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK 1. Hand washing - The single, most effective disease prevention activity is good hand washing . Hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and water or cleansed with an alcohol -based waterless antiseptic between patients, before vaccine preparation or any time hands become soiled. 2. Gloves - Gloves are not required to be worn when administering vaccines unless the person administering the vaccine is likely to come into contact with potentially infectious body fluids or has open lesions on the hands. It is important to remember that gloves cannot prevent needle stick injuries. 3. Needle stick injuries - should be reported immediately to the site supervisor, with appropriate care and follow -up given as directed by state/local guidelines. Safety needle devices should be used, if available to reduce the risk of injury. 4. Equipment Disposal - Used needles should not be detached from syringes, recapped or cut before disposal. All used syringe/needle devices should be placed in puncture proof containers to prevent accidental needle sticks and reuse. Empty or expired vaccine vials are considered medical waste and should be dis posed of according to state regulations. Equipment Selection 1. Syringe Selection - A separate needle and syringe should be used for each injection. Syringe devices with safety needles are available, recommended by OSHA to reduce the incidence of needle stick injuries and potential disease transmission. Personnel should be involved in evaluation and selection of these products. Staff should receive training with these devices before using them in the clinical area. 2. Needle Selection - Vaccine must reach the desired tissue site for optimal immune response. Therefore, needle selection should be based upon the prescribed route, size of the individual, volume and viscosity of the vaccine, and injection technique. For more information refer to Administering Vaccines: Dose, Route, Site, and Needle Size included at the end of this section. Vaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules Section 6 - Page 3 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK 3. Inspecting Vaccine - Each vaccine vial should be carefully inspected for damage or contamination prior to use. The expiration date printed on the vial or box should be checked. Vaccine can be used through the last day of the month indicated by the expiration date unless otherwise stated on the package labeling. Expired vaccine should never be used. 4. Reconstitution - Some vaccines are prepared in a form that requires reconstitution , which should be done according to manufacturer guidelines. Diluent solutions vary; use only the specific diluent supplied for the vaccine. Once reconstituted, the vaccine must be either administered within the time guidelines provided by the manufacturer or discarded. Changing the needle after reconstitution of the vaccine is not necessary unless the needle has become contaminated or bent. Continue with standard medication preparation guidelines. 5. Pre-filling Syringes - CDC strongly discourages filling syringes in advance, because of the increased risk of administration errors. Once the vaccine is in the syringe it is difficult to identify the type or brand of vaccine. Other problems associated with this practice are vaccine wastage, and possible bacterial growth in vaccines that do not contain a preservative. Furthermore, medication administration guidelines state that the individual who administers a medication should be the one to draw up and prepare it. An alternative to pre- filling syringes is to use filled syringes supplied by the vaccine manufacturer. Syringes other than those filled by the manufacturer are designed for immediate administration, not for vaccine storage. In certain circumstances, such as a large influenza clinic, more than one syringe can be filled. One person should pre- fill only a few syringes at a time, and the same person should administer them. Any syringes left at the end of the clinic day should be discarded. Under no circum stances should MMR, varicella, or zoster vaccines ever be reconstituted and drawn prior to the immediate need for them. These live virus vaccines are unstable and begin to deteriorate as soon as they are reconstituted with diluent. 6. Labeling - Once a vaccine is drawn into a syringe, the content should be indi cated on the syringe. There are a variety of methods for identifying or labeling syringes (e.g. Vaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules Section 6 - Page 4 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK keep syringes with the appropriate vaccine vials, place the syringes in a labeled partitioned tray, or use color coded or preprinted labels). Appendix D Admini stration Route Administering a vaccine by the recommended route is imperative. Deviation from the recommended route of administration might reduce vaccine efficacy or increase the risk of local reactions . For detailed illustrations refer to Administering Vaccines: Dose, Route, Site, and Needle Size; How to Administer Intramuscular/Subcutaneous Injections ; and Comforting Restraint included at the end of this section. 1. Subcutaneous (Sub -Q or SC) injections are administered at a 45\u00b0 angle into the fatty tissu e found below the dermis and above muscle tissue. Subcutaneous tissue can be found all over the body. The usual sites for vaccine administration are the thigh (for infants <12 months of age) and the upper outer triceps of the arm (for persons >12 months of age). If necessary, the upper outer triceps area can be used to administer subcutaneous injections to infants. Needle Gauge & Length - 5/8-inch, 23- to 25 -gauge needle Technique - Follow standard medication administration guidelines for site assessment/ selection and site preparation. To avoid reaching the muscle, pinch up the fatty tissue, insert the needle at a 45\u00b0 angle and inject the vaccine into the tissue. Withdraw the needle and apply light pressure to the injection site for several seconds with a dry cotton ball or gauze. 2. Intramuscular (IM) injections are administered at a 90\u00b0 Angle into muscle tissue below the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Although there are several IM injection sites on the body, the recommended IM sites for vaccine administra tion are the vastus lateralis muscle (anterolateral thigh) and the deltoid muscle (upper arm). The site depends on the age of the individual and the degree of muscle development. Needle Gauge - 1-inch 22- to 25 -gauge needle Needle Length - For all intram uscular injections, the needle should be long enough to reach the muscle mass and prevent vaccine from seeping into subcutaneous tissue, but not so long as to involve underlying nerves, blood vessels, or bone. The vaccinator should be familiar with the ana tomy of the Vaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules Section 6 - Page 5 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK area into which the vaccine will be injected. Decision on needle size and site of injection must be made for each person on the basis of the size of the muscle, the thickness of adipose tissue at the injection site, the volume of the material to be administered, injection technique, and the depth below the muscle surface into which the material is to be injected Technique - For the majority of infants (younger than 12 months), the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is the recommended site for i njection because it provides a large muscle mass. The muscles of the buttock have not been used for administration of vaccines in infants and children because of concern about potential injury to the sciatic nerve, which is well documented after injection of antimicrobial agents into the buttock. Injection technique is the most important factor to ensure efficient intramuscular vaccine delivery. 3. Aspiration - Aspiration is the process of pulling back on the plunger of the syringe prior to injection to ensure that the medication is not injected into a blood vessel. Although this practice is advocated by some experts, the procedure is not required because no large blood vessels exist at the recommended injection sites. 4. Multiple Vaccinations - When administe ring multiple vaccines, NEVER mix vaccines in the same syringe unless approved for mixing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If more than one vaccine must be administered in the same limb, the injection sites should be separated by 1- 2 inches so that any local reactions can be differentiated. Vacci ne doses range from 0.2 mL to 1 mL. The recommended maximum volume of medication for an IM site, varies among references and depends on the muscle mass of the individual. However, administering two IM vacc ines into the same muscle would not exceed any suggested volume ranges for either the vastus lateralis or the deltoid muscle in any age group. The option to also administer a subcutaneous vaccine into the same limb, if necessary, is acceptable since a diff erent tissue site is involved. If a vaccine and an immune globulin preparation are administered simultaneously (e.g., Td/Tdap and tetanus immune globulin [TIG] or hepatitis B vaccine and For newborn (first 28 days of life) and premature infants, a 5/8 inch need le usually is adequate if the skin is stretched flat between thumb and forefinger and the needle inserted at a 90- degree angle to the skin. Vaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules Section 6 - Page 6 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK hepatitis B immune globulin [HBIG]), a separate anatomic site should be used for each injection. The location of each injection should be documented in the patient's medical record. 5. Nonstandard Administration - Deviation from the recommended route, site and dosage of vaccine is strongly discouraged and can result in inadequate protection. In situations where nonstandard administration has occurred, refer to the ACIP General Recommendation on Immunization, MMWR 2006; 55 (RR -15 p.18), for specific guidance. Special Situations 1. Bleeding Disorders - Individuals with a bleeding disorder or who are receiving anticoagulant therapy may develop hematomas in IM injection sites. Prior to administration of IM vaccines the patient or family should be instructed about the risk of hematoma formation from the injection. Additionally, a physician familiar with the patient's bleeding disorder or therapy should be consulted regarding the safety of administration by this route. If the patient periodically receives hemophilia replacement factor or other similar therapy, IM vaccine administration should ideally be scheduled shortly after replacement therapy. A 23- gauge or finer needle should be used and firm pressure applied to the site for at least 2 minutes. The site should not be rubbed or massaged. 2. Latex Allergy - Administration of a vaccine supplied in a vial or syringe that contains natural rubber (refer to product information) should not be administered to an individual with a history of a severe (anaphylactic) allergy to latex, unless the benefit of vaccination clearly outweighs the risk of an allergic reaction. These situations are rare. Medical consultation and direction should be sought regarding vaccination. A local or contact sensitivity to latex is not a contraindication to vaccination. 3. Syncopal or Vasovagal Response (\"fainting\") m ay occur during vaccine administration, especially with adolescents and adults. Because individuals may fall and sustain injury as a result, the provider should have the patient sit during injection(s) as well as monitor the patient for 15 minutes after they are vaccinated. A syncopal or vasovagal response is not common and is not an allergic reaction. However, if syncope Vaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules Section 6 - Page 7 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK develops, the provider should observe and administer supportive care until the patient is recovered. 4. Anaphylaxis (a life -threatening ac ute allergic reaction) - Each facility that administers vaccines should have a protocol, procedures and equipment to provide initial care for suspected anaphylaxis. Facility staff should be prepared to recognize and respond appropriately to this type of emergency situation. All staff should maintain current CPR certification. Emergency protocols, procedures and equipment/supplies should be reviewed periodically. For additional information on medical management of vaccine reactions in children, teens, and adults, see the 2006 ACIP General Recommen dations on Immunization (p. 19), the 2006 AAP Red Book (pp. 64- 66), and Appendix D18- D21 of the 2008 Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine Preventable Diseases (Pink Book ). Immunization Schedule The Advisory Commit tee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) annually publishes immunization schedules that summarize recommendations for currently licensed vaccines for children aged 18 years and younger. The current schedule is included in this section. Parents often have questions about the immunization schedule and vaccine ingredients. The American Academy of Pediatrics developed two fact sheets that are intended to help providers answer some of the most frequently asked questions. These fact sheets are included at the end of this section. See Section 9 for more information for parents and patients.

The following section provides information about reporting of infectious diseases to the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH ) and adverse events following administration of vaccines to CDPH and the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Healthcare Provider Responsibility to Report It is the responsibility of physicians, physician assistants, nurses, medical assistants or any other person having knowledge of any of the reportable diseases, confirmed or suspected, to report the case to the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) within the specified time frame. A list of reportable infectious diseases and conditions in Illinois is provided at the end of this section . To report a case of vaccine preventable disease call: CDPH Vaccine Preventable Disease Surveillance 312.746.5911 On weekends, holidays, after hours, or if no one is available to take your call, reports may be made by calling 311 and asking for the communicable disease physician on call. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System What is VAERS? The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national program that monitors the safety of v accines after they are licensed. VAERS is managed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Vaccines prevent serious illnesses Section 7 C Public Health Reporting Section 7 - Page 1 (Rev. 01/2012) CHICAGO DE PARTMENT OF PUBLIC H EALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK and even death in persons who receive them. Before a vaccine is licensed, FDA takes steps to make sure the vaccine is safe. FDA requires that a vaccine goes through extensive safety testing. After a vaccine is licensed, VAERS is one of the mechanisms used to monitor for any problems, or \"adverse events,\" that happen after vaccination. Not all events reported to VAERS are caused by the vaccine. Even though careful studies are done before a vaccine is licensed, rare adverse effects may not be found until a vaccine is given to millions of people with different backgrounds and medical histories. By continued monitoring, VAERS helps to make sure that the benefits of vaccines are far greater than the risks. Anyone who receives a vaccine should be informed about both the benefits and risks of vaccination. Any questions or concerns should be discussed with a healthcare provider. Who Can Report to VAERS? FDA and CDC encourage anybody who experiences any problems after vaccination to report to VAERS. This includes parents, patients, and healthcare providers. Healthcare pr oviders are required by law to report certain problems. To get a list of these, please call 1- 800-822-7967 or go to: www.vaers.hhs.gov/reportable.htm . Why Report to VAERS? Reporting gives valuable information that helps CDC and FDA make sure that vaccines are safe . Reporting strengthens VAERS so it can be used to assess public health response to vaccines . Reporting allows for evaluating public health prevention and control measures . Remember, no vaccine (or any medicine) is completely free of risk and adverse events are possible. If a patient has an adverse event after a vaccine, please report to VAERS. Each report is important! VAERS does not provide medical advice .

To prevent perinatal transmission, the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that infants b orn to hepatitis B -infected women be administered HBIG and the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series within 12 hours of birth and complete the hepatitis B vaccine series on time. The Chicago Perinatal Hepatitis B Program works with health care providers, mothers and their babies to assure the proper health care is provided to at -risk families. When a baby is born in the city of Chicago to a hepatitis B infected mother, the Perinatal Hepatitis B staff work diligently to coordinate care and delivery of necessary immunizations. The Illinois State Law has set out specific mandates for identifying, testing, documenting, reporting, and managing perinatal hepatitis B cases. Since 2006 there have been no changes to perinatal hepatitis B prevention protocols . Please contact the P erinatal Hepatitis B C oordinator if you have any questions or concerns about Perinatal H epatitis B prevention. Illinois State Law Title 77 ILL. Adm. Code 690.451: Illinois Department of Public H ealth, Control of Comm unicable Diseases: Pregnant women shall be tested for HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) during an early prenatal visit, or when they present to a hospital for delivery if prenatal serologic results are not available. Pregnant women who are at high risk for hepatitis B in fection (recent history of sexually transmitted disease, injection drug use, or other possible risks of hepatitis B infection) should be retested upon admission. Healthcare providers shall refer pregnant women who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg -positive ) within 7days after receipt of the test results to a local health authority for counseling and recommendations on testing and immunizing contacts. Section 8 Preventing Hepatitis B in Newborns: What Providers Need to Know Perinatal Hepatitis B Section 8 - Page 1 (Rev. 01/2014) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Contacts to cases or carriers of hepatitis B should be tested for \"susceptibility \" to hepatiti s B virus.

A copy of the original HBsAg -positive laboratory report should be provided to the health care provider and/or hospital where delivery is planned. HBsAg -positive pregnant women should receive information concerning hepatitis B discussing: - Modes of transmission . - Perinatal concerns (e.g., transmission, treatment, breastfeeding ). - Prevention of hepatitis B transmission to contacts of HBsAg -positive women, including the importance of post - exposure prophylaxis for newborn infant, household, sexual, and needle- sharing contacts . - Substance abuse treatment, if appropriate; an d - Medical evaluation and possible treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Identifying and Managing Infants Born to Mothers HBsAg Unknown Women admitted for delivery without documentation of HBsAg test results should have blood drawn and tested as soon as possible after admission. While test results are pending, all infants born to women without documentation of HBsAg status should receive the 1 st dose of hepatitis B vaccine (without HBIG) <12 hours of birth. Perinatal Hepatitis B Section 8 - Page 3 (Rev. 01/2014) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK If the mother is determined to be H BsAg-positive , her infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible but no later than age 7 days, and the vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers. If the mother is determined to be HBsAg -negative, the vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg -negative mothers. If the mother has never been tested to determine her HBsAg status, the vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended sche dule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. However, the administration of HBIG is not necessary for these infants. Pediatric Provider Protocols for Hepatitis B infected Mothers and Their Infants, Children and Adolescents Managing Infants and Child ren Born to Hepatitis B Infected Mothers* All infants born to HBsAg -positive women should receive single- antigen hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin HBIG (0.5ml ) within 12 hours of birth, administered at different injection sites. Hepatitis B vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers. The final dose in the vaccination series should not be administered before 24 weeks (164 days). Note: Infants >6 weeks of age born to HBsAg -positive mothers, may receive Hepatitis B vaccine containing other antigens (combination vaccines ) to complete the vaccine series after the receipt of a birth dose of single -antigen hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG . Perinatal Hepatitis B Section 8 - Page 4 (Rev. 01/2014) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK For Preterm infants weighing <2,000 gram s, the initial vaccine dose (birth dose) should not be counted as part of the vaccine series because potentially reduced immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine in the infant; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered begi nning when the infant reaches age 1 month. Post -vaccination testing for anti -HBs and HBsAg should be performed after completion of the vaccine series, at age 9- 18 months (generally at the next well -child visit). Serologic testing should NOT be performed be fore age 9 months to avoid detection of anti -HBs from HBIG administered during infancy and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection. Anti-HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal an ti-HBc might be detected in infants born to HBV infected mothers at age 24 months. HBsAg -negative infants with anti -HBs levels >10mlU/ml are protected and need no further medical management . HBsAg -negative infants with anti -HBs levels <10mlU/ml should be re-vaccinated with a second 3- dose series and retested 1- 2 months after the final dose of vaccine . Infants who continue to be HBsAg -positive should receive appropriate medical follow -up for liver management . Hepatitis B infected Mothers and Their Contacts Managing Contacts of Hepatitis B Infected Mothers * Contacts to cases or carriers of hepatitis B should be tested for \"susceptibility\" to hepatitis B virus .

In the event of a temperature e xcursion call the VFC Vaccine Management Unit (312 -746-5385 ) Manage vaccine inventories. Inventory your vaccine supplies at least monthly and before placing an order. Expired vaccine must never be used and is money wasted! Always use the vaccine with the soonest expiration date first. Move vaccine with the soonest expiration date to the front of the storage unit and mark it to be used first. Keep vaccine vials in their original boxes. Store vaccine appropriately. Place vaccines in refrigerator or freezer immediately upon receiving shipment. Keep vaccine vials in their original pack - aging. Place vaccine in clearly labeled wire baskets or other open containers with a 2-3\" separation between baskets and from wall of unit. Separate vaccines that have been supplied from your state's Vaccines for Children program from vac - cines that are privately purchased. Do not store vaccines in the door or on the floor of the unit.Stabilize temperatures. Store ice packs in the freezer and large jugs of water in the refrigerator along with the vaccines. This will help maintain a stable, cold temperature in case of a power failure or if the re - frigerator or freezer doors are opened frequently or left open. Frequent opening of either the refrigerator or freezer door can lead to temperature variations inside, which could affect vaccine efficacy. For this reason you should not store food or beverages in the refrigerator or freezer. Safeguard the electrical supply to the refrigerator. Make sure the refrigerator and freezer are plugged into outlets in a protected area where they cannot be disconnected ac - cidentally. Label the refrigerator, freezer, electrical outlets, fuses, and circuit breakers on the power circuit with informa - tion that clearly identifies the perishable nature of vaccines and the immediate steps to be taken in case of interruption of power. If your building has auxiliary power, use the outlet supplied by that system.Vaccine Handling Tips Outdated or improperly stored vaccines won't protect patients! *MMR may be stored in either the freezer or the refrigerator. Refer to package insert for specific instructions on the storage of each vaccine. If you have questions about the condition of the vaccine upon arrival, you should immediately place the vaccine in recommended storage, mark it \"do not use,\" and then call your state health department or the vaccine manufacturer(s) to determine whether the potency of the vaccine(s) has been affected. For other questions, call the immunization program at your state or local health department.

August 11, 2003) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Public Health Fact Sheet What is HIPAA? The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104 -191) established a national floor of consumer privacy protection and marketpl ace reform. Some key provisions include: insurance reforms, privacy and security, administrative simplification, and cost savings. What is the HIPAA Privacy Rule? HIPAA required Congress to enact privacy legislation by August 1999 or the Secretary of DHH S was to develop regulations protecting privacy. The HIPAA Privacy Rule (Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information) sets national minimal standards for protected health information. Implications for Public Health The Privacy R ule strikes a balance between protecting patient information and allowing traditional public health activities to continue. Disclosure of patient health information without the authorization of the individual is permitted for purposes including but not lim ited to: disclosures required by law (45 CFR \u00a7 164.512(a)) or for \"public health activities and purposes.\" This includes disclosure to \"a public health authority that is authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability, including but not limited to, the reporting of disease, injury, vital events..., and the conduct of public health surveillance,... investigations, and... interventions.\" (45 CFR \u00a7 164.512(b)(i)) Definition o f Public Health Authority Defined as \"an agency or authority of the United States, a State, a territory, a political subdivision of a State or territory, or an Indian tribe, or a person or entity acting under a grant of authority from or contract with suc h public agency, including the employees or agents of such public agency or its contractors or persons or entities to whom it has granted authority, that is responsible for public health matters as part of its official mandates.\" (45 CFR \u00a7 164.501) For mo re information regarding HIPAA and vaccines, visit the CDC website at: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac -gen/policies/hipaa/default.htm Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Infectious and Respiratory Diseases Immunization Services Division Rev. August 11, 20 03 1 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Public Health Visits Access to Patient Records during AFIX and VFC Visits Responses to Frequently Asked Questions about AFIX and VFC This guidance is intended to give health care providers and publi c health agencies specific information regarding the HIPAA Privacy Rule and access to patient records during Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, Exchange (AFIX) and Vaccines for Children (VFC) site visits. Several frequently asked questions posed to the CDC legal counsel for interpretation are presented below. Additional sources of information and reference materials available on the internet are also included. Can patient records be reviewed by health department staff, or their contractual agents such as th e American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) or the Visiting Nurses Association (VNA), for the purpose of conducting AFIX provider site visits? Yes. Under 45 CFR \u00a7 164.512(b) of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, covered entities may disclose protected health information without authorization to public health authorities that are authorized by law to collect such information for public health purposes. AFIX, authorized under section 317 of the Public Health Service Act, is a public health strategy to raise immunization co verage levels and improve standards of practices at the provider level. AFIX providers, as covered entities, may share patient records with health department staff or their contractors because a health department is a public health authority authorized by law to review patient records for AFIX purposes, or because health department contractors are acting under a grant of authority from a public health authority. In addition, state health departments may have authority under applicable state law to collect t his information. Can patient records be reviewed by health officials or their agents for the purpose of conducting VFC provider site visits? Yes. As explained in the answer to question 1 above, under 45 CFR \u00a7 164.512(b) of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, covere d entities may disclose protected health information without authorization to public health authorities that are authorized by law to collect such information for public health purposes. VFC is a public health program that provides vaccines for children in certain eligibility groups. The VFC program was authorized under Section 1928 of the Social Security Act and has been delegated to CDC to administer. VFC providers, as covered entities, may share patient records with health officials or their agents becau se a health department is a public health authority authorized by law to review patient records for VFC purposes, or because contractors are acting under a grant of authority from a public health authority. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Infectious and Respiratory Diseases Immunization Services Division Rev. August 11, 20 03 2 Responses to Frequently Asked Questions about AFIX and VFC Are VFC providers required to allow health officials access to the immunization records of children in their practice to determine compliance with VFC requirements? The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits providers to share immunization records with public health officials for public health purposes as otherwise authorized by law. Under the VFC statute, at 42 U.S.C. 1396s(c)(2), as a condition of participation in the VFC program providers must share immunization records with health officials to verif y compliance with VFC program requirements, including: 1. screening of all children in their practice to determine VFC eligibility; 2. to determine provider compliance with the VFC immunization schedule regarding the appropriate periodicity, dosage and contrai ndications applicable to the vaccines; 3. to determine provider compliance with applicable State law, including any such law relating to any religious or other exemption; 4. to verify that VFC vaccine -eligible children are not being charged for the cost of the vaccine; 5. to verify that any administration fees being charged do not exceed the caps established by CMS; 6. to verify that the provider does not deny administration of vaccine to vaccine -eligible children due to the inability of the child's parent to pay a n administration fee. Can health care providers, daycare operators, Head Start and school officials share immunization information with another provider or school to update missing immunization history or bring children into compliance with daycare, Head Start and school requirements? Health care providers (or other covered entities) may share immunization information with other health care providers as needed to make treatment decisions, such as to give further immunizations. Providers may also disclos e immunization information to schools, without authorization, if permitted or required by State law. These State laws would not be preempted by the Privacy Rule. (45 CFR 160.203(c)). In the absence of such a State law, it appears that such disclosures to s chools will require individual authorization. Immunization records held by day care centers and schools are not protected health information under the Privacy Rule. Disclosures of immunization information by schools is covered by the Family Educational Rig hts and Privacy Act (FERPA). (45 CFR 164.501). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Infectious and Respiratory Diseases Immunization Services Division Rev. August 11, 20 03 3 Responses to Frequently Asked Questions about AFIX and VFC Can patient identifiers, including name and birthdate, be collected and stored electronically, incidental to AFIX or VFC visits? Yes. Under 45 C FR \u00a7 164.512(b) of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, covered entities may disclose protected health information --including name, birthdate, and other individually identifiable health information --to public health authorities that are authorized by law to collect suc h information for public health purposes. However, other requirements of the Privacy Rule (including minimum necessary, verification of identity, and accounting requirements) may apply to covered entities making these disclosures. For a full explanation of these requirements, see the website of the Office for Civil Rights (www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa) (responsible for enforcing the Privacy Rule), or CDC/DHHS guidance on the Privacy Rule and Public Health, in the MMWR, HIPAA Privacy Rule and Public Health (printab le version is available at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/other/m2e411.pdf ). Once protected health information has been disclosed to a public health authority for a public health activity pursuant to section 164.512(b) of the Privacy Rule, the information may be s tored in whatever way is reasonable for conducting the public health activity, including electronically, so long as the storage is consistent with other applicable State and Federal law. Links to additional sources of information may be found on the CDC website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/ or by returning to the HIPAA Policies page. (Source: http://www.idph.state.il.us/health/vaccine/icarefs.html ) What is I -CARE? I-CARE, or Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange is an immunization record -sharing computer program developed by the Illinois Department of Public Health. The program allows public and private health care providers to share the immunization records of Illinois residents. Currently, the program contains more than 37 million immunization records. Besides keeping track of the immunizations a child has already received, I -CARE forecasts immunization due dates based on the nationally recognized \"Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule.\" These recommendations are approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Pedi atrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians. What is the purpose of I -CARE? I-CARE is designed to help health care providers record, track and report their patients' immunizations. Participation is voluntary. The registry allows physicians to acce ss patient records for information about immunizations administered outside their practices. What is the goal of I -CARE? The primary goal of I -CARE is to increase the immunization coverage level of Illinois' 2 -year-olds to 90 percent. In 2008, approximatel y 77 percent of Illinois' 2 -year-olds were properly immunized, according to a National Immunization Survey. While this goal focuses on 2 -year-olds, keep in mind that patients of all ages can be included in the I -CARE program. How does I -CARE work? I-CARE u sers can exchange data with the statewide registry in one of two ways: Electronic Data Interchange (coming soon) I-CARE Web -based computer program Electronic Data Interchange allows the sharing of electronic data in a structured HL7 (Health Level 7 stand ard) compatible format between computer programs. It allows health care facilities with their own HL7 compatible immunization tracking programs to share information with I -CARE. The I -CARE computer program is robust, allowing health care providers to colle ct, store, analyze and report immunization data at individual sites. Here are the main features of the computer program: Calculation of immunization due dates Print option for school physical form and patient immunization history report Remind/Recall fea ture to track and notify patients of due dates Vaccine inventory feature to track usage by lot number Record of patient contraindications, adverse reactions or immunities Assessment of immunization coverage levels for a practice Appointment feature to log and notify patients due for shots Refrigerator/Freezer Temperature Log feature to track and report vaccine storage appliances Report creation feature for several required forms and reports Vaccine Information Statement module to update and print VIS forms and report What about security and patient confidentiality? I-CARE is designed to protect patient confidentiality while providing access to statewide registry information. Confidentiality is maintained through several security controls. Open access to the statewide registry is not allowed. Only registered I -CARE users have access to the data and information is available only on a need -to-know basis. In other words, an I -CARE user cannot browse through patient records. Specific name or ID search crit eria must be used to access information in the statewide registry. An audit log at the statewide registry tracks all updates to patient records and which I -CARE user made each update. In addition, a site can only produce reports for patients seen at its cl inic site. What kind of equipment is needed to operate I -CARE? A high -speed Internet connection is needed to access the I -CARE Web site and Adobe Reader is used to open and print reports and forms. What if a patient does not want to participate in I -CARE? As of July 1, 2011, I -CARE switched from an opt -in to an opt -out registry . This change to the registry now requires health care providers using I -CARE to provide a new patient or the patient's parent/guardian with a printed immunization data exemption for m only once, prior to entering immunization records into I -CARE. The new \"opt -out\" registry will improve immunization data reporting by allowing physicians and health departments to enter all patient immunization data into the registry unless the patient o r parent chooses to opt -out. A fact sheet is available to provide parents/patients with information about the benefits of including their immunization records on the statewide database. This form should supplement the \"opt-out\" form when a provider is addi ng a new patient. This will provide the parent/patient with the necessary information about I -CARE and hopefully prevent them from reflectively signing the \"opt -out\" form without reading it first. Keep in mind that any patient, of any age, can be included in your local I -CARE clinic, thereby allowing you to use the program's tracking and reporting capabilities for all of your patients.

These recommendations must be read with the footnotes that follow. For those who fall behind or start late, provide catch-up vaccination at the earliest opportunity as indicated by the green bars in Figure 1. To determine minimum intervals between doses, see the catch-up schedule (Figure 2). School entry and adolescent vaccine age groups are in bold. Not routinely recommendedRange of recommended ages for certain high-risk groups Range of recommended ages for all children Range of recommended ages for catch-up immunization NOTE: The above recommendations must be read along with the footnotes of this schedule. This schedule includes recommendations in effect as of January 1, 2014. Any dose not administered at the recommended age should be administered at a subsequent visit, when indicated and feasible. The use of a combination vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines. Vaccination providers should consult the relevant Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) statement for detailed recommendations, available online at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html . Clinically significant adverse events that follow vaccination should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) online (http://www.vaers.hhs.gov) or by telephone (800-822-7967).Suspected cases of vaccine-preventable diseases should be reported to the state or local health department. Additional information, including precautions and contraindications for vaccination, is available from CDC online (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/vac-admin/contraindications.htm) or by telephone (800-CDC-INFO [800-232-4636]). This schedule is approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (http//www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip ), the American Academy of Pediatrics (http://www.aap.org), the American Academy of Family Physicians (http://www.aafp.org), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (http://www.acog.org).Range of recommended ages during which catch-up is encouraged and for certain high-risk groupsVaccine Birth 1 mo 2 mos 4 mos 6 mos 9 mos 12 mos 15 mos 18 mos19-23 mos2-3 yrs 4-6 yrs MenACWY-D >9 mos; MenACWY-CRM mos) Booster 1st dose See footnote 13(3-dose series) 2-dose series, See footnote 112nd dose 1st dose2nd dose 1st doseAnnual vaccination (IIV or LAIV) Annual vaccination (IIV only)(Tdap)See footnote 22nd dose 1st dose 4th dose 3rd dose 2nd dose 1st dose4th dose 3rd dose 2nd dose 1st dose3rd or 4th dose, See footnote 5See footnote 52nd dose 1st dose5th dose 4th dose 3rd dose 2nd dose 1st dose3rd dose 2nd dose 1st dose1. Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine. (Minimum age: birth) Routine vaccination: At birth: Administer monovalent HepB vaccine to all newborns before hospital discharge. For infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers, administer HepB vaccine and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. These infants should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) 1 to 2 months after completion of the HepB series, at age 9 through 18 months (preferably at the next well-child visit). If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, within 12 hours of birth administer HepB vaccine regardless of birth weight. For infants weighing less than 2,000 grams, administer HBIG in addition to HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Determine mother's HBsAg status as soon as possible and, if mother is HBsAg-positive, also administer HBIG for infants weighing 2,000 grams or more as soon as possible, but no later than age 7 days. Doses following the birth dose: The second dose should be administered at age 1 or 2 months. Monovalent HepB vaccine should be used for doses administered before age 6 weeks. Infants who did not receive a birth dose should receive 3 doses of a HepB-containing vaccine on a schedule of 0, 1 to 2 months, and 6 months starting as soon as feasible. See Figure 2. Administer the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose (minimum interval of 4 weeks), administer the third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose AND at least 16 weeks after the first dose. The final (third or fourth) dose in the HepB vaccine series should be administered no earlier than age 24 weeks . Administration of a total of 4 doses of HepB vaccine is permitted when a combination vaccine containing HepB is administered after the birth dose. Catch-up vaccination: Unvaccinated persons should complete a 3-dose series. A 2-dose series (doses separated by at least 4 months) of adult formulation Recombivax HB is licensed for use in children aged 11 through 15 years. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 2. Rotavirus (RV) vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for both RV1 [Rotarix] and RV5 [RotaTeq])Routine vaccination:Administer a series of RV vaccine to all infants as follows: 1. If Rotarix is used, administer a 2-dose series at 2 and 4 months of age. 2. If RotaTeq is used, administer a 3-dose series at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. 3. If any dose in the series was RotaTeq or vaccine product is unknown for any dose in the series, a total of 3 doses of RV vaccine should be administered. Catch-up vaccination: The maximum age for the first dose in the series is 14 weeks, 6 days; vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged 15 weeks, 0 days or older. The maximum age for the final dose in the series is 8 months, 0 days. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2.3. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. vaccination: Administer a 5-dose series of DTaP vaccine at ages 2, 4, 6, 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years. The fourth dose may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since the third dose. Catch-up vaccination: The fifth dose of DTaP vaccine is not necessary if the fourth dose was administered at age 4 years or older. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 4. Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. (Minimum age: 10 years for Boostrix, 11 years for Adacel)Routine vaccination: Administer 1 dose of Tdap vaccine to all adolescents aged 11 through 12 years. Tdap may be administered regardless of the interval since the last tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. Administer 1 dose of Tdap vaccine to pregnant adolescents during each pregnancy (preferred during 27 through 36 weeks gestation) regardless of time since prior Td or Tdap vaccination. Catch-up vaccination: Persons aged 7 years and older who are not fully immunized with DTaP vaccine should receive Tdap vaccine as 1 (preferably the first) dose in the catch-up series; if additional doses are needed, use Td vaccine. For children 7 through 10 years who receive a dose of Tdap as part of the catch-up series, an adolescent Tdap vaccine dose at age 11 through 12 years should NOT be administered. Td should be administered instead 10 years after the Tdap dose. Persons aged 11 through 18 years who have not received Tdap vaccine should receive a dose followed by tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) booster doses every 10 years thereafter. Inadvertent doses of DTaP vaccine: -If administered inadvertently to a child aged 7 through 10 years may count as part of the catch-up series. This dose may count as the adolescent Tdap dose, or the child can later receive a Tdap booster dose at age 11 through 12 years. -If administered inadvertently to an adolescent aged 11 through 18 years, the dose should be counted as the adolescent Tdap booster. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 5. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine. (Minimum Routine vaccination: Administer a 2- or 3-dose Hib vaccine primary series and a booster dose (dose 3 or 4 depending on vaccine used in primary series) at age 12 through 15 months to complete a full Hib vaccine series. The primary series with ActHIB, MenHibrix, or Pentacel consists of 3 doses and should be administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The primary series with PedvaxHib or COMVAX consists of 2 doses and should be administered at 2 and 4 months of age; a dose at age 6 months is not indicated. One booster dose (dose 3 or 4 depending on vaccine used in primary series) of any Hib vaccine should be administered at age 12 through 15 months. An exception is Hiberix vaccine. Hiberix should only be used for the booster (final) dose in children aged 12 months through 4 years who have received at least 1 prior dose of Hib-containing vaccine.Footnotes \u2014 Recommended immunization schedule for persons aged 0 through 18 years\u2014United States, 2014 For further guidance on the use of the vaccines mentioned below, see: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html . For vaccine recommendations for persons 19 years of age and older, see the adult immunization schedule. Additional information For contraindications and precautions to use of a vaccine and for additional information regarding that vaccine, vaccination providers should consult the relevant ACIP statement available online at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html . For purposes of calculating intervals between doses, 4 weeks = 28 days. Intervals of 4 months or greater are determined by calendar months. Vaccine doses administered 4 days or less before the minimum interval are considered valid. Doses of any vaccine administered 5 days earlier than the minimum interval or minimum age should not be counted as valid doses and should be repeated as age-appropriate. The repeat dose should be spaced after the invalid dose by the recommended minimum interval.

Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine (cont'd) For recommendations on the use of MenHibrix in patients at increased risk for meningococcal disease, please refer to the meningococcal vaccine footnotes and also to MMWR March 22, 2013; 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6202.pdf . Catch-up vaccination: If dose 1 was administered at ages 12 through 14 months, administer a second (final) dose at least 8 weeks after dose 1, regardless of Hib vaccine used in the primary series. If the first 2 doses were PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB or COMVAX), and were administered at age 11 months or younger, the third (and final) dose should be administered at age 12 through 15 months and at least 8 weeks after the second dose. If the first dose was administered at age 7 through 11 months, administer the second dose at least 4 weeks later and a third (and final) dose at age 12 through 15 months or 8 weeks after second dose, whichever is later, regardless of Hib vaccine used for first dose. If first dose is administered at younger than 12 months of age and second dose is given between 12 through 14 months of age, a third (and final) dose should be given 8 weeks later. For unvaccinated children aged 15 months or older, administer only 1 dose. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. For catch-up guidance related to MenHibrix, please see the meningococcal vaccine footnotes and also MMWR March 22, 2013; 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6202.pdf . Vaccination of persons with high-risk conditions: Children aged 12 through 59 months who are at increased risk for Hib disease, including chemotherapy recipients and those with anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, immunoglobulin deficiency, or early component complement deficiency, who have received either no doses or only 1 dose of Hib vaccine before 12 months of age, should receive 2 additional doses of Hib vaccine 8 weeks apart; children who received 2 or more doses of Hib vaccine before 12 months of age should receive 1 additional dose. For patients younger than 5 years of age undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment who received a Hib vaccine dose(s) within 14 days of starting therapy or during therapy, repeat the dose(s) at least 3 months following therapy completion. Recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) should be revaccinated with a 3-dose regimen of Hib vaccine starting 6 to 12 months after successful transplant, regardless of vaccination history; doses should be administered at least 4 weeks apart. A single dose of any Hib-containing vaccine should be administered to unimmunized* children and adolescents 15 months of age and older undergoing an elective splenectomy; if possible, vaccine should be administered at least 14 days before procedure. Hib vaccine is not routinely recommended for patients 5 years or older. However, 1 dose of Hib vaccine should be administered to unimmunized* persons aged 5 years or older who have anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease) and unvaccinated persons 5 through 18 years of age with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. * Patients who have not received a primary series and booster dose or at least 1 dose of Hib vaccine after 14 months of age are considered unimmunized. 6. Pneumococcal vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for PCV13, 2 years for PPSV23)Routine vaccination with PCV13: Administer a 4-dose series of PCV13 vaccine at ages 2, 4, and 6 months and at age 12 through 15 months. For children aged 14 through 59 months who have received an age-appropriate series of 7-valent PCV (PCV7), administer a single of 13-valent PCV (PCV13). Catch-up vaccination with PCV13: Administer 1 dose of PCV13 to all healthy children aged 24 through 59 months who are not completely vaccinated for their age. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2.

If PCV13 has been received previously but PPSV23 has not, administer 1 dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after the most recent dose of PCV13. 3. If PPSV23 has been received but PCV13 has not, administer 1 dose of PCV13 at least 8 weeks after the most recent dose of PPSV23. For children aged 6 through 18 years with chronic heart disease (particularly cyanotic congenital heart disease and cardiac failure), chronic lung disease (including asthma if treated with high-dose oral corticosteroid therapy), diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, or chronic liver disease, who have not received PPSV23, administer 1 dose of PPSV23. If PCV13 has been received previously, then PPSV23 should be administered at least 8 weeks after any prior PCV13 dose. A single revaccination with PPSV23 should be administered 5 years after the first dose to children with sickle cell disease or other hemoglobinopathies; anatomic or functional asplenia; congenital chronic renal failure; nephrotic syndrome; diseases associated with treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or radiation therapy, including malignant neoplasms, leukemias, lymphomas, and Hodgkin disease; generalized Administer a 4-dose series of IPV at ages 2, 4, 6 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years. The final dose in the series should be administered on or after the fourth birthday and at least 6 months after the previous dose. Catch-up vaccination: In the first 6 months of life, minimum age and minimum intervals are only recommended if the person is at risk for imminent exposure to circulating poliovirus (i.e., travel to a polio-endemic region or during an outbreak). If 4 or more doses are administered before age 4 years, an additional dose should be administered at age 4 through 6 years and at least 6 months after the previous dose. A fourth dose is not necessary if the third dose was administered at age 4 years or older and at least 6 months after the previous dose. If both OPV and IPV were administered as part of a series, a total of 4 doses should be administered, regardless of the child's current age. IPV is not routinely recommended for U.S. residents aged 18 years or older. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 8. Influenza vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 months for inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV], 2 years for live, attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) Routine vaccination: Administer influenza vaccine annually to all children beginning at age 6 months. For most healthy, nonpregnant persons aged 2 through 49 years, either LAIV or IIV may be used. However, LAIV should NOT be administered to some persons, including 1) those with asthma, 2) children 2 through 4 years who had wheezing in the past 12 months, or 3) those who have any other underlying medical conditions that predispose them to influenza complications. For all other contraindications to use of LAIV, see MMWR 2013; 62 (No. RR-7):1-43, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6207.pdf. For children aged 6 months through 8 years: For the 2013-14 season, administer 2 doses (separated by at least 4 weeks) to children who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time. Some children in this age group who have been vaccinated previously will also need 2 doses. For additional guidance, follow dosing guidelines in the 2013-14 ACIP influenza vaccine recommendations, MMWR 2013; 62 (No. RR-7):1-43, at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6207.pdf . For the 2014-15 season, follow dosing guidelines in the 2014 ACIP influenza vaccine recommendations. For persons aged 9 years and older: Administer 1 dose.9. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months for routine vaccination) Routine vaccination: Administer a 2-dose series of MMR vaccine at ages12 through 15 months and 4 through 6 years. The second dose may be administered before age 4 years, provided at least 4 weeks have elapsed since the first dose. Administer 1 dose of MMR vaccine to infants aged 6 through 11 months before departure from the United States for international travel. These children should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, the first at age 12 through 15 months (12 months if the child remains in an area where disease risk is high), and the second dose at least 4 weeks later. Administer 2 doses of MMR vaccine to children aged 12 months and older before departure from the United States for international travel. The first dose should be administered on or after age 12 months and the second dose at least 4 weeks later. Catch-up vaccination: Ensure that all school-aged children and adolescents have had 2 doses of MMR vaccine; the minimum interval between the 2 doses is 4 weeks. 10. Varicella (VAR) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months) Routine vaccination: Administer a 2-dose series of VAR vaccine at ages 12 through 15 months and 4 through 6 years. The second dose may be administered before age 4 years, provided at least 3 months have elapsed since the first dose. If the second dose was administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose, it can be accepted as valid. Catch-up vaccination: Ensure that all persons aged 7 through 18 years without evidence of immunity (see MMWR 2007; 56 [No. RR-4], available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5604.pdf ) have 2 doses of varicella vaccine. For children aged 7 through 12 years, the recommended minimum interval between doses is 3 months (if the second dose was administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose, it can be accepted as valid); for persons aged 13 years and older, the minimum interval between doses is 4 weeks. 11. Hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months)Routine vaccination: Initiate the 2-dose HepA vaccine series at 12 through 23 months; separate the 2 doses by 6 to 18 months. Children who have received 1 dose of HepA vaccine before age 24 months should receive a second dose 6 to 18 months after the first dose. For any person aged 2 years and older who has not already received the HepA vaccine series, 2 doses of HepA vaccine separated by 6 to 18 months may be administered if immunity against hepatitis A virus infection is desired. Catch-up vaccination: The minimum interval between the two doses is 6 months. Special populations: Administer 2 doses of HepA vaccine at least 6 months apart to previously unvaccinated persons who live in areas where vaccination programs target older children, or who are at increased risk for infection. This includes persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of infection; men having sex with men; users of injection and non-injection illicit drugs; persons who work with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory; persons with clotting-factor disorders; persons with chronic liver disease; and persons who anticipate close, personal contact (e.g., household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the first 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity. The first dose should be administered as soon as the adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee. 12. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. (Minimum age: [Gardisil]) Routine vaccination: Administer a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine on a schedule of 0, 1-2, and 6 months to all adolescents aged 11 through 12 years. Either HPV4 or HPV2 may be used for females, and only HPV4 may be used for males. The vaccine series may be started at age 9 years. Administer the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose (minimum interval of 4 weeks), administer the third dose 24 weeks after the first dose and 16 weeks after the second dose (minimum interval of 12 weeks). Catch-up vaccination: Administer the vaccine series to females (either HPV2 or HPV4) and males (HPV4) at age 13 through 18 years if not previously vaccinated. Use recommended routine dosing intervals (see above) for vaccine series catch-up. 13. Meningococcal conjugate vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for Hib-MenCY [MenHibrix], for MenACWY-D [Menactra], 2 months for MenACWY-CRM [Menveo])Routine vaccination: Administer a single dose of Menactra or Menveo vaccine at age 11 through 12 years, with a booster dose at age 16 years. Adolescents aged 11 through 18 years with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection should receive a 2-dose primary series of Menactra or Menveo with at least 8 weeks between doses. For children aged 2 months through 18 years with high-risk conditions, see below. Catch-up vaccination: Administer Menactra or Menveo vaccine at age 13 through 18 years if not previously vaccinated. If the first dose is administered at age 13 through 15 years, a booster dose should be administered at age 16 through 18 years with a minimum interval of at least 8 weeks between doses. If the first dose is administered at age 16 years or older, a booster dose is not needed. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. Vaccination of persons with high-risk conditions and other persons at increased risk of disease: Children with anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease): 1. For children younger than 19 months of age, administer a 4-dose infant series of MenHibrix or Menveo at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age. 2. For children aged 19 through 23 months who have not completed a series of MenHibrix or Menveo, administer 2 primary doses of Menveo at least 3 months apart. 3. For children aged 24 months and older who have not received a complete series of MenHibrix or Menveo or Menactra, administer 2 primary doses of either Menactra or Menveo at least 2 months apart. If Menactra is administered to a child with asplenia (including sickle cell disease), do not administer Menactra until 2 years of age and at least 4 weeks after the completion of all PCV13 doses. Children with persistent complement component deficiency: 1. For children younger than 19 months of age, administer a 4-dose infant series of either MenHibrix or Menveo at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age. 2. For children 7 through 23 months who have not initiated vaccination, two options exist depending on age and vaccine brand: a. For children who initiate vaccination with Menveo at 7 months through 23 months of age, a 2-dose series should be administered with the second dose after 12 months of age and at least 3 months after the first dose. b. For children who initiate vaccination with Menactra at 9 months through 23 months of age, a 2-dose series of Menactra should be administered at least 3 months apart. c. For children aged 24 months and older who have not received a complete series of MenHibrix, Menveo, or Menactra, administer 2 primary doses of either Menactra or Menveo at least 2 months apart. For children who travel to or reside in countries in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic, including countries in the African meningitis belt or the Hajj, administer an age- appropriate formulation and series of Menactra or Menveo for protection against serogroups A and W meningococcal disease. Prior receipt of MenHibrix is not sufficient for children traveling to the meningitis belt or the Hajj because it does not contain serogroups A or W. For children at risk during a community outbreak attributable to a vaccine serogroup, administer or complete an age- and formulation-appropriate series of MenHibrix, Menactra, or Menveo. For booster doses among persons with high-risk conditions, refer to MMWR 2013; 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a1.htm. Catch-up recommendations for persons with high-risk conditions: 1. If MenHibrix is administered to achieve protection against meningococcal disease, a complete age-appropriate series of MenHibrix should be administered. 2. If the first dose of MenHibrix is given at or after 12 months of age, a total of 2 doses should be given at least 8 weeks apart to ensure protection against serogroups C and Y meningococcal disease. 3. For children who initiate vaccination with Menveo at 7 months through 9 months of age, a 2-dose series should be administered with the second dose after 12 months of age and at least 3 months after the first dose. 4. For other catch-up recommendations for these persons, refer to MMWR 2013; 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a1.htm.

Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine. (Minimum age: birth) Routine vaccination: At birth: Administer monovalent HepB vaccine to all newborns before hospital discharge. For infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers, administer HepB vaccine and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. These infants should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) 1 to 2 months after completion of the HepB series, at age 9 through 18 months (preferably at the next well-child visit). If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, within 12 hours of birth administer HepB vaccine regardless of birth weight. For infants weighing less than 2,000 grams, administer HBIG in addition to HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Determine mother's HBsAg status as soon as possible and, if mother is HBsAg-positive, also administer HBIG for infants weighing 2,000 grams or more as soon as possible, but no later than age 7 days. Doses following the birth dose: The second dose should be administered at age 1 or 2 months. Monovalent HepB vaccine should be used for doses administered before age 6 weeks. Infants who did not receive a birth dose should receive 3 doses of a HepB-containing vaccine on a schedule of 0, 1 to 2 months, and 6 months starting as soon as feasible. See Figure 2. Administer the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose (minimum interval of 4 weeks), administer the third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose AND at least 16 weeks after the first dose. The final (third or fourth) dose in the HepB vaccine series should be administered no earlier than age 24 weeks . Administration of a total of 4 doses of HepB vaccine is permitted when a combination vaccine containing HepB is administered after the birth dose. Catch-up vaccination: Unvaccinated persons should complete a 3-dose series. A 2-dose series (doses separated by at least 4 months) of adult formulation Recombivax HB is licensed for use in children aged 11 through 15 years. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 2. Rotavirus (RV) vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for both RV1 [Rotarix] and RV5 [RotaTeq])Routine vaccination:Administer a series of RV vaccine to all infants as follows: 1. If Rotarix is used, administer a 2-dose series at 2 and 4 months of age. 2. If RotaTeq is used, administer a 3-dose series at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. 3. If any dose in the series was RotaTeq or vaccine product is unknown for any dose in the series, a total of 3 doses of RV vaccine should be administered. Catch-up vaccination: The maximum age for the first dose in the series is 14 weeks, 6 days; vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged 15 weeks, 0 days or older. The maximum age for the final dose in the series is 8 months, 0 days. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2.3. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. vaccination: Administer a 5-dose series of DTaP vaccine at ages 2, 4, 6, 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years. The fourth dose may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since the third dose. Catch-up vaccination: The fifth dose of DTaP vaccine is not necessary if the fourth dose was administered at age 4 years or older. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 4. Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. (Minimum age: 10 years for Boostrix, 11 years for Adacel)Routine vaccination: Administer 1 dose of Tdap vaccine to all adolescents aged 11 through 12 years. Tdap may be administered regardless of the interval since the last tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. Administer 1 dose of Tdap vaccine to pregnant adolescents during each pregnancy (preferred during 27 through 36 weeks gestation) regardless of time since prior Td or Tdap vaccination. Catch-up vaccination: Persons aged 7 years and older who are not fully immunized with DTaP vaccine should receive Tdap vaccine as 1 (preferably the first) dose in the catch-up series; if additional doses are needed, use Td vaccine. For children 7 through 10 years who receive a dose of Tdap as part of the catch-up series, an adolescent Tdap vaccine dose at age 11 through 12 years should NOT be administered. Td should be administered instead 10 years after the Tdap dose. Persons aged 11 through 18 years who have not received Tdap vaccine should receive a dose followed by tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) booster doses every 10 years thereafter. Inadvertent doses of DTaP vaccine: -If administered inadvertently to a child aged 7 through 10 years may count as part of the catch-up series. This dose may count as the adolescent Tdap dose, or the child can later receive a Tdap booster dose at age 11 through 12 years. -If administered inadvertently to an adolescent aged 11 through 18 years, the dose should be counted as the adolescent Tdap booster. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 5. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine. (Minimum Routine vaccination: Administer a 2- or 3-dose Hib vaccine primary series and a booster dose (dose 3 or 4 depending on vaccine used in primary series) at age 12 through 15 months to complete a full Hib vaccine series. The primary series with ActHIB, MenHibrix, or Pentacel consists of 3 doses and should be administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The primary series with PedvaxHib or COMVAX consists of 2 doses and should be administered at 2 and 4 months of age; a dose at age 6 months is not indicated. One booster dose (dose 3 or 4 depending on vaccine used in primary series) of any Hib vaccine should be administered at age 12 through 15 months. An exception is Hiberix vaccine. Hiberix should only be used for the booster (final) dose in children aged 12 months through 4 years who have received at least 1 prior dose of Hib-containing vaccine.Footnotes \u2014 Recommended immunization schedule for persons aged 0 through 18 years\u2014United States, 2014 For further guidance on the use of the vaccines mentioned below, see: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html .

Catch-up vaccination: If dose 1 was administered at ages 12 through 14 months, administer a second (final) dose at least 8 weeks after dose 1, regardless of Hib vaccine used in the primary series. If the first 2 doses were PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB or COMVAX), and were administered at age 11 months or younger, the third (and final) dose should be administered at age 12 through 15 months and at least 8 weeks after the second dose. If the first dose was administered at age 7 through 11 months, administer the second dose at least 4 weeks later and a third (and final) dose at age 12 through 15 months or 8 weeks after second dose, whichever is later, regardless of Hib vaccine used for first dose. If first dose is administered at younger than 12 months of age and second dose is given between 12 through 14 months of age, a third (and final) dose should be given 8 weeks later. For unvaccinated children aged 15 months or older, administer only 1 dose. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. For catch-up guidance related to MenHibrix, please see the meningococcal vaccine footnotes and also MMWR March 22, 2013; 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6202.pdf . Vaccination of persons with high-risk conditions: Children aged 12 through 59 months who are at increased risk for Hib disease, including chemotherapy recipients and those with anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, immunoglobulin deficiency, or early component complement deficiency, who have received either no doses or only 1 dose of Hib vaccine before 12 months of age, should receive 2 additional doses of Hib vaccine 8 weeks apart; children who received 2 or more doses of Hib vaccine before 12 months of age should receive 1 additional dose. For patients younger than 5 years of age undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment who received a Hib vaccine dose(s) within 14 days of starting therapy or during therapy, repeat the dose(s) at least 3 months following therapy completion. Recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) should be revaccinated with a 3-dose regimen of Hib vaccine starting 6 to 12 months after successful transplant, regardless of vaccination history; doses should be administered at least 4 weeks apart. A single dose of any Hib-containing vaccine should be administered to unimmunized* children and adolescents 15 months of age and older undergoing an elective splenectomy; if possible, vaccine should be administered at least 14 days before procedure. Hib vaccine is not routinely recommended for patients 5 years or older. However, 1 dose of Hib vaccine should be administered to unimmunized* persons aged 5 years or older who have anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease) and unvaccinated persons 5 through 18 years of age with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. * Patients who have not received a primary series and booster dose or at least 1 dose of Hib vaccine after 14 months of age are considered unimmunized. 6. Pneumococcal vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for PCV13, 2 years for PPSV23)Routine vaccination with PCV13: Administer a 4-dose series of PCV13 vaccine at ages 2, 4, and 6 months and at age 12 through 15 months. For children aged 14 through 59 months who have received an age-appropriate series of 7-valent PCV (PCV7), administer a single of 13-valent PCV (PCV13). Catch-up vaccination with PCV13: Administer 1 dose of PCV13 to all healthy children aged 24 through 59 months who are not completely vaccinated for their age. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. Vaccination of persons with high-risk conditions with PCV13 and PPSV23: All recommended PCV13 doses should be administered prior to PPSV23 vaccination if possible.

Administer 1 dose of PCV13 if 3 doses of PCV (PCV7 and/or PCV13) were received previously. 2. Administer 2 doses of PCV13 at least 8 weeks apart if fewer than 3 doses of PCV (PCV7 and/or PCV13) were received previously. 6. Pneumococcal vaccines (cont'd) 3. Administer 1 supplemental dose of PCV13 if 4 doses of PCV7 or other age-appropriate complete PCV7 series was received previously. 4. The minimum interval between doses of PCV (PCV7 or PCV13) is 8 weeks. 5. For children with no history of PPSV23 vaccination, administer PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after the most recent dose of PCV13. For children aged 6 through 18 years who have cerebrospinal fluid leak; cochlear implant; sickle cell disease and functional asplenia; congenital chronic renal failure; nephrotic syndrome; diseases associated with treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or radiation therapy, including malignant neoplasms, leukemias, lymphomas, and Hodgkin disease; generalized malignancy; solid organ or multiple myeloma: 1. If neither PCV13 nor PPSV23 has been received previously, administer 1 dose of PCV13 now and 1 dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later. 2. If PCV13 has been received previously but PPSV23 has not, administer 1 dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after the most recent dose of PCV13. 3. If PPSV23 has been received but PCV13 has not, administer 1 dose of PCV13 at least 8 weeks after the most recent dose of PPSV23. For children aged 6 through 18 years with chronic heart disease (particularly cyanotic congenital heart disease and cardiac failure), chronic lung disease (including asthma if treated with high-dose oral corticosteroid therapy), diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, or chronic liver disease, who have not received PPSV23, administer 1 dose of PPSV23. If PCV13 has been received previously, then PPSV23 should be administered at least 8 weeks after any prior PCV13 dose. A single revaccination with PPSV23 should be administered 5 years after the first dose to children with sickle cell disease or other hemoglobinopathies; anatomic or functional asplenia; congenital chronic renal failure; nephrotic syndrome; diseases associated with treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or radiation therapy, including malignant neoplasms, leukemias, lymphomas, and Hodgkin disease; generalized Administer a 4-dose series of IPV at ages 2, 4, 6 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years. The final dose in the series should be administered on or after the fourth birthday and at least 6 months after the previous dose. Catch-up vaccination: In the first 6 months of life, minimum age and minimum intervals are only recommended if the person is at risk for imminent exposure to circulating poliovirus (i.e., travel to a polio-endemic region or during an outbreak). If 4 or more doses are administered before age 4 years, an additional dose should be administered at age 4 through 6 years and at least 6 months after the previous dose. A fourth dose is not necessary if the third dose was administered at age 4 years or older and at least 6 months after the previous dose. If both OPV and IPV were administered as part of a series, a total of 4 doses should be administered, regardless of the child's current age. IPV is not routinely recommended for U.S. residents aged 18 years or older. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 8. Influenza vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 months for inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV], 2 years for live, attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) Routine vaccination: Administer influenza vaccine annually to all children beginning at age 6 months. For most healthy, nonpregnant persons aged 2 through 49 years, either LAIV or IIV may be used. However, LAIV should NOT be administered to some persons, including 1) those with asthma, 2) children 2 through 4 years who had wheezing in the past 12 months, or 3) those who have any other underlying medical conditions that predispose them to influenza complications. For all other contraindications to use of LAIV, see MMWR 2013; 62 (No. RR-7):1-43, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6207.pdf. For children aged 6 months through 8 years: For the 2013-14 season, administer 2 doses (separated by at least 4 weeks) to children who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time. Some children in this age group who have been vaccinated previously will also need 2 doses. For additional guidance, follow dosing guidelines in the 2013-14 ACIP influenza vaccine recommendations, MMWR 2013; 62 (No. RR-7):1-43, at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6207.pdf . For the 2014-15 season, follow dosing guidelines in the 2014 ACIP influenza vaccine recommendations. For persons aged 9 years and older: Administer 1 dose.9. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months for routine vaccination) Routine vaccination: Administer a 2-dose series of MMR vaccine at ages12 through 15 months and 4 through 6 years. The second dose may be administered before age 4 years, provided at least 4 weeks have elapsed since the first dose. Administer 1 dose of MMR vaccine to infants aged 6 through 11 months before departure from the United States for international travel. These children should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, the first at age 12 through 15 months (12 months if the child remains in an area where disease risk is high), and the second dose at least 4 weeks later. Administer 2 doses of MMR vaccine to children aged 12 months and older before departure from the United States for international travel. The first dose should be administered on or after age 12 months and the second dose at least 4 weeks later. Catch-up vaccination: Ensure that all school-aged children and adolescents have had 2 doses of MMR vaccine; the minimum interval between the 2 doses is 4 weeks. 10. Varicella (VAR) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months) Routine vaccination: Administer a 2-dose series of VAR vaccine at ages 12 through 15 months and 4 through 6 years. The second dose may be administered before age 4 years, provided at least 3 months have elapsed since the first dose. If the second dose was administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose, it can be accepted as valid. Catch-up vaccination: Ensure that all persons aged 7 through 18 years without evidence of immunity (see MMWR 2007; 56 [No. RR-4], available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5604.pdf ) have 2 doses of varicella vaccine. For children aged 7 through 12 years, the recommended minimum interval between doses is 3 months (if the second dose was administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose, it can be accepted as valid); for persons aged 13 years and older, the minimum interval between doses is 4 weeks. 11. Hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months)Routine vaccination: Initiate the 2-dose HepA vaccine series at 12 through 23 months; separate the 2 doses by 6 to 18 months. Children who have received 1 dose of HepA vaccine before age 24 months should receive a second dose 6 to 18 months after the first dose. For any person aged 2 years and older who has not already received the HepA vaccine series, 2 doses of HepA vaccine separated by 6 to 18 months may be administered if immunity against hepatitis A virus infection is desired. Catch-up vaccination: The minimum interval between the two doses is 6 months. Special populations: Administer 2 doses of HepA vaccine at least 6 months apart to previously unvaccinated persons who live in areas where vaccination programs target older children, or who are at increased risk for infection. This includes persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of infection; men having sex with men; users of injection and non-injection illicit drugs; persons who work with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory; persons with clotting-factor disorders; persons with chronic liver disease; and persons who anticipate close, personal contact (e.g., household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the first 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity. The first dose should be administered as soon as the adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee. 12. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. (Minimum age: [Gardisil]) Routine vaccination: Administer a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine on a schedule of 0, 1-2, and 6 months to all adolescents aged 11 through 12 years. Either HPV4 or HPV2 may be used for females, and only HPV4 may be used for males. The vaccine series may be started at age 9 years. Administer the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose (minimum interval of 4 weeks), administer the third dose 24 weeks after the first dose and 16 weeks after the second dose (minimum interval of 12 weeks). Catch-up vaccination: Administer the vaccine series to females (either HPV2 or HPV4) and males (HPV4) at age 13 through 18 years if not previously vaccinated. Use recommended routine dosing intervals (see above) for vaccine series catch-up. 13. Meningococcal conjugate vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for Hib-MenCY [MenHibrix], for MenACWY-D [Menactra], 2 months for MenACWY-CRM [Menveo])Routine vaccination: Administer a single dose of Menactra or Menveo vaccine at age 11 through 12 years, with a booster dose at age 16 years. Adolescents aged 11 through 18 years with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection should receive a 2-dose primary series of Menactra or Menveo with at least 8 weeks between doses. For children aged 2 months through 18 years with high-risk conditions, see below. Catch-up vaccination: Administer Menactra or Menveo vaccine at age 13 through 18 years if not previously vaccinated. If the first dose is administered at age 13 through 15 years, a booster dose should be administered at age 16 through 18 years with a minimum interval of at least 8 weeks between doses. If the first dose is administered at age 16 years or older, a booster dose is not needed. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. Vaccination of persons with high-risk conditions and other persons at increased risk of disease: Children with anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease): 1. For children younger than 19 months of age, administer a 4-dose infant series of MenHibrix or Menveo at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age. 2. For children aged 19 through 23 months who have not completed a series of MenHibrix or Menveo, administer 2 primary doses of Menveo at least 3 months apart. 3. For children aged 24 months and older who have not received a complete series of MenHibrix or Menveo or Menactra, administer 2 primary doses of either Menactra or Menveo at least 2 months apart. If Menactra is administered to a child with asplenia (including sickle cell disease), do not administer Menactra until 2 years of age and at least 4 weeks after the completion of all PCV13 doses. Children with persistent complement component deficiency: 1. For children younger than 19 months of age, administer a 4-dose infant series of either MenHibrix or Menveo at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age. 2. For children 7 through 23 months who have not initiated vaccination, two options exist depending on age and vaccine brand: a. For children who initiate vaccination with Menveo at 7 months through 23 months of age, a 2-dose series should be administered with the second dose after 12 months of age and at least 3 months after the first dose. b. For children who initiate vaccination with Menactra at 9 months through 23 months of age, a 2-dose series of Menactra should be administered at least 3 months apart. c. For children aged 24 months and older who have not received a complete series of MenHibrix, Menveo, or Menactra, administer 2 primary doses of either Menactra or Menveo at least 2 months apart. For children who travel to or reside in countries in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic, including countries in the African meningitis belt or the Hajj, administer an age- appropriate formulation and series of Menactra or Menveo for protection against serogroups A and W meningococcal disease. Prior receipt of MenHibrix is not sufficient for children traveling to the meningitis belt or the Hajj because it does not contain serogroups A or W. For children at risk during a community outbreak attributable to a vaccine serogroup, administer or complete an age- and formulation-appropriate series of MenHibrix, Menactra, or Menveo. For booster doses among persons with high-risk conditions, refer to MMWR 2013; 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a1.htm. Catch-up recommendations for persons with high-risk conditions: 1. If MenHibrix is administered to achieve protection against meningococcal disease, a complete age-appropriate series of MenHibrix should be administered. 2. If the first dose of MenHibrix is given at or after 12 months of age, a total of 2 doses should be given at least 8 weeks apart to ensure protection against serogroups C and Y meningococcal disease. 3. For children who initiate vaccination with Menveo at 7 months through 9 months of age, a 2-dose series should be administered with the second dose after 12 months of age and at least 3 months after the first dose. 4.

Vaccine package inserts and the full ACIP recommendations for these vaccines should be consulted for additional information on vaccine-related contraindications and pre - cautions and for more information on vaccine excipients. Events or conditions listed as precautions should be reviewed carefully. Benefits of and risks for administering a specific vaccine to a person under these circumstances should be considered. If the risk from the vaccine is believed to outweigh the benefit, the vaccine should not be ad - ministered. If the benefit of vaccination is believed to outweigh the risk, the vaccine should be administered. A contraindication is a condition in a recipient that increases the chance of a serious adverse reaction. Therefore, a vaccine should not be adminis - tered when a contraindication is present. Whether and when to administer DTaP to chil - dren with proven or suspected underlying neurologic disorders should be decided on a case-by-case basis. 2. Hepatitis B vaccination should be deferred for preterm infants and infants weighing less than 2000 g if the mother is documented to be hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative at the time of the infant's birth. Vaccination can commence at chronological age 1 month or at hospital discharge. For infants born to women who are HBsAg-positive, hepatitis B immuno - globulin and hepatitis B vaccine should be administered within 12 hours of birth, regardless of weight. 3.

Immunosuppressive steroid dose is considered to be 2 or more weeks of daily receipt of 20 mg prednisone or equivalent. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 1 month after discontinuation of such therapy. Providers should consult ACIP recommendations for com - plete information on the use of specific live vaccines among persons on immune-suppressing medications or with immune suppression because of other reasons. 6. HIV-infected children may receive varicella and measles vaccine if CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is >15%. (Source: Adapted from American Academy of Pediatrics.

If you answer \"yes\" to any question, it does not necessarily mean your child should not be vaccinated. It just means additional questions must be asked. If a question is not clear, please ask your healthcare provider to explain it. 1. Is the child sick today? 2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kidney or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? 5. If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and 4 years, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told he or she has had intussusception? 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system problems? 8. Does the child have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? 9. In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that weaken their immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs, or had radiation treatments? 10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? 11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month? 12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? Immunization Action Coalition St. Paul, Minnesota (mo.) (day) (yr.) Did you bring your child's immunization record card with you? yes no It is important to have a personal record of your child's vaccinations. If you don't have one, ask the child's healthcare provider to give you one with all your child's vaccinations on it. Keep it in a safe place and bring it with you every time you seek medical care for your child. Your child will need this document to enter day care or school, for employment, or for international travel.

Does the child have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? [LAIV, MMR, rotavirus, and the intranasal live, at influenza vaccine [LAIV]) are usually contraindicated in immunocompromised children. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR is recommended for asymptomatic HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe immunosup - pression. Likewise, varicella vaccine should be considered for HIV-infected children with age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage at 15% or greater and may be considered for children age 8 years and older with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of greater than or equal to 200 cells/\u00b5L. Immunosuppressed children should not receive LAIV. Infants who have been diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) should not be given a live virus vaccine, including rotavirus (RV) vaccine. For details, consult the ACIP recommendations (4, 5, 6). 9. In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that weaken their immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs, or had radiation treat - ments? [LAIV, varicella, LAIV) should be postponed until after chemotherapy or long-term high-dose steroid therapy has ended. For details and length of time to postpone, consult the ACIP statement (1). To find specific vaccination schedules for stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant) patients, see reference 7. LAIV can be given only to healthy non-pregnant individuals age 2-49 years. 10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, MMR, MMRV, varicella) may need to be deferred, depending on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommendations or the cur - rent Red Book for the most current information on intervals between antiviral drugs, immune globulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines (1, 2). 11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month? [LAIV, MMR, LAIV) are contraindicated one month before and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus (1, 6). Sexually active young women who receive a live virus vaccine should be instructed to practice careful contraception for one month following receipt of the vac - cine (5, 8). On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given during pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of disease is imminent (e.g., travel to endemic areas) and immediate protection is needed. Use of Td or Tdap is not contra - indicated in pregnancy. At the provider's discretion, either vaccine may be administered during the 2nd or 3rd trimester (9). 12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR, yellow fever] If the child was given either live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, yellow fever) in the past 4 weeks, they should wait 28 days before receiving another vaccination of this type. Inactivated vac - cines may be given at the same time or at any spacing interval. References: 1. CDC. General recommendations on immunization, at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm. 2. AAP.

If so, read the information below. If you want to find out even more, consult the references listed at the bottom of this page. Immunization Action Coalition Item #P4060 p. 2 1. Is the child sick today? [all vaccines] There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events (1, 2). However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute ill - ness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (such as otitis media, upper respiratory infections, and diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? [all vaccines] If a person reports they have an allergy to egg, ask if they can eat lightly cooked eggs (e.g., scrambled eggs). If they can, trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) may be admin - istered. If after eating eggs or egg-containing foods, they have a reaction consisting of only hives, TIV may be given and the person should be observed for at least 30 minutes. If a person experiences a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives and either swelling of the lips or tongue, acute respiratory distress, or collapse) after eating eggs, do not administer TIV or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). It is possible that they may be eligible to be given TIV, but only after they have seen a physician with expertise in the management of allergic conditions. If a person has ana - phylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer LAIV, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), MMR+varicella (MMRV), or varicella vaccine. A local reaction is not a contraindication. For a table of vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain latex, go to www.cdc. gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/latex-table.pdf. For an extensive table of vaccine components, see reference 3. 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? [all vaccines] History of anaphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of vaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for subsequent doses (1). His - tory of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP is a contraindication for further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Precautions to DTaP (not Tdap) include the following: (a) seizure within 3 days of a dose, (b) pale or limp episode or collapse within 48 hours of a dose, (c) continuous crying for 3 or more hours within 48 hours of a dose, and (d) fever of 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of a previous dose. There are other adverse events that might have occurred following vaccination that constitute contraindications or precautions to future doses. Under normal circumstances, vac - cines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak). 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kid - ney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? [LAIV] Children with any of the health conditions listed above should not be given the intrana - sal, live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). These children should be vaccinated with the injectable influenza vaccine. 5. If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and 4 years, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? [LAIV] Children who have had a wheezing episode within the past 12 months should not be given the live attenuated influenza vaccine. Instead, these children should be given the inactivated influenza vaccine. 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told that he or she has had intussusception? [Rotavirus] Infants who have a history of intussusception (i.e., the telescoping of one portion of the intestine into another) should not be given rotavirus vaccine. 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system [DTaP, in children who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP. An unstable progressive neuro - logic problem is a precaution to the use of DTaP and Tdap. For children with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for children with a family history of seizures, vaccinate as usual ( exception: children with a personal or family [i.e., parent or sibling] history of seizures generally should not be vaccinated with MMRV; they should receive separate MMR and VAR vaccines). A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made to continue vaccination, give age-appropriate Tdap instead of Td if no history of prior Tdap, to improve pertussis protection; 2) Influenza vaccine (TIV or LAIV): if GBS has 1. \u00bfEst\u00e1 enfermo en terapia de aspirina a largo plazo? 5.

If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and 4 years, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? [LAIV] Children who have had a wheezing episode within the past 12 months should not be given the live attenuated influenza vaccine. Instead, these children should be given the inactivated influenza vaccine. 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told that he or she has had intussusception? [Rotavirus] Infants who have a history of intussusception (i.e., the telescoping of one portion of the intestine into another) should not be given rotavirus vaccine. 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system [DTaP, in children who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP. An unstable progressive neurolog - ic problem is a precaution to the use of DTaP and Tdap, and a progressive neurologic disorder in a teen is a precaution to the use of Td. For children with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for children with a family history of seizures, vaccinate as usual ( exception: children with a personal or family [i.e., parent or sibling] history of seizures generally should not be vaccinated with MMRV; they should receive separate MMR and VAR vaccines). A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syn - drome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made to continue vaccination, give age-appropriate Tdap instead of Td if no 1.

Check the package insert at www.immunize.org/packageinserts for a list of the vaccine components (i.e., excipients and culture media) used in the production of the vaccine, or go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ pubs/ pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf. Some vaccines also contain latex in the prefilled syringe cap which may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive people. Check the package inserts at www.immunize.org/ packageinserts for information on which vaccines are affected, or go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/ appendices/B/latex-table.pdf. 3. Has the person to be vaccinated ever had a seri - ous reaction to influenza vaccine in the past? Patients reporting a serious reaction to a previous dose of inactivated influenza vaccine should be asked to describe their symptoms. Immediate\u2014presumably allergic\u2014reactions are usually a contraindication to further vaccination against influenza. Fever, malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms most often affect people who are first-time vaccinees. These mild- to-moderate local reactions are not a contraindication to future vaccination. Also, red eyes or mild upper facial swelling following vaccination with inactivated injectable influenza vaccine is most likely a coincidental event and not related to the vaccine; these people can receive injectable vaccine without further evaluation. 4. Has the person to be vaccinated ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome? It is prudent to avoid vaccinating people who are not at high risk for severe influenza complications (see source 3) but who are known to have developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks after receiving a previous influenza vaccination. As an alternative, physicians might consider using influenza antiviral chemoprophylaxis for these people. Although data are limited, the established benefits of influenza vaccination for the majority of people who have a history of GBS, and who are at high risk for severe complications from influenza, justify yearly vaccination. 1. Is the person to be vaccinated sick today? There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events. People with an acute febrile illness usually should not be vaccinated until their symp - toms have improved. Minor illnesses with or without fever do not contraindicate use of influenza vaccine. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2. Does the person to be vaccinated have an allergy to eggs or to a component of the vaccine? Allergic reactions to any vaccine component can occur. The majority of reactions probably are caused by residual egg protein. Although most current influenza vaccines contain only a limited quantity of egg protein, this protein can induce immediate allergic reactions among people who have severe egg allergy. An egg-free recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine (RIV) may be used in people age 18 through 49 years with egg allergy of any severity who have no other contraindications. People who do not meet the age criteria for RIV who have experienced a seri - ous systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling of the lips or tongue, acute respiratory distress, or collapse) after eat - ing eggs should consult a specialist for appropriate evaluation to help determine if vaccine should be administered. People who have documented immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hyper - sensitivity to eggs, including those who have had occupational asthma or other allergic responses to egg protein, might also be at increased risk for allergic reactions to influenza vaccine. Protocols have been published for safely administering influenza vaccine to people with egg allergies (see source 3). Some people who report allergy to egg might not be egg- allergic. If a person can eat lightly cooked eggs (e.g., scrambled eggs), they are unlikely to have an egg allergy. However, peo - ple who can tolerate egg in baked products (e.g., cake) might still have an egg allergy. If the person develops hives only after ingesting eggs, CDC recommends they receive either inactivat - ed influenza vaccine (IIV) or, if age-eligible, RIV (not LAIV). If IIV is to be administered, CDC further recommends 1) the vaccine be administered by a healthcare provider familiar with the po - tential manifestations of egg allergy and 2) the vaccine recipient be observed for at least 30 minutes after receipt of the vaccine for signs of a reaction. Fluzone (sanofi pasteur) contains gelatin as a stabilizer; therefore a history of anaphylactic reaction to gelatin is a contraindication. Some inactivated influenza vaccines contain thimerosal as a pre - servative. Most people who had sensitivity to thimerosal when it was used in contact lens solution do not have reactions to thi -Information for Health Professionals about the Screening Checklist for Contraindications to Inactivated Injectable Influenza Vaccination Are you interested in knowing why we included a certain question on the screening checklist?

If you answer \"yes\" to any question, it does not necessarily mean you (or your child) should not be vaccinated. It just means additional questions must be asked. If a question is not clear, please ask your healthcare provider to explain it. No YesDon't KnowScreening Checklist for Contraindications to Date of birth: (mo.) (day) (yr.) Technical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention8. Is the person to be vaccinated receiving antiviral medications? Receipt of certain influenza antivirals (e.g., amantadine, mivir, oseltamivir) could reduce LAIV vaccine efficacy; therefore, providers may want to defer vaccination with LAIV in people who took these antivirals within the previous 48 hours and to advise avoiding use of these antivirals for 14 days after vaccination, if feasible. 9. Is the child or teen to be vaccinated receiving aspirin thera - py or aspirin-containing therapy? Because of the theoretical risk of Reye's syndrome, children and teens on aspirin therapy should not be given LAIV. Instead they should be vaccinated with the inactivated injectable influenza vaccine. 10. Is the person to be vaccinated pregnant or could she be - come pregnant within the next month? Pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant within a month should not be given LAIV. All pregnant women should, however, be vacci - nated with the inactivated injectable influenza vaccine. 11. Has the person to be vaccinated ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome? It is prudent to avoid vaccinating people who are not at high risk for severe influenza complications but who are known to have developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks after receiving a previous influenza vaccina - tion.

Does the person to be vaccinated live with or expect to have close contact with a person whose immune system is severely compromised and who must be in protective isolation (e.g., an isolation room of a bone marrow transplant unit)? Inactivated injectable influenza vaccine is preferred for people who anticipate close contact with a severely immunosuppressed person during periods in which the immunosuppressed person requires care in protective isolation (e.g., in a specialized patient-care area with a positive airflow relative to the corridor, high-efficiency particulate air filtration, and frequent air changes). Either the in - activated injectable influenza vaccine or LAIV may be used in people who have close contact with people having lesser degrees of immunosuppression. 13. Has the person to be vaccinated received any other vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? People who were given an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, zoster, yellow fever) in the past 4 weeks should wait 28 days before receiving LAIV. There is no reason to defer giving LAIV if people were vac - cinated with an inactivated vaccine or if they have recently received blood or other antibody-containing blood products (e.g., IG).1. Is the person to be vaccinated sick today? There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events. People with an acute febrile illness usually should not be vaccinated until their symptoms have improved. Minor illnesses with or without fever do not contraindicate use of influenza vaccine. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2. Does the person to be vaccinated have an allergy to eggs or to a component of the influenza vaccine? A history of anaphylactic or non-anaphylactic reaction\u2014such as hives, wheez - ing, or diffic ulty breathing, or circulatory collapse or shock (not fainting)\u2014after eating eggs or receiving any component of the intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV; tradename FluMist) is usually a contraindication for further doses. An egg-free recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine (RIV) may be used in people age 18 through 49 years with egg allergy of any severity who have no other contraindications. People with egg allergies who do not meet the age criteria for RIV can usually be vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV); consult ACIP recommendations (see source 3).

Q1: Who decides what immunization schildren need ? A:Each year, t opdisease experts and doctors who care for children work together to decide what torecommend that will best protect U.S. c hildren from diseases. The schedule is evaluated each year based on the most recent scientific data available . Changes are announced in January, if needed. The schedule is approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Family Physicians. Q2: How are the timing and spacing of the shots determined? A: Each vaccine dose is scheduled using 2 factors. First, it is scheduled for the age when the body's immune system will work the be st. Second, it is balanced with the need to provide protection to infants and children at the earliest possible age. Q3: Why are there so many doses? A:Researchers are always studying how well vaccines work. For many vaccines three or four doses areneeded to full yprotect your child. The doses need tobe spaced out a certain amount to work the best. Q4: Why is the schedule \"one size fits all?\" Aren't there some children who shouldn't receive some vaccines? A:Your child's health and safety are very important to your child's doctor. The schedule is considered the ideal schedule for healthy children but there may be exceptions. For example, your child might not receive certain vaccines if she has allergies to aningredient in the vaccine, or if she ha sa weakened immune system due to illness, a chronic condition, or another medical treatment. Sometimes a shot needs to be delayed for a short time, and sometimes not given at all . Your pediatrician stays updated about newexceptions to the immunization schedule. This is one reason your child's complete medical history is taken at the pediatrician's office, and why it is important for your child's health care providers to be familiar with your child's medical history. Q5: Why can't the shots be spread out over a longer period of time? There are 25 shots recommended in the first 15 months of life; wh ynotspread th eseout over 2 or 3 years? A: First, you would not want your child to go unprotected that long. Babies are hospitalized and die more often from some diseases, so it is important to vaccinate them as soon as it is safe. Second, the recommended schedule is designed towork best with a child's immune system at certain ages and at specific times . There is no research to show that a child would beequally protected against diseases with a very different schedule . Also, there is noscientific reason why spreading out the shots would be safer. But we do know that any length of time without immunizations is a time without protection. Q6: I've seen another schedule in a magazine that allows the shots to be spread out. It was developed by a pediatrician. Why can't I follow that schedule? My child would still get his immunizations in time for school. A: There is no scientific basis for such a schedule . No one knows how well it would work to protect your child from diseases . And if many parents in any community decided to follow such a schedule, diseases will be able to spread much more quickly .Also, people who are too sick or too young to receive vacc inesareplaced at risk when they are around unvaccinated children. For example, following one alternative schedule would leave children without full polio protection until age 4. Yet it would take only one case of polio to be brought into the U.S. for the disease to take hold again in this country. This schedule also delays the measles vaccine until age 3. We have already seen outbreaks of measles in some parts of the country because children were not immunized .This is a highly infectious disease that c ancause serious harm --even de ath. The reason we recommend vaccines when we do is because young children are more vulnerable to these diseases. Pediatricians want parents to have reliable, complete, and science -based information, so that they can make the best decision for their child about vaccination. Q7: Isn't it possible that my child has natural immunity to one or more diseases? If he does, can't he skip the shot? A:Tests thatcheck for immunity to certain diseases do not work well in young chi ldren . Q8: Isn't it overwhelming to a child's immune system to give so many shots in one visit? A:Infants and children are exposed to many germs every day just by playing, eating, and breathing. Their immune systems fight those germs, also called anti gens, to keep the body healthy. The amount of antigens that children fight every day is much more than the antigens in any combination of vaccines on the current schedule. So children's immune systems are not overwhelmed by vaccines. Q9: There are no sho ts given at 9 months, other than maybe flu vaccine or catch -up vaccines. W hynotgive some at that visit instead of at 6 months or 12 months? A: Waiting until 9 months would leave the child unprotected from some diseases , but 9 months is too early for some of the12-18 month vaccines .For example, i t is too early for the live measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines ,since some infants might have a bit ofprotection left from their mother during the pregnancy, and that protection could make the vacc ine less effective .

Copyright \u00a9 American Academy of Pediatrics, October 2008 Questions and Answers about Vaccine Ingredients Q. What ingredients are in vaccines? A. All vaccines contain antigens. Antigens make vaccines work. They prompt the body to create the immune response needed to protect against infection. Antigens come in several f orms. The form used in a vaccine is chosen because studies show it is the best way to protect against a particular infection. Antigen forms include: Weakened live viruses. They are too weak to cause disease but can still prompt and immune response. Measles, mumps, rubella, rotavirus, chickenpox, and one type of influenza vaccines contain weakened live viruses. Inactivated (or killed) viruses. These viruses cannot cause even a mild form of the disease, but the body still recognizes the virus and creates and immune response to protect itself. In the United States, t he polio, hepatitis A, influenza and rabies vaccines contain inactivated v iruses. Partial viruses. These are made up of the specific part of the dead virus that will prompt a protective immune response. Some vaccines are made this way including the hepatitis B and HPV vaccines. Partial bacteria. These are made up of the specifi c part of the dead bacteria that will prompt a protective immune response. Some vaccines are made this way including the Hib, pneumococcal , meningococcal , diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccines. Vaccines also contain other ingredients , which help make them safer and more effective. They include: Preservatives . They keep the vials from getting contaminated with germs. Adjuvants. They help the body create a better immune response. These are aluminum salts . Additives. They help the vaccine stay effective while being stored. Additives include gelatin, albumin, sucrose, lactose, MSG, and glycine. Residuals of the vaccine production process. Some ingredients are needed to make the vaccine. Although these ingredients are removed, tiny (resi dual) amounts are left in the final product. Depending on how the vaccine is made, it may include tiny amounts of antibiotics (neomycin), egg protein, or yeast protein. Q. Are these other ingredients in vaccines safe? A. Yes. Q. Why are these other ingred ients in vaccines? A. Each ingredient has a specific function in a vaccine. These ingredients have been studied and are safe for humans in the amount used in vaccines. This amount is much less than children encounter in their environment, food and water. Aluminum salts. Aluminum salts help your body create a better immune response to vaccines. Aluminum salts are necessary to make some of the vaccines we use more effective. Without an adjuvant like aluminum, people could need more doses of shots to be protected. Everyone is exposed to aluminum because there is much aluminum in the earth's crust. It's present in our food, air and water, including breast milk and formula. The amount of aluminum in vaccines is similar to that found in 33 ounces of infant form ula. Aluminum has been used and studied in vaccines for 75 years and is safe. Formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is used to detoxify diphtheria and tetanus toxins or to inactivate a virus. The tiny amount which may be left in these vaccines is safe. Vaccines ar e not the only source of formaldehyde your baby is exposed to. Formaldehyde is also in products like paper towels, mascara and carpeting. Our bodies normally have formaldehyde in the blood stream and at levels higher than in vaccines . Antibiotics. Antibiot ics, such as neomycin, are present in some vaccines to prevent bacterial contamination when the vaccine is made. Trace amounts of antibiotics in vaccines rarely, if ever, cause allergic reactions. Egg protein. Influenza and yellow fever vaccines are produc ed in eggs, so egg proteins are present in the final product and can cause allergic reaction . Measles and mumps vaccines are made in chick embryo cells in culture, not in eggs. The much smaller amount of remaining egg proteins found in the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine does not usually cause a reaction in egg allergic children. Gelatin. Some vaccines contain gelatin to protect them against freeze-drying or heat. People with severe allergies to gelatin should avoid getting gelatin -containing vaccines . Q. Do vaccines contain antifreeze? A: No. Antifreeze is typically made of ethylene glycol, which is unsafe. Confusion has arisen, because p olyethylene glycol (a chemical used personal care products like skin creams and toothpaste) is used in vaccines an d is safe. It is used to inactivate the influenza virus in some influenza vaccines. It is also used to purify other vaccines. Q. Do vaccines contain mercury? A: Almost all childhood vaccines do NOT contain any mercury. Methylmercury, which is found in fis h and other animals (including humans) can be toxic and lead to adverse effects in humans. Thimerosal, a mercury -based preservative, was removed from most childhood vaccines in 2001. Thimerosal contains a different form of mercury called ethylmercury, whic h is processed by the body very differently than methylmercury, and is not associated with the same adverse effects . It is still present in some influenza vaccines. Thimerosal is still used in the manufacture of some vaccines to prevent contamination. The thimerosal is removed at the end of the manufacturing process. In some cases, a tiny amount of thimerosal remains. The remaining amount is so small, that it is not possible for it to have any effect. Valid scientific studies have shown there is no link bet ween thimerosal and autism. In fact, autism rates have actually increased since thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Medical Association (AMA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) agree that science does not support a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism. For the IOM report, go to http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3793/4705/4717.aspx . Q. Do vaccines contain fetal tissue? A. No. A few vaccines involve growing the viruses in human cell culture. Two cell lines provide the cultures needed for producing vaccines . These lines were developed from two fetuses in the 1960s . The fetuses were ab orted for medical reasons, not for the purpose of producing vaccines. These cell lines have an indefinite life span, meaning that no new aborted fetuses are ever used . No fetal tissue is included in the vaccines, either, so children are not injected with any part of an aborted fetus. Q. Should vaccines be \"greener\"? A. The amount of each additive used in vaccines is very small. In fact, we are exposed to much higher levels of these chemicals in our everyday lives. In vaccines, these ingredients are used t o make the vaccine safer and more effective. Each vaccine is tested many times to make sure it is safe and works. Taking ingredients out might affect the ability of the vaccine to protect a child. Research is always being done to make sure that the ingredi ents in vaccines continue to be the safest and best available for children.

Chicago Depar tment of Public Health Pediatric Providers Protocol for Manag ement of Infants, Children, and Adolescents Born to Hepatitis B Infected Mothers Illinois State Laws (Title 77 ILL. Adm. Code 690.451) ; the Illinois Department of Public Health, Control of Communicable Diseases : a) Infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive should receive hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (0.5 mL) within 12 hours of birth, both by intramuscular injection, but at different sites. b) Contacts to cases or c arriers of hepatitis B should be tested for \"susceptibility \" to hepatitis B virus. c) Non-immune contacts should begin hepatitis B vaccination. d) A person who is a contact to cases or carriers of hepatitis B should be given prophylaxis in accordance with the mo st recent Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule and most recent recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Management of Infants Born to Women who are HBsAg Positive : All infants born to HBsAg -positive women should receive single -antigen hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG (0.5ml) <12 hours of birth, administered at different injection sites. T he vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers (see table below). The final dose in the vaccination series should not be administered before 24 weeks (164 days). For preterm infants weighing <2,000 g, the initial vaccine dose (birth dose) should not be counted as part of the vaccine series because of the potential ly reduced immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine in the infants; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered beginning when the infant reaches age 1 month (see below). Postvaccination testing for anti -HBs and HBsAg should be performed after completion of the vaccine series, at age 9 -18 months (generally at the next well - child visit). Testing should not be performed before age nine months to avoid detection of anti -HBs from HBIG administered during infancy and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late HBV infection. Anti -HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal anti -HBc might be detected in infants born to HBV -infected mothers to age 24 months. 1. HBsAg -negative infants with anti -HBs l evels >10mlU/ml are protected and need no further medical management Chicago Depar tment of Public Health 2. HBsAg -negative infants with anti -HBs levels <10mlU/ml should be revaccinated with a second 3 -dose series and retested 1 -2 months after the final dose of vaccine. 3. Infants who are HBsAg -positive should receive appropriate follow -up (Appendix A). Infants of HBsAg -positive mothers may be breast fed beginning immediately after birth. Although not indicated in the manufacture's package labeling, HBsAg -positive containing combination vaccines may be used for infants age >6 weeks born to HBsAg -positive mothers to complete the vaccine series after receipt of a birth dose of single -antigen hepatitis b vaccine and HBIG. Management of Infants Born to Women of \"Unknown\" HBsAg Status : Women admitte d for delivery without documentation of HBsAg test results should have blood drawn and tested as soon as possible after admission While test results are pending, all infants born to women without documentation of HBsAg tests , should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine (without HBIG) <12 hours of birth (Tables 2 and 3) 1. If the mother is determined to be HBsAg -positive, her infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible but no later than age 7 days, and the vaccine series should be completed accordi ng to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers (Table 3) 2. If the mother is determined to be HBsAg -negative, the vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg -negative mothers (Table 3) 3. If the mother has never been tested to determine her HBsAg status, the vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers (Table 3). Administration of HBIG is not necessary for these infan ts. All infants born to HBsAg -positive women should receive single -antigen hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG (0.5ml) <12 hours of birth, administered at different injection sites. The vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers (see table below). The final dose in the vaccination series should not be administered before 24 weeks (164 days).

Manag ement of Pregnant Women who are HBsAg Positive All pregnant women should be tested routinely for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit (e.g., first trimester) in each pregnancy, even if they have been previously vaccinated or tested. Women who were not screened prenatally, those who engage in behaviors that put them at \"high risk \" for infection (e.g., injection drug use, having had more than one sex partner in the last six months, HBsAg -positive sex partner, evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease [STD], or recent or current history of injection -drug use) and those with clinical hepatitis should be tested at the time of admission to the hospital for delivery. Women who are HBsAg -positive should be referred to the Chicago Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Program to ensure that their infants receive timely post -exposure prophylaxis and follow -up. In addition, a copy of the original laboratory report indicating the pregnant women's HBsAg status should be provided to the hospital where delivery is planned and to the health -care provider who will care for the newborn. Women who are HBsAg -positive should be provided with or referred for appropriate counseling and medical management. HBsAg -positive pregnant women should receive information concerning hepatitis B that discusses: 1. Modes of transmission; 2. preinatal concerns (e.g., infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers may be breast fed); Chicago Department of Public Health 3. prevention of hepatitis B transmission to contacts, including the importance of post -exposure prophylaxis for the newborn infant and hepatitis B vaccination for household, sexual, and needle -sharing contacts; 4. substance abuse treatment, if appr opriate; and 5. medical evaluation and possible treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Women who are HBsAg -positive should be informed of the importance of their newborn receiving hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and single antigen hepatitis B vaccination withi n 12 hours of delivery, completing the three (3) dose series after hospital discharge, and receiving serologic screening to confirm immunity (Table 3) . Women who are HBsAg -positive should be advised that all household, sexual, or needle -sharing contacts s hould be tested for hepatitis B virus and vaccinated if susceptible.

Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person. Tetanus enters thebody through cuts or wounds. DIPHTHERIA causes a thick covering in the back of the throat. It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and even death. TETANUS (Lockjaw) causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to \"locking\" of the jaw so the victim cannot open his mouth or swallow. Tetanus leadsto death in up to 2 out of 10 cases. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough) causes coughing spells so bad that it is hard for infants to eat, drink,or breathe. These spells can last for weeks. It can lead to pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring spells), brain damage, and death. Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine (DTaP) can help prevent these diseases. Most children who are vaccinated with DTaP will beprotected throughout childhood. Many more childrenwould get these diseases if we stopped vaccinating. DTaP is a safer version of an older vaccine called DTP. DTP is no longer used in the United States. Children with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But children who are moderatelyor severely ill should usually wait until they recoverbefore getting DTaP vaccine. Any child who had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of DTaP should not getanother dose. Any child who suffered a brain or nervous system disease within 7 days after a dose of DTaP shouldnot get another dose. Talk with your doctor if your child: - had a seizure or collapsed after a dose of DTaP,- cried non-stop for 3 hours or more after a dose of DTaP, - had a fever over 105 oF after a dose of DTaP. Ask your health care provider for more information. Some of these children should not get another doseof pertussis vaccine, but may get a vaccine withoutpertussis, called DT. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP vaccine, one dose at each of the following ages: 33333 2 months 3 3 3 3 3 4 months 33333 6 months 3 3 3 3 3 15-18 months 3 3 3 3 3 4-6 years DTaP may be given at the same time as other vaccines.W H A T Y O U N E E D T O K N O W Some children should not get DTaP vaccine or shouldwait3 Who should get DTaPvaccine and when?21 Why get vaccinated? 4 Older children and adults DTaP is not licensed for adolescents, adults, orchildren 7 years of age and older. But older people still need protection. A vaccine called Tdap is similar to DTaP. A single dose of Tdap is recommended for people 11 through 64years of age. Another vaccine, called Td, protects against tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis. It isrecommended every 10 years. There are separateVaccine Information Statements for these vaccines. Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis 5/17/2007Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis.In the rare event that you or your child has a serious reaction to a vaccine, a federal program has been createdto help pay for the care of those who have been harmed. For details about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, call 1-800-338-2382 or visit the program's website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. Ask your health care provider. They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources ofinformation. Call your local or state health department's immunization program.

However, a vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergicreactions. The risk of DTaP vaccine causing seriousharm, or death, is extremely small. Mild Problems (Common) Fever (up to about 1 child in 4) Redness or swelling where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4) Soreness or tenderness where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4) These problems occur more often after the 4th and 5thdoses of the DTaP series than after earlier doses.Sometimes the 4th or 5th dose of DTaP vaccine isfollowed by swelling of the entire arm or leg in whichthe shot was given, lasting 1-7 days (up to about 1child in 30).Other mild problems include: Fussiness (up to about 1 child in 3) Tiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10) Vomiting (up to about 1 child in 50) These problems generally occur 1-3 days after the shot. Moderate Problems (Uncommon) Seizure (jerking or staring) (about 1 child out of 14,000) Non-stop crying, for 3 hours or more (up to about 1 child out of 1,000) High fever, over 105 oF (about 1 child out of 16,000) Severe Problems (Very Rare) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine. These include:- Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness- Permanent brain damage.These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are causedby the vaccine. Controlling fever is especially important for children who have had seizures, for any reason. It is alsoimportant if another family member has had seizures.You can reduce fever and pain by giving your child anaspirin-free pain reliever when the shot is given, and for the next 24 hours, following the packageinstructions.What should I look for? Any unusual conditions, such as a serious allergic reaction, high fever or unusual behavior. Serious allergic reactionsare extremely rare with any vaccine. If one were to occur,it would most likely be within a few minutes to a fewhours after the shot. Signs can include difficulty breathing,hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fastheart beat or dizziness. If a high fever or seizure were tooccur, it would usually be within a week after the shot. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form.

VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENT Hepatitis A Vaccine What You Need to Know Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis. Hojas de http://www.immunize.org/vis 1 What is hepatitis A? Hepatitis A is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus (HA V). HA V is found in the stool of people with hepatitis A. It is usually spread by close personal contact and some\u00ad times by eating food or drinking water containing HA V . A person who has hepatitis A can easily pass the disease to others within the same household. Hepatitis A can cause: \"fl u-like\" illness jaundice (yellow skin or eyes, dark urine) severe stomach pains and diarrhea (children) People with hepatitis A often have to be hospitalized (up to about 1 person in 5). Adults with hepatitis A are often too ill to work for up to a month. Sometimes, people die as a result of hepatitis A (about 3-6 deaths per 1,000 cases). Hepatitis A vaccine can prevent hepatitis A. 2 Who should get hepatitis A vaccine and when? WHO? Some people should be routinely vaccinated with hepatitis A vaccine: All children between their rst and second birthdays (12 through 23 months of age). Anyone 1 year of age and older traveling to or working in countries with high or intermediate prevalence of hepatitis A, such as those located in Central or South America, Mexico, Asia (except Japan), Africa, and eastern Europe. For more information see www.cdc.gov/travel. Children and adolescents 2 through 18 years of age who live in states or communities where routine vaccination has been implemented because of high disease incidence. Men who have sex with men. People who use street drugs. People with chronic liver disease. People who are treated with clotting factor concentrates. People who work with HA V-infected primates or who work with HA V in research laboratories. Members of households planning to adopt a child, or care for a newly arriving adopted child, from a country where hepatitis A is common. Other people might get hepatitis A vaccine in certain situations (ask your doctor for more details): Unvaccinated children or adolescents in communities where outbreaks of hepatitis A are occurring. Unvaccinated people who have been exposed to hepatitis A virus. Anyone 1 year of age or older who wants protection from hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccine is not licensed for children younger than 1 year of age. WHEN? For children , the rst dose should be given at 12 through 23 months of age. Children who are not vacci\u00ad nated by 2 years of age can be vaccinated at later visits. For others at risk, the hepatitis A vaccine series may be started whenever a person wishes to be protected or is at risk of infection. For travelers , it is best to start the vaccine series at least one month before traveling. (Some protection may still result if the vaccine is given on or closer to the travel date.) Some people who cannot get the vaccine before traveling, or for whom the vaccine might not be effective, can get a shot called immune globulin (IG). IG gives immediate, temporary protection. Two doses of the vaccine are needed for lasting protection. These doses should be given at least 6 months apart. Hepatitis A vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 3 Some people should not get hepatitis A vaccine or should wait. Anyone who has ever had a severe (life threatening) allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis A vaccine should not get another dose. Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any vaccine component should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies, including a severe allergy to latex. All hepatitis A vaccines contain alum, and some hepatitis A vaccines contain 2-phenoxyethanol. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should probably wait until they recover. Ask your doctor. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. Because hepatitis A vaccine is inactivated (killed), the risk to a pregnant woman or her unborn baby is believed to be very low. But your doctor can weigh any theoretical risk from the vaccine against the need for protection. 4 What are the risks fromhepatitis A vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of hepatitis A vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting hepatitis A vaccine is much safer than getting the disease. Mild problems soreness where the shot was given (about 1 out of 2 adults, and up to 1 out of 6 children) headache (about 1 out of 6 adults and 1 out of 25 children) loss of appetite (about 1 out of 12 children) tiredness (about 1 out of 14 adults) If these problems occur, they usually last 1 or 2 days. Severe problems serious allergic reaction, within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot (very rare). 5 What if there is a moderate orsevere reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or unusual behavior. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include dif culty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do?

It is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBVcan cause: Acute (short-term) illness. This can lead to: of appetite \u0081 diarrhea and vomiting\u0081 tiredness \u0081 jaundice (yellow skin or eyes)\u0081 pain in muscles, joints, and stomach Acute illness is more common among adults. Children who become infected usually do not haveacute illness. Chronic (long-term) infection . Some people go on to develop chronic HBV infection. This can be veryserious, and often leads to:\u0081liver damage (cirrhosis) \u0081liver cancer \u0081death Chronic infection is more common among infants and children than among adults. People who areinfected can spread HBV to others, even if they don'tappear sick. \u0081 In 2005, about 51,000 people became infected with hepatitis B. \u0081 About 1.25 million people in the United States have chronic HBV infection. \u0081 Each year about 3,000 to 5,000 people die from cirrhosis or liver cancer caused by HBV . Hepatitis B virus is spread through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. Aperson can become infected by: - contact with a mother's blood and body fluids at the time of birth; - contact with blood and body fluids through breaks in the skin such as bites, cuts, or sores; - contact with objects that could have blood or body fluids on them such as toothbrushes or razors; - having unprotected sex with an infected person; - sharing needles when injecting drugs;- being stuck with a used needle on the job.Children and Adolescents \u0081 All children should get their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and should have completed the vaccine series by 6-18 months of age. \u0081 Children and adolescents through 18 years of age who did not get the vaccine when they were younger should also be vaccinated. Adults \u0081 All unvaccinated adults at risk for HBV infection should be vaccinated. This includes: - sex partners of people infected with HBV ,- men who have sex with men,- people who inject street drugs,- people with more than one sex partner,- people with chronic liver or kidney disease,- people with jobs that expose them to human blood, - household contacts of people infected with HBV ,- residents and staff in institutions for the developmentally disabled, - kidney dialysis patients,Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, and the serious consequences of HBV infection, includingliver cancer and cirrhosis. Routine hepatitis B vaccination of U.S. children began in 1991. Since then, the reported incidence ofacute hepatitis B among children and adolescentshas dropped by more than 95% - and by 75% in allage groups. Hepatitis B vaccine is made from a part of the hepatitis B virus. It cannot cause HBV infection. Hepatitis B vaccine is usually given as a series of 3 or 4 shots . This vaccine series gives long-term protection from HBV infection, possibly lifelong. 2Hepatitis B vaccine: Why get vaccinated? 3Who should get hepatitis B vaccine and when?Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis.- people who travel to countries where hepatitis B is common, - people with HIV infection. \u0081 Anyone else who wants to be protected from HBV infection may be vaccinated. 4Who should NOT get hepatitis B vaccine? \u0081 Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to baker's yeast , or to any other component of the vaccine, should not get hepatitis B vaccine. T ell your provider if you have any severe allergies. \u0081 Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine should not get another dose. \u0081 Anyone who is moderately or severely ill when a dose of vaccine is scheduled should probably wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. Y our provider can give you more information about these precautions. Pregnant women who need protection from HBV infection may be vaccinated. 5Hepatitis B vaccine risks Hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine. Most people do not have any problems with it. The following mild problems have been reported: \u0081 Soreness where the shot was given (up to about 1 person in 4). \u0081 T emperature of 99.9\u00b0F or higher (up to about 1 person in 15). Severe problems are extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1million doses. A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious reaction. But the risk of a vaccine causing seriousharm, or death, is extremely small. More than 100million people have gotten hepatitis B vaccine in theUnited States. 6What if there is a moderate or severe reaction?8How can I learn more? \u0081 Ask your doctor or nurse.

See www.immunize.org/vis. Hojas de What is HPV? Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States. More than half of sexually active men and women are infected with HPV at some time in their lives. About 20 million Americans are currently infected, and about 6 million more get infected each year. HPV is usually spread through sexual contact. Most HPV infections don't cause any symptoms, and go away on their own. But HPV can cause cervical cancer in women. Cervical cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths among women around the world. In the United States, about 10,000 women get cervical cancer every year and about 4,000 are expected to die from it. HPV is also associated with several less common cancers, such as vaginal and vulvar cancers in women and other types of cancer in both men and women. It can also cause genital warts and warts in the throat. There is no cure for HPV infection, but some of the problems it causes can be treated. 2 HPV vaccine - Why get vaccinated? HPV vaccine is important because it can prevent most cases of cervical cancer in females, if it is given before a person is exposed to the virus. Protection from HPV vaccine is expected to be long-lasting. But vaccination is not a substitute for cervical cancer screening. Women should still get regular Pap tests. The vaccine you are getting is one of two vaccines that can be given to prevent HPV. It may be given to both males and females. In addition to preventing cervical cancer, it can also prevent vaginal and vulvar cancer in females, and genital warts and anal cancer in both males and females. The other vaccine is given to females only for prevention of cervical cancer. 3 Who should get this HPV vaccine and when? Females: Routine Vaccination HPV vaccine is recommended for girls 11 or 12 years of age. It may be given to girls starting at age 9. Why is HPV vaccine given to girls at this age? It is important for girls to get HPV vaccine before their rst sexual contact - because they won't have been exposed to human papillomavirus. Once a girl or woman has been infected with the virus, the vaccine might not work as well or might not work at all. Females: Catch-Up Vaccination The vaccine is also recommended for girls and women 13 through 26 years of age who did not get all 3 doses when they were younger. Males Males 9 through 26 years of age may get HPV vaccine. As with females, it is best to be vaccinated before the rst sexual contact. HPV vaccine is given as a 3-dose series 1st Dose Now 2nd Dose 1 to 2 months after Dose 1 3rd Dose 6 months after Dose 1 Additional (booster) doses are not recommended. HPV vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 4 Some people should not get HPV vaccine or should wait Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any component of HPV vaccine, or to a previous dose of HPV vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if the person getting vaccinated has any severe allergies, including an allergy to yeast. 5 What are the risks from this vaccine? HPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. However, receiving HPV vaccine when pregnant is not a reason to consider terminating the pregnancy. Women who are breast feeding may get the vaccine. Any woman who learns she was pregnant when she got this HPV vaccine is encouraged to contact the manufacturer's HPV in pregnancy registry at 800-986-8999. This will help us learn how pregnant women respond to the vaccine. People who are mildly ill when a dose of HPV vaccine is planned can still be vaccinated. People with a moderate or severe illness should wait until they are better. This HPV vaccine has been used in the U.S. and around the world for several years and has been very safe. However, any medicine could possibly cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction. The risk of any vaccine causing a serious injury, or death, is extremely small. Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it would be within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. Several mild to moderate problems are known to occur with HPV vaccine. These do not last long and go away on their own. Reactions in the arm where the shot was given: - Pain (about 8 people in 10) - Redness or swelling (about 1 person in 4) Fever: - Mild (100\u00b0 F) (about 1 person in 10) - Moderate (102\u00b0 F) (about 1 person in 65) Other problems: - Headache (about 1 person in 3) - Fainting. Brief fainting spells and related symptoms (such as jerking movements) can happen after any medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after a vaccination can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by falls. Tell your doctor if the patient feels dizzy or light-headed, or has vision changes or ringing in the ears. Like all vaccines, HPV vaccines will continue to be monitored for unusual or severe problems. 6 What if there is a severe reaction? What should I look for? Serious allergic reactions including rash; swelling of the hands and feet, face, or lips; and breathing dif culty. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell the doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form.

Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after a vaccination can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by falls. Tell your doctor if the patient feels dizzy or light-headed, or has vision changes or ringing in the ears. Like all vaccines, HPV vaccines will continue to be monitored for unusual or severe problems. Any woman who learns she was pregnant when she got this HPV vaccine is encouraged to contact the manufacturer's HPV in pregnancy registry at 888-452-9622. This will help us learn how pregnant women respond to the vaccine. People who are mildly ill when a dose of HPV vaccine is planned can still be vaccinated. People with a moderate or severe illness should wait until they are better.

Translation provided by the Immunization Action CoalitionINACTIVATED VACCINE Why get vaccinated?1 Infl uenza (\" fl u\") is a contagious disease. It is caused by the in fl uenza virus, which can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or nasal secretions. Anyone can get in fl uenza, but rates of infection are highest among children. For most people, symptoms last only a few days. They include: fever/chills sore throat muscle aches fatigue cough headache runny or stuffy nose Other illnesses can have the same symptoms and are often mistaken for in fl uenza. Young children, people 65 and older, pregnant women, and people with certain health conditions - such as heart, lung or kidney disease, or a weakened immune system - can get much sicker. Flu can cause high fever and pneumonia, and make existing medical conditions worse. It can cause diarrhea and seizures in children. Each year thousands of people die from in fl uenza and even more require hospitalization. By getting fl u vaccine you can protect yourself from infl uenza and may also avoid spreading in fl uenza to others. Who should get inactivated infl uenza vaccine and when? 3 There are two types of in fl uenza vaccine: 1. Inactivated (killed) vaccine, the \" fl u shot,\" is given by injection with a needle. 2. Live, attenuated (weakened) in fl uenza vaccine is sprayed into the nostrils. This vaccine is described in a separate Vaccine Information Statement. A \"high-dose\" inactivated in fl uenza vaccine is available for people 65 years of age and older. Ask your doctor for more information. Infl uenza viruses are always changing, so annual vaccination is recommended. Each year scientists try to match the viruses in the vaccine to those most likely to cause fl u that year. Flu vaccine will not prevent disease from other viruses, including fl u viruses not contained in the vaccine. It takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the shot. Protection lasts about a year. WHO All people 6 months of age and older should get fl u vaccine. Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of severe in fl uenza and their close contacts, including healthcare personnel and close contacts of children younger than 6 months. WHEN Get the vaccine as soon as it is available. This should provide protection if the fl u season comes early. You can get the vaccine as long as illness is occurring in your community. Infl uenza can occur at any time, but most in fl uenza occurs from October through May. In recent seasons, most infections have occurred in January and February. Getting vaccinated in December, or even later, will still be bene cial in most years. Adults and older children need one dose of in fl uenza vaccine each year. But some children younger than 9 years of age need two doses to be protected. Ask your doctor. Infl uenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, including pneumococcal vaccine.Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de Visite www.immunize.org/vis2011-12W H A T Y O U N E E D T O K N O W Inactivated in fl uenza vaccine 2Some Thimerosal-free in fl uenza vaccine is available. Ask your doctor for more information. Some people should not get inactivated in fl uenza vaccine or should wait4 Tell your doctor if you have any severe (life-threatening) allergies, including a severe allergy to eggs. A severe allergy to any vaccine component may be a reason not to get the vaccine. Allergic reactions to in fl uenza vaccine are rare. Tell your doctor if you ever had a severe reaction after a dose of in fl uenza vaccine. Tell your doctor if you ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS). Your doctor will help you decide whether the vaccine is recommended for you. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting fl u vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your doctor about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine.What if there is a severe reaction?6 What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include dif culty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell the doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form. Or you can le this report through the V AERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS does not provide medical advice. How can I learn more?8 Ask your doctor. They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. Call your local or state health department.

The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Serious problems from inactivated in fl uenza vaccine are very rare. The viruses in inactivated in fl uenza vaccine have been killed, so you cannot get in fl uenza from the vaccine. Mild problems: soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given hoarseness; sore, red or itchy eyes; cough fever aches headache itching fatigueIf these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1-2 days. Moderate problems: Young children who get inactivated fl u vaccine and pneu- mococcal vaccine (PCV13) at the same time appear to be at increased risk for seizures caused by fever. Ask your doctor for more information. Tell your doctor if a child who is getting fl u vaccine has ever had a seizure. Severe problems: Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. In 1976, a type of inactivated in fl uenza (swine fl u) vaccine was associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). Since then, fl u vaccines have not been clearly linked to GBS. However, if there is a risk of GBS from current fl u vaccines, it would be no more than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated. This is much lower than the risk of severe in fl uenza, which can be prevented by vaccination.The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program7 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was created in 1986. People who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about ling a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 , or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation . One brand of inactivated fl u vaccine, called A fl uria, should not be given to children 8 years of age or younger, except in special circumstances. A related vaccine was associated with fevers and fever-related seizures in young children in Australia. Your doctor can give you more information.The safety of vaccines is always being monitored.

See www.immunize.org/vis. Hojas de What is meningococcal disease? Meningococcal disease is a serious bacterial illness. It is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children 2 through 18 years old in the United States. Meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain and the spinal cord. Meningococcal disease also causes blood infections. About 1,000 - 1,200 people get meningococcal disease each year in the U.S. Even when they are treated with antibiotics, 10-15% of these people die. Of those who live, another 11%-19% lose their arms or legs, have problems with their nervous systems, become deaf or mentally retarded, or suffer seizures or strokes. Anyone can get meningococcal disease. But it is most common in infants less than one year of age and people 16-21 years. Children with certain medical conditions, such as lack of a spleen, have an increased risk of getting meningococcal disease. College freshmen living in dorms are also at increased risk. Meningococcal infections can be treated with drugs such as penicillin. Still, many people who get the disease die from it, and many others are affected for life. This is why preventing the disease through use of meningococcal vaccine is important for people at highest risk. 2 Meningococcal vaccine There are two kinds of meningococcal vaccine in the U.S.: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( MCV4) is the preferred vaccine for people 55 years of age and younger. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( MPSV4) has been available since the 1970s. It is the only meningo- coccal vaccine licensed for people older than 55. Both vaccines can prevent 4 types of meningococcal disease, including 2 of the 3 types most common in the United States and a type that causes epidemics in Africa. There are other types of meningococcal disease; the vaccines do not protect against these . Who should get meningococcalvaccine and when? 3 Routine Vaccination Two doses of MCV4 are recommended for adolescents 11 through 18 years of age: the rst dose at 11 or 12 years of age, with a booster dose at age 16. Adolescents in this age group with HIV infection should get three doses: 2 doses 2 months apart at 11 or 12 years, plus a booster at age 16. If the rst dose (or series) is given between 13 and 15 years of age, the booster should be given between 16 and 18. If the rst dose (or series) is given after the 16th birthday, a booster is not needed. Other People at Increased Risk College freshmen living in dormitories. Laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to meningococcal bacteria. U.S. military recruits. Anyone traveling to, or living in, a part of the world where meningococcal disease is common, such as parts of Africa. Anyone who has a damaged spleen, or whose spleen has been removed. Anyone who has persistent complement component deciency (an immune system disorder). People who might have been exposed to meningitis during an outbreak. Children between 9 and 23 months of age, and anyone else with certain medical conditions need 2 doses for adequate protection. Ask your doctor about the number and timing of doses, and the need for booster doses. MCV4 is the preferred vaccine for people in these groups who are 9 months through 55 years of age. MPSV4 can be used for adults older than 55. 4 Some people should not get meningococcal vaccine or should wait. Anyone who has ever had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a previous dose of MCV4 or MPSV4 vaccine should not get another dose of either vaccine. Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any vaccine component should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should probably wait until they recover. Ask your doctor. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. Meningococcal vaccines may be given to pregnant women. MCV4 is a fairly new vaccine and has not been studied in pregnant women as much as MPSV4 has. It should be used only if clearly needed. The manufacturers of MCV4 maintain pregnancy registries for women who are vaccinated while pregnant. Except for children with sickle cell disease or without a working spleen, meningococcal vaccines may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 5 What are the risks from meningococcal vaccines? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of meningococcal vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Brief fainting spells and related symptoms (such as jerking or seizure-like movements) can follow a vaccination. They happen most often with adolescents, and they can result in falls and injuries. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after getting the shot - especially if you feel faint - can help prevent these injuries. Mild problems As many as half the people who get meningococcal vaccines have mild side effects, such as redness or pain where the shot was given. If these problems occur, they usually last for 1 or 2 days. They are more common after MCV4 than after MPSV4. A small percentage of people who receive the vaccine develop a mild fever. Severe problems Serious allergic reactions, within a few minutes to a few hours of the shot, are very rare. 6 What if there is a moderate orsevere reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a severe allergic reaction or a high fever. If a severe allergic reaction occurred, it would be within a few minutes to an hour after the shot. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difculty breathing, weakness, hoarseness or wheezing, a fast heart beat, hives, dizziness, paleness, or swelling of the throat. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form. Or you can le this report through the V AERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967.

It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and rarely sterility. Rubella (German Measles) Rubella virus causes rash, arthritis (mostly in women), and mild fever. If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects. These diseases spread from person to person through the air. Y ou can easily catch them by being around someone who is already infected. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine can protect children (and adults) from all three of these diseases. Thanks to successful vaccination programs these diseases are much less common in the U.S. than they used to be. But if we stopped vaccinating they would return. 2 Who should get MMR vaccine and when? Children should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine: First Dose: 12-15 months of age Second Dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 28 days after the 1st dose) Some infants younger than 12 months should get a dose of MMR if they are traveling out of the country. (This dose will not count toward their routine series.) Some adults should also get MMR vaccine: Generally, anyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have either been vaccinated or had all three diseases. MMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Children between 1 and 12 years of age can get a \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV , which contains both MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines. There is a separate Vaccine Information Statement for MMRV . 3 Some people should not get MMR vaccine or should wait. Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMR or MMRV vaccine should not get another dose. Some people who are sick at the time the shot is scheduled may be advised to wait until they recover before getting MMR vaccine. Pregnant women should not get MMR vaccine. Pregnant women who need the vaccine should wait until after giving birth. Women should avoid getting pregnant for 4 weeks after vaccination with MMR vaccine. Tell your doctor if the person getting the vaccine: - Has HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the immune system - Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids - Has any kind of cancer - Is being treated for cancer with radiation or drugs- Has ever had a low platelet count (a blood disorder)- Has gotten another vaccine within the past 4 weeks- Has recently had a transfusion or received other blood products Any of these might be a reason to not get the vaccine, or delay vaccination until later. 4 What are the risks from MMR vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of MMR vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps or rubella. Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Mild problems Fever (up to 1 person out of 6) Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20) Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (about 1 person out of 75) If these problems occur, it is usually within 6-14 days after the shot. They occur less often after the second dose. Moderate problems Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses) Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4) Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses) Severe problems (very rare) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been reported after a child gets MMR vaccine, including: - Deafness - Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness- Permanent brain damage These are so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine. 5 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. 6 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. 7 How can I learn more?

These diseases can spread from person to person through the air. Varicella can also be spread through contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters. Before vaccines, these diseases were very common in the United States. MMRV Vaccine 2 MMRV vaccine may be given to children from 1 through 12 years of age to protect them from these four diseases. Two doses of MMRV vaccine are recommended: - The rst dose at 12 through 15 months of age - The second dose at 4 through 6 years of age These are recommended ages. But children can get the second dose up through 12 years as long as it is at least 3 months after the rst dose. Children may also get these vaccines as 2 separate shots: MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and varicella (MMRV) or 2 Shots (MMR & Varicella)? Both options give the same protection. One less shot with MMRV . Children who got the first dose as MMR V have had more fevers and fever-related seizures (about 1 in 1,250) than children who got the first dose as separate shots of MMR and varicella vaccines on the same day (about 1 in 2,500). Your health-care provider can give you more information, inclu ding the Vaccine Information Statements for MMR and Varicella vaccines. Anyone 13 or older who needs protection from these diseases should get MMR and varicella vaccines as separate shots. MMRV may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Some children should not get MMRV vaccine or should wait 3 Children should not get MMRV vaccine if they: Have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMRV vaccine, or to either MMR or varicella vaccine. Have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine, including gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. Tell the doctor if your child has any severe allergies. Have HIV/AIDS, or another disease that af fects the immune system. Are being treated with drugs that af fect the immune system, including high doses of oral steroids for 2 weeks or longer. Have any kind of cancer. Are being treated for cancer with radiation or drug s.

Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (rare). If these problems happen, it is usually within 5-12 days after the rst dose. They happen less often after the second dose. Moderate Problems Seizure caused by fever (about 1 child in 1,250 who get MMRV), usually 5-12 days after the rst dose. They happen less often when MMR and varicella vaccines are given at the same visit as separate shots (about 1 child in 2,500 who get these two vaccines), and rarely after a 2nd dose of MMRV . Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 child out of 40,000). Severe Problems (Very Rare) Several severe problems have been reported following MMR vaccine, and might also happen after MMRV .

See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de informaci\u00f3n vaccine (called PCV13 or Prevnar\u00ae 13) is recommended to protect infants and toddlers, and some older children and adults with certain health conditions, from pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal disease is caused by infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. These bacteria can spread from person to person through close contact. Pneumococcal disease can lead to severe health problems, including pneumonia, blood infections, and meningitis. Meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain. Pneumococcal meningitis is fairly rare (less than 1 case per 100,000 people each year), but it leads to other health problems, including deafness and brain damage. In children, it is fatal in about 1 case out of 10. Children younger than two are at higher risk for serious disease than older children. People with certain medical conditions, people over age 65, and cigarette smokers are also at higher risk. Before vaccine, pneumococcal infections caused many problems each year in the United States in children younger than 5, including: more than 700 cases of meningitis, 13,000 blood infections, about 5 million ear infections, and about 200 deaths. About 4,000 adults still die each year because of pneumococcal infections. Pneumococcal infections can be hard to treat because some strains are resistant to antibiotics. This makes prevention through vaccination even more important. 2 PCV13 vaccine There are more than 90 types of pneumococcal bacteria. PCV13 protects against 13 of them. These 13 strains cause most severe infections in children and about half of infections in adults. PCV13 is routinely given to children at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. Children in this age range are at greatest risk for serious diseases caused by pneumococcal infection. PCV13 vaccine may also be recommended for some older children or adults. Your doctor can give you details. A second type of pneumococcal vaccine, called PPSV23, may also be given to some children and adults, including anyone over age 65. There is a separate Vaccine Information Statement for this vaccine. 3 Precautions Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a dose of this vaccine, to an earlier pneumococcal vaccine called PCV7 (or Prevnar), or to any vaccine containing diphtheria toxoid (for example, DTaP), should not get PCV13. Anyone with a severe allergy to any component of PCV13 should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if the person being vaccinated has any severe allergies. If the person scheduled for vaccination is sick, your doctor might decide to reschedule the shot on another day. Your doctor can give you more information about any of these precautions. 4 What are the risks of PCV13 vaccine? With any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but serious reactions are also possible. Reported problems associated with PCV13 vary by dose and age, but generally: About half of children became drowsy after the shot, had a temporary loss of appetite, or had redness or tenderness where the shot was given. About 1 out of 3 had swelling where the shot was given. About 1 out of 3 had a mild fever, and about 1 in 20 had a higher fever (over 102.2\u00b0F). Up to about 8 out of 10 became fussy or irritable. Adults receiving the vaccine have reported redness, pain, and swelling where the shot was given. Mild fever, fatigue, headache, chills, or muscle pain have also been reported. Life-threatening allergic reactions from any vaccine are very rare. 5 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS).

Spanish VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENT Polio Vaccine What You Need to Know Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis. Hojas de http://www.immunize.org/vis 1 What is polio? Polio is a disease caused by a virus. It enters the body through the mouth. Usually it does not cause serious illness. But sometimes it causes paralysis (can't move arm or leg), and it can cause meningitis (irritation of the lining of the brain). It can kill people who get it, usually by paralyzing the muscles that help them breathe. Polio used to be very common in the United States. It paralyzed and killed thousands of people a year before we had a vaccine. 2 Why get vaccinated? Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) can prevent polio. History: A 1916 polio epidemic in the United States killed 6,000 people and paralyzed 27,000 more. In the early 1950's there were more than 25,000 cases of polio reported each year. Polio vaccination was begun in 1955. By 1960 the number of reported cases had dropped to about 3,000, and by 1979 there were only about 10. The success of polio vaccination in the U.S. and other countries has sparked a world-wide effort to eliminate polio. Today: Polio has been eliminated from the United States. But the disease is still common in some parts of the world. It would only take one person infected with polio virus coming from another country to bring the disease back here if we were not protected by vaccine. If the effort to eliminate the disease from the world is successful, some day we won't need polio vaccine. Until then, we need to keep getting our children vaccinated. Who should get polio vaccine3 and when? IPV is a shot, given in the leg or arm, depending on age. It may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Children Children get 4 doses of IPV , at these ages: A dose at 2 months A dose at 4 months A dose at 6-18 months A booster dose at 4-6 years Some \"combination\" vaccines (several different vaccines in the same shot) contain IPV . Children getting these vaccines may get one more (5th) dose of polio vaccine. This is not a problem. Adults Most adults 18 and older do not need polio vaccine because they were vaccinated as children. But some adults are at higher risk and should consider polio vaccination: (1) people traveling to areas of the world where polio is common, (2) laboratory workers who might handle polio virus, and (3) health care workers treating patients who could have polio. Adults in these three groups: who have never been vaccinated against polio should get 3 doses of IPV: -Two doses separated by 1 to 2 months, and -A third dose 6 to 12 months after the second. who have had 1 or 2 doses of polio vaccine in the past should get the remaining 1 or 2 doses. 4 It doesn't matter how long it has been since the earlier dose(s). who have had 3 or more doses of polio vaccine in the past may get a booster dose of IPV . Your doctor can give you more information. Some people should not get IPV or should wait. These people should not get IPV: Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to any component of IPV , including the antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B, should not get polio vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who had a severe allergic reaction to a previous polio shot should not get another one. These people should wait: Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting polio vaccine. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. Ask your doctor for more information. 5 What are the risks from IPV? Some people who get IPV get a sore spot where the shot was given. IPV has not been known to cause serious problems, and most people don't have any problems at all with it. However, any medicine could cause a serious side effect, such as a severe allergic reaction or even death. The risk of polio vaccine causing serious harm is extremely small. What if there is a moderate or severe problem? What should I look for? Look for any unusual condition, such as a serious allergic reaction, high fever, or unusual behavior. If a serious allergic reaction occurred, it would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. Signs of a serious allergic reac\u00adtion can include dif culty breathing, weakness, hoarseness or wheezing, a fast heart beat, hives, dizziness, paleness, or swelling of the throat. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form.

See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de 1 Why get vaccinated? Rotavirus is a virus that causes diarrhea, mostly in babies and young children. The diarrhea can be severe, and lead to dehydration. V omiting and fever are also common in babies with rotavirus. Before rotavirus vaccine, rotavirus disease was a common and serious health problem for children in the United States. Almost all children in the U.S. had at least one rotavirus infection before their 5 th birthday. Every year: more than 400,000 young children had to see a doctor for illness caused by rotavirus, more than 200,000 had to go to the emergency room, 55,000 to 70,000 had to be hospitalized, and 20 to 60 died. Rotavirus vaccine has been used since 2006 in the United States. Because children are protected by the vaccine, hospitalizations, and emergency visits for rotavirus have dropped dramatically. 2 Rotavirus vaccine Two brands of rotavirus vaccine are available. Your baby will get either 2 or 3 doses, depending on which vaccine is used. Doses of rotavirus vaccine are recommended at these ages: - First Dose: 2 months of age - Second Dose: 4 months of age - Third Dose: 6 months of age (if needed) Rotavirus vaccine is a liquid that is swallowed, not a shot. Rotavirus vaccine may safely be given at the same time as other vaccines. Rotavirus vaccine is very good at preventing diarrhea and vomiting caused by rotavirus. Almost all babies who get rotavirus vaccine will be protected from severe rotavirus diarrhea. And most of these babies will not get rotavirus diarrhea at all. The vaccine will not prevent diarrhea or vomiting caused by other germs.Another virus called porcine circovirus (or parts of it) can be found in both rotavirus vaccines. This is not a virus that infects people, and there is no known safety risk. For more information, see www.fda.gov/ BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ ucm205547.htm. 3 Some babies should not get this vaccine A baby who has had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a dose of rotavirus vaccine should not get another dose. A baby who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any component of rotavirus vaccine should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if your baby has any severe allergies that you know of, including a severe allergy to latex. Babies with \"severe combined immunodeficiency\" (SCID) should not get rotavirus vaccine. Babies who have had a type of bowel blockage called \"intussusception\" should not get rotavirus vaccine. Babies who are mildly ill can probably get the vaccine today. Babies who are moderately or severely ill should probably wait until they recover. This includes babies with moderate or severe diarrhea or vomiting. Check with your doctor if your baby's immune system is weakened because of: - HIV/AIDS, or any other disease that affects the immune system - treatment with drugs such as long-term steroids- cancer, or cancer treatment with x-rays or drugs 4 Risks of a vaccine reaction With a vaccine, like any medicine, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own. Serious side effects are also possible, but are very rare.Most babies who get rotavirus vaccine do not have any problems with it. But some problems have been associated with rotavirus vaccine: Mild problems Babies might become irritable, or have mild, temporary diarrhea or vomiting after getting a dose of rotavirus vaccine. Serious problems Intussusception is a type of bowel blockage that is treated in a hospital, and could require surgery. It happens \"naturally\" in some babies every year in the United States, and usually there is no known reason for it. There is also a small risk of intussusception from rotavirus vaccination, usually within a week after the 1 st or 2nd vaccine dose. This additional risk is estimated to range from about 1 in 20,000 U.S. infants to 1 in 100,000 U.S. infants who get rotavirus vaccine. Your doctor can give you more information. 5 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? For intussusception , look for signs of stomach pain along with severe crying. Early on, these episodes could last just a few minutes and come and go several times in an hour. Babies might pull their legs up to their chest. Your baby might also vomit several times or have blood in the stool, or could appear weak or very irritable. These signs would usually happen during the first week after the 1st or 2nd dose of rotavirus vaccine, but look for them any time after vaccination. Look for anything else that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.What should I do? If you think it is intussusception , call a doctor right away. If you can't reach your doctor, take your baby to a hospital. Tell them when your baby got the vaccine. If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get your baby to the nearest hospital. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the \"Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System\" (VAERS). Y our doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. 6 The National V accine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.

See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de informaci\u00f3n www.immunize.org/vis 1 Why get vaccinated? Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis can be very serious diseases, even for adolescents and adults. Tdap vaccine can protect us from these diseases. TETANUS (Lockjaw) causes painful muscle tightening and stiffness, usually all over the body. It can lead to tightening of muscles in the head and neck so you can't open your mouth, swallow, or sometimes even breathe. Tetanus kills about 1 out of 5 people who are infected. DIPHTHERIA can cause a thick coating to form in the back of the throat. It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and death. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough) causes severe coughing spells, which can cause difficulty breathing, vomiting and disturbed sleep. It can also lead to weight loss, incontinence, and rib fractures. Up to 2 in 100 adolescents and 5 in 100 adults with pertussis are hospitalized or have complications, which could include pneumonia or death. These diseases are caused by bacteria. Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. Tetanus enters the body through cuts, scratches, or wounds. Before vaccines, the United States saw as many as 200,000 cases a year of diphtheria and pertussis, and hundreds of cases of tetanus. Since vaccination began, tetanus and diphtheria have dropped by about 99% and pertussis by about 80%.2 Tdap vaccine Tdap vaccine can protect adolescents and adults from tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. One dose of Tdap is routinely given at age 11 or 12. People who did not get Tdap at that age should get it as soon as possible. Tdap is especially important for health care professionals and anyone having close contact with a baby younger than 12 months. Pregnant women should get a dose of Tdap during every pregnancy, to protect the newborn from pertussis. Infants are most at risk for severe, life-threatening complications from pertussis. A similar vaccine, called Td, protects from tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis. A Td booster should be given every 10 years. Tdap may be given as one of these boosters if you have not already gotten a dose. Tdap may also be given after a severe cut or burn to prevent tetanus infection. Your doctor can give you more information.Tdap may safely be given at the same time as other vaccines. 3 Some people should not get this vaccine If you ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of any tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis containing vaccine, OR if you have a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, you should not get Tdap. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. If you had a coma, or long or multiple seizures within 7 days after a childhood dose of DTP or DTaP, you should not get Tdap, unless a cause other than the vaccine was found. You can still get Td. Talk to your doctor if you:- have epilepsy or another nervous system problem,- had severe pain or swelling after any vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis, - ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS),- aren't feeling well on the day the shot is scheduled.4 Risks of a vaccine reaction With any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but serious reactions are also possible. Brief fainting spells can follow a vaccination, leading to injuries from falling. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent these. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy or light-headed, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. Mild problems following Tdap (Did not interfere with activities) Pain where the shot was given (about 3 in 4 adolescents or 2 in 3 adults) Redness or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 person in 5) Mild fever of at least 100.4\u00b0F (up to about 1 in 25 adolescents or 1 in 100 adults) Headache (about 3 or 4 people in 10) Tiredness (about 1 person in 3 or 4) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 1 in 4 adolescents or 1 in 10 adults) Chills, body aches, sore joints, rash, swollen glands (uncommon) Moderate problems following Tdap (Interfered with activities, but did not require medical attention) Pain where the shot was given (about 1 in 5 adolescents or 1 in 100 adults) Redness or swelling where the shot was given (up to about 1 in 16 adolescents or 1 in 25 adults) Fever over 102\u00b0F (about 1 in 100 adolescents or 1 in 250 adults) Headache (about 3 in 20 adolescents or 1 in 10 adults) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 1 or 3 people in 100) Swelling of the entire arm where the shot was given (up to about 3 in 100). Severe problems following Tdap (Unable to perform usual activities; required medical attention) Swelling, severe pain, bleeding and redness in the arm where the shot was given (rare). A severe allergic reaction could occur after any vaccine (estimated less than 1 in a million doses). 5 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.

See www.immunize.org/vis. 1Why get vaccinated? Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common childhood disease. It is usually mild, but it can be serious, especially in young infants and adults. It causes a rash, itching, fever, and tiredness. It can lead to severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage, or death. The chickenpox virus can be spread from person to person through the air, or by contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters. A person who has had chickenpox can get a painful rash called shingles years later. Before the vaccine, about 11,000 people were hospitalized for chickenpox each year in the United States. Before the vaccine, about 100 people died each year as a result of chickenpox in the United States. Chickenpox vaccine can prevent chickenpox. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine will not get chickenpox. But if someone who has been vaccinated does get chickenpox, it is usually very mild. They will have fewer blisters, are less likely to have a fever, and will recover faster. 2Who should get chickenpox vaccine and when? Routine Children who have never had chickenpox should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at these ages: 1st Dose: 12-15 months of age 2nd Dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 3 months after the 1st dose) People 13 years of age and older (who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine) should get two doses at least 28 days apart. Catch-Up Anyone who is not fully vaccinated, and never had chickenpox, should receive one or two doses of chickenpox vaccine. The timing of these doses depends on the person's age. Ask your provider. Chickenpox vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Note: A \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV, which contains both chickenpox and MMR vac\u00ad cines, may be given instead of the two individual vaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. Some people should not get chickenpox vaccine or should wait 3 People should not get chickenpox vaccine if they have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of chickenpox vaccine or to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting chickenpox vaccine. Pregnant women should wait to get chickenpox vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should not get pregnant for 1 month after getting chickenpox vaccine. Some people should check with their doctor about whether they should get chickenpox vaccine, including anyone who: -Has HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system -Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or longer -Has any kind of cancer -Is getting cancer treatment with radiation or drugs People who recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get chickenpox vaccine. Ask your provider for more information. Chickenpox 3/13/08 4 What are the risks from chickenpox vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of chickenpox vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than getting chickenpox disease. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it. Reactions are usually more likely after the first dose than after the second. Mild Problems Soreness or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 out of 5 children and up to 1 out of 3 adolescents and adults) Fever (1 person out of 10, or less) Mild rash, up to a month after vaccination (1 person out of 25). It is possible for these people to infect other members of their household, but this is extremely rare. Moderate Problems Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (very rare). Severe Problems Pneumonia (very rare) Other serious problems, including severe brain reac\u00adtions and low blood count, have been reported after chickenpox vaccination. These happen so rarely experts cannot tell whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. If they are, it is extremely rare. Note: The first dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and higher rates of fever than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately. Rash has been reported in about 1 person in 20 and fever in about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also reported more often after MMR V . These usually occur 5-12 days after the first dose. 5What if there is a moderate or severe reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever, weakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program 6 A federal program has been created to help people who may have been harmed by a vaccine.

See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de Informaci\u00f3 Your baby will get these today: DTaP Polio Hib Rotavirus Hepatitis B PCV13 (Provider: Check appropriate boxes.) Ask your doctor about \"combination vaccines, \" which can reduce the number of shots your baby needs. Combination vaccines are as safe and effective as these vaccines when given separately. These vaccines protect your baby from 8 serious diseases: diphtheria tetanus pertussis (whooping cough) Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) hepatitis B polio rotavirus pneumococcal disease About this vaccine information statement Please read this Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) before your baby gets his or her immunizations, and take it home with you afterward. Ask your doctor if you have any questions. This VIS tells you about the benefits and risks of six routine childhood vaccines. It also contains information about reporting an adverse reaction and about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and how to get more information about vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases. (Individual VISs are also available for these vaccines.) How vaccines work Immunity from disease: When children get sick with an infectious disease, their immune system usually produces protective \"antibodies, \" which keep them from getting the same disease again. But getting sick is no fun, and it can be dangerous or even fatal. Immunity from vaccines: Vaccines are made with the same bacteria or viruses that cause disease, but they have been weakened or killed\u2014or only parts of them are used\u2014to make them safe. A child's immune system produces antibodies, just as it would after exposure to the actual disease. This means the child will develop immunity in the same way, but without having to get sick first.Vaccine benefits: why get vaccinated? Diseases have injured and killed many children over the years in the United States. Polio paralyzed about 37,000 and killed about 1,700 every year in the 1950s. Hib disease was once the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children under 5 years of age. About 15,000 people died each year from diphtheria before there was a vaccine. Up to 70,000 children a year were hospitalized because of rotavirus disease. Hepatitis B can cause liver damage and cancer in 1 child out of 4 who are infected, and tetanus kills 1 out of every 5 who get it. Thanks mostly to vaccines, these diseases are not nearly as common as they used to be. But they have not disappeared, either. Some are common in other countries, and if we stop vaccinating they will come back here. This has already happened in some parts of the world. When vaccination rates go down, disease rates go up. Childhood vaccines can prevent these 8 Diseases 1. DIPHTHERIA Signs and symptoms include a thick covering in the back of the throat that can make it hard to breathe. Diphtheria can lead to breathing problems, and heart failure. 2. TETANUS (Lockjaw) Signs and symptoms include painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. Tetanus can lead to stiffness of the jaw so victims can't open their mouth or swallow. 3. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough) Signs and symptoms include violent coughing spells that can make it hard for a baby to eat, drink, or breathe. These spells can last for weeks. Pertussis can lead to pneumonia, seizures, and brain damage. 4. HIB (Haemophilus influenzae type b) Signs and symptoms can include trouble breathing. There may not be any signs or symptoms in mild cases. Hib can lead to meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord coverings); pneumonia; infections of the blood, joints, bones, and covering of the heart; brain damage; and deafness. 5. HEPATITIS B Signs and symptoms can include tiredness, diarrhea and vomiting, jaundice (yellow skin or eyes), and pain in muscles, joints and stomach. But usually there are no signs or symptoms at all. Hepatitis B can lead to liver damage, and liver cancer. 6. POLIO Signs and symptoms can include flu-like illness, or there may be no signs or symptoms at all. Polio can lead to paralysis (can't move an arm or leg). 7. PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE Signs and symptoms include fever, chills, cough, and chest pain. Pneumococcal disease can lead to meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord coverings), blood infections, ear infections, pneumonia, deafness, and brain damage. 8. ROTAVIRUS Signs and symptoms include watery diarrhea (sometimes severe), vomiting, fever, and stomach pain. Rotavirus can lead to dehydration and hospitalization. Any of these diseases can lead to death. How do babies catch these diseases? Usually from contact with other children or adults who are already infected, sometimes without even knowing they are infected. A mother with Hepatitis B infection can also infect her baby at birth. Tetanus enters the body through a cut or wound; it is not spread from person to person.Routine baby vaccines Vaccine Number of dosesRecommended ages Other information DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis)5 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15-18 months, 4-6 yearsSome children should not get pertussis vaccine. These children can get a vaccine called DT. Hepatitis B 3 Birth, 1-2 months, 6-18 monthsChildren may get an additional dose at 4 months with some \"combination\" vaccines. Polio 4 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, 4-6 years Hib ( Haemophilus influenzae type b)3 or 4 2 months, 4 months, (6 months), 12-15 months There are 2 types of Hib vaccine. With one type the 6-month dose is not needed. PCV13 (pneumococcal)4 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12-15 months Older children with certain chronic diseases may also need this vaccine. Rotavirus 2 or 3 2 months, 4 months, (6 months)Not a shot, but drops that are swallowed. There are 2 types of rotavirus vaccine. With one type the 6-month dose is not needed. Annual flu vaccination is also recommended for children 6 months of age and older. Precautions Most babies can safely get all of these vaccines. But some babies should not get certain vaccines. Y our doctor will help you decide. A child who has ever had a serious reaction, such as a life-threatening allergic reaction, after a vaccine dose should not get another dose of that vaccine. Tell your doctor if your child has any severe allergies, or has had a severe reaction after a prior vaccination . (Serious reactions to vaccines and severe allergies are rare.) A child who is sick on the day vaccinations are scheduled might be asked to come back for them. Talk to your doctor... before getting DTaP vaccine, if your child ever had any of these reactions after a dose of DTaP: - A brain or nervous system disease within 7 days,- Non-stop crying for 3 hours or more,- A seizure or collapse,- A fever of over 105\u00b0F. before getting Polio vaccine , if your child has a life-threatening allergy to the antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B. before getting Hepatitis B vaccine, if your child has a life-threatening allergy to yeast. before getting Rotavirus Vaccine, if your child has: - SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency),- A weakened immune system for any other reason,- Digestive problems,- Recently gotten a blood transfusion or other blood product,- Ever had intussusception (bowel obstruction that is treated in a hospital). before getting PCV13 or DTaP vaccine, if your child ever had a severe reaction after any vaccine containing diphtheria toxoid (such as DTaP).Risks Vaccines can cause side effects, like any medicine. Most vaccine reactions are mild: tenderness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given; or a mild fever. These happen to about 1 child in 4. They appear soon after the shot is given and go away within a day or two. Other reactions: Individual childhood vaccines have been associated with other mild problems, or with moderate or serious problems: DTaP vaccine Mild problems: Fussiness (up to 1 child in 3); tiredness or poor appetite (up to 1 child in 10); vomiting (up to 1 child in 50); swelling of the entire arm or leg for 1-7 days (up to 1 child in 30)\u2014usually after the 4th or 5th dose. Moderate problems: Seizure (1 child in 14,000); non-stop crying for 3 hours or longer (up to 1 child in 1,000); fever over 105\u00b0F (1 child in 16,000). Serious problems: Long term seizures, coma, lowered consciousness, and permanent brain damage have been reported. These problems happen so rarely that it is hard to tell whether they were actually caused by the vaccination or just happened afterward by chance.Polio vaccine / Hepatitis B vaccine / Hib vaccine These vaccines have not been associated with other mild problems, or with moderate or serious problems. Pneumococcal vaccine Mild problems: During studies of the vaccine, some children became fussy or drowsy or lost their appetite. Rotavirus vaccine Mild problems: Children who get rotavirus vaccine are slightly more likely than other children to be irritable or to have mild, temporary diarrhea or vomiting. This happens within the first week after getting a dose of the vaccine. Serious problems: Studies in Australia and Mexico have shown a small increase in cases of intussusception within a week after the first dose of rotavirus vaccine. So far, this increase has not been seen in the United States, but it can't be ruled out. If the same risk were to exist here, we would expect to see 1 to 3 infants out of 100,000 develop intussusception within a week after the first dose of vaccine. What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Y our doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice.The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.

What should I do? Check your child's temperature to find out if there is a fever. An easy way to do this is by taking a temperature in the armpit using an electronic ther - mometer (or by using the method of temperature-taking your healthcare provider recommends). If your child has a temperature that your healthcare provider has told you to be concerned about or if you have questions, call your healthcare provider. Here are some things you can do to help reduce fever: n Give your child plenty to drink. n Dress your child lightly. Do not cover or wrap your child tightly. n Give your child a fever- or pain-reducing medicine such as acetamino - phen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin). The dose you give your child should be based on your child's weight and your heathcare provider's instructions. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. Recheck your child's temperature after 1 hour. Call your healthcare provider if you have questions. My child has been fussy since getting vaccinated. What should I do? After vaccination, children may be fussy because of pain or fever. To reduce discomfort, you may want to give your child a medicine such as acetami n- ophen or ibuprofen. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. If your child is fussy for more than 24 hours, call your healthcare provider. My child's leg or arm is swollen, hot, and red. What should I do? n Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the sore area for comfort. n For pain, give a medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. n If the redness or tenderness increases after 24 hours, call your healthcare provider. My child seems really sick. Should I call my healthcare provider? If you are worried at all about how your child looks or feels, call your health - care provider! healthcare provider: please fill in the information below. If your child's temperature is \u00b0F or \u00b0C or higher, or if you have questions, call your healthcare provider.

Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist which medicine is best for your child. 2. Give the dose based on your child's weight. If you don't know your child's weight, give the dose based on your child's age. Do not give more medicine than is recommended. 3. If you have questions about dosage amounts or any other concerns, call your healthcare provider. 4. Always use a proper measuring device. For example: When giving acetaminophen liquid (e.g., Tylenol), use the device enclosed in the package. If you misplace the device, consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice. Kitchen spoons are not accurate measures. When giving ibuprofen liquid (e.g., Advil, Motrin), use the device enclosed in the package. Never use a kitchen spoon! Take these two steps to avoid causing a serious medication overdose in your child. 1. Don't give your child a larger amount of acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin, Advil) than is shown in the table below. Too much of any of these medicines can cause an overdose. 2. When you give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen, don't also give them over-the-counter (OTC) cough or cold medicines. This can also cause a medication overdose because cough and cold medicines often con - tain acetaminophen or ibuprofen. In fact, to be safe, don't give OTC cough and cold medicines to your child unless you talk to your child's healthcare provider first.Medicines and Dosages to Reduce Pain and Fever Acetaminophen (Tylenol or another brand): How much to give? Give every 4 to 6 hours, as needed, no more than 5 times in 24 hours (unless directed to do otherwise by your healthcare provider). Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or another brand): How much to give? Give every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, no more than 4 times in 24 hours (unless directed to do otherwise by your healthcare provider).

In an attempt to reduce the confu - sion over different strengths that have been blamed for past overdoses, some manufacturers are voluntarily offer - ing only the less concentrated version for all children. Until now, liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants has only been available in a stronger concentration that doesn't require giving the infants as much liquid with each dose. But right now both concentrations of liquid acetaminophen are in cir - culation. Before giving the medica - tion, parents and caregivers need to know whether they have the less con - centrated version or the older, more concentrated medication. FDA is con - cerned that infants could be given too much or too little of the medicine if the different concentrations of acet - aminophen are confused. \"Be very careful when you're giving your infant acetaminophen\" says Carol Holquist, director of FDA's Division of Medical Error Prevention and Analysis. Here's what the agency wants par - ents and caregivers to do: Read the Drug Facts label on the package very carefully to identify the concentration of the liquid acetaminophen, the correct dosage, and the directions for use. Do not depend on a banner proclaiming that the product is \"new.\" Some medicines with the old concentration also have this headline on their packaging. Use only the dosing device provided with the purchased product in order to correctly measure the right amount of liquid acetaminophen. Consult your pediatrician before giving this medication and make sure you're both talking about the same concentration. Overdosing Has Been a Risk An April 2011 report from FDA's Cen - ter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) found that confusion caused by the different concentrations of liq - uid acetaminophen for infants and children was leading to overdoses that made infants seriously ill, with some dying from liver failure. So to avoid dosing errors, some manufacturers voluntarily changed the liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants from 80 mg per 0.8mL or 80 mg per 1 mL to be the same con - centration as the liquid acetamino - phen marketed for children\u2014160 mg per 5mL. This less concentrated liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants now has new dosing directions and 2 / FDA Consumer Health Information / U.S. Food and Drug Administration DECEMBER 2 011 Consumer Health Information www.fda.gov/consumer Find this and other Consumer Updates at www.fda.gov/ ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates Sign up for free e-mail subscriptions at www.fda.gov/ consumer/consumerenews.htmlmay have a new dosing device in the box, such as an oral syringe. But this is a voluntary change and some of the older, stronger concen - trations of acetaminophen marketed for infants are still available and may remain available. \"There is still some on store shelves; there is still some in homes; and there is still some in distribution,\" says Holquist. Why does this pose a danger? If a pediatrician prescribes a 5 mL dose of the less concentrated liq - uid acetaminophen, but the parents administer a 5 mL dose of the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen, the child can receive a potentially fatal overdose during the course of therapy, Holquist explains. Conversely, if a physician pre - scribes a dose based on the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen and the less concentrated medication is used, the child might not receive enough medication to fight a fever, she says. FDA has issued a Drug Safety Communication ( www.fda.gov/Drugs/ DrugSafety/ucm284741.htm ) with more information for consumers about how to avoid confusion and potential dosing errors with the different con - centrations of liquid acetaminophen. What Should You Do? Adding to the confusion is the fact that that the box and the bottle may look much the same for both old and new versions of the medication, Holquist says. Read the Drug Facts label to tell the difference between the two liquid acetaminophen products: Look for the \"Active ingredient\" section of the Drug Facts label usually printed on the back of an over-the-counter medication package. If the package says \"160 mg per 5 mL\" or \"160 mg (in each 5 mL)\", then this is the less concentrated liquid acetaminophen. This medication should come with an oral syringe to help you measure the dose. If the package says \"80 mg per 0.8 mL\" or \"80 mg per 1 mL,\" then this is the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen. This product may come with a dropper. If the dosing instructions provided by your healthcare provider differ from what is on the label, check with a healthcare professional before admin - istering the medication. Do not rely on dosing information provided from other sources such as the Internet, old dosing charts, or family members.It is important to understand that there is no dosing amount specified for children younger than 2 years of age. If you have an infant or child younger than 2 years old, always check with your healthcare provider for dosing instructions. Acetaminophen is marketed for infants under brand names such as Little Fevers Infant Fever/Pain Reliever, Pedia Care Fever Reducer Pain Reliever and Triaminic Infants' Syrup Fever Reducer Pain Reliever. There are also store brands on the shelves. \"Be very careful when you're giving your infant acetaminophen.\" Despu\u00e9s de las vacunas... la Si hijo tiene temperatura su profesional o envuelva manera n Dele a su el ni\u00f1o su No casillero abajo).

Aire, La Do you need it? If you haven 't been vaccinated and haven 't had chickenpox, you need 2 doses of this vaccine. Anybody who was vaccinated with only 1 dose should get a second dose. You need 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine if you would like to be protected from this disease or if you have a risk factor for hepatitis A. Check with your healthcare provider to find out if you need this vaccine. This vaccine is recommended for all people age 0-18 years. You need a series of doses of hepatitis B vaccine if you have not already received them. All preteens and teens age 11 and older need 3 doses of HPV vaccine. The vaccine protects against HPV, the most common cause of cervical cancer. It also protects against some other types of cancers, such as cancer of the anus and penis. Everyone age 6 months and older needs influenza vaccination every fall or winter and for the rest of their lives. You need 2 doses of MMR vaccine if you have not already received them. MMR vaccine is usually given in childhood. All preteens and teens age 11-18 years need 2 doses of MCV4. If you are a first-year college student living in a residence hall, you need a dose of MCV4 if you have never received it or received it when you were younger than 16. Check with your healthcare provider. Do you have a chronic health problem? If so, check with your healthcare provider to find out if you need the pneumococcal vaccine. You need a series of at least 3 doses of polio vaccine if you have not already received them. Polio vaccine is usually given in childhood. All preteens and teens (and adults!) need a dose of Tdap vaccine, a vaccine that protects you from tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough (pertussis). After getting a dose of Tdap, you will need a tetanus-diphtheria ( Td) shot every ten years. If you become pregnant, however, you will need another dose of Tdap during the pregnancy, preferably during the third trimester. If you will be traveling outside the United States, additional vaccines may be needed.

As a new parent (or parent-to-be), it's hard not to hear the great debate in parenting circles these days\u2014do vaccines cause autism? If not, what causes autism and why is it on the rise? Let's start at the beginning\u2014just what is autism? Q: What is autism? Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is really a collection of several disorders that have three abnormal areas in common: social skills, communication skills, and repetitive or obsessive traits. Specialists use the terms ASD and Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) interchangeably. To add even more confusion, Pervasive Devel - opmental Disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and As - perger's Syndrome also are other categories that fall under the ASD umbrella. There is a very broad range of severity within ASD. A child may have normal intelligence and language, but be socially awkward and have panic attacks if his sandwich is cut in triangles instead of squares. Or a child may appear out of touch with reality and spend his entire day rocking and flapping his hands. Both children have ASD. As you might suspect, children with severe problems as in classic autism are diagnosed much earlier than kids who can com - municate but have trouble with social skills, as in Asperger's Syn - drome. Children are usually diagnosed by 18-24 months of age when lan - guage delays are obvious. Many children with Asperger's Syndrome may not be diagnosed until preschool (or sometimes even later). However, clues to the diagnosis appear long before that time. Some early clues include: not smiling back at people, poor eye contact, not imitating, not gesturing (waving bye-bye), not responding to being called by name, and not trying to communicate/connect/engage with other people by 1 year of age. There also are some unusual behaviors. Cuddling may not be sooth - ing. In fact, an autistic child may get very upset by being touched. Bright lights and noises often bother them. Because they are bugged by the outside world, they may turn inward and find comfort in re - petitive behaviors (rocking, head banging, spinning). Autistic chil -dren may have little interest in playing with toys. Or they may play in an odd way\u2014 such as using a phone as a comfort object. Bottom line: Children with autism have autism long before their first birthdays, even though their \"official\" diagnosis usually occurs in their second year of life. Q: I have a friend whose child has autism. She said he was \"perfectly normal\" until he was about 18 months old. Does this happen? A small minority of ASD children have completely normal mile - stones and then regress, which is known as \"late onset autism.\" These children most likely have a distinct genetic abnormality that turns on or off without any trigger. However, for most kids with ASD, parents and doctors just miss (or dismiss) the early signs in the first year of life and the child's atypi - cal development only becomes apparent at 18 months. Doctors rely heavily on parents to point out concerns. And parents (especially first-timers) don't know what is normal and what isn't. The mother of one of my ASD patients told me that she only real - ized how unusual her son's development was after she watched her second child, without ASD, breeze through her milestones. Even the most vocal ASD mom of all, Jenny McCarthy, agrees. Her son was 5 months old when he first smiled at her (that's abnormal), when all of her friends' babies smiled at 2 months of age (that's normal). Some parents report that their ASD child spoke a few words and then \"lost\" the ability to say them. If you delve a bit deeper, the child may have randomly said a few things, but was not consistently using words like \"juice\" or \"no\" to communicate his needs. There is growing research in language development that looks at brain anatomy. Primitive brain parts control early language develop - ment from birth to 18 months. At 18 to 24 months, the mature brain parts turn on and language takes off. With autistic children, mature language does not take off. But from a parent's perspective, it may look like a loss of skills.

In private practice since 1995, Dr. Brown is perhaps best known as the coauthor of the 411 parenting book series \u2014 Expecting 411: Clear Answers and Smart Advice for Your Pregnancy, Baby 411, and Toddler 411 (Windsor Peak Press). In response to the recent media attention given to vaccines, autism, and other controversies concerning vaccines, the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) has reprinted a special excerpt from Baby 411 that answers these questions and more. IAC thanks Dr. Brown for this clearly written information, but mostly, we are grateful for her continued advocacy for safe and effective vaccines . Immunization Action Coalition 1573 Selby Ave. St. Paul, #P2068 (9/13) Environmental triggers: Is there some environmental exposure that sets off abnormal brain development in a genetically predisposed baby? Maybe. And that exposure may happen at or shortly after conception, before a mother even knows she is pregnant. The embryo has a critical period of brain development at 20-24 days after conception. That is when the developing brain is most sensitive to injury. Studies done by the Environmental Working Group have detected over 280 environmental toxins in umbilical cord blood, so clearly pregnant moms are exposed to a variety of toxins. Could one of these be the autism trigger? We don't know. Viral infections during pregnancy also may be a key environmental trigger that causes abnormal genes in the fetus. Those infections include rubella, CMV (cytomegalovirus), and influenza (yes, \"the flu\").5 What about vaccines as an environmental trigger? Researchers and scientists have taken a long, hard look at vaccines\u2014and there is conclusive evidence that vaccine exposure is NOT the turn-on switch for autism.6 Bottom line: There's evidence that newborns who are later diagnosed with ASD already have abnormal levels of certain proteins in their brains. So, whatever the trigger is (if there is one), it has been fired before the baby even enters the world. Prematurity: A developing brain is quite vulnerable. Premature, very low birth-weight babies (under three pounds) have a 25 percent chance of developing an autism spectrum disorder.7 Older parents: Another possible reason for the increase of autism: the trend of parents having babies at a later age. Moms who conceive after the age of 40 have a 30 percent increased risk of having a child with autism. Dads who conceive after the age of 40 have a 50 percent increased risk of having an autistic child.8 Scientists speculate that an older dad's sperm may have defective genetic material, possibly altered by environmental toxins. Closely spaced pregnancies: A 2011 study compared children who were conceived at least three years after their sibling was born to closer-spaced pregnancies and found that babies conceived less than 12 months after the birth of the first-born child were THREE times more likely to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Babies conceived from 12 to 23 months after the birth of the first-born child had almost two times the risk of ASD. And, even babies conceived 23 to 35 months after the first- born child had a slightly greater risk of ASD. Unfortunately, the researchers have no idea why the odds are greater when the spacing between pregnancies is shorter. Perhaps it's because a woman's nutritional stores have not had enough time to be replenished. Or maybe women who have put off parenthood until later in life have more closely spaced babies\u2014 and parental age itself is a risk factor for having a child with an ASD. This study alone should not necessarily influence your decision on how long to wait between pregnancies. However, the current recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is to wait at least 18 to 23 months between pregnancies for a mother's and baby's optimal health.9 And again, children with subtle atypical behaviors may be harder to diagnose early on. Reviewing home movies of a child once the diagnosis is made often shows that early signs are overlooked.1 Q: OK, so what causes autism? The million-dollar question. In the 1980s, one in 10,000 kids was diagnosed with autism. Today, one in 150 American 8-year-olds has some form of autism. Boys outnumber girls four to one. The United States is not the only coun - try seeing this trend. It is increasingly diagnosed worldwide. For starters, is it really an epidemic? Or, are more people being diag - nosed? Many children who were diagnosed with mental retardation 30 years ago are children who are diagnosed with classic autism today. And mildly disabled ASD kids today are children who never would have had a diagnosis 30 years ago. Those verbal, but socially awkward, children account for the majority of new ASD cases. Here are the hottest areas of autism research today: Genetics: There is no question genetics plays a role. Autism runs in families. I have a family in my practice and all four children have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. Studying twins is an obvious way to detect genetic disorders. If one identical twin has autism, up to 90 percent of the time, so will the other twin. To date, studies suggest there is more than just one \"autism gene\"; there appear to be several. ASD children have several different abnormalities with their DNA. However the X chromosome is one of interest because of the high prevalence of boys with ASDs.2 Fragile X Syndrome, which is a known genetic cause of autism, also points to a defective X chromosome in ASD. And Rett Syndrome, which is a disorder causing developmental regression and autistic behaviors in girls, is caused by a defective MECP2 gene located on the X chromosome.3 We also know that kids with autism and defects on Chromosome 11 have dysfunctional \"neurexin 1 protein.\" Researchers are looking into how this defective protein affects fetal and infant brain growth. Finding these specific genetic defects may help in genetic counseling, as well as therapies, in the future. Animal studies already are underway for targeted genetic therapy in both Fragile X and Rett Syndrome. Abnormal brain growth: ASD children have problems with brain growth. Babies are born with immature brains that grow rapidly and make nerve connections called synapses ... like an information superhighway. In the normally growing brain, some branches of this superhighway get \"pruned.\" In the autistic brain, this pruning process seems to be defective. This may explain why babies who are autistic have abnormally rapid head growth under 1 year of age. No one has yet figured out what causes that defective nerve growth. Of note, boys with ASD have higher levels of hormones (insulin-like growth factor) that may contribute to their larger head size, weight, and body mass index.4Clear Answers & Smart Advice About Your Baby's Shots page 2 of 6Bottom line: Researchers don't know what causes autism, although the above factors provide clues. The goal is to find a way to prevent autism ... but we aren't there yet. Vaccines Q: Why do you care whether I vaccinate my child or not? For starters, we want your baby to be protected. But we also want you to realize that the decision to vaccinate your child impacts the health of other children in the community. Choosing NOT to vaccinate your child is choosing to put your child AND your community's children at risk. As a parent, you want to make the right choices to protect your child. I want you to ask questions. I want you to be informed. And I want you to get your child vaccinated. YOUR decision impacts ALL children. Why? There are two critical points for vaccination to work: 1. You need to be vaccinated. 2. Your neighbor needs to be vaccinated. This concept is called herd immunity. And yes, you are a member of a herd. When 90 to 95 percent of \"the herd\" is protected, it is nearly impossible for a germ to cause an epidemic. Think of germs as rain. Vaccination is a raincoat. Even with a raincoat on, you can still get wet. You need an umbrella, too. The umbrella is \"herd immunity.\" Those who don't vaccinate expect someone to share their umbrella when it rains. But society can only buy umbrellas TOGETHER. And raincoats aren't made for newborns\u2014they need umbrellas! Some parenting decisions have little or no impact on the community at large. Deciding whether or not your child eats organic baby food, goes to preschool, or sleeps in a family bed is entirely up to you\u2014 your decision only affects your child. However, your decision whether or not to vaccinate your child affects all our kids. If you are a parent who is considering delaying or skipping vaccinations altogether, please realize the impact of your decision. If more than 10 percent of American parents choose to \"opt out\" of vaccines, there's no question that our entire country will see these horrible diseases of bygone days return. Fortunately, very few parents decide to do this. What is most concerning today is that there are pockets of under-vaccinated children. Birds of a feather flock together. Like-minded parents who don't vaccinate their kids tend to live in the same community and send their kids to the same schools. With lower immunization rates, there is no herd immunity. We have these \"Ground Zero\" areas to thank for recent measles and whooping cough outbreaks of 2008 and 2011.10 Q: I've heard that the MMR vaccine might cause autism. Is this true? No. Parents also hear that vaccinations cause multiple sclerosis, diabetes, asthma, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). None of these are caused by vaccination. The government operates a safety monitoring system (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, Food and Drug Administration, CDC) watching for any possible adverse effects from vaccines. No one wants to increase autism rates.One small case report of only eight patients in 1998 led a research group to feel that the combination measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine might cause autism.11 But, don't try to find the article online because the journal that published it later retracted it when a former member of the research lab revealed that the data reported in the study was fabricated!12 Twelve years later, the lead author lost his license to practice medicine in England and was accused of fraud. The whole thing was a hoax. Before this came to light, several reputable scientists tried to duplicate the findings of this now discredited researcher. No one ever could\u2014and now we know why! Unfortunately, frightened parents chose to skip the MMR vaccine and measles epidemics occurred in the United Kingdom and the United States as a result of these unfounded claims. Bottom line: Don't base health decisions for your child on one research study or what the media says! Talk to your child's doctor about any vaccine safety concerns. Q: If the MMR vaccine doesn't cause autism, why is the diagnosis made around the same time as the vaccination? One of the criteria used to make a diagnosis of autism is a language delay. Because children do not have significant expressive language under a year of age, doctors have to wait until 15 to 18 months to confirm a language delay and make the diagnosis. That's about the same time as the MMR vaccination, which leads some parents to wonder about autism and vaccination. Q: I've heard mercury preservative is in vaccines. Is this true? Only a few remain. Preservatives and stabilizers are used in vaccines so the vaccinations remain potent and uncontaminated. A popular preservative used to be a chemical called thimerosal, which contained trace amounts of ethylmercury. Thimerosal use began in the 1940s. Thimerosal was removed from all vaccines given to infants younger than age 6 months by 2001. This deserves repeating: YOUR young baby will not be getting vaccines that contain mercury (thimerosal) as a preservative. The one exception is the influenza vaccine that is found in multi-dose vials that need a preservative to prevent contamination. Influenza vaccine that is packaged in single dose vials does not need a preservative and many clinics choose to use these individual vials with the youngest patients. Remember, it's very important that children get vaccinated against influenza each fall or winter beginning when they are 6 months old. Despite the fact that most vaccines are mercury preservative-free now, speculation persists about vaccines previously containing mercury and links to autism. This speculation continues even after the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a conclusive report in 2004 negating any association between vaccines and autism. (The IOM spent four years studying both the mercury question and the MMR combo vaccine question and published a series of eight reports on the subject.) A quick chemistry lesson: Certain compounds have completely different properties even though they may be related. For instance, Clear Answers & Smart Advice About Your Baby's Shots page 3 of 6the anticipated flu strains. Since millions of doses of flu vaccine are needed every year, the most efficient way to produce the shot is in multi-dose vials, which require a preservative. Hence, some flu shots (not the flu nasal spray) contain the preservative thimerosal. However, there are single-dose preparations of flu vaccine that are mercury preservative-free. These can be given to young children and pregnant women. Ask your doctor for a thimerosal-free flu vaccine if you are concerned. Even though thimerosal is safe, it would be ideal for all flu vaccines to be thimerosal preservative-free\u2014this would put any concerns to rest. However, the technology just isn't there yet. The Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University has a chart online that tracks any thimerosal content in vaccines: www. vaccinesafety.edu/thi-table.htm . FYI: Many vaccines such as the combination measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine never used thimerosal in the production process or as a preservative. Reality Check: Worried about the mercury preservative (thimerosal) in your child's flu vaccine? Consider this: A tuna fish sandwich has five times more mercury than a thimerosal-preserved flu vaccine. 15 And the type of mercury (methylmercury) found in tuna is the one that has health concerns. Also, a baby who is exclusively breastfed for six months of life consumes about 0.36 mg of methylmercury from breast milk. That's 15 times the quantity of ethylmercury in one flu vaccine! Bottom line: As a doc, I am much more concerned about your baby's mercury exposure from the environment than what's in a flu shot. Here's a look at the numbers: Product Amount of Mercury Type of Mercury Tuna, 5.6 oz can 0.115 mg Methyl Breast milk, 1 liter 0.015 mg Methyl Flu vaccine with thimerosal 0.025 mg Ethyl Q: Does thimerosal cause autism? No. The Institute of Medicine reached this conclusion in 2004. What proof do we have? Thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines since 2001, but the rates of autism are still skyrocketing. A 2008 survey of autism rates in California confirms that mercury is essentially out and autism rates are still going up. If thimerosal was the cause and it was removed from vaccines seven years ago, autism rates would be going down by now. Why? Because autism spectrum disorders are usually diagnosed by 3 years of age. By now, any reduction in autism should have been obvious if thimerosal caused the disorder.16 Mercury preservatives were removed from vaccines in Denmark in 1992. Canada and the European Union followed suit shortly thereafter. However, their autism rates are going up too. Mad Hatter's Disease (mercury poisoning) and autism are very different disorders (see chart in next column). A study of 100,000 kids in England compared those receiving thimerosal-containing vaccines to those who did not. The ones who had the t-free shots had HIGHER rates of autism.17take the alcohol family. Methanol is anti-freeze; ethanol is a Bud Light. Keep this in mind when we discuss mercury. We are all exposed to small amounts of mercury. The type of mercury that has raised health concerns is called methylmercury. High concentrations of methylmercury can be found in tuna, swordfish and shark from contaminated waters. The information known about mercury poisoning comes from unfortunate communities that have experienced it. Example: There is a large amount of data from the Faroe Islands, near Iceland. The people there would eat whale blubber contaminated with toxic levels of methylmercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Children, especially those exposed as fetuses during their mother's pregnancy, seemed to have lower scores on memory, attention, and language tests than their unexposed peers. (They were not diagnosed with autism or Attention Deficit Disorder, however.)13 Chronic exposure to liquid methylmercury causes Mad Hatter's Disease, named for hat makers who used liquid mercury in the hat-making process. The disease consists of psychiatric problems, insomnia, poor memory, sweating, tremors, and red palms. Chronic mercury poisoning also impairs kidney function. Methylmercury is a small molecule that can get into the brain\u2014it takes almost two months to break down in the body. Ethylmercury (the type of mercury that was previously used as a vaccine preservative) is a large molecule that cannot enter the brain and is rapidly eliminated from the body within a week. Because of the increased number of vaccinations that children get, the potential cumulative exposure to mercury became a concern in 1999. There are three federal groups that set standards for acceptable daily mercury exposure (the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], the Food and Drug Administration [FDA], and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry). When the exposure was calculated, the cumulative dose was higher than acceptable levels set by the EPA only (the other groups' standards were higher). As a result of these findings, the Public Health Service (which includes the FDA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a joint statement as a precautionary measure, urging vaccine manufacturers to reduce or eliminate thimerosal in vaccines as soon as possible.14 This was issued in 1999 before scientists had an opportunity to study the potential health effects of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Numerous studies have since shown that there is no relationship between vaccines, either with or without thimerosal, and the development of autism or other neurologic problems in children. Q: I heard that I should still ask my doctor if the vaccines for my baby are thimerosal-free. What do you suggest? We think you should ask as many questions as you need to feel comfortable. Remember that since 2001, most childhood vaccines given to infants and children went thimerosal (mercury) preservative- free. If your doctor has a 2001 vintage vaccine vial sitting on the shelf (which would be expired by now), he needs to re-stock. To give you some perspective, my practice buys its vaccine supply on a monthly basis. Why does flu vaccine need thimerosal or any other preservative? First, understand the flu vaccine is reformulated every year to reflect Clear Answers & Smart Advice About Your Baby's Shots page 4 of 6Why is aluminum used in vaccines? Aluminum enhances the immune system's response to the vaccine. It's been used safely for several decades. By using aluminum salts, some inactivated vaccines require fewer booster shots for the body to mount an adequate immune response. Are there any health concerns with aluminum in vaccines? No. There is significantly less aluminum in vaccines than what babies are exposed to in the environment. Both the National Vaccine Program Office and the World Health Organization have determined that the aluminum content in the childhood vaccination series is safe. Does aluminum poisoning cause autism? No. People with aluminum poisoning have bone problems (osteomalacia) and anemia, as well as neurologic issues. These include memory loss, fatigue, depression, behavioral changes, and learning impairment. Aluminum also has been proposed as the cause of Alzheimer's Disease. To date, however, there is little evidence that aluminum causes that disorder.21 How much aluminum is in vaccines? Very little. If your baby follows the standard immunization schedule, he is exposed to about four to six milligrams (mg) of aluminum at six months of life. By comparison, he's also exposed to 10 mg of aluminum if he is breastfed, 40 mg if he is fed cow's milk-based formula, or 120 mg if he is fed soy formula. None of these are very large amounts, by the way. To put things in perspective, there are about 200 mg of aluminum in a standard antacid tablet. In fact, the average adult ingests seven to nine milligrams of aluminum every day. Here's a look at how much aluminum is in breast milk/formula, compared with vaccines: Amount of aluminum exposure (milligrams per liter)22 Product Amount of aluminum Breast DTaP/IPV/HIB vaccine 1.5 mg/dose Is it a good idea to space out vaccinations that contain aluminum salts? No. Since aluminum-containing vaccines do not cause any health risk, separating or spacing out these vaccines has no benefit. In fact, there is a risk to spacing out the vaccines\u2014your baby will go unprotected against real vaccine-preventable disease. A 2007 study showed that children between 7 and 10 years of age who got those mercury-containing vaccines (before 2001) have no significant differences in tests of attention and processing information. Although the study did not look specifically at autism, it showed that mercury preservatives did not make much of an impact on brain functions in general. A follow-up study that specifically addresses autism is underway.18 Did thimerosal cause autism? Notice the differences between autism and mercury poisoning: Autism Mercury Poisoning19 Motor Repetitive movements Wobbly, shaky gait Vision Normal Impaired Speech Delay, repetitive sounds Articulation problem Sensory Hyper-responsive Loss of sensation Psychiatric Aloof, likes sameness Psychosis, depression Head size Large Small Q: Are there other additives in the vaccines? Yes. And you should know about them. Vaccines contain the active ingredients that provide immunity. But there are inactive ingredients that improve potency and prevent contamination. Below is a list of additives and why they are there. These products are present in trace amounts and none have been proven harmful in animals or humans.20 Preservatives: Prevent vaccine contamination with germs (bacteria, fungus). Examples: 2-phenoxyethanol, phenol, and thimerosal (prior to potency/immune response. Example: aluminum salts. Additives: Prevent vaccine deterioration and sticking to the side of the vial. Examples: gelatin, albumin, sucrose, lactose, MSG, glycine. Residuals: Remains of vaccine production process. Examples: formaldehyde, antibiotics (Neomycin), egg protein, yeast protein. See our website (www.Baby411.com, click on \"Bonus Material\") for a list of ingredients for the routine childhood vaccination series. Q: Why is aluminum in vaccines? Now that the mercury (thimerosal) saga is coming to an end, anti- vaccine crusaders have come up with a new bad guy: aluminum. Yes, trace amounts of aluminum salts are used in some childhood vaccines. Here's all you need to know (and more) about aluminum. Bottom line: We are not worried about it. Aluminum is everywhere. It's the most common metal in our earth's crust. So it is naturally present in our water, soil, and even in the air. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, flour, cereal, dairy products, and yes, even baby formula and breast milk ... all contain some aluminum. Do you wear antiperspirant? It's in there, too. To avoid aluminum exposure, you'd have to quit wearing antiperspirant ... and basically leave the planet. Clear Answers & Smart Advice About Your Baby's Shots page 5 of 6 Reality Check: If vaccines contain ingredients like aluminum or formaldehyde, wouldn't it be better if vaccine makers got rid of these additives? Shouldn't vaccines be \"greener\"? This is a red herring argument against vaccines\u2014current vac- cines are safe, even with tiny/trace amounts of preservatives or additives like aluminum. And your baby is exposed to many of these ingredients every day ... simply by eating or breathing. Q: Why is formaldehyde in vaccines? Small amounts of formaldehyde are used to sterilize the vaccine fluid so your child doesn't get something like flesh-eating Strep bacteria when he gets his shots. We know when you think of formaldehyde, you think of that ever-present smell wafting from the anatomy lab in high school. But what you probably don't know is that formaldehyde is also a naturally occurring substance in your body. And if you use baby shampoo, paper towels or mascara, or have carpeting in your home, you've been exposed to formaldehyde. The small amount used in vaccines is not a health concern.23 Q: Is it true that anti-freeze is used in vaccines? No. Antifreeze has never been a component of vaccines. Antifreeze products commonly contain either ethylene glycol or propylene glycol. A product with a similar name, polyethylene glycol (PEG), is used in the production process to purify vaccines. PEG is not antifreeze! PEG is also found in medications, toothpastes, laxatives, lubricant eye drops, and various skin care creams. Q: Is it safer to delay vaccines or use an alternative vaccination schedule? Easy answer: No. The CDC publishes a recommended vaccine schedule for American children. Many, many doctors, scientists, and researchers work together with the CDC to decide what is the best timing to give shots. The goal: Protect babies as soon as it is safe and effective to do so. This schedule was not created out of thin air. Between anti-vaccine activists shouting \"too many shots, too soon\" and Dr. Bob Sears hawking his book, new parents wonder if it would somehow be safer to wait on shots altogether or stagger them out on \"Dr. Bob's schedule.\" Here's a nasty little truth about alternative vaccination schedules: They are all fantasy. There is absolutely no research that says delaying certain shots is safer. Dr. Bob is making up \"Dr. Bob's Schedule\" all by himself. He even admits that. In an interview with iVillage, he commented, \"My schedule doesn't have any research behind it. No one has ever studied a big group of kids using my schedule to determine if it's safe or if it has any benefits.\" A 2010 study actually did evaluate children whose vaccinations were delayed and found absolutely no difference in their development compared with children who had received their shots on time. I'd much rather follow a schedule that has been extensively researched for both safety and effectiveness by experts in the field of infectious diseases. What we do know about alternative vaccination schedules is that delaying shots is playing Russian roulette with your child. The simple truth is that you are leaving your child unprotected, at a time when she is the most vulnerable. We realize that parents who choose to delay or opt out on vaccines are not bad parents. They are scared parents. What we are trying to help you realize is that the fear you should have is for the diseases that vaccines prevent. If you are on the fence about vaccinations, please take the time to research the disease\u2014and talk to your child's doctor.Q: If I want to do a staggered vaccination schedule, how should I do it? I suggest setting up a consultation with your own pediatrician to discuss what both of you feel comfortable with doing. Remember, the ultimate goal is to have your child vaccinated in a timely manner. Q: Didn't the government concede that vaccines caused a child's autism? During the equivalent of a class action lawsuit against the government (called the \"Omnibus Autism Proceedings\"), one child, Hannah Poling, received a monetary settlement. The court did not hear her case. Hannah's case was being reviewed to serve as one of the test cases for a suit to represent 5,000 families who believe vaccines caused their child's autism. During the review process, it was determined that Poling did not represent a test case because she had a rare, underlying genetic mitochondrial disorder that caused her deterioration and autism. For rare kids like her, any stress could have caused her to deteriorate. This is the equivalent of being born with an aneurysm, a ticking time bomb that could go off at any moment. Although she was not diagnosed prior to being vaccinated, experts recommend that even children with known mitochondrial disorders still be vaccinated. Bottom line: The government did NOT concede that vaccines cause autism in the Poling case. Citations 1. Maestro S. Psychopathology . 1999;32(6):292-300. 2. S, et al.

Doses cannot be given too close together or immunity doesn't have time to build up. On the other hand, you don't want to delay your child's shots and get behind schedule because during this time, your child remains unprotected against these diseases. What if I miss an appointment? Does my baby have to start the vaccines all over again? No. If your baby misses some doses, it's not necessary to start over. Y our provider will continue from where he or she left off. How do I keep track of my baby's shots? Y our healthcare provider should give you a personal record card for your child's vaccinations. If you don't receive one, ask! Bring the card to all medical appointments. Whenever your child receives a vaccine, make sure the card gets updated. Y our child will benefit by retaining an accurate vaccina - tion record throughout his or her life. What if my child isn't a baby anymore? Is it too late to get him or her vaccinated?

Vaccinations (vaccines) protect your child against serious diseases by stimulating the immune system to create antibodies against certain bacteria or viruses. Most vaccinations are given as injections. What diseases do vaccines protect against? Vaccines protect against diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, influenza, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, polio, tetanus, whooping cough, chickenpox, rotavirus, and more. Vaccines can't protect children from minor illnesses like colds, but they can keep children safe from many serious diseases. Isn't all this talk about diseases just a way to scare parents so they'll bring their babies in for shots? No. These diseases can injure and kill children in the United States. For example, pertussis is a dangerous disease for infants. During 1997-2000, nearly 30,000 pertussis cases were reported; 62 resulted in death. In 2003 alone, 11,647 cases and 18 deaths from pertussis were reported. Influenza also takes a toll on children. During the 2003-04 influenza season, 40 states reported 152 influenza-related deaths among children younger than 18 years of age. I don't know anybody who has had measles or rubella. Why does my baby need these shots? Y ou might not think that measles and rubella are a threat today because you don't see or hear much about them, but they are still around. These diseases are common in other parts of the world and are just a plane ride away. If we stop vaccinating against these diseases, many more people will become infected. Vaccinating your child will keep him or her safe. Isn't there some way besides vaccination to protect my baby against these diseases? No. Breastfeeding offers temporary immunity against some minor infections like colds, but it is not an effective means of protecting a child from the specific diseases preventable by vaccines. Likewise, vitamins don't protect against the specific bacteria and viruses that cause these serious diseases. Of course, infection usually results in immunity, and some parents think that getting the \"natural\" disease is preferable to \"artificial\" vaccination. Some even arrange chickenpox \"parties\" to ensure their child is infected. However, the price paid for natural disease can include paralysis, retardation, liver cancer, deafness, blindness, or even death. Vaccination is definitely a better choice! Are vaccinations safe? Vaccines are safe, and scientists continually work to make sure they become even safer. Every vaccine undergoes many tests before being licensed, and its safety continues to be monitored as long as the vaccine is in use. Most side effects from vaccination are minor, such as soreness where the injection was given or a low-grade fever. These side effects do not last long and are treatable. Serious reactions are very rare. The tiny risk of a serious vaccine reaction has to be weighed against the very real risk of getting a dangerous vaccine-preventable disease. If you have concerns or questions, talk to your child's healthcare provider. What if my baby has a cold or fever, or is taking antibiotics? Can he or she still get vaccinated? Y es. Y our child can still be vaccinated if he or she has a mild illness, a low-grade fever, or is taking antibiotics. Ask your child's healthcare provider if you have questions. How many times do I need to bring my baby in for vaccinations? At least five visits are needed before age two, but the visits can be timed to coincide with well-child check-ups. Y our baby should get the first vaccine (hepatitis B) shortly after birth, while still in the hospital. Multiple visits during the first two years are necessary because there are 14 diseases your baby can be protected against, and most require several doses of vaccine for the best protection. How do I know when to take my baby in for shots? Y our healthcare provider should give you a reminder when the next doses are due.

Parents, please consider the consequences of not immunizing your child. Your vaccination decision affects not only the health of your child, but also the health of your family, your child's friends and their families, and your community.Without immunizations your child is at risk for catching a vaccine-preventable disease. Vaccines were developed to protect people from dangerous and often fatal diseases. Vaccines are safe and effective, and vaccine-preventable diseases are still a threat. Influenza or \"flu\" is a serious respiratory disease that can be deadly. Healthy infants and toddlers are especially vulnerable to the complications of influenza. Tragically, every year in the United States children die from influenza. Pertussis or \"whooping cough\" is an extremely dangerous disease for infants. It is not easily treated and can result in permanent brain damage or death. Since the 1980s, the number of cases of pertussis has increased, especially among babies younger than 6 months and teenagers. In 2010, several states reported an increase in cases and outbreaks of pertussis, including a state-wide epidemic in California. Many infants died from whooping cough during this epidemic . Measles is dangerous and very contagious. It is still common in many countries and is easily brought into the United States by returning vacationers and foreign visitors. The number of reported measles cases began to decline rapidly during the 1990s. Recently, vaccine hesitancy among parents in the United States and abroad has led to a growing number of children and teens who are under-vaccinated and thus, unprotected from measles. Unfor-tunately, measles cases are on the rise across this country and worldwide. Chickenpox is very contagious. Before the development of a vaccine, about 100 people died every year in the United States from chickenpox. Most were previously healthy. Children with chickenpox need to be kept out of day care or school for a week or more so they don't spread the disease to others. Children who are not immunized can readily transmit vaccine-preventable diseases throughout the community. Unvaccinated children can pass diseases on to babies who are too young to be fully immunized. Unvaccinated children pose a threat to children and adults who can't be immunized for medical reasons. This includes people with leukemia and other cancers, immune system problems, and people receiving treatment or medications that suppress their immune system. Unvaccinated children can infect the small percentage of children who do not mount an immune response to vaccination. During disease outbreaks, unimmunized children may be excluded from school or child care until the outbreak is over. This is for their own protection and the protection of others. It can cause hardship for the child and parent. Without immunizations your child can infect others. .
