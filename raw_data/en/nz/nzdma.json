Examples of CCS -eligible conditions include, but are not limited to, chronic medical conditions such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, cerebral palsy, heart disease, cancer, hearing loss, and traumatic injuries. T he CCS Program is administered as a partnership between local CCS county programs and the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS). Throughout California, CCS authorizes services for approximately 185,000 children served by a network of CCS -paneled specialty and subspecialty providers, and CCS - approved hospitals and special care centers. Historically, CCS only funds and manages the care of the CCS conditions, and not the primary care or care of non-CCS eligible health conditions, leading to fragmentation of health care. Under the 1115 Waiver, t he State of California will pilot up to two models of care for children enrolled in the CCS program. By testing these models of care, California believes it will be able to create health care delivery systems that respond to the unique needs of regions and populations throughout the state. The pilots will also help inform best practices, through a comprehensive evaluation component, so that at the end of the five- year demonstration period decisions can be made on permanent restructuring of the CCS program design and delivery systems. This draft outlines the evaluation component of the Section 1115 waiver for the CCS Demonstration Projects. Goal and Objectives The overarching goal of the CCS pilot project is for the State to test two integrated delivery models for the CCS population that results in achieving the desired outcomes related to timely access to care, improved coordination of care, promotion of community -based services, improved satisfaction with care, improved health outcomes and greater cost-effectiveness. The two models of care delivery include a provider -based Accountable Care Organization (ACO) and an existing Medi -Cal Managed Care Plan (MCP) . The objective of the evaluation is to demonstrate the effectiveness of an integrated delivery model for the CCS population by: 1. Ensuring that the CCS population has access to timely and appropriate, high quality and well -coordinated medical and supportive services that are likely to maintain and enhance their health and functioning and meet their developmental needs. 1 2. Increasing patient and family satisfaction with the delivery of services provided through the CCS program. 3. Increasing satisfaction with both the delivery of and the reimbursement of services. 4. The State's ability to measure and assess those strategies that are most and least effective in improving the cost -effectiveness of delivering high- quality, well -coordinated medical and supportive services to the CCS population. 5. Increasing the use of community -based services as an alternative to inpatient care and emergency room use. 6. Reducing the annual rate of growth of expenditures for the CCS population. Evaluation Design and Methods The CCS pilot evaluation design incorporates quantitative and/or qualitative process and/or outcome measures that adequately assess the effectiveness of the demonstration in terms of cost of services and total costs of care, improved health outcomes and system transformation including better care, better quality, and enhanced value, change in delivery of care from inpatient to outpatient, and quality improvement under managed care. T he evaluation will meet the standards of leading academic institutions and academic journals. Data will be reported at the beneficiary, provider, health plan, and statewide levels. Significant attention will be given to ensuring use of the best available data and the cleanliness of it when utilized. When necessary, the data will be adjusted and/or controls will be put into place to maximize the use of it. Should there be data limitations, the data will be modified as needed and only used appropriately so as not to misinterpret it. Any modifications and changes will be reported in the final evaluation report. The final evaluation report will also consider how the findings from the evaluation may or may not be generalized. The evaluation will compare pre- and post -pilot implementation data whenever possible. Research has shown that it can take up to two years for beneficiaries to become adjusted to a change in delivery system. Therefore, for the two pilot programs, an analysis will be conducted of the experience of CCS children 24 months prior to the pilot and 24 months post implementation of the pilot. Furthermore, the evaluation shall also evaluate the managed care plans or ACO particip ating in the pilot as compared to the CCS program in selected counties where CCS services are not incorporated into managed care or an ACO. Because additional data are available for the post -pilot implementation population and only certain assessed requirements exist for the post pilot implementation, additional metrics and data may only be available for the post pilot implementation period of time. All measures will be benchmarked against available state and national standards and benchmarks. For example, NCQA Medicaid benchmarks 2 for performance will be utilized when possible. Evaluation Measures The evaluation shall provide a general beneficiary profile of each model including, age, gender , race and ethnicity, primary language spoken at home and CCS diagnoses . The evaluation shall look at the following enrollment measures: Measure 1: Percent of new ly enrollment Numerator: Number of unique c hildren under age 21 with CCS -eligible medical conditions, deemed newly eligible during the reporting period Denominator: All unique c hildren under age 21 with CCS -eligible medical conditions , during the reporting period Data will be stratified by source of eligibility referral such as managed care plan, provider, etc. and monitor trends over time Baseline value: TBD Data Sources: CMS Net Eligibility Data Measure 2: Average length of enrollment Definition: The average length of time from original enrollment date of program to disenrollment rate Data will indicate percent of continuous enrollment Baseline value: TBD Data Sources: CMSNet Eligibility Data F urthermore, the evaluation shall measure the following domains: access to care, client satisf action, provider satisfaction, quality of care, care coordination and total cost of care. Each domain of the evaluation will respond to a fundamental evaluation question and hypotheses. Access to Care Evaluation Question: What is the impact of the pilots on children's access to CCS services? Hypotheses: An integrated delivery system ensures access to timely and appropriate, high quality and well -coordinated medical and supportive services that maintain and enhance the health for the CCS population. To demonstrate access to timely and appropriate primary, specialty and behavioral health care, DHCS shall measure the following: 1. Percent of children and young adults 12 months -20 years of age who had a visit with a PCP. 2. Referral of a Child to Special Care Center (SCC) 3. Screening for Clinical Depression and Follow -Up Plan Measure 1: Percent of children and young adults 12 months -20 years of age who had a visit with a PCP 3 Access to primary care is important for the health and well -being of children and adolescents. Definition: The measure reports on four separate percentages: o CCS Children 12 -24 months who had a visit with a PCP during the reporting period. o CCS Children 25 months -6 years who had a visit with a PCP during the reporting period. o CCS Children 7- 11 years who had a visit with a PCP during the measure year or the year prior to the reporting period. o CCS Adolescents 12- 20 years who had a visit with a PCP during the measurement year or the year prior to the reporting period.

Introduction Within the Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver, the Dental Transformation Initiative (DTI) represents a critical strategy to improve dental health for eligible Medi -Cal children by focusing on high-value care, improved access, and utilization of performance measures to drive delivery system reform. More specifically, this initiative aims to increase the use of preventive dental services for children, prevent and treat more early childhood caries, and increase continuity of care for children. Given the importance of oral health to the overall health of an individual, California views improvements in dental care as critical to achieving better health outcomes overal l for Medi -Cal children. The DTI covers 4 areas or Domains: Domain 1 This domain aims to increase statewide the number of Medi -Cal children ages 1 through 20 that receive preventive dental services by at least 10 percentage points over a five - year period. Domain 2 Under this domain, d ental p roviders in selected pilot counties will be eligible to receive incentive payment s for performing pre -defined caries risk assessments (CRAs) , develop treatment plans , provide nutritional and motivational counseling for Medi -Cal children ages 6 and under based upon the child's risk. This domain seeks to prevent and mitigate oral disease through the delivery of preventive services in lieu of more invasive and costly procedures (restorative services). Domain 3 This domain seeks to make available i ncentive payments to dental service office locations in select pilot counties who have maintained continuity of care through providing recall examinations to their e nrolled Medi -Cal children age s 20 and under. This domain seeks to increase continuity of care for the targeted population over 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 continuous year periods. Domain 4 Local Dental Pilot Project s (LDPP s) will address the above -described d omains through pilot programs aimed at increasing preventive services, CRAs and disease management and continuity of care. The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) will solicit proposals and shall review, approve, and make payments to LDPPs in accordance with the requirements stipulated in the Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver. There is the potential to fund up to 15 LDPPs . 1| P a g e Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver Evaluation DRAFT Evaluation Plan for the Dental Transformation Initiative II. Goals and Objectives The primary goals of the DTI are to improve dental health for eligible Medi -Cal children by focusing on high -value care, improved access, and utilization of performance measures to drive delivery system reform. More specifically, this initiative aims to increase the use of preventive dent al services, prevent and treat more early childhood caries, and increase continuity of care for children. The evaluation will examine each of these goals. The aim of the evaluation is to determine the causal impacts of the DTI Demonstration on how ince ntive payments influence : Increas ed statewide number s of Medi -Cal children ages 1 through 20 that receive preventive dental services by at least 10 percentage points over a five - year period; Diagnoses of early childhood caries for targeted children 6 and u nder by utilizing a predefined CRA tool and treatment planning for managing this condition as a chronic disease based on the beneficiary 's risk assessment in lieu of more invasive and costly procedures and restorative treatment; and Improve d continuity of care for targeted children under the age of 21 through regular examinations with their established dental provider . A. Hypotheses Evaluation hypotheses are as follows : 1. Provider incentive payments are an effective method to encourage dental service office locations to provide preventive dental services to targeted Medi-Cal children. 2. Provider incentive payments are an effective method for increasing Medi-Cal provider participation, which could improve access to care for children. 3. Provider incentive payments are effective in encouraging providers to perform CRA for the targeted population and ensure completion of appropriate treatment modalities for the management of early childhood caries. 4. Utilization of emergency room visits for dental issues among the targeted populations will decline. 5. Utilization and expenditures for dental related general anesthesia for target ed populations will decline. 6. incentive payments are an effective method of promoting continuity of care for targeted children. 7. The provider incentive payments for preventive services and continuity of care provide a more favorable cost benefit ratio than that of CRA. B. Design Determination of the best approach to evaluate the causal effects of the DTI demonstration is challenging. When considering alternative evaluation designs, the implementation of some DTI Domains in select counties versus statewide, uncertainty regarding participation of dental providers and yet to be det ermined as LDPP awardees must be taken into account. All d ental p roviders in a select county and/or LDPPs may 2| P a g e Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver Evaluation DRAFT Evaluation Plan for the Dental Transformation Initiative not be ready to participate in the Domains immediately. It is likely that Doma in implementation will not be tightly tied to stated implementation dates. As a result, the start dates used in data collection or analyses will in some instances be based on an individual dental provider's implementation start date s, rather than California' s state d implementation dates. The proposed evaluation will use an interrupted time series design that, under a multiple baseline design, allows implementation of the respective Domain s at multiple points staggered over time with a hypothetical outcome of measurement of treatment access or quality of care . Changes in outcomes following Domain implementation, coupled with the absence of changes in other counties that were not selected for the Domain may suggest that the change observed resulted from the implementation of the demonstration. A multiple baseline design can be used to study the changes created by the demonstration. To determine whether incentive payments have been effective in meeting the goals of the DTI demonstration, the evaluation wil l examine the availability of services along the full continuum of dental care, dental services provided to eligible Medi -Cal children and target populations, perfo rmance metrics for each of the D omains and any health care cost offsets resulting from appropriate use of dental services using a logic model . To determine the cost benefits of the DTI, a cost-benefit analysis of the DTI and each of the Domains , as well as any health care cost offset resulting from the appropriate use of dental services will be conducted . III. Methodology The proposed methods can be divided into three broad areas: Access, Quality , and Cost. The measures proposed for each of the areas are described below. The data sources included in this section are described in gr eater detail in the Data section that follows. A. Access Measures Hypothese s: 1. Provider incentive payments are an effective method to encourage dental service office locations to provide preventive dental services to targeted Medi-Cal children. Progress will be measured across all Domains by conducting a comparative analysis of the before and after utilization measures. This will entail the measurement of provider participation figures for actual number of providers, as well as number of claims received in the fee for service and managed care delivery systems. Utilization will also be measured by age stratifications consistent with CMS 416 methodology to gauge the extent of success within each Domain. Comparative analysis for proximate counties prior to the demonstration with similar population and/or utilization that were not selected for participation will be conducted and as provided in Appendix 1, Evaluation Methodology Models. 3| P a g e Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver Evaluation DRAFT Evaluation Plan for the Dental Transformation Initiative 2. Provider incentive payments are an effective method for increasing Medi -Cal provider participation, which could improve access to care for children. Progress will be measured across all Domains by conducting a comparative analysis of the before and after utilization measures. This will entail the measurement of provider participation figures for actual number of providers, as well as numb er of claims received in the fee for service and managed care delivery systems. Utilization will also be measured by age stratifications consistent with the CMS 416 methodology to gauge the extent of success within each Domain. Comparative analysis for proximate counties prior to the demonstration with similar population and/or utilization that were not selected for partic ipation will be conducted and as provided in Appendix 1, Evaluation Methodology Models . 3. Provider incentive payments are effective in encouraging providers to perform CRA for the targeted population and ensure completion of appropriate treatment for the management of early childhood caries. Progress will be measured by conducting a comparative analysis by distinguishing the CDTs that are utilized within this Domain and assessing whether the risk level associated with the child also affects the provider's ability to complete the CRA treatment plan and assessments. As CRA is not a covered benefit statewide, there are specific challenges imposed in this Domain as there is not a control county in which to compare. Rather, a study of t he progress through all counties will be conducted. Stratifications again consistent with the CMS 416 methodology will be utilized as provided in Appendix 1, Evaluation Methodology Models . 4. Utilization of emergency room visits for dental issues among the targeted children will decline . Utilization of emergency room visits will be measured across all of the pilot counties for Domain 2 and compared against similarly situated and in close geographic proximity to assess if the number of emergency room visits declines. Further analysis will also be performed to trend if counties in which there is a higher rate of completion of appropriate treatment for the management of childhood caries affects the ratio or restorative to preventive services as well as has a r esidual effect resulting in the decline of emergency room services. Comparative analysis Statewide will be conducted and as provided in Appendix 1, Evaluation Methodology Models. 5. Utilization and expenditures for dental related general anesthesia for ta rget children will decline . Utilization of general anesthesia will be measured across all of the pilot counties for Domain 2 and compared against similarly situated and in close geographic proximity to assess if the number of general anesthesia declines. Further analysis will also be performed to trend if counties in which there is a higher rate of completion of appropriate treatment for the management of childhood caries affects the ratio or restorative to preventive services and if there is a residual effect resulting in the decline of emergency room services. 4| P a g e Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver Evaluation DRAFT Evaluation Plan for the Dental Transformation Initiative Comparative analysis Statewide will be conducted and as provided in Appendix 1, Evaluation Methodology Models . 6. Provider incentive payments are an effective method of promoting continu ity of care for targeted children. Progress will be measured across all Domains by conducting a comparative analysis of the before and after percentage measures in a year by year comparison for continuity of care. This will entail the measurement of total number beneficiaries in co mparison to the number of beneficiaries that continued to see the same provider on an annual basis. Utilization will also be measured by age stratifications consistent with the CMS 416 methodology to gauge the extent of success wi thin this Domain. Comparative analysis for proximate counties prior to the demonstration with similar population and/or utilization that were not selected for participation will be conducted. Comparative analysis for proximate counties prior to the demonstration with similar population and/or utilization that were not selected for participation will be conducted and as provided in Appendix 1, Evaluation Methodology Models . 7. Promising practices will be identified with the implementation of CRA and disease management and LDPPs. Comparative analysis for proximate counties prior to the demonstration with similar population and/or utilization that were not selected for participation will be conducted and as provided in Appendix 1, Evaluation Methodology Models . Access will be evaluated using the following measures : Provider enrollment, beneficiary eligibility , encounter data, and claims data will be used to evaluate access to preventive services, continuity of care, emergency services, general anesthesia utilization , and provider enrollment for periods prior to the implementation of the demonstration pilots and subsequent to implementation of the pilots . Claims data will be analyzed to examine changes in access and whether the frequency of pr eventive services , CRA and treatment , and continuity of care have increased, remained the same , or decreased for the target populations . Claims data will be examined to determine changes in utilization of emergency room visits for dental services and util ization for dental related general anesthesia utilization to determine whether emergency room visits for dental services or utilization of dental related general anesthesia have declined, remained the same , or increased for the target populations. Medi -Cal beneficiary and dental provider surveys regarding access to care will be used to measure perceptions of access to care . 5| P a g e B. Quality Measures Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver Evaluation DRAFT Evaluation Plan for the Dental Transformation Initiative Hypotheses: 1. Promising practices will be identified with the implementation of CRA and disease management and LDPPs. Progress will be measured by conducting a comparative analysis by distinguishing the CDTs that are utilized within this Domain and assessing whether the risk level associated with the child also affects the provider's ability to complete the CRA treatment plan and assessments and assessing if the increased number of CRAs has a correlation to the improvement of care by decreasing the number of childhood caries within the targeted population. Quality will be evaluated using the following measures : Provider enrollment, beneficiary eligibility and claims data will be used to evaluate preventive services, continuity of care, emergency services, general anesthesia, and provider enrollment for periods prior to the implementa tion of the demonstration project and subsequent to implementation of the pilots. Medi -Cal beneficiary and dental provider surveys will be used to measure perceptions of quality of care . Grievance reports and provider audits will be leveraged to track the type of concerns received by beneficiaries and providers . C. Cost Measures Hypotheses: 1. Utilization of emergency room visits for dental issues among the targeted children will decline. 2. Utilization and e xpenditures for dental related general anesthesia utilization for target children will decline. 3. The provider incentive payments for preventive services and continuity of care provide a more favorable cost benefit ratio than that of CRA. Costs will be evaluated using Medi -Cal claims data and the actual d ollar amounts paid for dental services and DTI incentive payments for calendar time periods pre and post implementation on a quarterly basis . The following measures will be examined: Change in overall average costs for Medi -Cal children who receive preventive services, CRA and disease management, and /or continuity of care. Change in emergency room utilization for dental services to assess if there is a decrease in the cost of emergency room utilization based on increased utilization of preventive care services . Change in utilization and expenditures for dental related general anesthesia utilization. 6| P a g e Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver Evaluation DRAFT Evaluation Plan for the Dental Transformation Initiative Change in preventive services utilization and costs. Differences in costs among Medi -Cal children that received DTI services and beneficiaries that did not, analyzed to the extent possible by geographic location , delivery system, and type of service. IV. Data Sources A. Administrative Data Sources 1. Medi -Cal Eligibility Data System (MEDS): MEDS contains data on all Medi -Cal beneficiaries statewide, including demographic information and residential addresses. 2. Medi -Cal Claims and Encounter Data ( DHCS data warehouse ): The DHCS data warehouse, known as the Medi -Cal Management Information System/Decision Support System ( MIS/DSS) contains data for Medicaid claims, which provides identifying information on Medi -Cal eligible beneficiaries that can be linked to other datasets. 3. Medi -Cal Provider Master File (PMF) : The PMF contains data for enrolled Medi - Cal dental providers and safety net clinic providers , including service office locations , pay -to addresses and delivery system details. 4. Surveillance Utilization Review System (SURS): Suspicious claim activi ty is tracked through SURS to prevent fraud , waste, and abuse. In addition to the above datasets, data from any other dataset that may become available during the evaluation will be assessed to determine whether the data would add substantially to the p lanned analyses. If so, these datasets will be incorporated into the evaluation to the extent possible. B. New Data Collection Activities 1. Stakeholder Surveys : Stakeholder surveys will address multiple needs. For example, Medi -Cal beneficiary and dental provider surveys may include questions on access to care, quality of care, and/or whether provider incentive payments are an effective method to encourage service office locations to provide preventive dental services and continuity of care to more Medi -Cal children or enroll as a Medi -Cal dental provider. 2. Chart Review: Beneficiary dental records at dental provider service office locations may be reviewed to inform evaluation activities. 3. Document Review: The evaluation may consider other relevant data points such as enrollment data, provider audits or grievance reports, in order to inform evaluation activities. These activities will complement but not duplicate planned review processes, which are intended to ensure that baseline re quirements from the STCs are met. 7| P a g e Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver Evaluation DRAFT Evaluation Plan for the Dental Transformation Initiative V. Analysis Plan A. Statistical Data Analysis Administrative data and survey data will be collected and analyzed across the State and different Domains, pre -implementation and throughout the demonstration years to acco unt for implementation periods and comparisons among participating and non - participating Medi -Cal dental providers. A variety of models may be used to analyze DTI statistical data. These analyses will be used to assist DHCS in answering the stated research questions. For annual longitudinal quantitative data, a generalized linear model will be used to identify changes over time. These mixed effects models are similar to a multivariate regression model. Mixed effects regress ion models can account for the correlation seen between years within the same county. For example, one county may implement a Domain quicker than another county, which will influence the next year's measurement within that county. Generalized linear mode ls are helpful in accounting for differences at a county level, such as multiple delivery systems while other counties may not have these. An analogous set of analyses can be conducted using a logistic mixed model to account for binary outcomes over time. Where data is sufficient, a multiple baseline approach may be applied to account for different implementation period s and comparisons among two county types, for example, looking at data pre -implementation, partial implementation when some counties hav e implemented a Domain and some have not, and post -implementation, using a separate mixed effects model for each piece of the data. Multivariate regression models using indicator variables for opt -in status (e.g. Domain 2) along with other possible cofounding factors may be used to control for differences based on characteristics such as Medi -Cal enrollment, age, or race. It is also p ossible to test for interactions between cofounding variables and opt -in status and when looking at binary outcomes, it is possible to account for differences using logistic regression. Data may be insufficient for the analyses models described. In the se cases, repeated measure methods may be used to compare baseline to any specific later observation or composite of later observations . For surveys of beneficiaries or dental providers, statistical significance is a consideration since surveys will be conducted on sample sizes. The number of surveys may be adjusted up or down based on resource availability and the numbers of beneficiaries or providers participating in a Domain will be critical to the ability to detect an effect ive size i n estimating the pre -and-post change of a continuous outcome. B. Qualitative Analysis Data collected will be analyzed separately as well as across the Domains and different groups, by implementation and over time to identify themes and patterns. Detailed 8| P a g e Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver Evaluation DRAFT Evaluation Plan for the Dental Transformation Initiative information will provide an understanding of experiences, which will be used to supplement and expand on the data sets to answer the research questions. The evaluation work will be inclusive of results from both qualitative and quantitative data sets, con sider how they contribute to answering the research questions in the relevant Domains, and examine whether and where the results from the data sets converge, complement one another, and /or expand on another. VI. Evaluation Implementation A.

Introduction California's GPP is a new pilot program to support public health care systems ( PHCS ) efforts to provide services to California's remaining uninsured , and to promote the delivery of more cost- effective and hi gher -value care . The GPP establishes a new payment structure that will reward the provision of care in more appropriate venues, rather than primarily through the emergency department or through inpatient hospital settings. Under the GPP, public health care systems will receive GPP payments that will be calculated using a value -based point methodology that incorporates factors designed to incentivize a shift in the overall delivery of services for the uninsured to more appropriate settings , and reinforce structural changes to the care delivery system that will improve the options for treating uninsured patients. The intent of the GPP framework is to provide flexibility in the provision of services while encouraging a broad shift to more cost -effective care that is person- centered. GPP p ayment s will not exceed the established aggregate limit stated in the Standard Terms and Conditions ( STC) but may be less if PHCS do not provide the required level of service s and the established point thresholds are not achieved. The total amount available for the GPP funding is a combination of portion the s tate's Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital ( DSH ) allotment that would otherwise be allocated to the PHCS, and the state's Safety Net Care Uncompe nsated Care Pool. Evaluation Requirements The STCs require two GPP evaluations. The first evaluation will occur at the midpoint of the GPP program, and the second evaluation is due at the end of program year 4. The evaluations are intended to take a snapshot of early of GPP implementation and assess the impact of the program, including the care provided by the public health care system , the benefits and challenges of this new innovative payment approach , and the potential for broader application for future waivers . The STCs require the following elements to be included in the GPP evaluations: Required for the first and second evaluation: o Assess the GPP goals of promoting value, not volume by each individual PHCS: 2 o Number of uninsured individuals served o Number and type of services provided o Expenditures associated with the services provided, both at 100% and 175% uncompensated care cost (UCC) levels o Expenditures that were avoided or reduced due to the GPP o An assessment of the effects of the GPP on care delivery and costs o Individual PHCS self -assessment of the successes and challenges of the GPP For the second evaluation only : o Examine the extent to which the GPP encouraged or improved: o Care in more appropriate settings, to ensure right care in the right place at the right time o Changes in resource allocation o Improvements in workforce involvement and care team transformation under the demonstration Data C ollection The first GPP evaluation will use the most complete data available for State fiscal years (SFY) 2015 -16 and 2016 -17 and will rely primarily on aggregate data by service type for all partic ipating GPP systems. Encounter level data for GPP services (e.g. diagnosis and procedure codes ) will be collected for service dates beginning in the second year of the GPP program. The evaluation will also utilize applicable available cost data from PHCS as well as qualitative individual system GPP narratives. For purposes of the evaluations, utilization will be defined in terms of units of service as described in Table 5, Attachment FF. For many of the components in the first evaluation, PH CS will have to evaluate changes compared to the pre -GPP baseline, which is the SFY 2014 -15 reporting period utilized to establish the initial thresholds. The second evaluation will include all data sources from the first evaluation, plus data from GPP encounter reporting that begin s in PY2 . Each year, PHCS will submit an interim- year -end summary report and a final year -end summary report that will include data for all services provided in Categories 1 -4 in Table 1 of Attachment FF. The interim and final year -end summary reports will include all GPP utilization information that will specify the provision and volume of services at each PHCS. Data obtained from these reports will inform summary and system level information for the GPP evaluation, and will provide the necessary service level information to assess trends over time in the second evaluation . Furthermore, beginning in GPP PY2, all PHCS will also submit encounter level data in conjunction with their final year and summary GPP reports that will offer additional details on the scope of services provided to uninsured patients within in their systems. The source of data for the summary reports and encounter data will include services provided internally at the PHCS, contracted providers as well as local mental health and substance use providers. 3 Please refer to Table 1 in Attachment FF for the list of all services that will be captured under the GPP . With respect to the cost data required under the calculation, PHCS will utilize different source s and methodologies for the various types of servic es being provided under the GPP as follows: For traditional hospital inpatient, outpatient, and professional services provided internally by PHCS, the most recently available \"Interim Hospital Payment Rate Workbooks\" (referred to as the \"P14 reports\") will be the primary data sources, with key cost elements matching those in the 2552 Medi -Cal hospital cost reports which will also be available. This is consistent with the methodology used in the 2010 Bri dge to Reform waiver. For the various contracted uninsured services which may earn GPP points (e.g., hospital, physician, and behavioral health), PHCS will rely on all claims/invoices paid to the contracted providers, with the negotiated paid amount equivalent to the \"costs\". For mental health services provided internally by PHCS, PHCS will continue to report costs using the same sources and methodologies under the 2010 waiver with the P14s. Sources of data will include the Short Doyle Medi -Cal cost r eports (SD/MC cost report) and mental health databases which are utilized for determining number of uninsured mental health units of service. For substance abuse services provided internally by PHCS, PHCS will rely on the SUD cost reports as well as intern al records to identify the number of uninsured units of service and associated costs. For non -traditional services, to determine costs, PHCS will look to various data sources to estimate costs which shall include general ledger for direct costs, internal records, logs and stats, time studies and invoices for contracted services. In estimating the costs incurred for these non- traditional services, PH CS will utilize all these sources to identify direct costs where applicable and for other costs, will apport ion the time spent by the provider and intensity of services to calculate a cost per service.

State of California\u2014 Health and Human Services Agency Dep artment of Health Care Services JENNIFER KENT ED MUND G. BROWN JR. DIRECTOR GOVERNOR Seniors and Persons with Disabilities Evaluation Design September 2016 Background Under t he aut hority o f California's S ection 1115 Medicai d Waiver, B ridge to Reform, C alifornia transitioned i ts Seniors a nd Persons w ith SPDs ) population fro m the Medi -Cal fee- for- service (FFS) delivery system into the managed care delivery system (i.e., enrolled into Medi-Ca l managed care health plans (MCPs)) between June 2011 and May 2012. Specifically, the Special Terms and Conditions (STCs ) of the Bridge to Reform Waiver included requirements about information and communication s trategies that address the unique needs of SPDs, approaches to assignment and opportunities for c hanges i n MCPs , participant r ights, sa feguards and c ontractual provisions r egarding care coordination and l inkages to other se rvice delivery sy stems, per son-centered approaches t o service planning and del ivery, and phys ical and geographic acce ssibility of s ervice providers. The transition occu rred in Two- Plan and Geographic Managed Car e (GMC) pl an model counties, 16 counties in total , located across C alifornia. M andatory enr ollment o f SPDs i n managed ca re and t he aforementi oned requirements w ere continued u nder the State's ection 1115 Medicai d Waiver r enewal, Medi -Cal 2020. Evaluation Objectives The M edi-Cal 2020 STCs require t he State to c omplete an as sessment, u sing p re-mandatory enrollment as a base line, o f the impact on m andatory manag ed care on the S PD popul ation, i ncluding all significant and notabl e findings base d on all o f the dat a accu mulat ed throug h the quarterly pr ogress report. T he evaluation must address t hree areas: access to care; quality of ca re; and cost of co verage. The bel ow descr iption sets forth the State's design for t he SPD t ransition evaluation. This design approach was se lected becaus e it co nsider s cost o f care, q uality of care, a nd ac cess t o care, al l of which provide a picture o f the beneficiary 's experience and impact t o the State's ad ministration of the program ov erall. The m easures selected were chosen because t hey pr ovide indicators of the beneficiary's experience and resultant health outcomes when accessing car e through a delivery system . They are tied t o the specific heal th car e needs o f SPDs and t heir specific ca re needs due to diagnosis and t he ex istence of , at times , multiple complex conditions. Evaluator Selection The S tate will c ontract w ith an i ndependent entity and ensure that the ent ity is free of co nflict of i nterest to conduct an evaluati on of the SPD transition to t he Medi -Cal m anaged c are delivery sy stem. The State will co ntract w ith an entity t hat does no t have a direct r elations hip to t he State of California, Department o f Health Care Services ( DHCS). A d ata use a greement w ill be included i n the co ntract t o Department of Health Care Services | Managed Care Quality and Monitoring Division Page 2 allow for the sharing of data with and access to data by the independent entity for purposes of conducing the SPD transition evaluation. The State will seek application(s) from interested entities that have been identified based on prior experience and expertise in analyzing the experience of the population and working with the data that would be analyzed. Proposals will be scored; if a minimal score is not achieved, the State will seek proposals from additional entities. Evaluation Methods G eneral Approach The evaluation will meet the standards of leading academic institutions and academic journals. Data will be reported at the beneficiary, provider, health plan, and statewide levels. Significant attention will be given to ensuring use of the best available data and the cleanliness of it when utiliz ed. When necessary, the data will be adjusted and/or controls will be put into place to maximize the use of the it. Should there be data limitations, the data will be modified as needed and only used appropriately so as not to misinterpret it. Any modifications and changes will be reported in the final evaluation report. The final evaluation report will also consider how the findings from the evaluation may or may not be generalized. The evaluation will compare pre- and post -transition data whenever possible. Research has shown that it can take up to two years for beneficiaries to become adjusted to a change in delivery system. Therefore, for the 16 transition counties, an analysis will be conducted of the experience of SPDs in FFS 24 months prior to the tr ansition and 24 months post -transition. For both pre- and post - transition analyses, socioeconomic and demographic factors will be considered including race/ethnicity, gender, age, geographic area, diagnosis, language, and other factors (as identified through a public comment process). Data from the California Department of Public Health will be utilized to overlay these demographic factors with applicable health disparity considerations such as average income, tobacco utilization, and crime rates. A menu of the same metrics will be used and compared for both the pre- and post -transition populations. Because additional data are available for the post -transition population and only certain assessed requirements exist for the post -transition managed care delivery system, additional metrics and data are available for it. All measures will be benchmarked against available state and national standards and benchmarks. For example, NCQA Medicaid benchmarks for performance will be utilized when possible. State vital statistics databases will be also used to report on the number of deaths by diagnosis. This information will be presented as a comparison across transition counties and non-transition counties. Data Sources and Types Qualitative and quantitative data available to DHCS both from data collected directly or collected in partnership with the State will be utilized. The evaluation will consider: process and outcomes measures (MCP encounter data, FFS claims, HEDIS) (pre - and post - transition); beneficiary satisfaction (Ombudsman, call center, grievances and appeals, beneficiary surveys) (post -transition); and administrative functions (beneficiary surveys) (post -transition). Department of Health Care Services | Managed Care Quality and Monitoring Division Page 3 Baseline Data and Pre- Transition Evaluation Baseline data that will be utilized to assess the pre- transition population will include FFS claims data, qualitative interviews including with beneficiaries, and HEDIS rates. The pre- transition analysis will review the beneficiary's experience 24 months prior to the transition beginning. The pre -transition evaluation will review access to care metrics which will provide an indication of the beneficiaries ' ability to access primary care providers within a close proximity to their residence while in FFS. In addition, the pre -transition evaluation will utilize HEDIS metrics to determine access to services. They will be calculated administratively using FFS claims data for the pre- transition period. Costs associated with average annual costs and avoidable costs will be considered as well. All of the aforementioned factors will provide a baseline understanding of the SPD beneficiary's overall experience when care was received through the FFS delivery system. The data measures and sources that will be used to measure the pre -transition experience consists of, but are not limited to: a. A ccess to Care i. Network Access 1. Time and distance - average number of miles to primary care provider from beneficiary residence 2. Type of available specialists Data Sources: California provider enrollment data ii. HEDIS rates (see quality of care metrics below) b. Quality of Care (for beneficiaries transitioned to managed care) i. HEDIS/EAS rates stratified measures by SPD/Non- SPD (see attached for NCQA measure specifications) 1. All-Cause Readmissions - NCQA a. Ambulatory Care - NCQA i. Outpatient visits ii. Emergency department visits 2. Annual Monitoring for Patients on Persistent Medications - NCQA 3. Comprehensive Diabetes Care (8 indicators) - NCQA 4. Rate of post -discharge follow -up after hospitalization or ED visit - NCQA Data Sources: The State will use FFS claims data to calculate performance rates for these measures. c. Cost of Coverage (for beneficiaries enrolled in the delivery system for a minimum of ten months and transitioned to managed care ) i. Average annual cost for Medi -Cal covered health 1 services per beneficiary ii. Avoidable institutionalization costs : 1. Ratio per 10,000 beneficiaries of and average cost per beneficiary for length of stays greater than ten days in an acute care hospital 1 California is in the process of determining whether or not county mental health and SUD costs will be included for purposes of this analysis.

Ratio per 10,000 beneficiaries of and average cost per beneficiary stay for length of stay s less than 60 days in a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) 3. Ratio per 10,000 beneficiaries of and average cost per beneficiary stay for length of stays less than 90 days in an acute hospital stay plus SNF iii. Average annual pharmacy costs per beneficiary iv. Ratio per 10,000 beneficiaries of and average emergency room costs for non- emergency visits (as defined by NCQA) Data Source(s): FFS claims and pharmacy data Post -Tr ansition Evaluation Different types of data will be used to analyze the post -transition beneficiary experience. The data will support analysis of the same metrics utilized in FFS as described above as well as additional data sets that are accessible through the managed care delivery system and an independent External Quality Review Organization (EQRO). HEDIS rates will be calculated utilizing MCP encounter data for hybrid measures; and audited EQRO data will be utilized for admin measures. This will allow for an equal comparison of the measures across the FFS and managed care delivery systems. Additionally, data collected by Carrie Graham, University of California at Berkeley, during a qualitative study will be utilized to gauge beneficiary satisfaction including care coordination (see attachment for additional information about the questions and findings from the study). Lastly, MCP network data which the State collects monthly, as well as MCP network certifications for the SPD transition, will also be utilized to support analysis of provider data and access. Moreover, other data sources will be utilized, such as calls to the Ombudsman, State Fair Hearing and Independent Medical Review (IMT) information, and grievances and appeals data. The State reports these data in the quarterly progress reports to CMS and serves as indicators regarding beneficiary experience. The combination of all of the aforementioned data sources will allow the State to analyze the beneficiary's experience post -transi tion in a comprehensive way. The data and measures that will be used to for post -transition include, but are not limited to, the following: i. Access to Care a. Network Access i. Time to primary care provider from place of residence ii. Type of available specialists in network iii. Out of network referrals and access 1. Frequency of out -of-network referrals per 10,000 beneficiaries a. Compared to non- SPD population iv. Ease of getting appointments with primary care doctor - Likert scale v.

The evaluation will also contain both performance metrics and a narrative description in order to present the full experience of SPDs during the transition. Upon submission of the draft SPD evaluation design to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) it will be shared publically. The document will be distributed via email to the State's stakeholder waiver distribution list and posted on the State's website for public comment. Specifically, the State will request comment on the evaluation approach and questions that the evaluation should address. It will also be presented and discussed at the State's Waiver Stakeholder Advisory Committee (SAC) and Managed Care Advisory Group (MCAG). Updates to the design will be made based on stakeholder comment received during these meetings or in writing. The design will be finalized in conjunction with the independent entity and submitted to CMS for final approval. Based on the methodology used to assess the pre- and post -transition population, the evaluation will provide recommendations for programmatic changes relating to access to and quality of care as well as Department of Health Care Services | Managed Care Quality and Monitoring Division Page 7 overall cost implications for the SPD population. The final evaluation report is due December 31, 2021 at the completion of the Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver. The findings from the assessment will allow DHCS to evaluate the experience of SPDs in the managed care delivery system as well as inform DHCS as to best practices and lessons learned. "}
