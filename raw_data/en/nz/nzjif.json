In this dissertation we do several analyzes for different kinds of structural connections a natural connection due to adhesion, a two-sided constraint connection, and a bolted jointed connection. This work ranges from the nano-scale, as in the adhesive contact, to the macro-scale, as in the bolted joint. First consider a natural connection in which adhesive contact and the resulting morphology of micro-/nano- scale beams/plates on a sinusoidal/grooved surface are the subject. There are three different ways to model this behavior: a) without induced tension as has been studied in a previous investigation; b) with the stiffening effect due to the contact regions being prevented from slipping axially, thereby inducing tension due to transverse displacement; c) the case with frictional slip regions which reduces the induced tension compared to case (b). This analysis uses continuum beam theory with bending and induced tension as needed. The three different models show significant quantitative differences. Now consider an elastic strip clamped between two rigid plates over a portion of its length. For this two-sided constraint connection, the correction for rotational stiffness within the support is taken into account. This rotational stiffness is determined by applying a distributed load (statically equivalent to a couple moment) to such a constrained infinite elastic strip in plane strain. The displacement profile is determined analytically and approximated by a straight line. The ratio of the applied moment to the slope of this line provides the rotational stiffness. Examples are given for a cantilever and a fixed- fixed plate/beam as well as for a clamped circular plate.

One example is templated assembly by selective removal (TASR), which has been shown to be able to selectively assemble microscale objects and biological cells by size into predetermined locations on a 2D surface based on the surface's geometry and acoustic excitation. Although directed assembly excels at ordering structures on exposed 2D surfaces, it is less well developed for forming 3D and hierarchical architectures such as are typically required for metamaterials, tissue engineering or medical diagnostic devices. One potential solution to the challenge of creating 3D and hierarchical systems using directed assembly is to integrate the assembly techniques with other microscale technologies such as microfluidics or the folding of 2D surfaces into the third dimension. However, the physics of directed assembly processes a not independent of their context, and applying directed assembly to folding and microfluidic systems requires that their physics be understood and taken into account. This research examines the engineering principles that underlie the integration of the TASR process into folding and microfluidic systems and demonstrates TASR's successful integration into these systems.

Here, the aim is to design network graphs and develop control algorithms for a class of MAS considering critical the interplay between network delays and network graphs. Specifically, the network graphs influence not only the stability of MAS guaranteed when delay is less than a certain margin, delay margin, but also the performance, reaching speed of agents to a common steady state (consensus).

However, disorganized network assembly and non-ideal constituent carbon nanotubes make macroscopic production-level networks significantly less ideal than individual carbon nanotubes. By creating covalently bonded molecular junctions in place of weaker van der Waals interactions, carbon electrical graphitization offers a way to improve the mechanical properties of the network with controlled current pulses. This study investigates the possibility of improving the mechanical performance of macro- scale carbon nanotube structures through electrical graphitization.

Much of this early work was focused on the attenuation of structure response using passive isolation and tuned absorber systems, but these devices tend to have limited effective bandwidths and they are unable to adapt to potential changes in the host structure or excitation spectra. The tuned vibration absorber (TVA) was originally developed to attenuate base structure response at a single, critical frequency yielding a destructive interference condition at that frequency. The TVA was intended to be disposable, sparing the host structure from expensive fatigue damage/degraded performance. Advances in this field have led to the development of passive tuning techniques where multiple resonances can be mitigated with a single, distributed TVA. In addition, further improvements can be made with the application of modern actuator/sensor technology and advanced control techniques including delayed and/or modal feedback. Previous research has shown that piezoelectric materials are quite effective sensors/ actuators for vibration control problems due to their fast response and high sensitivity/force generation. In addition, these materials are capable of simultaneous actuation/sensing when placed in a balanced capacitive bridge.

Given the important role these networks play in our daily life, science and economy, their understanding, mathematical description, prediction, and control have become a major intellectual and scientific challenge of the 21st century. In response, the field of Network Science has emerged, drawing on theories and methods including graph theory, statistical mechanics, data mining, inferential modeling, and social structure. In this dissertation, we focus on the application of Network Science in two distinct areas: network structure and health. In the first chapter, we explore the properties of physical networks, where the nodes and links are physical objects unable to cross each other. These non-crossing conditions constrain their layout geometry and affect how networks form, evolve and function. We developed a modeling framework that accounts for the physical reality of nodes and links, allowing us to explore how the non-crossing conditions affect the network geometry. For small link thicknesses, we observed a weakly interacting phase where the layout avoids the link crossings via local link rearrangements, without altering the overall layout geometry. Once the link thickness exceeds a critical threshold, a strongly interacting phase emerges, where multiple geometric quantities scale with link thickness. We observed a deep universality, finding that the observed scaling properties are independent of the underlying network topology. In the second chapter, we investigate the role that diet plays in the development of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).

Concerns about the environmental impact of greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels have promoted the use of alternative sources of energy. These include renewable biomass and organic wastes (both agricultural and post-consumer). Options include firing these alternative fuels in dedicated boilers or co-firing them with coal in existing coal-fired boilers, as such infrastructure is already available, and it only requires limited modifications. In both cases, knowledge on the details of the pyrolysis and combustion behaviors of these fuel types is needed. Thus, in this work investigations have been conducted where: (i) Torrefaction, pyrolysis and combustion characteristics of pulverized biomass (woody, herbaceous and crop wastes) were assessed. Pyrolysis and combustion of raw and torrefied biomass particles took place under high heating rates and temperatures, similar to those prevailing in utility furnaces. Using optical and scanning electron microscopy it was determined that biomass particles undergo fusion and melting, and thereby their typical initial needle shapes transform to spheroidal or elliptical shapes. (ii) Combustion details of biomass were investigated by burning individual biomass particles, both raw and torrefied, of a priori-know mass, size and shape, under experimental conditions that are suitable for utility boilers. Based on a combination of these experimental techniques and appropriate numerical modeling it was determined that torrefied biomass chars that are formed under high heating rates and high temperature conditions burned as thin-wall cenospheres. (iii) A methodology was established for finding the torrefied biomass grind size that is suitable for firing or co- firing with coal in existing pulverized fuel boilers.

Syngas, or synthesis gas, and Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) fuel has gained considerable attention in recent years due to its clean combustion behavior when compared to the conventional fuels. Theoretical predictions on ignition delay time and laminar burning speed of GTL and mixture of JP-8/syngas have been investigated using a detailed kinetic model (DKM). In thermodynamics, gas dynamics and many other fields it is very important to determine the non-equilibrium behavior of a system. The most accurate way to do this is to set up and solve the detailed kinetic model. Since the DKM contains rate equations for every variable, the model may become very complicated when it is applied to a system that is three-dimensional and has many species or even coupled with turbulent model. Sometimes it is impossible to solve the model numerically because of the wide range of time and length scales. Rate- controlled constrained-equilibrium (RCCE) is a method which can help reduce the modeling and computational efforts. In this dissertation, fundamentals of RCCE and the development of different RCCE models are presented. The RCCE method is described in detail and then applied on methane, propane and butane combustions. Comparison between RCCE, DKM and shock tube experimental data show good performance of RCCE prediction on ignition delay times.
