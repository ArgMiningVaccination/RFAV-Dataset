Chrysanthemum flowers come in many varieties, but the one we offer is a particular varietal called [Royal Chrysanthemum](https://the-qi.com/products/organic-chrysanthemum-flower-tea) as it was specifically gifted to the Royal family at the time. Chrysanthemum tea/infusion is made by infusing boiling hot water with the whole flower, which releases a wide variety of antioxidants, organic compounds, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and soothing chemicals into the tonic, making it one of the most nourishing and delightful drink. Its medicinal uses have been known for centuries, making it highly sought after by natural healers. VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: While all varietals of the Chrysanthemum flowers are considered edible flowers, but not all Chrysanthemums are cultivated as food grade to be ingested or used for flower tea. Please do not eat or drink Chrysanthemums from your florists or local super markets as they are NOT grown for ingestion, they are grown ONLY for decoration and are generally speaking full of pesticides/chemicals or pests/diseases.

By lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels, some reports even say this herbal flower tea can be a long-term preventative measure for different cardiovascular issues, such as heart attacks and strokes, as well as atherosclerosis. This lowered blood pressure is mainly attributed to the potassium content of the infusion, as potassium is a vasodilator. + Skin Care Super rich in beta-carotene in [chrysanthemum tea](https://the-qi.com/products/organic-chrysanthemum-flower-tea), which breaks down into vitamin A to serve different purposes in the body. Vitamin A behaves like an antioxidant in many ways and therefore eliminates oxidative stress and damaged cells in organ systems around the body. Chrysanthemum tea has long been used topically for this reason, as it can clear up skin irritation, redness, and chronic conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis. It also helps to generally reduce the signs of aging, as well as wrinkles and blemishes, thanks to the antioxidant content of the flowers. + Maintains Healthy Immune Function Vitamin C and A are both found in high concentrations within [chrysanthemum tea](https://the-qi.com/products/organic-chrysanthemum-flower-tea), and both of these vitamins are crucial for immune system health. Vitamin C stimulates the production of white blood cells and functions as an antioxidant to protect against free radicals. There are also quite a few minerals in chrysanthemum, such as magnesium, calcium, and potassium, all of which are necessary for a healthy immune system. + Helps Maintain Bone Health You don't often hear about a flower tea being ideal for bone health and the prevention of osteoporosis, but [chrysanthemum tea](https://the-qi.com/products/organic-chrysanthemum-flower-tea) as a super herbal flower tea's mineral content stands apart in many ways.
