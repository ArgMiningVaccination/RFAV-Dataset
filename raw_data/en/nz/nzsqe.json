The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations measured by ELISA in heterologous versus homologous schedules at 2 8 days after the second dose, with a non-inferiority criterion of the GMR ab ove 0\u00b763 for the on e-sided 98\u00b775% CI. The primary analysis was on the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done for all participants who received a dose of study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 27841311. Findings Between April 19 and M ay 14, 2021, 1072 participants were enrolled at a median of 9\u00b74 weeks after receipt of a single dose of ChAd ( n=540, 47% female) or BNT (n=532, 40% female). In ChAd-primed participants, geometric mean concentration (GMC) 28 days after a boost of S ARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in recipients of ChAd/m1273 ( 20 114 ELISA laboratory units [ELU]/mL [95% CI 1 8 160 to 22 (5597 ELU/mL [4756 to 6586]) recipients (1 971 ELU/mL [1718 to 226 2]) with ChAd/ChAd. In BNT- primed participants, no n-inferiority was shown for BNT/m1273 (GMC 22 978 ELU/m L [95% CI 2 0 597 to 25 636]) but not for BNT/NVX (8 874 ELU/mL [7 391 to 10 654]), compared with BNT/BNT (1 6 929 ELU/m L [15 025 to 19 with NT; however, NVX still induced an 1 8-fold rise in GMC 2 8 days after vaccination. There were 1 5 serious adverse events, none considered related to immunisation. Interpretation Heterologous second dosing with m 1273, but not NVX, increased transient systemic reactogenicity compared with homologous schedules. Multiple vaccines are appropriate to complete primary immunisation following priming with BNT or ChAd, facilitating rapid vaccine deployment globally and supporting recognition of such schedules for vaccine certification.

In early 2021, multiple countries implemented age restrictions for the ChAdOx1 n-CoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca, hereafter referred to as ChAd) after the emergence of vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, and recent pauses in immunisation of young people with mRNA vaccines due to concerns about myocarditis. 5-8 Such changes have disrupted roll-out plans, and have the potential to do so in future. Additionally, concerns about waning vaccine immunity, and the potential for existing schedules to protect against new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have led to questions on the optimisation of vaccine schedules. 9 Heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccination might be useful in responding to these challenges. Many national immunisation advisory groups implemented this strategy on a pragmatic basis following ChAd-related vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis events before evidence had accrued. 10-12 Since then, a number of studies have shown an acceptable short-term safety profile of ChAd and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, hereafter referred to as BNT) heterologous vaccination, although with some transient increased reactogenicity. 13-17 There is accruing evidence that the use of an mRNA boost after adenoviral-vector prime might enhance humoral and cellular responses against SARS-CoV-2, and that this response translates to efficacy against COVID-19. 8,14-16,18-29 The only other available data regarding heterologous schedules comes from preprints that suggest that adenoviral vaccines might be an effective boost for inactivated whole-virion prime. 30,31 To date, there are no published data from randomised controlled trials examining the immunogenicity and safety of heterologous schedules of primary course COVID-19 vaccination with mixed mRNA, and none examining regimes containing a protein-subunit vaccine. NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax, hereafter referred to as NVX), a Matrix-M adjuvanted recombinant nanoparticle spike protein vaccine, has shown safety and efficacy in phase 3 trials and has been submitted to multiple regulatory agencies, including WHO, for licensing. 32 This vaccine can be transported and stored at standard refrigeration temperatures, making it particularly suitable for deployment in low-resource settings. 33 An mRNA vaccine mRNA-1273 (Moderna, hereafter referred to as m1273) has also shown high efficacy in clinical trials, with an acceptable safety profile, although with appreciable reactogenicity after second dose. 34 We have previously reported on the preliminary results of the Com-COV study, a randomised controlled trial of Research in context Evidence before this study Most high-income countries have now vaccinated their adult populations with a primary course of COVID-19 vaccine, but deployment remains low across lower income regions. Heterologous prime-boost schedules are a measure that could enhance deployment flexibility and improve access to vaccines. Evidence to support the use of mixed schedules is rapidly evolving. We searched PubMed for articles published between database inception and Oct 20, 2021 using the terms \"(COVID) AND (heterologous) AND (vaccin*) NOT (BCG)\" with no language restrictions. An additional search was done of the medRxiv preprint server. There are few randomised controlled trials examining heterologous schedules, but many observational comparator was included, reactogenicity appeared increased in heterologous boost, but was tolerated. There were no safety concerns identified in any study. Heterologous schedules were immunogenic, with mRNA boost after ChAd prime inducing higher concentrations of neutralising antibodies when compared with homologous ChAd. mRNA boost after ChAd prime induced a T-cell response above that of homologous comparators. Adenoviral-vectored boost after inactivated prime appears to enhance immunogenicity over that of inactivated prime-boost.Added value of this studyThese data are the first from a randomised controlled trial of COVID-19 vaccines of heterologous mRNA boost and protein-subunit boost. We have shown that reactogenicity at boost is consistently increased in heterologous versus homologous schedules of ChAd and mRNA vaccines, but not increased by NVX-CoV2373 (NVX) boost after ChAd or BNT prime. mRNA-1273 as a heterologous boost after ChAd or BNT prime induces a higher binding and neutralising antibody response than either homologous schedule. Heterologous boost with NVX after ChAd prime was superior to homologous ChAd for induction of humoral and cellular immunity. NVX after BNT prime did not meet non-inferiority criteria for binding antibodies when compared with homologous BNT; however, in a non-randomised comparison, binding antibody concentrations were still well above the geometric mean concentration observed following ChAd/ChAd. Decrements in neutralising antibody responses to beta and delta variants of concern were largely conserved across schedules, whereas T-cell responses were not affected. Implications of all the available evidence This study adds to the body of evidence that heterologous COVID-19 vaccination is safe, tolerated, and immunogenic. Flexibility of schedules should be considered to improve access to COVID-19 vaccination globally.Articleswww.thelancet.com Published online December 6, 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02718-5 3NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK (Prof V Libri MD); Infection Research Group, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Hull, UK (P J Lillie PhD); University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK (D P J Turner, PhD); Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK (D P J Turner); National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK (P J Turner PhD); Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham School of Medicine, Nottingham, UK (Prof J S Nguyen-Van-Tam DM); Oxford NIHR\u2014Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK (M D Snape) Correspondence to: Dr Matthew D Snape, Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK matthew.snape@paediatrics.ox.ac.uk See Online for appendixChAd and BNT heterologous vaccination.8,13 Here, we present findings from the related Com-COV2 study, a non- inferiority randomised controlled trial examining safety, and hetero logous COVID-19 regimens including m1273 and NVX as boost vaccines for people who received a first dose of ChAd or BNT in the community COVID-19 vaccination programme in the UK, given after the prime at 8-12 weeks. Methods Study design Com-COV2 is a UK multicentre, single-blinded, randomised, phase 2, non-inferiority investigating the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of hetero logous boost COVID-19 vaccine schedules. Recruitment occurred at nine National Health Service and academic institutions in England (appendix p 4). The trial was reviewed and approved by the South-Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (21/SC/0119), the University of Oxford, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Most participants were enrolled into the general cohort while a subset (n=150, selected on the basis of site capacity and participant availability) were enrolled into an immuno - logy cohort that had mucosal and salivary samples collected, along with two additional blood tests to explore the kinetics of the immune responses. We report the primary endpoint results, and reacto - genicity profile from the day 28 visit. Safety data were collected up until Oct 5, 2021. The protocol is provided in the appendix (pp 45-123), and online. Participants The study inclusion criteria were being aged 50 years or older and having received a single dose of either ChAd or BNT by routine immunisation 8-12 weeks earlier. Important exclusion criteria were history of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, comorbidities that were considered severe or poorly controlled, anaphylaxis or allergy to a vaccine component, pregnancy, or intent to conceive, breastfeeding, and use of anticoagulants. Full details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the protocol (appendix pp 69-71). Randomisation and masking Computer generated randomisation lists were prepared by the study statistician. Participants were randomised (1:1:1) to receive a single dose of either the same vaccine as their prime dose (BNT or ChAd homologous schedule), m1273, or NVX (heterologous schedules). Randomisation was done by random block sizes of three and six. Randomisation was stratified by study site, cohort (immunology or general), and prime vaccine (ChAd/BNT). Clinical research nurses who were not involved in endpoint evaluation did the randomisation using REDCap version 10.6.13 and prepared and administered the vaccine.Participants were masked to boost vaccine allocation at enrolment. Blinding was maintained by completing pages and by preparing vaccines out of sight of participants, and use of the same syringe type across vaccines, with the drawn volume concealed by applying a masking tape. Following the introduction of COVID-19 vaccine certification in the UK, the study was amended on June 21, 2021, to allow individual participant unblinding where necessary to prevent disadvantage in accessing facilities or travel. This took place after all participants had completed the 28 day postvaccination diary monitoring period. Staff involved in study delivery, including in the assessment of adverse events, were aware of vaccine allocation. Laboratory staff processing the immunology samples remained blinded to vaccine allocation. Procedures Participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria at the online screening (and additional subsequent telephone screening for some participants) were invited to attend a screening and enrolment visit (day 0). Participants who met final eligibility criteria and provided written informed consent were randomly assigned to a study group and vaccinated at the day 0 visit. Baseline haematological and biochemical blood tests were taken before vaccination at day 0. Four vaccines were used in this study. ChAd was given as a 0\u00b75 mL intramuscular injection into the upper arm. BNT was given as a 0\u00b7 3 mL intramuscular injection into the upper arm. m1273 was given as a 0 \u00b75 mL intramuscular injection into the upper arm, and NVX as a 0\u00b7 5 mL intramuscular dose injection into the upper arm. Participants were observed for at least 15 min after vaccination. During the day 0 visit, participants were given an oral thermometer, tape measure, and diary card (electronic or paper) to record solicited, unsolicited, and medically attended adverse events with instructions. Study-site physicians reviewed the diary card regularly to identify, clinically action, and record adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and serious adverse events, with additional recording of events that were not entered into the diaries collected in person at study visits. The follow-up visit schedule can be found in the protocol (appendix pp 116-17). Participants were instructed to notify trial teams if they received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the community. They were then invited for a study visit to allow for clinical assessment, collection of blood samples, and a nasopharyngeal swab, and were asked to complete a COVID-19 symptom diary for 7 days. Sera were analysed at Nexelis (Laval, QC, Canada) to determine SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations by ELISA (reported as ELISA laboratory units [ELU]/mL) and the 50% neutralising antibody titre (NT 50) pseudotype virus neutralisation assay, using a vesicular adapted to bear the 2019-nCOV SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 35 The conversion factors For the protocol online see https://comcovstudy.org.ukArticles4 www.thelancet.com Published online December 6, 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02718-5to international standard units can be found in the appendix (pp 3-4). Sera from day 0 were analysed at Porton Down, Public Health England, by ECLIA (Cobas platform, Roche Diagnostics) to determine anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleo - capsid IgG status (reported as negative if below a cutoff index of 1\u00b7 0). The samples from the immunology cohort (n=25) were also tested at Porton Down, UK Health Security Agency to measure the normalised 80% neutralising antibody titre (NT 80) for live SARS-CoV-2 virus (lineage Victoria/01/2020) by micro neutralisation assays.35 For participants from five of nine selected sites, IFN- secreting T cells specific to whole spike protein epitopes, designed based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence (YP_009724390.1), were detected using a modified T-SPOT-Discovery test done at Oxford Immunotec (Abingdon, UK) within 32 h of venepuncture, using the addition of T-Cell Xtend reagent to extend peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) survival. Participants at the other four sites did not have these taken as their sites were too far from the processing laboratory to enable sample integrity. T-cell frequencies were reported as spot forming cells (SFC) per 250 000 PBMCs with a lower limit of detection of one in 250 000 PBMCs. Intracellular cytokine staining was done on cryopreserved PBMCs, stimulated 16 h with SARS-CoV-2 antigens (based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence). Cells were stained with viability dye and fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to CD3, CD4, and CD8 and further stained fluorochrome-conjugated to IFN-, TNF-, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Data are presented as percentage of CD4 or CD8 T cells expressing specific cytokines. 36 Samples collected at day 28 after boost immunisation from a subgroup of seronegative participants (roughly 50 per arm) were selected pragmatically to test immun - ogenicity against Victoria/01/2020 (representative of wild-type), beta, and delta variants. Cryopreserved samples were tested against full spike protein from these variants using ELISpot at Oxford Immunotec. assays to determine focus reduction neutralisation titres (FRNT 50) for live SARS-CoV-2 virus lineages (Victoria/01/2020, beta variant B.1.351, delta variant B.1.617 .1) were done at the University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. The reduction in the number of infected foci is compared with a negative control well without an antibody. 37 Outcomes The primary outcome was non-inferiority of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentration 28 days after heterologous boost in comparison with homologous boost (the geometric mean ratio [GMR]) in participants who were seronegative for SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG at enrolment. Secondary outcomes included safety and reactogenicity, measured through local and systemic solicited adverse events for 7 days after the boost, unsolicited adverse events for 28 days after the boost, medically attended adverse events up to 3 months after boost, and adverse events of special interest and serious adverse events throughout the study. Haematological and biochemical blood parameters were measured at day 0 and day 28 after the boost for all participants, and additionally at day 7 for those in the immunology cohort. Full definitions of safety outcomes can be found in the protocol (appendix pp 95-103). Immunological secondary outcomes include titres, cellular IFN ELISpot) in peripheral blood, and intracellular cytokines. The full list of outcome measures can be found in the protocol (appendix pp 66-67). Statistical analysis The primary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG was carried out on a per-protocol basis. The per-protocol population consisted of participants who were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (defined by anti-nucleocapsid IgG negativity), had no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 14 days after boost vaccination, received the study vaccine as randomly assigned, had primary endpoint data available, and had no protocol deviations, whereas the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included the per-protocol population and participants with protocol deviations. The GMR was calculated as the antilogarithm of the difference between the mean of the log 10 transformed titre in the heterologous arms and the corresponding homologous arm as the reference adjusting for study site and cohort (general or immunology) in the linear regression model. Results are presented separately for participants primed with ChAd and BNT in the community. We did four primary comparisons and therefore we presented one-sided 98\u00b775% CIs to adjust for multiple testing for the primary outcome. Non-inferiority of a heterologous arm to its corresponding homologous arm was concluded if the lower 98\u00b775% CI of a GMR lay above the non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b763. This margin was chosen after discussion with policy makers and regulatory agencies to allow a sample size consistent with rapid study delivery, while still being close to the WHO criterion of 0\u00b767 for licensing of new vaccines. 38 We also presented geometric means, adjusted GMRs, and corresponding two-sided 95% CIs in the mITT population. A heterologous arm was considered superior to its homologous arm if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI lies above one, and the homologous boost arm was superior if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI lies below one. The analyses for secondary immunological outcome were also carried out among the mITT population. For all immunological outcomes, censored data reported as below the lower limit of detection or lower limit of quantification were imputed with a value equal to half of the threshold before tran - sformation. Correlations between different immunological outcomes were evaluated by Pearson correlation coe - fficients. Participants who received at least one dose of the Articleswww.thelancet.com Published online December 6, 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02718-5 5study vaccines were included in the safety analysis. The proportion of participants with at least one safety event was reported by vaccine schedule.The sample size calculation assumed a non-inferiority margin of a 0\u00b763 fold difference between the geometric mean concentration (GMC) in the heterologous and 180 assigned ChAd/ChAd 155 general 25 immunology 9 excluded 8 baseline seropositive 1 withdrew from trial before day 28181 assigned ChAd/m1273 157 general 24 immunology179 assigned ChAd/NVX 152 general 27 immunology175 assigned BNT/BNT 151 general 24 immunology177 assigned BNT/m1273 151 general 26 immunology180 assigned BNT/ NVX 155 general 25 immunology 180 received ChAd boost vaccination540 participants randomly assigned to receive boost vaccination 540 participants previously received ChAd prime1174 participants screened 1072 participants enrolled 921 general cohort 151 immunology cohort 181 received m1273 boost vaccination179 received NVX received per-protocol analysis 162 in per-protocol analysis 160 in per-protocol analysis 163 in per-protocol analysis 154 in per-protocol analysis 166 in per-protocol analysis 532 participants randomly assigned to receive boost vaccination 532 participants previously received BNT prime 14 excluded 10 baseline seropositive 2 withdrew from trial before day 28 2 unsuccessful venepunc-ture at day 2812 excluded 10 baseline seropositive 2 unsuccessful venepunc-ture at day 288 excluded 8 baseline seropositive 102 excluded 80 did not complete screening22 ineligible for inclusion 13 excluded 12 baseline seropositive 1 unsuccessful venepunc-ture at day 288 excluded 6 baseline seropositive 2 unsuccessful venepuncture at day 28 7 excluded 7 deviation on timing of blood sample for primary endpoint5 excluded 1 received vaccine not as assigned 4 deviation on timing of blood sample for primary endpoint7 excluded 1 deviation on timing of boost vaccination 6 deviation on timing of blood sample for primary endpoint4 excluded 4 deviation on timing of blood sample for primary endpoint10 excluded 1 missing anti-N at baseline 9 deviation on timing of blood sample for primary endpoint6 excluded 6 deviation on timing of blood sample for primary endpoint Figure 1: Trial profile BNT=BNT162b2 6, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02718-5homologous boost arms, a SD of 0\u00b7456 on log10 scale, and a true difference in GMC on log10 scale of zero.

Role of the funding source The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. Results From April 19 to May 14, 2021, 1174 participants across nine study sites in England were screened, with a total of 1072 enrolled and randomly assigned to a study group: 921 to the general cohort and 151 to the immunology cohort (figure 1). Recruitment was stratified by community prime vaccines, with 540 participants having received ChAd and 532 BNT. Study site recruitment by community prime is presented in the appendix (p 4). All participants were immunised. The median age of participants primed with ChAd was 63 years (range 50-75 years), 241 (45%) were female, and 50 (9%) were from minority ethnicities. In participants primed with BNT, the median age was 62 years (range 50-78 years), 210 (40%) were female, and 28 (5%) from minority ethnicities (table 1). There were higher rates of cardiovascular, respiratory, and diabetic comorbidity in the BNT primed groups; reflective of the earlier availa bility of BNT in the UK and vaccination prioritisation in the initial phases of the national vaccine roll-out. Median prime-boost interval was 9\u00b7 4 (range 4\u00b7 7-12\u00b70) weeks for the ChAd community-prime group, and 9 \u00b76 (8\u00b7 0-12\u00b7 0) weeks for the BNT community-prime group (table 1). Within each prime group, characteristics were well balanced between the three randomised arms, except for a male predominance in the BNT/NVX group (34% female; table 1). At baseline, 54 (5%) of 1072 participants were positive for anti-nucleocapsid IgG (cutoff index 1 \u00b70), with a range of 4-6% in the ChAd- primed groups and 3-7% in the BNT-primed groups (figure 1). Participants who received a community prime with ChAd had a SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG GMC at 28 days of 20 114 ELU/mL (95% CI 18 160 to 22 279) in the m1273 group, 5597 ELU/mL (4756 to 6586) in the NVX group, and 1971 ELU/mL (1718 to 2262) in the ChAd homologous group (per-protocol analysis; table 2). GMRs in the per-protocol (2\u00b72 to ) for ChAd/NVX when compared with ChAd/ ChAd, with lower limits of both the CIs above the non-inferiority margin. Similar GMRs were observed in the mITT population, and the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG Prime (range). BNT=BNT162b2 vaccine, Pfizer-BioNTech. were self-reported by participants, with review by study team doctor for assessment of severity. General practitioner confirmation was sought where needed. Included severities were those classified as mild, moderate, or well controlled. Single participant boosted in error at 33 days, protocol deviation.

In those who received BNT community prime, anti-spike IgG GMC was 22 978 ELU/mL (95% CI 20 597 to 25 636) in the m1273 group, 16 929 ELU/mL (15 025 to 19 075) in the BNT homologous group, and 8874 ELU/mL (7391 to 10 654) in the NVX group (per-protocol analysis, table 2). The BNT/m1273 group GMR 1 \u00b73 (one-sided 98\u00b775% CI 1 \u00b71 to ), with the lower limit of the CI above the non-inferiority margin, and was statistically superior to BNT/BNT. Although BNT/NVX did not meet the non-inferiority criterion at 0\u00b75 (one-sided 98\u00b775% CI 0 \u00b74 to ) there was an 18-fold rise (95% CI 15 to 21) from baseline (appendix pp 8-10). Similar results were reported for the mITT analysis (table 2). In the mITT population, the GMRs between the live virus neutralising antibody titres (normalised FRNT 50) against the Victoria strain, the live virus neutralising antibody titres (normalised NT 80 by neutralising (NT50) antibody titres from the mITT analysis at 28 days after boost are broadly consistent with those of binding antibodies (table 2).

Correlations between cellular and humoral responses show a moderate correlation for the ChAd/ChAd group (correlation coefficient of 0 \u00b746), and weak correlation (Pearson correlation coefficients <0 \u00b73) for all other schedules (figure 2A). There is a strong correlation between live neutralising assays done at national reference and local laboratories (figure 2D). In the modified intention-to-treat population, the GMCs of anti-spike IgG at baseline were 381 (95% CI 347-418) and 526 (480-577) in the populations previously immunised with ChAd and BNT, respectively. While an increase in antibody concentrations at day 7 compared with baseline was observed in all groups, these tended to remain stable or decrease across all groups by day 28 except those receiving an NVX-CoV2373 boost, where there was a further increase from day 7 to day 28 (figure 3, appendix pp 6-9). With regard to cellular responses, participants who had received a community prime with ChAd had numerically higher baseline frequencies than did the BNT groups; responses peaked in all groups at day 14 but were maintained above baseline at day 28 (figure 3B). Responses of intracellular cytokines to SARS-COV-2 spike peptides by flow cytometry at day 0 and 14 after boost were similar across groups, with a predominantly T-helper-1 cell response (appendix pp 11-14). In ChAd-primed groups, live virus neutralising antibody titres (FRNT 50) were reduced according to Figure 2: Correlation in the modified intention-to-treat population (A) SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG and cellular response by IFN- ELISpot cellular data only, n=582), (B) anti-spike IgG and live virus neutralising antibodies (the subset with live virus neutralising antibodies data only, n=289), (C) live virus neutralising antibodies and cellular response by IFN- ELISpot at 28 days after boost (the subset with live virus neutralising antibodies data only, n=289), (D) live virus neutralising antibodies tested at University of Oxford and those tested at Porton Down, UK Health Security Agency (the immunology cohort, n=123).

However, both heterologous groups maintained numerically higher titres than ChAd/ChAd, with the highest titres in ChAd/m1273 recipients, with GMRs of 15\u00b78 (95% CI 9\u00b76-26\u00b71) against the beta variant and 17\u00b74 (10\u00b72-29\u00b75) against the delta variant. Similarly, in BNT-primed groups, live virus neutralising antibody titres (FRNT 50) across groups were numerically lower against beta and delta variants than to Victoria (table 3). There was no evidence of a difference in neutralising activity against Victoria, beta, and delta variants between the BNT-primed groups. Across all groups, little difference was noted in cellular responses to variants (table 3, appendix p 15). Local and systemic reactions were more frequent after m1273 boost vaccination compared with the homologous boost groups, with feverishness reported by 60 (33%) of 181 recipients of ChAd/m1273 compared with nine (5%) of 176 recipients of ChAd/ChAd (difference 28%, 95% CI 20-36), and by 39 (22%) of 176 recipients of BNT/m1273, compared with 16 (9%) of 175 recipients of BNT/BNT (13%, 5-21; figure 4). Similar increases were observed for chills, fatigue, fever, headache, joint pain, malaise, muscle ache, and nausea (figure 4). Most of the increase in reactogenicity was observed within the 48 h after immunisation (appendix pp 18-19). By contrast, for NVX recipients, similar patterns were observed in systemic reactogenicity compared with the homologous study schedules. Local reactions were generally less frequent for NVX recipients, for example a difference in injection site pain of -49% (95% CI -50 to -30) for BNT/NVX compared with BNT/BNT. Paracetamol use mirrored the profile of systemic reactogenicity (appendix p 20). Between enrolment and Oct 5, 2021, there were 589 adverse events in 357 participants (appendix p 21). Numbers of adverse events were similar across vaccine groups. Descriptions of all non-serious adverse events of grade 3 or worse are presented in the appendix (pp 22-25). There were five adverse events of special interest (excluding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 events) and one deemed possibly related to study vaccination (eosinophilia, grade 2 severity; appendix p 26). 18 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had a COVID-19 episode after enrolment (appendix pp 26-28). All cases occurred at least 2 months after a boost, coinciding with an epidemiological surge of infection nationally. A single participant was hospitalised but did not require invasive ventilation (appendix pp 28-30). There were 15 serious adverse events, none of which was considered related to study vaccination since boost vaccination07 28 Days since boost vaccination07 28 Figure 3: Kinetics of immunogenicity by vaccine schedule Cellular response data were available in around 60% of sites, the other study sites did not collect plasma samples due to logistical challenges; data presented at day 7 and day 14 were from the immunology cohort only.

There were no notable differences in biochemical adverse events between groups, with some minor variations reported in white blood cell indices. A single participant had grade 3 neutropenia at enrolment and day 7, which progressed to grade 4 at day 28 and was reported as an unrelated serious adverse event. Discussion Findings from this trial demonstrate that the immuno - genicity of heterologous boost with m1273 following community prime with ChAd or BNT was non-inferior to the homologous-boost schedule. When heterologous boost was with NVX, only those primed with ChAd had titres of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG that were non-inferior to the homologous schedule, whereas BNT/NVX did not meet the non-inferiority threshold against homologous BNT. Nevertheless, within the limitations of comparing between non-randomised cohorts, SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG titres induced by BNT/NVX were still above that of homologous ChAd, a schedule with demonstrated effectiveness of 65-70% against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and over 90% against hospitalisation and death. 39 Additionally, the T-cell response across all groups was greatest with ChAd/NVX, which might prove important in terms of durability of protection and protection against new SARS-CoV-2 variants. 40 These data align with real- world evidence of robust effectiveness of mixed schedules against disease. 24-26 Together, these findings support use of the mixed schedules studied here in rapid and flexible global deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. Accordingly, these schedules should be widely recognised for travel and certification. Consistent with our previous results, schedules containing at least one mRNA dose showed the greatest binding and neutralising antibody responses, with the heterologous mRNA vaccination studied (BNT/m1273) generating a greater humoral immune response than the homologous BNT/BNT schedule.

ChAd/NVX showed the highest cellular response as measured by IFN- ELISPOT, and is similar to that seen with ChAd/BNT at a 28 day boost interval. 8 The ChAd/m1273 schedule also produced a substantial cellular response, whereas both heterologous and homologous mRNA schedules (BNT/m1273 and BNT/BNT) showed lower res ponses. Strikingly, the BNT/NVX schedule produced a response Figure 4: Severity of solicited local and systemic reactions in days 0-7 following boost vaccination by study arm as self-reported in participant electronic diaries Data are (A) local at vaccination site and (B) systemic.

These data do not show any convincing evidence of additional benefit of mixed schedules in maintaining neutralising activity against variants of concern, beyond that conferred by greater neutralising activity against the Victoria strain\u2014ie, the decrease in neutralising activity elicited by mixed and homologous schedules was broadly similar. However, for the BNT/NVX recipients, it is notable that the apparent differences in neutralising activity against Victoria were less evident when testing against beta and delta strains. Whether this result is an artefact of a relatively small sample size, or suggestive of better preservation of neutralisation against variants of concern for this schedule, this finding warrants further research. Consistent with previous work, the T-cell response was maintained across all variants of concern, regardless of the schedule. 40 This study supports our previous finding of mixed adenoviral-vectored and mRNA COVID-19 vaccine schedules being more reactogenic than homologous schedules, consistent with other studies examining BNT/ChAd. 13,41 Additionally, there was evidence of increased reactogenicity for the heterologous over the homologous mRNA schedule (BNT/m1273 vs BNT/BNT). This effect could be due to the mixing of different mRNA vaccines, or m1273 being more reactogenic than BNT, potentially consistent with higher mRNA dosage; however, it is not possible to differentiate these possible causes in our study. By contrast, there was no evidence of increased reactogenicity for the NVX containing schedules. Importantly, within the limits of the sample size of this study, none of the schedules raised any safety concerns. While most high-income countries have completed two-dose primary courses of COVID-19 vaccinations in adults, these data remain extremely relevant to the 94% of people in low-income countries who are yet to receive any doses. 1 Of the mixed schedules studied, perhaps the most relevant to these countries is the ChAd/NVX, given that neither of these vaccines require ultra-low temperature storage and the low cost of ChAd. NVX has recently been the subject of a WHO Emergency Use Licence and should become available under the COVAX scheme. 42 Furthermore data for mixed schedules across platforms could help to inform the use of third-dose boosters, in addition with data from CoV-BOOST (ISRCTN12348322) 43 and the recent work by Atmar and colleagues44 supporting use of mRNA vaccines for adenoviral-primed individuals. Such schedules could also allow avoidance of a second mRNA vaccine dose in adolescents, given concerns regarding myocarditis, and this hypothesis is being further studied in Com-COV3. 45,46 This study has a number of limitations. The age range (50-78 years) and ethnicity (90\u00b77% of participants primed with ChAd and 94\u00b77% of those primed with BNT self-identified as White) of the study cohort limit generalisability of the reactogenicity and immunology results to younger populations and people who are not of White ethnicity. These groups might be more likely to receive heterologous COVID-19 vaccine schedules as a primary course, given age-associated safety concerns with the use of ChAd, and logistic constraints in lower-income regions. 47 Any increased reactogenicity with heterologous regimes might be amplified in younger groups, as reported in studies of homologous vaccine schedules. 48-51 As participants were recruited after community prime, this dose was not randomised, meaning that some caution is required when comparing ChAd versus BNT community-primed groups, especially as there were higher rates of comorbidity in the BNT-primed groups. Additionally, the proportion of participants primed with ChAd versus BNT differed according to site, creating the potential for different amounts of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between the groups. This fact is especially important when comparing the number of breakthrough infections observed between ChAd-primed and BNT-primed groups. Due to logistical and pragmatic constraints, we were not able to incorporate a full comparative schedule for all vaccines, and thus cannot provide evidence for the use of mixed mRNA schedules in both permutations, nor the effect of prime with a protein-based vaccine followed by ChAd or mRNA. This research confirms previous evidence of mixed adenoviral and mRNA schedules as being safe, tolerable, and immunogenic alternatives to homologous schedules when given at an 8-12 weeks interval. It also provides new evidence on the response to mixed mRNA vaccinations in a randomised trial, and novel data for the incorporation of protein-based COVID-19 vaccines into heterologous schedules. These results provide reassurance that there are multiple appropriate options to complete primary immunisation in individuals primed with BNT or ChAd, which will facilitate rapid vaccine deployment globally.
