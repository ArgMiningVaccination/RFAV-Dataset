At Bionica Dental Wellness of Delafield, Dr. Holinbeck believes in caring for your whole health, not just your teeth and gums. Integrating naturopathic medicine with modern technology and experienced dentistry, she and our very own naturopathic doctor, Dr. Brian Borden, will treat your problem while keeping your full body in mind. How does this work? For example, if you were to see Dr. Holinbeck for a toothache, she will do more than just treat the symptoms. She will look for the initial cause and find the appropriate method to treat and improve your condition. This helps you avoid repeated treated for the same symptoms. The goals of naturopathic medicine are to utilize the most natural, least toxic approaches, identify the root cause, rather than treat the symptoms, teach and prioritize prevention, and harness the body's natural ability to heal itself.

Dr. Brian Borden earned his Doctorate of Naturopathy from the United States School of Naturopathy in Georgia. Passionate about being able to treat the root causes of various health problems instead of just their symptoms, Dr. Borden is trained in using Computerized Bio-Resonance Screening, which is a bio-feedback that detects any imbalances, deficiencies, or obstacles the body might face that can impede wellness. Helping individuals combat their dental problems since 2002, he has made it possible for patients to better understand how their dental health impacts their overall well-being. True naturopathic doctors have received training from accredited naturopathic colleges and programs. Doctors who study and specialize in this type of medicine often follow a similar formula for diagnosing and treating patients. This includes everything from evaluating a person's overall health to determine what negative entities must be removed in order to achieve optimal health, to using alternative, non-pharmaceutical means to safely treat, restore, and improve the body, mouth, mind, and spirit. Similar to a holistic dentist like Dr. Holinbeck, naturopathic doctors believe in identifying the underlying problem (root cause), providing individualized care, and working with the patient to make changes to their lifestyle in an effort to improve and restore full-body health. At Bionica Dental Wellness of Delafield, Dr. Holinbeck works closely with like-minded providers who can help to provide a total-body approach. While she can offer a wide array of services in order to help a patient achieve better oral and overall health, she will provide referrals to other professionals who can assist in preventing problems from developing in the future.
