A screening test is done to find possible disorders or diseases in people who don't have any symptoms. The goal is to find a disease early so lifestyle changes can be made and you can be watched more closely to reduce the risk of disease, or to detect it early enough to treat it most effectively. Screening tests are not considered diagnostic, but are used to determine if more testing is needed. Although you and your healthcare provider may decide that a different schedule is best for you, this plan can guide your discussion. | | Screening | | Who needs it | | How often | | Alcohol misuse | | All adults | | At routine exams | | Blood pressure | | All adults | | Yearly checkup if your blood pressure is normal* Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg* If your blood pressure reading is higher than normal, follow the advice of your healthcare provider | | Colorectal cancer | | All men of average risk in this age group | | According to the American Cancer Society: Several tests are available and used at different times. For tests that find polyps and cancer: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years1, or - Colonoscopy every 10 years, or - CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) every 5 years For tests that primarily find cancer: - Yearly fecal occult blood test2, or - Yearly fecal immunochemical test every year2, or - Stool DNA test, every 3 years You will need a follow-up colonoscopy if you choose any test other than a colonoscopy and you have an abnormal result. Screening recommendations vary among expert groups. Talk with your healthcare provider about which test is best for you. Some people should be screened using a different schedule because of their personal or family history. Talk with your provider about your health history. | | Depression | | All men in this age group | | At routine exams | | Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes | | All men beginning at age 45 and men without symptoms at any age who are overweight or obese and have 1 or more additional risk factors for diabetes | | At least every 3 years | | Type 2 diabetes | | All men with prediabetes | | Every year | | Hepatitis C | | Men at increased risk for infection - talk with your healthcare provider | | At routine exams (All men age 50 to 70 should be tested once for hepatitis C.) | | High cholesterol and triglycerides | | All adults | | At least every 5 years | | HIV | | All men | | At routine exams | | Lung cancer | | Adults age 50 to 80 who have smoked | | Yearly screening in smokers with 20 pack-year history of smoking or who quit within 15 years | | Obesity | | Anyone at increased risk | | At routine exams | | BMI (body mass index) | | All men in this age group (3) | | Every year, to help find out if you are at a healthy weight for your height | | Prostate cancer | | Starting at age 45, talk to health care provider about risks and benefits of digital rectal exam (DRE) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening*** | | At routine exams | | Syphilis | | Anyone at increased risk for infection | | At routine exams | | Tuberculosis | | Anyone at increased risk for infection | | Check with your healthcare provider | | Vision | | All men in this age goupr3 | | Ask your healthcare provider if you need glaucoma screening with a dilated eye exam every 2 years | | Counseling | | Who needs it | | How often | | Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events | | Men ages 45 to 79 when potential benefits from a decrease in heart attacks outweigh the harm or risks from an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage | | When diagnosed with risk for cardiovascular/heart disease; check with your healthcare provider before starting | | Diet and exercise | | Adults who are overweight or obese | | When diagnosed and at routine exams | | Sexually transmitted infection prevention | | Anyone at increased risk for infection | | At routine exams | | Tobacco use and tobacco-related disease | | All adults | | Every exam | | Immunization | | Who needs it | | How often | | Tetanus/diphtheria/ pertussis (Td/Tdap) booster | | All adults | | Td: every 10 years Tdap: substitute a 1-time dose of Tdap for a Td booster after age 18, then boost with Td every 10 years | | Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) | | Men in this age group through their late 50s who have no previous infection or record of vaccines** | | 1 or 2 doses; check with your healthcare provider | | Chickenpox (varicella) | | Adults ages 50 to 64 who have no previous infection or record of vaccines** | | 2 doses; second dose should be given at least 4 weeks after the first dose | | Flu (seasonal) | | All adults | | Yearly, when the vaccine becomes available in the community | | Hepatitis A | | Men at risk4 | | 2 or 3 doses (depending on the vaccine) given at least 6 months apart; check with your healthcare provider | | Hepatitis B | | Men at risk5 | | 2 or 3 doses (depending on the vaccine) over 6 months; check with your healthcare provider.
