[SNIP] The burden of proof is not on me to prove that people get well. [SNIP] Yes it is. It always is. You have to demonstrate safety and efficacy through a prescribed manner. So what you're saying is... [SNIP] Did you really think that was a cogent, logical argument instead of a pile of straw? \"Must be made sick again.\" Right then. You can go fuck yourself with the rest of the nutcases. immune systems exist, however BLEACH is a poison and even non fatal doses can impact someone for the rest of their lives[SNIP] The burden of proof is not on me to prove that people get well. [SNIP] Yes it is. It always is. You have to demonstrate safety and efficacy through a prescribed manner. So what you're saying is that if someone gets well and Mr Pharma or his government agent doesn't know why and it was not via an \"approved\" method, that person must be made sick again? Did I get that right? Just read it again and think about it. There is no burden of proof when someone gets well to show how or why that person got well.=, especially of that person chose his own course of action. Of course in a CDC/FDA controlled world, that would be the case, as it was in Nazi Germany or Mao's China, but that's not the way to move forward. Put your head out of the sand man! We're not talking about some new complex pharmaceutical concoction, we're talking about a simple weak oxidant that has been safely used for almost a century and it being injected by thousands daily with not a single person dying due to it. Can your \"science based pharma industry\" claim that? Of course they can't. Still waiting for a video of lifeboy ingesting a 100 mg/l solution of CLO2. It should be entertaining. And who are the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing? Well, I usually don't link to dangerous hucksters' sites, but this one's worth walking through because it's such an absolutely shameless embarrassment that anybody who sees it will probably be less likely to fall for this stuff.Disclaimer: The protocols described on this site are official sacraments of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing.

Eat shit and dieOk everyone, including the Marxist Bernie fans: take a deep breath and relax a little. Let this sink in: 1. The coronavirus is destroyed by chlorine dioxide. This should be used as wide and as far a possible to prevent spreading by other means than direct transmission between humans. 2. Chlorine dioxide, in the proper but low dosage, is totally SAFE and NOAEL for humans so despite what some industry stooges at the CDC have said in the past, it can be used to treat infected persons and with great success. So do a little homework! The research is well established and easily accessible. Unless of course you're not interested in health, but rather support some sinister agenda (like the Georgia Guidestones' goal to wipe out 80% of humanity). Lowering a CDC budget so they can focus on their core function, is indeed a good thing. Trump should go further and stop the revolving door between drug industry executives and the CDC and FDA so that these organisation can stop being shills for industry to the large extent that they have become in the last few decades.
