This document will be updated on an ongoing basis. New: [These FAQs address required COVID-19 vaccination of health care workers in Maine.](https://www.maine.gov/covid19/vaccines/public-faq/health-care-worker-vaccination) Maine COVID-19 Vaccine FAQ Vaccine Eligibility - Who is eligible for vaccination now? - Anyone 6 months and older is eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in Maine. Note that only the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are authorized for children from 6 months - 17 years of age. The Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson / Janssen vaccines are all available for individuals 18 and older. - Can residents from other states get vaccinated for COVID-19 in Maine, if they are otherwise eligible? - Yes. - Are youth under the age of 18 eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine? - Yes. The Pfizer vaccine is authorized for ages 6 months to 4yrs, 5-11 & 12 to 17. The Moderna vaccine is authorized for 6 months-5yrs, & 6 -17 years of age. The Johnson & Johnson / Janssen) is not authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 vaccination for those under age 18 at this time. The Novavax vaccine is authorized for those 18 years and older. - Where can youth 6+ months get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine? - The State of Maine's [listing of vaccination sites](https://www.maine.gov/covid19/vaccines/vaccination-sites)will indicate which sites are accepting appointments for youth. The Community Vaccination Line (1-888-445-4111) will also be available to provide information regarding vaccine and clinic availability. - Is consent from a parent or legal guardian required for individuals under the age of 18 to receive a COVID-19 vaccine? - Yes. Parental or guardian consent can be obtained in two ways. Option 1: The first option for consent is by phone with a witness listening on the phone line as arranged by the vaccination site. Telephone registration staff can write \"verbal consent obtained\" on the guardian/parent signature line followed by their signature. And a witness can write \"witnessed personally\" followed by their signature. Option 2: The second option is to provide consent on paper or electronically. Each vaccination site has a consent form. Such consent forms can be mailed in advance to vaccination sites, emailed to vaccination sites, or brought to sites at the time of registration. A small number of youth may give their own consent for COVID-19 vaccination. This includes youth who: - Are living separately from parents/legal guardian and independent of parental support. (A minor may prove he/she meets this exception with certain documentation, including a written statement signed by (1) the director or designee of a government or nonprofit agency that provides services to individuals experiencing homelessness, (2) a school social worker or counselor, or (3) an attorney representing the minor, or proof of filing for emancipation or a copy of a protection from abuse complaint or a temporary order or final order of protection against the minor's parent or legal guardian); - Are or were legally married; - Are or were a member of the Armed Forces of the U.S.; - Have been emancipated by the court. - What type of identification is needed to verify a youth's eligibility at the vaccine clinic? - In recognition that youth have less documentation of age, parents or guardians can attest to the eligibility of a youth in their care. Vaccine sites can also check the State immunization registry, ImmPact, to verify the date of birth of a person under 18 years-old. Scheduling Your Vaccination - How will people be told when a vaccine may be available for them? - People will learn about access to vaccines through the Maine CDC, employers, and their medical providers, and this website. - Should I call my local town office, fire, or police department to speed up my chances of being vaccinated? - No. Doing so could interfere with their ability to deliver essential services. - Why are there no appointments at a site on the Maine website that says it is open to the public? - A clinic may close registration when available vaccine slots are exhausted. - I am now age-eligible. Will my doctor's office contact me to help me get vaccinated? - Some but not all doctors' offices will be reaching out to patients. Maine is listing sites open to the public on [www.maine.gov/covid19/vaccines/vaccination-sites](https://www.maine.gov/covid19/vaccines/vaccination-sites)or search \"Maine COVID vaccine sites\" and click the official website link. - I lost my vaccination card. What should I do? - The Maine Immunization Program does not issue replacement COVID-19 vaccination cards, but you can use the [online record request form](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/forms/immpact-immunization-record-request)or call 287-3746 to obtain a copy of your immunization record. Alternatively, you could obtain verification of vaccination through your physician's office, or the location where you received the COVID-19 vaccine. About the COVID-19 Vaccine - Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine? - COVID-19 vaccination is the best protection we have to help keep you from getting COVID-19. Getting vaccinated may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Vaccination is an important tool to help stop the COVID-19 pandemic. - How do these vaccines work? - Two of the three vaccines, such as from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, use a genetic molecule known as mRNA to prime the immune system against COVID-19. The mRNA is packaged in an oily bubble that can fuse to a cell, allowing the molecule to slip in. The cell uses the mRNA to make proteins from the coronavirus, which stimulates the immune system. While the mRNA is destroyed by our cells within days, the immune protection from the vaccine may last for months or even years. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine does not use mRNA. Rather, it's what's known as an adenovirus vector vaccine. It uses the more established approach of employing a harmless cold virus to deliver a gene that carries the blueprint for the spiky protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. - What are the side effects? - The injection into your arm won't feel different than any other vaccine. The side effects, which can resemble the symptoms of COVID-19, last about a day and appear more likely after the second dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Early reports from vaccine trials suggest some people might need to take a day off from work because they feel lousy after receiving the second dose. In the Pfizer vaccine study, about half developed fatigue. Other side effects occurred in at least 25% to 33% of patients, sometimes more, including headaches, chills, minor swelling, pain at the injection site, and muscle pain. Side effects might affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. - Can the vaccine give me COVID-19? - No, it cannot. The vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. do not include any version of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. - How do I know the vaccine is safe? - Each vaccine company's application to the federal Food and Drug Administration included two months of follow-up safety data from clinical trials conducted by universities and other independent bodies, during which tens of thousands of volunteers got a vaccine and waited to see if they became infected, compared with others who received a placebo. By September, Pfizer's trial had 44,000 participants; no serious safety concerns have been reported. While it is possible that a small number of adverse effects occur following vaccination, the health risk from COVID-19 is far greater than potential complications from the vaccine. - I have a medical condition -- how will I know if the vaccine is safe for me? - You should discuss any concerns with your health care provider to determine your best course of action. For more about the three approved COVID-19 vaccines, [consult this U.S. CDC fact sheet](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/clinical-considerations.html) [.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fpfizer%2Fclinical-considerations.html) - I've already had COVID-19. Do I need the vaccine? - It is recommended that people get a COVID-19 vaccine even if they were previously infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. People who had COVID-19 can get the vaccine when eligible to receive it after they've recovered from being ill with COVID-19. - Does the COVID-19 vaccine require two doses? - Two of the currently authorized vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) require two doses. Individuals are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving a second dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. The third currently authorized vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) requires a single dose. Individuals are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving that dose. In some circumstances, it may be advisable to wait an eight week interval between the first and second doses of an mRNA vaccine, rather than the previously advised three week (Pfizer) or four week (Moderna) intervals between first and second doses. If you have questions, please consult with your medical provider. - If I receive a two-dose vaccine, should both doses of vaccine come from the same manufacturer? - Yes. When taking your primary course of vaccines, the types of vaccine are not interchangeable. People who get a vaccine that requires two doses must make sure they get the second dose from the same manufacturer as the first dose. - Does anyone know how long it will take after your shot before it becomes effective? - This can vary by vaccine, and we will likely learn more about this over time. For the three currently authorized vaccines, individuals are considered fully vaccinated approximately 14 days after their final dose. For Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax vaccines, individuals are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after their second dose. For the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, individuals are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving one dose. - When can I stop wearing a mask and practicing physical distancing after I've been vaccinated? - [According to the U.S. CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html), fully vaccinated - 14 days post-final vaccination of either your two-dose Moderna, Pfizer, or Novavax vaccine or single-dose J&J vaccine - people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance. Other factors, including how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities, will also affect this decision. - I am age-eligible. Why isn't my doctor's office contacting me to help me get vaccinated? - Some but not all doctors' offices will be reaching out to patients. Maine is listing sites open to the public on [www.maine.gov/covid19/vaccines/vaccination-sites](https://www.maine.gov/covid19/vaccines/vaccination-sites)or search \"Maine COVID vaccine sites\" and click the official website link. - Will I have to pay for a vaccine? - No, vaccine doses purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars will be provided at no cost. For people covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and most commercial insurance plans, the vaccine will be covered by insurance with no out-of-pocket cost. For uninsured people, any administrative fees charged by participating providers will be paid for by the federal Provider Relief Fund. - Should I get the J&J vaccine? - On December 16, 2021, the U.S. CDC updated its recommendations to express a clinical preference for individuals to receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine over Johnson & Johnson's vaccine after further consideration and robust discussion about the latest scientific evidence of vaccine effectiveness, safety, rare adverse events and consideration of U.S. vaccine supply. That said, given the current state of the pandemic the CDC advisory committee reaffirmed that receiving any vaccine is better than being unvaccinated and individuals who are unable or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine will continue to have access to the J&J COVID-19 vaccine. - Why was use of the J&J vaccine paused? - On April 13, 2021, after six cases of extremely rare but severe cases of blood clots associated with low platelet count were reported in women who had received the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine, the U.S. CDC and U.S. FDA paused use of the vaccine. This pause allowed the U.S. CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to investigate the case reports and assess the safety of the vaccine. Maine halted use of the J&J vaccine in the state of Maine on April 13, 2021, while the scientific review process took place. - What did the U.S. CDC and FDA decide after their scientific review of the J&J vaccine? - After an 11-day pause on the use of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine to review scientific and case data related to extremely rare cases of severe blood clots, the U.S. CDC and FDA authorized providers to resume use of the J&J vaccine on April 23, 2021. The pause was instituted after reports of six cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts. The teams at FDA and CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). Following their scientific review, U.S. CDC and FDA determined the following: - Use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine should be resumed in the United States. - The FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19. - The FDA has determined that the available data show that the vaccine's known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks. - At this time, the available data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, and the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in continuing to investigate this risk. - Health care providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients or caregivers should review the [Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers)](https://www.fda.gov/media/146304/download)and [Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers](https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download), which have been revised to include information about the risk of this syndrome, which has occurred in a very small number of people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. - Can I get the J&J vaccine now? - Yes, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is available to individuals age 18 and older, per the emergency use authorization. - What ingredients are in the COVID-19 vaccines? - [Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Overview and Safety](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html) [Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Overview and Safety](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html) [Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Overview and Safety](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Janssen.html) [Ingredients Included in COVID-19 Vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#Appendix-C) None of the vaccines contains eggs, gelatin, latex, or preservatives. All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals such as iron, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth alloys. They are also free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, or nanowire semiconductors. None of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized or approved in the United States contains any live virus. - Vaccines For Children 5-17 - Is the vaccine safe for children 5-17? - The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines have gone through all the same clinical trials and rigorous approval processes that every vaccine for children goes through. This vaccine and others for COVID-19 have been developed faster than other vaccines because scientists and governments around the world have contributed expertise and funding to their development. Hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been safely administered in the United States. The pediatric vaccine from Pfizer and Moderna are smaller doses for children ages 5 - 11 and 6 - 11 (respectively) that have been proven safe and effective in clinical trials. Children age 12-17 receive the same dosage as is prescribed for adults, whether receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. - Will my child experience side effects after receiving the vaccine? - In the clinical trial for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for 5-11-year-olds, the most common side effects were fatigue (39%), headache (28%), and muscle pain (12%). As with adults, the reactions were more common after the 2nd dose. Fever/chills were less frequent compared to older children and adults. Reactions to vaccines materialize in the first weeks/months after receiving the vaccine, not years later. Given that mRNA research began in 1961 and the first clinical trials using mRNA technology began in 2001, there is no reason to think that these vaccines would be any different than other vaccines in terms of long-term safety. - Is there a fertility/development concern with vaccinating children before they reach puberty? - No. There is no evidence that any vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines, can cause female or male fertility problems. - Why should my child get a COVID-19 vaccine? - The Delta variant resulted in a surge of COVID-19 cases in children across the country throughout the summer. During a 6-week period in late June to mid-August, COVID-19 hospitalizations among children and adolescents [increased fivefold](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7036e2.htm?s_cid=mm7036e2_w). Getting your child vaccinated helps protect them against contracting COVID-19, as well as protecting them against serious illness or death from the disease. Being vaccinated also protects children from the long-term effects of COVID-19, including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children ( [MIS-C](https://www.cdc.gov/mis/index.html)), a rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19 in children in which different body parts become inflamed including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. Fully vaccinated children may also be able to avoid quarantining if they are a close contact of a confirmed case. This allows them to remain in school and participate in after-school activities with fewer interruptions. Additional details on this topic will be forthcoming in future updates to the Maine School Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Responding to a Positive Case in Schools. - How is the vaccine for kids different from the vaccine for adults? - The vaccines for children are administered in a smaller dose than what is administered to adolescents and adults. This smaller dose is what was used in the clinical trial that supported authorization of this formulation for children 5-11 for Pfizer and 6-11 for Moderna. The vaccine is packaged with different colored tops so that providers can quickly differentiate the vaccine for children from the vaccine for adults. - Does weight or age determine which vaccine a child should receive? - While certain medicines like Tylenol or other pain killers are dosed according to the age of the recipient, vaccines are based on the age of the immune system. A child should receive the dose of COVID-19 based on their age on the day of vaccination. If a child turns from 11 to 12 years of age in between their first and second dose [they should receive the adult dose](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/pfizer-bioNTech-faqs.html)of the COVID-19 vaccine (which is authorized for 12-17-year-olds) for their second dose. If a child turns from 11 to 12 years of age in between their first and second dose and receives the pediatric COVID-19 vaccine for their second dose, they do not need to repeat the dose. - Do children ages 5-17 need two doses of the vaccine? - Yes, the recommended course for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for children are two doses. With the Pfizer vaccine, the two doses are separated by at least three weeks; with the Moderna vaccine, the two doses are separated by at least four weeks. - When are children considered fully vaccinated? - Like adults, children are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after they receive the second dose of their Pfizer vaccine. - If my child already had an infection with COVID-19, should they get a vaccine? - Children with prior infection or disease with COVID-19 should receive a COVID-19 vaccination, according to U.S. CDC guidelines. - How will vaccine safety be monitored in this age group? - COVID-19 vaccines have undergone - and will continue to undergo - the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. U.S. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor safety using their established and new safety monitoring systems. Parents/caregivers can enroll your child in [v-safe](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html), a free and easy-to-use smartphone-based app, where you can complete health check-ins after COVID-19 vaccination and report how you child is feeling after vaccination. Additionally, patients, caregivers, and vaccine providers are also asked to report adverse events after vaccination to the [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html)(VAERS), even if it is not clear that the vaccine caused the adverse event. The U.S. CDC reviews all the information and reports any serious adverse reactions. - Is the Maine CDC worried about myocarditis or pericarditis after vaccination in children? - Cases of [myocarditis](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html)(inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported after Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccination of children ages 12-17 years. These reactions are rare; in one study, the risk of myocarditis after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech in the week following vaccination was around 54 cases per million doses administered to males ages 12-17 years. - Is it safe to co-administer COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines, like flu? - Yes, if a patient is eligible, both flu and COVID-19 vaccines can be administered at the same visit, as recommended by [U.S. CDC and its advisory committee, ACIP](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fclinical-considerations.html%22%20\\l%20%22Coadministration), as well as by [Maine CDC Director Nirav D. Shah](https://youtu.be/quSRX__T-Gg). In addition to flu vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine can be given with other vaccines as well. - Will COVID-19 vaccines for children be free? - Yes, COVID-19 vaccines are available for everyone at no cost, including the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children ages 5 through 11 and the Moderna vaccine for children 6-17. COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be given to all eligible people living in the United States, regardless of insurance or immigration status. - Will children younger than 12 receive a vaccine card? - Yes, all vaccine recipients will receive a U.S. CDC vaccination card upon initial vaccination. Vaccines for 6 months to 4-years-old - Where is the vaccine for this age group available? - Vaccines will be available at doctors' offices across Maine, as well as at pharmacies (for those 3 years and older), Federally Qualified Health Centers, and community vaccination events. You can find locations vaccinating this age group at [this link](https://www.maine.gov/covid19/vaccines/vaccination-sites). More locations will be added as they come online. - Are these vaccines safe for babies and toddlers? Are there side effects? - These vaccines are safe. Before recommending COVID-19 vaccination for children, scientists conducted clinical trials with thousands of children to establish both the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. Millions of children and teens ages 5 through 17 years have been fully vaccinated for COVID-19. Ongoing safety monitoring shows that the known risks and possible severe complications of COVID-19 outweigh the potential risks of having a rare, adverse reaction to vaccination. Reported side effects tend to be mild, temporary, and like those experienced after routine vaccination. They include fever, chills, feeling tired, and having some pain at the injection site. Some children experience more side effects after the second dose of vaccination. Some experience no side effects, at all. Serious reactions after COVID-19 vaccination in children are rare. When they are reported, serious reactions most frequently occur within a few days after vaccination. - Why should I get my baby/toddler/preschooler vaccinated? - Between March 2020 and April 2022, COVID-19 was a [leading cause of death](https://twitter.com/nirav_mainecdc/status/1538543442665537542?s=20&t=mWjSzimoBIdCU8UMNujVtQ)in children between 1 and 4 years old, according to the U.S. CDC. Children who get COVID-19 can get very sick, can require treatment in a hospital, and in rare situations, can even die. After getting COVID-19, children and teens can also experience a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems. It is unclear what the impact of long COVID will be in children. Getting eligible children vaccinated can help prevent them from getting really sick even if they do get infected and help prevent serious short- and long-term complications of COVID-19. Vaccinating children can also give parents greater confidence in their children participating in childcare, school, and other activities. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer, more reliable way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. The known risks of COVID-19 and possible severe complications\u2014such as long-term health problems, hospitalization, and even death\u2014outweigh the potential risks of having a rare, adverse reaction to vaccination. The benefit of COVID-19 vaccines, like other vaccines, is that those who get vaccinated get protection without risking the potentially serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19. - How many doses of the vaccine will my child need? - At this time, the Pfizer vaccine is three-doses, with the first two doses spaced three weeks apart and the third dose given two months after the second dose. The Moderna vaccine is two-doses spaced four weeks apart. Children are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the last dose in the series. Research is still underway as to whether these vaccines will require further doses/booster doses. This information will be updated as and when information changes. - If my child has already had a COVID-19 infection, should they get vaccinated? - Yes, it is still recommended that children get vaccinated even if they have had a previous COVID-19 infection. The CDC notes that for children who have been infected with COVID-19, their next dose can be delayed 3 months from when symptoms started or, if they did not have symptoms, when they received a positive test result. - I can't get an appointment at my pediatrician/family doctor's office to vaccinate my 6 month-5-year-old child. What do I do? - Some hospital systems and FQHCs will be vaccinating children who are not enrolled in their practices, so it is best to call to see whether you can take your child there for a vaccination. Pharmacies can vaccinate anyone 3 years and older. Vaccine clinics are being held at WIC clinics across the state and at community pop up events. Also, the York County Vaccination Center will be open and offering vaccines on a walk-in basis Tuesday/Thursday from 1PM-6PM and Saturday from 10AM-3:30PM. Check [this site](https://www.maine.gov/covid19/vaccines/vaccination-sites)regularly to see where you may be able to take your child for their vaccination. - I don't have a pediatrician or family doctor. How can I get my small child vaccinated? - Some hospital systems and FQHCs will be vaccinating children not enrolled in their practice, so it is best to call to see whether you can take your child there for a vaccination. Similarly, pharmacies can vaccinate anyone 3 years and older. Throughout the summer, vaccine clinics will be held at some WIC clinics across the state, as well. Check [this site](https://www.maine.gov/covid19/vaccines/vaccination-sites)regularly to see where you may be able to take your child for their vaccination. - My child will age out of this age group partway through the vaccination series. Should I wait until they are old enough to receive the 5+ vaccine for Pfizer or the 6yr old+ vaccine for Moderna? Should I switch courses midway through? - They shouldn't wait. U.S. CDC guidance says that you should start the vaccination process now, and then when the child turns 5 (or 6), they can get the higher dose. Children should continue with the same type of vaccine in the series if possible. That is, if they started with the Moderna vaccine and are about to turn 6 years old, they should continue with Moderna at the 6-year-old to 17-year-old dose. Likewise, if they are about to turn 5 years old and started the Pfizer series when they were 4 years old, they should continue with the Pfizer series at the 5-11-year-old dose. - How is the vaccine for babies and toddlers different from the vaccine for older kids and adults? - The COVID-19 vaccines for children have the same active ingredients as the vaccines given to adults. However, children receive a smaller, age-appropriate dose that is the right size for them. The smaller doses were rigorously tested and found to create the needed immune response for each age group. Your child should get the vaccine made for their age group. - Can my child receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as they receive other childhood vaccines? - Yes, the COVID-19 vaccine can be administered alongside other childhood vaccines. Routine vaccination is an important preventive care service that should not be delayed, and the COVID-19 vaccine can be given alongside other routine childhood vaccines. If multiple vaccines are given at a single visit, each injection will be given in a different injection site, according to recommendations by age. - Are COVID-19 vaccines for this age group free? - Yes, COVID-19 vaccines are available for everyone 6 months and older [at no cost](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/no-cost.html). COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be given to all eligible people living in the United States, regardless of insurance or immigration status. While a vaccination site may ask to see your health insurance card, it is not required for your child to receive a vaccine and you will not be turned away for not having insurance. - Can the vaccines cause any fertility/development issues? - No. There is no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, can cause female or male fertility problems. There is no evidence that vaccine ingredients, including mRNA, or antibodies made following COVID-19 vaccination would cause any problems with becoming pregnant now or in the future. Similarly, there is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine affects puberty. Booster Doses - Do I need a booster dose? - Maine CDC recommends everyone stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, including all primary series doses and boosters for their age group:People ages 5 years and older should get all primary series doses, and the booster dose recommended for them by U.S. CDC, if eligible - Everyone age 5 years and older are recommended to receive an updated (bivalent) booster. - This includes people who have received all primary series doses and people who have previously received one or more original (monovalent) boosters at least 2 months ago. - Children age 5 years can only get a Pfizer-BioNTech booster - Children ages 6-11 years can get either a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster - Anyone age 18 and older can choose to receive a Novavax (monovalent) booster, if they are unable to receive or choose not to receive an updated Pfizer or Moderna booster. - Everyone age 5 years and older are recommended to receive an updated (bivalent) booster. - What is considered a \"booster\" dose? - A \"booster dose\" refers to another dose of a vaccine that is given at least 2 months after a second dose of the Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, or first dose of the J&J vaccine. A booster dose is given to someone who built enough protection after vaccination, but then that protection decreased over time (this is called waning immunity).
