Project Contributor : Amanda Doherty -Kirby, member of COVI D-END in Canada 's citizen pool June 28, 2021 2 Executive Summary Background As coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) vaccines continue to become available, and age eligibility expands, the public health sector is tasked with ensuring vaccination is available and that uptake is high across the eligible population . An in -depth understanding of parents' considerations in vaccin ating their children is important for designing effective and equitable campaigns at the local level to promote COVID -19 vaccin ation among children and adolescents . This rapid review was produced to support public health decision makers' response to the COVID -19 pandemic. This review seeks to identify, appraise , and summarize emerging research evidence to support evidence -informed decision making. This rapid review includes evidence available up to May 31, 2021 to answer the question : What is known about parents' considerations for vaccine uptake for children and adolescents? Key Points Trust, or lack of trust, in health care providers or government, was a factor in parental decisions about childhood vaccination. Parents who accept vaccination for their children tend to express trust in health care professional s, science, and government. Some parents believe that advice from physicians is biased and not trus tworthy , and look to other or additional sources for information . A lack of trust in science, or doubt that vaccines are effective, also emerged as a reason not to vaccinate, or to be hesitant or unsure. The confidence in this finding is moderate (GRADE -CERQual) and it is likely that this finding is a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest. Safety was a common theme a cross studies exploring perceptions of childhood vaccines . Parents who support vaccination for their children express ed confidence that vaccines are generally safe. C oncern about adverse effects was a common finding. Some parents who are hesitant or refuse vaccination have a general sense that vaccines are unsafe, along with a sense that there are too many childhood vaccin es, that the ingredients may not be safe , or that vaccination can cause illness . The confidence in this finding is moderate (GRADE -CERQual) and it is likely that this finding is a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest. Information provide d has an effect on decisions about vaccination . A theme that parents lack information emerged from the research , but there is also a theme that there is too much information that is contradictory , or that it is delivered without time to consider i t. Parent s want access to the ir desired amount of trusted information ; however, the appropriate amount s and preferred sources var y across individuals. A strategy to tailor the amount and nature of information to the parent, based on checking in about their wish to know more, seems most likely to be successful. The confidence in this finding is moderate (GRADE -CERQual) and it is likely that this finding is a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest. Citizen representative input emphasizes clear, concise information prior to vaccination about what to expect at a vaccination appointment , including practical strategies for managing and reporting adverse reactions if any arise. June 28, 2021 3 In their decision -making, parents assess risks associated both with disease and with vaccination. For example, i f the risks associated with the disease are high (e.g., the likelihood or consequences of being affected is high) and the risks associated with vaccination are low (e.g., the vaccine is considered safe), the risk calculation may predispose parental choice to vaccinate. The confidence in this finding is moderate (GRADE -CERQual) and it is likely that this finding is a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest. Citizen representative comments suggest that providing information about risks of disease is important but must be carefully done to avoid being perceived by parents as overly fear -based. Some parents feel strongly about the right and the opportunity to do their own research and make their own choices about the health of their children without influence or input from authorities . Some parents express a preference for perceived alternative methods of building a healthy immune system in their children , through healthy diet and ways of living , through alternative health care approaches , and through perceived beneficial exposure to disease. The confidence in this finding is moderate (GRADE -CERQual) and it is likely that this finding is a reasonable repres entation of the phenomenon of interest. The citizen representative on this review suggested that parental uptake could be supported by providing accessible information and flexible options about where, by whom and when to vaccinate their children. The potential for herd immunity as a protective factor, and as a rationale for not vaccinating one's own children , was raised by the citizen representative, although this theme did not emerge strongly in the research literature. More researc h on interpretations and applications of information about herd immunity is needed. The studies included in this review provide only very limited evidence for the experiences of populations who live with social and structural inequities. Studies examining experiences of high and low socioeconomic status ( SES) populations found that largely similar decision -making processes are used, although high SES parents expressed more mistrust of physician s, and low SES parents had less familiarity with vaccines and experience d more structural barriers to accessing vaccination for their children. Further research is required to ensure representation of these populations for decision making. Overview of Evidence and Knowledge Ga ps Most evidence to date comes from studies that are focused on vaccines other than COVID -19. Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID -19 pandemic, it is not known how applicable these findings are to the current context. Parents who had a negative vacc ination experience themselves, or with their child, sometimes expressed concerns about vaccination for their children. Previous experience with a vaccine -preventable disease was identified as a factor that led to more vaccine acceptance. Citizen representa tive comments reflected the importance of health care provider acknowledgement, not dismissal, of these negative experiences. Some populations, including people living with low income , described access barriers (e.g., transportation, clinic policies that r equire certain conditions to be met, cost of vaccination) that limited their uptake of vaccines. Social norms and judgements of others were reported to influence both uptake and refusal, depending on the nature of the social environment. June 28, 2021 4 One moderate qual ity review focused specifically on perceptions of mandatory vaccinations for children . Requiring vaccination, penalizing parents who choose not to vaccinate by keeping children out of school, or providing financial incentives to vaccinate were considered inappropriate strategies. Universal strate gies were preferred over targeted approaches . The risk of unvaccinated children spreading disease was acknowledged by parents as part of a rationale in favour of mandatory vaccination, although this was not considered to be a definitive reason to require vaccination . Two studies explored reasons for acceptability of a COVID -19 vaccine (one among pregnant women, for their babies, and one in November 2020 before a vaccine was available). Parents who were accepting of a COVID -19 vaccine for their infants or children empha sized protection of the child and other family members , a desire to return to normal activities , and trust and belief in the vaccine. Parents who were unsure or opposed to COVID -19 vaccine for their infants or children emphasized vaccine safety concerns , the belief that children are at low risk of infection or harm , the need for transparent information , and a mistrust of science and health care providers. Studies related to parental acceptance of specific vaccines ( influenza vaccine (two studies) and infant pneumococcal vaccine (one study) found that parents generally had confidence in vaccines for their children, and had concerns about the number of vaccinations their children received. They trusted information from what they considered reliable, unbiased s ources , although the perception of what constituted a reliable source differed across individuals. Gaps in research evidence were noted by the citizen representative. The experiences and decision -making processes among parents of a child with chronic illness or disability are not well represented in the research. Not enough is known about the effect of access factors, such as a trusted provider and public health or school -based clinics focusing on vaccination. What appears to be lack of trust i n health care providers may be related to lack of consistent access to providers, and the lack of opportunity to build a trusting relationship. Information about vaccination needs to be perceived as unbiased and trustworthy by the parent. Health care profe ssionals are an important source of information, but not all parents consider health care providers to be trusted sources about vaccination. Parents want an opportunity to give informed consent or to not consent, based on their own assessments of the risks . Steps to ensure that vaccines are accessible to those who wish to receive them can involve providing transportation and convenient options, removing financial barriers, and providing as much information about risks and benefits as is requested .

Data Extraction and Synthesis Data relevant to the research question, such as study design, setting, location, population characteristics and key findings were extracted when reported. We synthesized the r esults narratively due to the variation in methodology and research questions for the included studies. Appraisal of Evidence Quality We evaluated the quality of included evidence using critical appraisal tools as indicated by the study design below. Quality assessment was completed by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Conf licts were resolved through discussion.

This starting point of 'high confidence' reflects a view that each review finding should be seen as a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest unless there are factors that would weaken this assumption. Warning Given the need to make emerging COVID -19 evidence quickly available , many emerging studies have not been peer reviewed . As such , we advise caution when using and interpreting the evidence included in this rapid review . We have provided a summary of overall certainty of the evidence to support the process of decision making . Where possible , make decisions using the highest quality evidence available.
