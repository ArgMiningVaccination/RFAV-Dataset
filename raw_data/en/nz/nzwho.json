Unbeknownst to you \u2014 or her \u2014 she was probably harnessing the placebo effect, loosely defined as a favorable response to a medical intervention that doesn't have a direct physiological effect. Although you may have learned later in life that there isn't much scientific evidence to support the practice, you may still sleep better after a cup of warm milk at bedtime.

Image: Wavebreakmedia Ltd/Thinkstock Vitamin C is often touted as a natural cold remedy. The nutrient is featured in supplements promising to boost the immune system.

[](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/body-scan-for-pain) Body scan mindfulness exercise for pain Stress reduction expert Jon Kabat-Zinn recommends the body scan mindfulness exercise as the best form of mindfulness meditation for pain conditions. He advises practicing it every day for 45 minutes, even if it seems boring or doesn't seem to be helping. \"You don't have to like it, you just have to do it,\" he explains in his book. \"Whether you find the body scan to be very relaxing and interesting or difficult and uncomfortable or exasperating is irrelevant to whether it will serve you well.\" The goal of the body scan is not to relieve the pain completely, but to get to know it and learn from it so you can manage it.
