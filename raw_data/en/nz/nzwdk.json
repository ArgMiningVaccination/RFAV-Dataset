Together the share their experiences with detoxing from everyday chemicals in our home and education on non-toxic living. Dr. Chen shares her education from her schooling as a western UK Doctor, and her expertise on helping people find a way to empower themselves through little everyday changes. To focus on lifestyle changes to help heal the body naturally. Western medicine is wonderful, but she sees health through a more integrative approach to help fight chronic diseases. Although there is a pill for every ill, we should address the underlying issues rather than band-aiding over problems. Together they see \"Food is medicine\" and that we as an individual, we have more power than we are thought to believe when it comes to minimizing toxicity from our life. Together, they talk about Dr. Chen's story and the driving forces that led her onto this journey of wellness beyond the western medicine approach. A main force was her children. Her daughter had life threatening struggles early on in life with allergies, which had Vivian digging deeper for answers on how to help her daughter. As they changed her daughters diet, they began to see what the root causes were, instead of the reactions. What began as allergies with dairy, quickly turned into looking at all the toxicity in our conventional food. Which then led to looking at the toxicity beyond food, to our general cleaning products we use in our household, to the daily environment we surround ourselves with, and to the whole world we live in. She eventually changed her life, and her family's life by changing their diets, ridding their lives of toxicity as much as possible, and educating herself and others on the products we use everyday. She notices very common illnesses among many different people, and she believes it's coming from many common root sources. She uses the metaphor: if see ourselves as a garden, with many different plants and with soil lacking certain important nutrients, how it's going to show up will be different in different plants. If we change the soil and replenish it, we will start to see results in all the plants, just like ourselves. They dive deep into some of the many sources of toxic load and the science behind it. How not to focus on just one toxin, but one all of them in our life. Learning to minimize toxins is an everyday task. Your everyday actions make a huge different. You won't want to miss this episode for all the juicy insights on how to lower toxic load in your household and life overall.
