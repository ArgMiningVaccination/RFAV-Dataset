Oh, hello night sweats, hot flushes and heart palpitations. But with a few simple lifestyle tweaks you can help ease the symptoms of menopause and get back to the land of nod. Menopause is the period in a woman's life when menstruation stops. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 45 and 55, with the average age being 51. As a woman begins the march towards menopause, levels of oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone begin to drop - this hormonal rollercoaster can throw you off-kilter, leaving you fatigued and deflated. Menopause can lead to lack of sleep for many women. Why? It's thought that a fall in oestrogen and progesterone affects the body's temperature control, which can often lead to hot flushes and night sweats. These short, sudden feelings of heat - usually in the face, neck and chest - can make skin feel sweaty, and make catching those all-important ZZZs a real challenge. Although hot flushes can happen without warning, they can also be triggered by a whole range of things, including eating spicy food, drinking caffeine or alcohol, smoking, wearing thick clothing and feeling stressed or anxious. Our advice? Skip the nightcap and vindaloo and trade them for a night-time tea. Treating the symptoms of hot flushes can help make drifting off a little easier. The most effective treatment for hot flushes during menopause is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT - which is available as a tablet, skin patch or gel - replaces depleted hormones. There are two main types of HRT: Combined HRT (oestrogen and progestogen) - for women who still have their womb Oestrogen-only HRT - for women who've had their womb removed in a hysterectomy You can get HRT by speaking to your GP or via our [Menopause and HRT Treatment Online Doctor Service.* ](https://onlinedoctor.boots.com/HRT-treatment-online?utm_source=Boots&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Boots_nav_HRT_treatment_online) Although HRT is effective at relieving hot flushes and night sweats, there are a number of side effects and risks. Discuss the risks and benefits of HRT with your GP or consider various other treatments to help cope with sleep problems in menopause.
