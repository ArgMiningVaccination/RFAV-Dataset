In April 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) simplified vaccine and booster recommendations to include one booster dose for everyone 6 months and older and a second booster dose for those 65 and older or immunocompromised to provide continued protection against severe illness from COVID-19. Eligible individuals may choose which vaccine they receive as a booster dose. New Hanover County Health and Human Services have both Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 booster shots available.

The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine has been approved by the FDA and CDC for individuals 12 years and older. In studies, these COVID-19 vaccines reduced the rate of COVID-19 infection and provided strong protection against severe illness and hospitalization. Parents can learn more at [NCDHHS.gov](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/vaccines/kids). Parental consent is required for children ages 6 months to 15 years old prior to receiving the vaccine.

There is no way to know how your body will fight COVID-19 or the impact the illness could have if spread to members of your family, to friends, or other close contacts. The vaccine will help your body build protection from COVID-19, without having to experience the virus itself or risk spreading the illness to others. More Information - [What are the side effects from the vaccine?](#) - While side effects can occur after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, just like with any other vaccine you receive, they are typically minor and short-lived. Adverse events from the vaccine are extremely rare, and some people experience no side effects at all. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [lists common side effects](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html)of the vaccine, including pain, redness and swelling at the injection site along with tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea. Side effects are normal signs that your body is building protection against the virus and should go away within a few days. While COVID-19 vaccines may cause side effects, they cannot and do not give you COVID-19. The CDC encourages people to contact their doctor if side effects do not go away after a few days. - [How do I know the vaccine is safe?](#) - Every vaccine goes through extensive clinical trials and monitoring to identify effectiveness, potential side effects, or safety concerns before it is approved for public use, and the COVID-19 vaccine is no different. The COVID-19 vaccine is designed like many other vaccines to teach your body to fight infection. Sometimes, this can cause a spike in fever or other symptoms that signal your body is building immunity. Some recipients have reported effects of the immune response the vaccine triggers, like soreness at the injection site or fatigue. Any potential side effects are required by law to be reported by the drug manufacturer. So far, none of the approved vaccines have reported any significant safety concerns in their trials. The CDC also has an app called [\"V-Safe\"](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/v-safe/index.html)that allows users to report any side effects experienced after receiving the vaccine. Monitoring of potential side effects will be on-going as the vaccine is distributed, with mandatory reporting of any adverse effects to the [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)](https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html)and the [Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html). More Information - [Will the vaccine give me COVID-19? Or make me sick?](#) - No. The COVID-19 vaccine is designed like many other vaccines to teach your body to fight infection. Sometimes, this can cause a spike in fever or other symptoms that signal your body is building immunity. Some recipients have reported effects of the immune response the vaccine triggers, like soreness at the injection site or fatigue. Any side effects from the vaccine will be reported, as required by law. More Information - [If I get the vaccine, am I immune to COVID-19?](#) - Not quite. Getting your vaccine will build your immunity, which can lower your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. Your vaccine will also greatly reduce your risk of developing serious illness or death related to COVID-19. Your greatest level of immunity will be 14 days after receiving a COVID vaccine. Immunity can fade with time so to keep your immunity level high, stay [up-to-date](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html)on COVID-19 vaccines and boosters. Everyone 6 months and older is eligible for one updated bivalent COVID-19 booster 2 months after your last COVID-19 vaccine or any previous booster. Those 65 and older are eligible for a second bivalent COVID-19 booster 4 months after the first bivalent booster and those that are immunocompromised are eligible for a second bivalent COVID-19 booster 2 months after the first bivalent booster. More Information - [What will the vaccine cost?](#) - The COVID-19 vaccine and booster is free and accessible to everyone. Health insurance is not required. - [If I've been diagnosed with COVID-19, can I still get the vaccine?](#) - Yes, and you should. Even if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, there is no current understanding of how long natural immunity, gained from exposure to the virus, will last from person to person. Re-infection is still possible, so everyone is encouraged to get the vaccine and booster to protect themselves from severe illness. More Information - [Can I get the vaccine if I have COVID or have had another vaccine recently?](#) - Yes. The CDC has advised that you can receive your COVID-19 vaccine even if you have received another vaccine recently. You can even receive other necessary vaccines on the same day you receive your COVID-19 vaccine, like for the flu or other diseases. People who are actively sick with COVID-19 should wait until they have recovered and can no longer spread the virus before getting their vaccine. Once you have recovered, it is safe to get vaccinated with any COVID-19 vaccine if you have been infected in the past. If you were treated for COVID-19 symptoms with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. - [What is a booster dose?](#) - The [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines)and [Centers for Disease Control (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s1012-COVID-19-Vaccines.html)have authorized and recommended updated bivalent COVID-19 booster shots to provide continued protection for those who have been fully vaccinated.
