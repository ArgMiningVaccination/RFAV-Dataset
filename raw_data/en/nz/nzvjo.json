[[3]](#cite_note-Cooksey2005-3) [[4]](#cite_note-Novey2000-4) [[5]](#cite_note-Wisneski2009-5) He had an interest in [philosophy](/wiki/Philosophy) and [religions](/wiki/Religion), and encountered [Ayurvedic](/wiki/Ayurveda) philosophy on a trip to India. [[3]](#cite_note-Cooksey2005-3) His background in chiropractic was shaped by his studies of various Eastern concepts of [energy medicine](/wiki/Energy_medicine), including Ayurveda, [traditional Chinese medicine](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine), yoga, and [reflexology](/wiki/Reflexology). Life and work[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Randolph_Stone&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] Stone was born Rudolph Bautsch in 1890 in Austria. He immigrated with his family to the United States in 1898 and changed his name to Randolf Stone in the 1920s. [[3]](#cite_note-Cooksey2005-3) During that period he began studying several different practices and became qualified in [chiropractic](/wiki/Chiropractic). Dissatisfied with Western approaches, he also began traveling and studying non-Western medical practices. [[7]](#cite_note-goldstein01-7) He first published his concepts of [polarity therapy](/wiki/Polarity_therapy) in 1947 in a book entitled Energy, [[5]](#cite_note-Wisneski2009-5) and then published a series of books and pamphlets to explain his ideas and methods. [[8]](#cite_note-digitalstone01-8) [[9]](#cite_note-:2-9) [[10]](#cite_note-:5-10) He had concluded that an observable (yet undetectable to mainstream scientific methods) 'electromagnetic polarity' was a reflection of health. [[5]](#cite_note-Wisneski2009-5) [[11]](#cite_note-Endacott-11) He held the opinion that this energy was influenced by touch, diet, movement, sound, attitude, relationships and by environmental factors. [[11]](#cite_note-Endacott-11) He had a successful private practice in Chicago and he also worked for about 10 years in a clinic in India. [[12]](#cite_note-:0-12) Stone was initiated into the [Radha Soami Satsang Beas](/wiki/Radha_Soami_Satsang_Beas) tradition under [Baba Sawan Singh](/wiki/Baba_Sawan_Singh) in 1945 and in 1956 published his Mystical Bible, a Radha Soami interpretation of verses from the Bible. Stone spent the last eight years of his life with his niece Louise Hilger in a house at the Radha Soami center in Beas, India. [[3]](#cite_note-Cooksey2005-3) [[13]](#cite_note-Juergensmeyer01-13) He died there in 1981. Stone's ideas have been dismissed by medical health experts as [quackery](/wiki/Quackery) or untestable. [[14]](#cite_note-14) [[15]](#cite_note-15) [[16]](#cite_note-16) They have also been criticized as a discredited form of [vitalism](/wiki/Vitalism). [[17]](#cite_note-17) According to Nancy Allison in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Body-Mind Disciplines, even advocates of Stone's theory consider his books Health Building and Polarity Therapy to be difficult reading due to their inconsistencies and ambiguities. [[18]](#cite_note-Allison-18) His ideas are thus interpreted widely, and polarity therapists vary in their approaches. [[18]](#cite_note-Allison-18) His ideas were later popularized by Pierre Pannetier, a naturopath who had studied under Stone. [[19]](#cite_note-neher01-19) [[20]](#cite_note-20) There are many polarity associations around the world. Tony (July 20, Mindessence - The Polarity of Life and Death. MasterWorks International. 107.
