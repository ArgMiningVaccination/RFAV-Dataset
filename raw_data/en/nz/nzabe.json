It serves as a 22-strand DNA Activation that awakens your divine blueprint and heightens your connection with your Higher Self. While enabling you to bring in and anchor more Light (positive energy) in your physical body, the Life Activation also empowers you to maximize your potential to bring forth unrevealed talents and abilities, and gives you more vitality and clarity. It begins a process of releasing unconscious patterns (old emotional traps we fall into), while increasing your ability to use more of your brain and clears family and genetic karmic patterns. The ceremony is a sacred practice performed by a Life Activation practitioner who has been trained and certified in the [Modern Mystery School](https://www.modernmysteryschoolint.com/) to set the energetic space for the ritual. This intensive healing session lasts about 90 minutes beginning with a series of energy healing modalities which were designed to re-balance, re-calibrate, and \"deep clean\" various components of the energy field, preparing us for an activation protocol that takes place for the last half hour of the session. Energy alignments protocols are performed initially to help you achieve a sense of peace and connection between your mind, body and spirit: - 16-Lotus Petal Balancing - Central Core Balancing - Elemental Line Balancing - Magnetic Line Balancing - Etheric Field Clearing - Aura Clearing - Chakra Alignment - Negative Crystal Removal - 22-Strand DNA Activation - Spiritual DNA Reading Also includes a 1-month supply of Purificato and Crystalis - a vibrational elixir that will assist in the facilitation in the energy clearing that began with this session.

The Max Meditation System was designed by the [Founder of the Modern Mystery School Gudni Gudnason](https://www.modernmysteryschoolint.com/ipsissimus-gudni-frater-ged-gudnason/). The system is based on a fusion of ancient techniques of Yoga and mind acrobatics mixed with modern techniques of psychology and Neuro-linguistic programming. The developer of this practice has traveled around the world for the last 35 years exploring the phenomena of the mind and people. He learned the ancient methods from prominent teachers in India and Tibet and has received a degree in NLP and Psychology in Europe. The Max Meditation System is based on the FIVE components of Meditation: - Relaxation - Passive Meditation - Active Meditation - Guided Visualization - Soothing Down \"Meditation brings wisdom; lack of meditation leaves ignorance.

In the Mystery School tradition, working with these symbols, you unlock access to states of heightened consciousness and expanded spiritual awareness. All things in the physical world manifest through Sacred Geometry. Sacred patterns and symbols are found in all matter and form the basis of the blocks of creation. Sacred Geometry is an art, a science and a metaphysical series of teachings that help to elevate consciousness and master the process of creation. The Greeks and Egyptians were the most famous students of the Sacred Geometry principles. From the Pyramids of Giza to the mathematical schools of Pythagoras, Sacred Geometry helped the adept to acquire wisdom, connect with spirit and transform the energy of the physical world around them.
