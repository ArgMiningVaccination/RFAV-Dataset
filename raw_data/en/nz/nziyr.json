Timely vaccination after childhood cancer treatment is vital for protecting against vaccine-preventable diseases during survivorship. However, caregiver intention for restarting vaccinations, such as getting catch-up or booster vaccines, after cancer treatment is unknown. Methods: We surveyed primary caregivers ages 18 or older with a child who had completed cancer treatment in the prior 3-24 months (N = 129; participation rate = 60.3%). Participants were asked about demographics, their child's vaccination status, and healthcare factors (e.g., provider recommendations, barriers). We examined the influence of whether the oncology care team recommended catch-up or booster vaccines on caregiver intention to restart vaccines using multivariable generalized linear models. Vaccine barriers were examined by intention in chi- square tests. Results: Caregivers were primarily aged 30-49 years (82.0%), mothers (81.2%), college graduates (44.8%), married (89.1%), and Non-Hispanic (90.3%). In total, 67% of caregivers intended to restart vaccines for their child and 49.6% reported that they had a discussion with the cancer care team about catch-up or booster vaccines. Caregivers who discussed vaccines with their child's cancer care team were much more likely to report intention to restart vaccination (Relative Risk (RR) = 1.82, 95% CI 1.37-2.45). The most common barrier to restarting vaccines after cancer was not knowing which vaccines to get, which was common across both groups (intend to restart = 31% vs. did not intend = 40.5%, P = 0.29). Of caregivers, 93.1% who intended to restart vaccines felt vaccines were safe compared to 79.5% of those who did not (P = 0.02). Conclusions: Caregivers of childhood cancer survivors need guidance for restarting vaccinations after cancer treatment, including information on safety and which vaccines their child needs. Provider recommendations positively influence caregiver's intention to restart vaccines. Clinical guidelines are needed to support providers in making tailored vaccination recommendations after cancer treatment.", "sitename": "American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2019-03-01", "cleaned_text": "Abstract Timely vaccination after childhood cancer treatment is vital for protecting against vaccine-preventable diseases during survivorship.
