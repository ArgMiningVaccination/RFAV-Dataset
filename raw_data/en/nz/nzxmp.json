The process of developing these skills includes a literature review, continuous education, and evaluation by different long-term care experts. The five simulation skills are difficult feeding and swallowing care, position management and skin care, promoting toileting ability care, and acute and chronic confusion care. In the long-term care course, the content of the five simulation skills comprises diverse scenarios for five long-term care cases, preparation before the practicing of skills, competency in the assessment and practicing of skills, evaluation of the cases' problems, and professional essences while practicing the skills. There are different indicators for the preparation, assessment, practice, and evaluation of the five simulation skills in the long-term care course. After lectures and the practicing of skills, every nursing student participating in the long-term care course is evaluated through a simulation test conducted by five teachers at the OSCE center, involving five standardized patients who have been trained by the examining teachers. Additionally, every nursing student writes reflection reports for the practice and testing of the five simulation skills in terms of the learning process, obstacles, and suggestions for improvement of the long-term care course in the future. Through a sincere and careful developing process, the five simulation skills of the long-term care course could be standardized for the use of long-term care nursing teachers and students.
