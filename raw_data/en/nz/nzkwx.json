The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to learn about the efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and the side effects associated with them. Methods: We used five databases to conduct an electronic search of material published between 2020 and June 2021. The PRISMA declaration was used to create and report on a procedure for a systematic review and meta-analysis. The systematic review comprised eleven RCTs, and nine RCTs were included for meta-analysis. To assess bias risk, the Cochrane collaboration tool was employed. Results: In a total of 70604 cases, the overall effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines was determined to be 94.6% (95% CI 0.04-0.08). The administration of mRNA-based vaccine was associated with a greater number of side effects, such as, injection site pain, fever, swelling, fatigue, headache, chills, by yielding a summary OR of 4.35 (95% CI 2.05-9.24), respectively. Conclusion: In all investigations, the m-RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines caused mild to moderate local and systemic adverse effects following the first and second doses of immunisation. mRNA vaccines were shown to have an overall effectiveness of 94.6%. The findings demonstrate the overall safety and effectiveness of all currently available m-RNA- based covid 19 vaccines, giving unambiguous data-driven evidence to support the continuing worldwide public health endeavour to immunise the whole population.
