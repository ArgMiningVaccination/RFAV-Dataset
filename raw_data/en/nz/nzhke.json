Homeopathy is used widely around the world - Western and Eastern Europe have long traditions of homeopathy as well as India, South America and Africa. Homeopathy first came to New Zealand in 1849 and a Homeopathic Association was established in 1857 as well as a homeopathic hospital in 1858. Homeopathy works on the principle of \"like cures like\" or the way of similar and the word Homeopathy means \"similar suffering\". Two other key principles are looking at the totality of a person's symptoms and seeing each person as a unique individual. The homeopathic approach to health is a holistic one, meaning the whole person is taken into consideration in the consult - This includes a person's physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. You can learn more about Homeopathy [here](https://www.aklhomeopathy.co.nz/learn-more-about-homeopathy/) Homeopathic remedies are derived from plant, mineral and animal substances. They are specially prepared following Homeopathic Pharmaceutical guidelines. They can be dispensed in the form of tablets, pills, pilules, liquid or powder and are taken by dissolving in the mouth. You may be given a single dose or repeated doses of a remedy.

Likewise, our physical symptoms are unique and individual. For example, one persons joint pains are worse for wet weather, another's is worse at night, and yet another's for eating tomatoes. Homeopathy essentially is a process of 'pattern-matching' - matching the total individual picture with the most similar remedy. Different remedies are therefore often given to different patients who might have the same medical diagnosis or condition. You can learn more about the Homeopathic approach to health [here](https://www.aklhomeopathy.co.nz/can-homeopathy-help-with-xyz/) The first consultation for chronic health problems can take an hour or more. During this time the Homeopath will seek an insight into your health issues and how you experience your symptoms as well as the general traits of your temperament, sleep patterns, reactions to temperature, food intolerances etc. A full history of your health is also taken. Homeopathic practitioners select remedies based on the total collection of your symptoms. The homeopath will evaluate your response to the remedy at a follow up appointment. 1-2 follow up appointments are normally recommended and these take 20-45 mins depending on the condition. Follow ups are usually spaced about approximately 4-6 weeks apart.
