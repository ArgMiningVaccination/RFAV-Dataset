Additions The following treatments are best added to any of the previous wellness treatments. Ayurvedic Remedies (3 -7 days) Despite predating all other healing systems, Ayurveda offers one of the most comprehensive answers to the pressures of modern life;stress, diabetes, sciatica, spondylitis, insomnia and hypertension are just some of the lifestyle-related diseases, degenerative and psychosomatic disorders that it actively addresses. Each of our extended Ayurvedic Remedies offers an individually tailored programme of therapies, yoga and consultations designed to promote health, prevent disease and remedy existing ailments. Sushumna The Spinal Column 3, 5 or 7 days Lower back and neck pain are two of the most common pain disorders in modern society. In Ayurveda, such pain stems from an aggravation of Vata - one of the body's three principle doshas - as a result of pushing oneself beyond physical or emotional capacity. Sushumna comprises a focused series of herbal massages, specially prepared leaf bundles and invigorating oil baths designed to relieve back and neck pain by bringing the Vata dosha back into equilibrium. In addition, our resident yogis will devise a sequence of simple postures to balance and stabilise the spine, relax the mind and redirect body energy to relieve the pain. Rasayana The Rejuvenator 5 or 7 days Ayurveda has identified seven constituent tissues - dhatus - that support life. With the help of the digestive fire, the dhatus (tissues) form the pillars of the body; they provide the means for nourishment and growth, defend the internal immune system and give support to the body and mind. Rasayana rejuvenates the body by nourishing the dhatus. This tailored sequence of therapies helps slow the ageing process, improve memory and intelligence, maximise physical endurance and sexual prowess, strengthen the sense organs and brighten the complexion . A complete rejuvenation for body and mind. Manoyana Journey of the Mind 7 days Stress is the uncomfortable gap between how we would like our life to be and how we perceive it to be. Manoyana works by taking the mind on a blissful journey to address imbalances between body, mind and spirit . The programme includes head and body massages with individualised herbal oils, Shirodhara and other stress specific therapies. In addition, our yogis will share meditation and breathing techniques to ensure progressive deep relaxation and postures to relax mind and body. Guests wishing to embark on longer Ayurvedic programmes may discuss individual requirements with our Ayurvedic Physicians and Spa Director. We also offer all-inclusive 7-, 14- and 21-day Ayurvedic Immersions, designed to guide participants along their own transformational path to ultimate wellness. AYURVEDIC IMMERSIONS Our Ayurvedic Immersions take guests on their own journey of discovery into the heart of Ayurveda - and towards perfect health .

Panchakarma is a serious, medically accredited programme that can have many positive benefits on health and wellbeing. Due to its intensity and the commitment required, however, it is highly recommended for people with prior experience of Ayurveda and/or intensive detoxification programmes. Panchakarma comprises five elimination therapies, each split into three parts. Each part involves a variety of treatments, massages and therapeutic procedures to identify, liquefy, eliminate and remove toxins . In addition, Panchakarma is always accompanied by a special detoxification diet. Please speak to our Receptionists or Physicians if you are interested in participating in Panchakarma at Landaa Giraavaru. PANCHAKARMA Panchakarma is an intensive, and cleansing programme. Meaning 'five therapies' in Sanskrit, and conducted over a period of 14 or 21 days, Panchakarma uses a series of five elimination treatments to help remove deep-rooted stress and illness-causing toxins from the body while balancing the doshas (the energies that govern all biological functions). YOGA Here at Landaa, Yoga is so much more than an additional spa activity. Our Indian-trained yogis conduct a multitude of complimentary and private classes each week from three dedicated yoga areas -an over-water deck, in-jungle pavilion and oceanfront seawater pool - including classic Sun Salutations, blissful evening Yoga Nidra and supportive Aqua Yoga. Daily AntiGravity \u00aeYoga classes introduce guests to the soaring sensation of the world's first suspended practice, with further private classes ranging from classic Hatha to powerful Ashtanga Vinyasa. Whether you're 8 or 80, seeking pain relief, core-strengthening or relaxation, our yoga programme offers something for everyone:Kids Club yoga sessions for youngsters; private sessions for mothers-to-be - you can even join the dive team for underwater meditation for the ultimate sense of 'oneness' with the ocean. Our yogis are experts at devising personalised programmes to address your specific health and wellness needs. Please ask us about tailoring a bespoke programme or refer to the Resort Activities Guide for the group yoga class schedule. AntiGravity \u00aeYoga It is an entrancing elevated practice that uses hammocks, slightly suspended above the ground, to master poses that defy gravity. Ideal for relieving age-related aches and pains, it helps fine tune the body's balance and alignment, releases 'happy hormones', enhances self-esteem, fast-tracks flexibility and offers a unique sensation of flying. Highly recommended. Offered as group class or as private class for couples or individuals. Also recommended as an 'Enhancer' for Muladhara, Swadhisthana and Manipura Chakra Blessings. Hatha Yoga Through an approach that incorporates awareness of all aspects of being, Hatha Yoga promotes the alignment of body, mind, emotions and spirit . It features classic asanas - explored gently and in a non-competitive atmosphere - with an emphasis on awareness. As the student's experience deepens, more complex practices are gradually introduced. Also recommended as an 'Enhancer' for Vishuddha and Ajna Chakra Blessings. Ashtanga Vinyasa and Power Yoga Geared towards experienced practitioners, this class combines two advanced yogic practices. Ashtanga Vinyasa resembles flow due to the smooth way the poses run together, while Power Yoga focuses on postures that enhance strength and flexibility - ideal for those who are already quite fit and want a minimal amount of chanting and meditation with their yoga. Also recommended as an 'Enhancer' for Therapeutic Massage, Lava Shell Massage and Elakkizhi. Aqua Yoga Conducted in our salt-water pool, these low-impact classes feature asanas and postures derived from Hatha Yoga. Buoyancy decreases pressure on the joints while increasing range of motion and blood flow to muscle tissue . Great for increasing water confidence, strength and balance, sessions can equally be developed to include more advanced underwater postures. Yoga Nidra, Meditation and Pranayama This series of guided meditation and breathing techniques improves and balances the flow of the vital life force - prana . Including bhastrikas (rapid abdominal breathing) and kapalabhatti (rapid inhalation and exhalation), the session also incorporates anapana - following the breath to calm the mind - and anulomaviloma, alternate nostril breathing. Also recommended as an 'Enhancer' for Anahata and Sahasrara Chakra Blessings, Shirodhara and Zaanta Nidraa. Pregnancy Yoga A wonderful way to focus on quality 'you time', keep in shape and prepare for the birth process . Gentle and specially adapted asanas make for a safe and enjoyable experience for new and experienced practitioners alike. Also recommended as an 'Enhancer' for Pregnancy Massage and Scrub. PHYSIOTHERAPY Physiotherapy helps to restore movement and function following injury, illness or disability and reduce pain without the use of medication . In addition to managing acute or chronic conditions, it can also help prevent disease or disability while promoting optimal mobility and wellness. Here at Landaa, our holistic approach involves evaluation/reassessment followed by intervention using a combination of result-optimising techniques, including: Ultrasound High frequency vibrations to increase blood flow, promote muscle relaxation and accelerate cellular repair. Interferential Therapy Electrical currents to stimulate endorphins/block pain impulses, reduce inflammation and activate weak muscles. Manual Therapy Muscle pressure and joint manipulation to relieve pain, spasms, fluid build-up and tension. Movement and Exercise Specific therapeutic activities that must be regularly repeated to strengthen and improve affected areas. Aquatic Therapy Performed while floating in water to support manipulation and movement. Ice and Heat Therapies To either constrict the blood vessels, reducing inflammation and pain; or dilate blood vessels, ease stiffness and relax muscles. Initial Treatment: 60 minutes (includes consultation with our Ayurvedic Doctor) Follow-up Treatment: 30 minutes Acupuncture involves the stimulation of specific acupuncture points on pathways known as meridians to correct imbalances in the flow of qi (energy). It is also highly beneficial in treating a number of different ailments and conditions related to muscles and joints - from neck pain, back pain and sciatica to frozen shoulder and migraines. Whether you have persistent discomfort or are in need of top-to-toe balance, our skilled acupuncturist creates highly personalised and painless treatments that identify, strengthen, harmonise and heal weak points throughout the body .Your treatment may also incorporate cupping - the placing of 'cups' on the skin to create suction. Cupping often accompanies traditional acupuncture as it helps mobilise blood flow, drain toxins and promote localised healing. It also brings enhanced relief to specific acupuncture points or painful areas through the application of additional pressure. Initial Treatment: 90 minutes (includes consultation with our Ayurvedic Doctor) Follow-up Treatment: 60 minutes ACUPUNCTURE Restore the body's natural balance and improve overall wellbeing with one of Asia's oldest healing arts. CHAKRA blessings Chakra is a Sanskrit word meaning wheel or disk. The body's seven main chakras each sit at the intersection of the vital energy channels that run along the spinal column. Governing the spread of physical energy throughout our bodies, the chakras also govern the circulation of the astral, emotional and spiritual energy that flows within us. Each chakra is often described as the petals of a lotus, ranging from four petals in the first (root) chakra to one thousand in the seventh (crown) chakra. When our chakras are cleansed and balanced, our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies are able to function at their optimum levels. A personalised consultation will determine which chakras are most out of balance and require most immediate attention. Guests may book Chakra Blessings singly or as a series. Opt for a 5- or 7-day programme for maximum effect. Please enquire at The Spa for details. Muladhara 120 minutes Muladhara - the root chakra - is located at the base of the spine. It anchors the spirit to the material world and the body to the earth. Muladhara is the root of our survival. It governs base instincts, mental stability and sensuality. It gives us the focus we need to succeed and the centering necessary to nurture ourselves and others. Balancing Muladhara calms body and mind, creating a profound inner peace that helps free our full potential. Combining a foot wash, frankincense smoke, Tibetan singing bowls and a slow, deep massage with grounding vetiver, ginger, patchouli and jatamansi oils, this treatment induces a deep sense of stillness that will leave you feeling ready to take on the world. See Yoga section for recommended AntiGravity\u00ae Yoga Enhancer. Swadhisthana 120 minutes Swadhisthana - the sacral chakra - is located in the lower abdomen. It governs fertility, self-worth and creativity. It is also associated with emotional balance, desire and pleasure. This chakra helps us to 'let go' and find a healthy balance in life. When it is functioning well, Swadhisthana brings enhanced emotional gratification, higher self-esteem and free-flowing creative energy. Ideal for couples to experience together , this nurturing treatment combines a deep lymphatic scrub, vichy shower, flowing massage and chakra warming with the nourishing oils of jasmine, patchouli, rose and sandalwood. Happiness is renewed and the desire for life and love is reinvigorated. See Yoga section for recommended AntiGravity\u00ae Yoga Enhancer. Manipura 120 minutes Manipura - the navel chakra - is located in the solar plexus. It is our centre of health and vitality and governs our capacity to grow and develop. Connected to our inner strength, sense of purpose and self-confidence, Manipura means beautiful, shining jewel in Sanskrit. When it is open and balanced, we shine from within. This elevating treatment floods the body with vital energy and inner warmth . An Energising & Detoxifying Foot and Body Scrub, Bio-Energy Mud Wrap and massage with Vital Energy Oil restore inner radiance and positive feelings, renew strength and health and leave the skin brilliantly lustrous. See Yoga section for recommended AntiGravity\u00ae Yoga Enhancer. Anahata 150 minutes Positioned at the centre of the chakra system, Anahata -the heart chakra -is the bridge between the physical and the spiritual world, and the heart of our being. Perhaps the most powerful of all the chakras, it is the body's seat of love and compassion, generosity and wellbeing: the energy source that keeps our worlds balanced. Balancing Anahata is important for the circulatory system, heart and thymus. It also helps fend off disease, nurtures spiritual love and can help free us from our limits and fears. But above all, it awakens our hearts to the beauty of unconditional love. Viewing the skin as an extension of the heart, this beautifully gentle blessing treats the whole body, pervading the very essence of our being and flooding the heart with strength. The tender combination of foot wash, scrub, massage and heart work uses rose oil and warmed rose quartz to gently reconnect the body and mind to inner peace and stillness. Equilibrium is restored, leaving you feeling at one with yourself and those around you, fully surrendered to the energy of love. See Yoga section for recommended Meditation and Pranayama Enhancer. Vishuddha 120 minutes Vishuddha - the throat chakra - is located in the centre of the throat. It governs our communication and self- expression and is linked to creativity and honesty. It also encourages strong leadership. A balanced throat chakra embodies the spirit of truth and intuition; when it is weak or low in energy, our thoughts become unstable and our sleep patterns disturbed. This treatment uses yoga, healing sounds, smudge sticks and a highly specialised marma facial massage to balance Vishuddha. It enables us to acknowledge and express the truth in and around us, reconnects the mind to a positive flow and encourages a deep and restful sleep . See Yoga section for recommended Hatha Yoga Enhancer. Ajna 120 minutes Ajna - the third eye chakra - is located in the centre of the forehead. Responsible for physical sight, and spiritual insight, it also deals with perception and intuition, imagination, concentration and peace of mind. Ajna is linked to the pituitary gland: when balanced, it has a harmonising effect on our emotional behaviour. The best way to unblock and balance Ajna is through meditation. This treatment uses yoga, breathing techniques, essential oils of sandalwood and jasmine, and specific marma and light technique massage to balance the higher and lower selves . The mind feels light, clear and knowing, and a sense of peace and harmony pervades the whole body. See Yoga section for recommended Hatha Yoga Enhancer. Sahasrara 120 minutes Sahasrara - the crown chakra - is located at the top of the head. Symbolised by a lotus with one thousand petals, it is the chakra of pure consciousness. Sahasrara represents liberation and inner wisdom and - as the point of entry for celestial energy - is our connection to the cosmic universe. This enlightening and unifying treatment rejuvenates the nervous system through a sequence of foot, back, head and toe massages that channel energy from the heart of the earth to the higher self. With seabuckthorn to regenerate life force and orange blossom and jasmine to attract cosmic light, this gentle yet powerful treatment leads to a state of blissful understanding. See Yoga section for recommended Meditation and Pranayama Enhancer. Tantric Traditions At its core, the spiritual tradition of Tantra embraces life and all creation. It compels us to see ourselves as perfect - inexhaustible, boundless and immeasurable - and to become 'one' with the universe and all living things. Tantra, meaning 'weave' in Sanskrit, teaches awareness of Shiva and Shakti, the two inseparable forces of consciousness and energy present in each of us that also give form to all matter in existence. In this way, Tantra encourages us to expand our consciousness and unite with the infinite possibilities of the universe. Each ritual is designed to awaken our awareness and put us on the path to wholeness - because it is only when we live and feel at one with the forces within and around us that we are awake and alive in the fullest sense. Siddha Tantric Rituals Each ritual incorporates a 90-minute Tantric massage, herbal steam and bath. Omkara Ritual for Couples 180 minutes Coiled like a sleeping serpent at the base of the spine, the Kundalini gland is a powerhouse of creative energy. The centrepiece of this hypnotic ritual is the Kundalini Massage . Performed by a pair of male and female Tantric therapists using fluid, dance-like movements and melodic strokes, this massage harnesses the Shiva (male) and Shakti (female) energies to stir the Kundalini; awakened, it rises through the spine and chakra channels, releasing blocked energy and increasing awareness. Devi Bhavani Ritual for Women 150 minutes Each woman has within her the power to create new life, along with the transformative energy of beauty, delight and creativity; inspired by Devi Bhavani - the Divine Mother - this energy flows like soothing wind and calming water, bringing about positive, life-affirming changes. Delivered by two female Tantric therapists, this ritual nourishes and replenishes the female energy with mantras, sacred songs and healing sounds , and nurtures the body with a tender, revitalising massage. Ojas and Atma Ritual for Men 150 minutes In its purest form, male energy is both dynamic and transcendent. This duality is reflected in the Ojas (vitality) and Atma (spirit) ritual. Vigorous and expressive, the techniques used in this treatment require both the strength and spiritual concentration of the two male Tantric therapists. Their synchronised movements invigorate the body by increasing body heat and vitality and flushing toxins out of the systems . Meditative and soulful, the ritual also uplifts the spirit by taking it on a contemplative journey. RECONNECTION RITUALS At the heart of optimum health and wellness lies our connection with ourselves and those around us. Our four Reconnection Rituals offer each family member the opportunity to cast aside all external stresses and reconnect fully with their inner bliss, both individually and as a unit.Key to the success of these special rituals is the strong bond within our spa team -between one another and between themselves and the guest. Aailaa Ritual 120 minutes In societies where modern services and facilities are not always close at hand, the importance of the family unit cannot be overestimated. Meaning 'family' in Dhivehi (the Maldivian language), our Aailaa ritual celebrates the communal familial structure of the Maldivian people. A relaxing and bonding journey for up to four family members , (parents and children) this ritual takes each family through a nurturing sequence of body therapies culminating in a special celebration of 'togetherness'. Kaumara Ritual 120 minutes Aimed at young adults aged 12 to 18, our Kaumara Ritual ('adolescence' in Sanskrit) have been specially designed to nurture teenagers' emotional and physical bodies at their most vulnerable stage . With rose oil to calm and support the heart and vetivert to ground the body and mind, this special sequence of scrub, bath and facial balances from inside out. For girls, a focus on the heart and earth chakras enables a connection to the energy centres of strength and vitality; for boys, a focus on the throat chakra connects to growth and maturation. Kuda Vela Ritual 60 minutes Children have very little control over their own basic needs, yet depend on a nurturing physical and emotional environment to thrive. This gentle, one hour treatment leads children as young as 7 through an exploratory journey of holistic therapy , instilling in them a sense of peace and security, stability and belonging. Through a series of yoga postures, body painting, bathing and song, children are curiously calmed and delightfully intrigued: the perfect 'first insight' into the wonderful world of spa. Parents are invited to sign a waiver, sit and watch or enjoy a simultaneous treatment (not included) in the same suite. Zaanta Nidraa Ritual 180 minutes Meaning 'peaceful sleep' in Sanskrit, our delicate yet powerful Zaanta Nidraa ritual draws on healing sounds, marma massage and chakra healing to purify the mind and balance the throat chakra - the body's sleep centre. Designed to improve the overall quality of sleep , this meditative sequence of chanting, purification, bathing and body therapies is complemented by mineral-rich Himalayan crystal salt and essential oils of jatamansi, vetivert, jasmine and patchouli. The ritual is augmented by the peaceful aura of the island, which helps the body connect and synchronise with the gentle rhythms of the ocean and solar cycle. Mesmerising alone, beautiful to share.
