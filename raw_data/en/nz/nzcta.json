Schedules 167 8. Glossary 183 Foreword Legislation enacted on 1 April 20 09 created a new Commissioning system with the establishment of a region-wide Health and Social Care Board, including 5 Local Commissioning Groups (LCGs), and a Public Health Agency. In li ne with Departmental direction and guidance the objectives of th e new commissioning arrangements were to: \u0083 Approach the future delivery of Health and Social Care from a region-wide perspective focused on outcomes. \u0083 Ensure local sensitivity throu gh the creation of five Local Commissioning Groups reflective of their areas. \u0083 Give appropriate weight to the public health agenda to ensure that commissioning reflects the drive to reduce health inequalities in our society and works in partnership with others to improve health and wellbeing. In this regard the legislation si gnalled a new way forward which would first be expressed in a Commissioning Plan for 2010/11 and beyond. This plan outlines how the Health and Social Care Board and the Public Health Agency are approaching that task. It is our aim that this plan is straightforward and written in a manner which will encourage public engagement and understanding. We wish to show clearly how the commissioning task is to be approached and to signal the decisions necessary to ensure the maintenance of a health and social care system in Northern Ireland which responds to the population it serves. The Commissioning Plan takes full account of the commissioning direction, financial parameters and Pr iorities for Action set out by the Minister and DHSSPS. Co mmissioning has been defined as a \" ... process which looks at the ne eds of the population, and plans and secures health and social se rvices to respond to that need within given financial parameters with the objective of improving and protecting the health and social wellbeing of the population Commissioning is the process which looks at the needs of the population and plans and secures Health and Social Services to respond to that need. and reducing differences in access to good health and quality of life\". In this regard Commissioning is princ ipally concerned with what is available; it is less concern ed with (although not exclusively divorced from) how it is provided. To discharge this responsibility we propose to use the criteria lis ted below in our planning and decision making to ensure t hat these processes are linked explicitly to the need for ch ange and for impro ved clarity of purpose: \u0083 Are decisions rooted in ex isting policy and targeted to delivering Ministerial objectives and Priorities for Action? \u0083 Do they demonstrate appropri ate needs assessment of the population? \u0083 Is there evidence and/or measurement to support these judgements? \u0083 Can we show that the out comes for the citizen will be improved? \u0083 Is there balance between lo cal provision and the need to ensure safety and sustainab ility of services to the population? \u0083 Do proposals take account of opportunities for earlier diagnosis and more cost effective intervention? \u0083 Do our proposals ensure an accessible service for the population and address inequalities? \u0083 Do the decisions take acco unt of imminent and future changes in treatment and care? \u0083 Do our proposals contribute to improving health and social wellbeing and reducing health inequalities? \u0083 Are decisions in line with the agreed commissioner quality standards? The last three years hav e seen many significant improvements in a wide range of areas, most notably in waiting times for elective treatment and for A ccident and Emergency services; in childcare services, improved access to specialist drugs, better access to primary care services, the development of enhanced services which have enabled the shift of care from hospital to community, improvements in chronic disease management through the Quality Outcomes Framework and the continuing growth in community services. The improvements - particularly in waiting times - have been achieved despite a significant growth in demand. This has been achieved by in vesting in a range of Health and Social Care (HSC) provision and by specific initiatives procured outside that framework. Over the same period the HSC syst em has been faced with the need to make an overall 9% reducti on in funding through improved efficiency. Simultaneously it has had to absorb significant increases in demand, perhaps up to 2%. That so much has been done in the face of serious fi nancial constraint and increased demand is a tribute to the professi onalism and dedication of Health and Social Care. However, if we are to have a prospect of maintaining the quality of our services and indeed making progress on the many challenges still facing us (such as addressing health inequalities) we need to progress three key areas. First, we need to understand more fully the nature of demand for services and to identify better ways of dealing with the increases in demand that we have experienced. Our experience to date suggests a number of major avenu es through which we can take this work forward: \u0083 The development of groups of General Practitioners co- operating together in the delivery of Primary Care; \u0083 The reshaping of existing pa tterns of hospital services; \u0083 The promotion of \"living at hom e\" strategies in dealing with a range of illnesses including m any chronic conditions. The future shape of Northern Ireland Health and Social Care system needs to change. Maintaining the status quo is not an option. Secondly, we must plan for t he future in the knowledge that significant new resources are unlikel y to be available. This will mean reviewing how existing servic es can be reshaped to deliver future demand and need s - even where this confronts us with difficult and potentially unpopular choices. Finally, we need to give a much greater emphasis to health promotion and disease prevention. For example, research suggests up to 70% of all attendances at general practice are directly related to weight, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, poor sleep or stress. Clearly a different approach to lifestyle and targeted interventions can materially change the population's health st atus and address inequalities in health. The Public Health Agency will have a key role in developing programmes to dri ve this agenda forward. The Commissioning Plan was app roved by the Boards of the Health and Social Care Board and the Public Health Agency on 27 th of May 2010 and submitted to the Department for consideration. The final Commi ssioning Plan was approved by the Minister on ( ) and arrangements have now been put in place by the Health and Social Care Board, in partnership with the Public Health Agency, to oversee the deliv ery of the Commissioning Plan. These include: \u0083 The translation of the Commi ssioning Plan into objectives within corporate and local commi ssioning plans that will be the subject of scrutiny th rough established performance review; \u0083 Detailed service and budge t agreements with providers, supported by appropriate perf ormance management regimes to ensure delivery of Priority for Action targets and other objectives; \u0083 Project management arrangements to implement and monitor the financial plan for 2010 /11 in line with the financial allocation received from the Department; We need to give much greater emphasis to health promotion and disease prevention. \u0083 Securing the development of detailed proposals from Local Commissioning Groups and Provider s to give effect to the commissioning strategy in this Commissioning Plan for consideration, equality scr eening, consultation and implementation as appropriate. The future shape of Northern Ir eland Health and Social Care system needs to change. Maintain ing the status quo is not an option. Commissioning can and w ill create that change and this Commissioning Plan for 2010/11 reflects that imperative, acknowledging that final decisions fall to the Minister and the Department in the light of resource availability. Dr Iain Clements Chair, Health and Social Care Board Mr John Compton Chief Executive, Health and Social Care Board Ms Mary McMahon Chair, Public Health Agency Dr Eddie Rooney, Chief Executive, Public Health Agency 1Section One Summaries and Overviews 21 Strategic Context This section focuses on some of the environmental factors influencing policy formulation and on the major policy imperatives which define the future direction of travel for service development and redesign. 1.1 Demographic Changes Northern Ireland is becoming an old er society. While the absolute size of our population is estimat ed to increase over the next ten years, of greater significance to th e demand for Health and Social Care is the likelihood that the average age of our population will also continue to increase at a fast er rate. Specifically, estimates are that between 2008 and 2020: \u0083 The Northern Ireland populati on will increase by 142,000 people (8%); \u0083 The number of people over 75 ye ars will increase by 40%. Figure 1: Changing Demography of Northern Ireland - % Change by 2015, 2020 and 2030 by age group. 3Older people are major users of our Health and Social Care system. On any given day: \u0083 800 beds in Northern Ireland are occupied by individuals aged over 70 years; \u0083 Two thirds of acute hospita l beds in Northern Ireland are occupied by individual s aged over 65 years; \u0083 1 in 14 people aged over 65 hav e a form of dementia, rising to 1 in 6 people over 80 and 1 in 3 over 85 years; \u0083 Of the 21,000 people who re ceive home help services, 69% are aged 75 years and over; \u0083 9,485 people aged over 65 are cared for in residential and nursing homes; \u0083 At any given time 1 older p erson in 8 is very dependent upon health and social services to support them each day. If systems remain unchanged by 2020 demand placed on our systems by an elderly population mean that hospital admissions will have increased by 17% and beds used by 23%. Older people tell us that they want care, support and treatment in or clos e to home (Health & Wellbeing Strategy for Older People 2 006-16). Commissioning must therefore continue to reform and mod ernise the Health and Social Care system, responding to growing demand with an increased emphasis on community based services. An important element within this plan is to promote older people's health and wellbeing, through a furth er shift to supporting people at home and giving individuals, thei r family and local communities' greater control over the range and delivery of services. Major features will be positive health promotion, the active prioritisation of direct payment schemes, the focus on support for carers, the management of people with chroni c diseases in their own homes with the help of technology, and the delivery of palliative care in the community. An important element within this plan is a further shift to supporting people at home. 4 1.2 Safe and Sustainable Services The overall aim in commissioning is to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland have timely access to high quality services and equipment, responsive to their needs and delivered locally where this can be done safely, sustainabl y and cost effectively. To maintain and to continue to achi eve this standard of service will mean a reprofiling of the current pa ttern of services. To meet best clinical practice some services may have to be delivered on a national, regional or sub regional basis. This is not a new approach and we have demonstrated in the past - for example by consolidating cancer care into t he major acute hospitals with strealined access to a regional service - that we can provide evidence based practice st andards and achieve improved outcomes for people with cancer. Frequently these changes are simplistically portrayed as centralisation. The Commissioner will wish to secure local services for local people but simultaneously provide safe, sustainable services f or the population at large. The safety of services provided is paramount and we will progress strategies for reducing infection rates, reducing untoward events across all areas of practice, achieving real improvement in hygiene to improve outcomes and the patient/client experience. Commissioning is about securing good outcomes and providing safe services. We recognise the importance of patient choice and the need for people to have confidence in how our se rvices are provided. Choice will therefore be a major theme in drivi ng commissioning but this must be realistic and consistent with the delivery of safe, effective care. 1.3 Modern Treatments Since 1948 the nature of Health and Social Care services has been characterised by the need to respond to new demands, treatments and interventions. For example many surgical procedures previously requiring i npatient stays in hospital now To meet best clinical practice some services may have to be delivered on a national, regional or sub regional basis. 5happen safely on a day case basis allowing patients to return home on the same day as their treatment occurs. In recent years, we have seen t he day case rate as a percentage of total elective work increase in certain key service areas. By March 2011, there is a requirement that all Trusts in Northern Ireland achieve a 75% day ca se rate across a basket of 24 specified procedures which will s ee the number of day cases rise even further. Treatment for cancer has been revolutionised over the past decade with survival rates im proving across a range of cancers, although we still fall behind European survival rates in a number of cancers, so further work needs to be done. Improved survival rates have occu rred at a time of significant investment in improving access to cancer services including drug regimes. As survival rates cont inue to increase the nature of caring for people with cancer will change. More people will be living with cancer as a chronic illne ss and our services must evolve responsively to these needs. Figure 2: Changes in survival for male patient with cancer by cancer site, 1993 - 2002 (Five year relative survival by sex, cancer site and period of diagnosis. Source NI Cancer registry). 6 New drugs and treatment techni ques for a wide range of healthcare needs are constantly being developed and their efficacy and value assessed by t he National Institute for Clinical Excellence. Traditional support supplied in children's residential care has been revolutionised by a much expanded and more skilled fostering service. Home based treatment in mental health services has introduced a recovery model of treatment and led to major changes in how hospital care is provided. Primary Care has been given the opportunity to provide more care and treatment in the community through locally enhanc ed services. The decision to introduce and implement thes e kinds of improvements and innovations is linked to how we us e resources. Sometimes this will happen with new funding, or possi bly the re-use of funding released by greater efficiency or a decision to change the priority of an existing service. Our local population of 1.7m cannot support the full range of modern acute services some of which will have to be commissioned outside Northern Ireland to meet the required standards. Figure 3: Changes in survival for female patient with cancer by cancer site, 1993 - 2002 (Five year relative survival by sex, cancer site and period of diagnosis. Source NI Cancer registry). 7The introduction of a service c an also depend on the availability within Northern Ireland of staff with the appropriate expertise and skills. For example, with a local p opulation of 1.7m it is difficult to support the full range of modern acute services. Some very specialist services for our popul ation will either be commissioned outside Northern Ireland or will be jointly commissioned with other regions. It is also essential to recognise that it will not always be possible to commission immediately every new service that is available, even where approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. Commissioning in these areas will inevitably make for difficult choices. For example, we will shortly complete a pilot on dem and for bariatric surgery. There is no certainty that we will be in a po sition to commission this service locally and we may opt instead fo r prevention and support services as alternatives for those with obesity problems. Similarly, there are a number of instances where so cial care patients have been the subject of transfer to high cost facilities outside Northern Ireland. It will be important to scrutinise these and other similar future cases in order to deter mine whether appropriate alternatives can be supplied locally. 1.4 Resources Discussion about money is always c ontroversial. In the public perception, proposed changes or debates about money are frequently assumed to be about savings or perceived cuts. Where any commissioning decisions are primarily taken to make a saving or service reduction, this will be explicitly stated. In fact many of the dec isions to make change are not driven by money but by a desire to improve quality or effectiveness. Commissioners will not avoid such decisions but will seek to take them in an informed and sensitive manner that re flects the potential implications for individuals and communities. In the end however there are no neutral decisions. Unnecessary It will not always be possible to commission immediately every new service that is available. 2010/11 will be the most difficult financial year for Health and Social Care in a generation. 8preservation of an existing pattern of service delivery will in all probability mean denial of new devel opments. Making choices is a reality for any commissioning system. This is vitally important to understand in the financia l climate that commissioning is entering. For over a decade Health and So cial Care has invested in one year and met the full cost from a growth in funding the following year. The period 2010-13 w ill not permit such a pattern. It is much more likely that the money currently in the Health and Social Care system is the most that will be av ailable leading to a number of difficult years ahead. Whilst this represents a different climate the Health and Social Care system is likely to continue to spend 38% of the Northern Ireland Block. We will commit nearly \u00a310m 1 every 24 hours to enable the delivery of services to the population of Northern Ireland. Opportun ities to develop new services remain but onl y if there is change and greater efficiency in the current service patterns. It is, however, a fact that 2010/11 will be the most difficult financial year for Health and Social Care in a generation. Often when there is a debate in regards to resource the problem is presented in terms of unnecessary bureaucracy. While it is important that administration and management costs are tightly controlled and represent value fo r money, this does not reflect where the real focus needs to be. Within Health and Social Care today we commit 4.1% of the commissioning resource to management costs. We need a p roperly managed system that is responsibly resourced. Very significant administrative and management savings have been made in the last 3 years. For example a 20% reduction in the re sources available to the Health and Social Care Board has been achieved. The real debate about resource is an understanding of the need for change and decisions about what can and cannot be pro vided. The Plan will not be distracted from this central issue. However, as Commissioners, we fully appreciate that final dec isions require to be endorsed by the Minister and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS). 1.5 Workforce Successful commissioning needs to have a keen appreciation of the workforce implications of what it wishes to see provided. This 1Source: DFP Review of 2010/11 Spending Plans 9In 2009/10 \u00a325m was spent on locum doctors and nurses in Northern Ireland to support the existing hospital system. holds true for all types of grades an d staff working in the sector. It also requires the Commissioner to have an appreciation of capacity within the delivery system. This interest spreads across both the statutory and independent sector. In 2009/10 \u00a325m was spent on locum doctors and nurses in Northern Ireland to support the existing hospital system. Such expenditure not only represents poor value for money but also impacts on the continuity and therefore the quality of care provided. Commi ssioning in 2010 and beyond will seek to reshape the ho spital sector in a manner which minimises the need for such expe nditure. This change is also required to respond to the im plementation of the European Working Time Directive and take account of the actual medical workforce availability. Such a change is driven principally by quality, and the interplay of quality, volume and value for money is at the core of this decision making process. Although there will be a requirement f or rapid change it will be done in such a manner as to reflect the need to respond to capacity. Failure to acknowledge this would simply lead to unplanned service change or collapse and inappropriate commissioning which does not take account of responsible risk management. 1.6 Demand Reference has already been made to demographic change and the effect this has on demand for services: \u0083 In 2008/09 demand grew by 12% in the hospital sector and is on target for a further 9% growth in 2009/10; \u0083 Family and child care services saw demand in the children at most risk grow by 20%; \u0083 In one Trust area additional home care services for older people rose by 20% between 200 8 and 2009. For the same Trust there was a 55% increase in the number of older people with complex care needs discharged from hospital over the same period. 10In 2008/09 demand grew by 12% in the hospital sector and is on target for a further 9% growth in 2009/10. We propose to accelerate the implementation of the final stages of this strategy so that the transition to this model will be substantially completed by 2013. Understanding these demand patterns is a central issue for the commissioning system and 2010 will see detailed work and analysis undertaken on bot h demand for serv ices and on our performance in meeting that demand. For example, if we were able to improve our performance in hospital length of stay to a level equivalent to the better performing hospitals in the rest of the UK this would substantially reduce the requirement for beds. This in turn would allow us to consider re-investment in community based services and prevention/screening programmes whilst maintaining or even raising quality within the hospital sector. This means planned change within the hospital sector. At the same time, the creation of Local Commissioning Groups provides us with an opportunity to engage with family practitioners, patients, carers and lo cal care providers to examine both the nature of demand and the potentia l for local alternatives for appropriate assessment and treatment. Local Commissioning Groups, in par tnership with primary care, will have a key role in the analysis of demand for services and in developing, where appropriate, safe , effective alternative models of care. For example in 2010/11 Local Commissioning Groups will, through partnerships with lo cal stakeholders, ex plore solutions within primary and community ca re as alternatives to acute assessment and treatment in a range of acute specialities. 1.7 Developing Better Services Written in 2002, this DHSSPS strategy addresses the future shape of hospital provision for Northern Ireland. Although time has moved on its core principles remain. Changes have occurred at Downpatrick, Lagan Valley, Enniskillen, Omagh, South Tyrone and most recently Magherafelt and Whiteabbey. In 2010/11 we propose to accelerate the implementation of the final stages of this strategy so that transition 11 A core theme (of Bamford) will be the need to strengthen community services to promote a recovery based model of care provided predominantly in or to this model will be substantially completed by 2013. In addition we will need to address the out come of the recently announced Review of Maternity Services and the impact this will have on the future pattern of provis ion later in 2010/11. The principal driver remains the maintenance of quality of intervention and whilst local serv ices and central delivery will be balanced in the commissioning proc ess, safety, sustainability and outcome will be the key determinants. The next steps in terms of detaile d implementation will follow but it will lead to new roles for local hospitals and the concentration of acute inpatient services on fewer sites. This approach will require change to facilities located in both urban and rural settings. Additionally it will signal new co mmissioning partnerships with the Republic of Ireland and ot her facilities in the UK. This will reflect the fact that a population of 1.7m is simply too small to safely sustain some highly specialised services. 1.8 The Bamford Report The Bamford Report and the 'Prot ect Life' Strategy set out the vision for the reform and modernisa tion of Mental Health, Learning Disability and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services over a fifteen year horizon. Since the pub lication of the individual reports, further evidence based models of service delivery have emerged and these will be integrated during the implementation of the Bamford recommendations. The Health and Social Care Board and the Public Health Agency have established a number of core task groups to take this work forward and this will be monitored by the Bamford Implementation Taskforce, led by the Health and Social Care Board's Chief Executive. A core theme will be the need to promote mental health and wellbeing and to strengthen community services to promote a recovery based model of care provided predominantly in or close to people's homes. As outlined in \"Delivering the Bamford Vision\" (DHSSPS, 2009), key themes include: 12It is important that children are valued, protected and cherished as they are the foundation stone for future generations.\u0083 Promoting positive health, wellbeing and early intervention; \u0083 Supporting people to lead independent lives; \u0083 Supporting meet people's needs; \u0083 Providing structures and a legislative base to deliver the Bamford Vision. 1.9 Older People The strategic direction for serv ices for older people has been guided by Priorities for Action in recent years, with the focus being on a continuum of integrated primary and community care services, supporting independence and reducing inappropriate reliance on hospitals and other institutional care. The anticipated Service Framework for Older People's Heal th and Wellbeing and the NI Dementia Strategy will form the future strategic direction for commissioning, with the agreement of evi dence based standards, targets and measurable outcomes. Using this strategic base, commissioning will aim to ensure a balance of provision between disease prevention, health promotion and healthy ageing, and t he required network of care and treatment services for those most at risk. 1.10 Children The theme of improving children's health and wellbeing resonates with the six high level outcomes identified in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister Strategy \"Our Children and Young People - Our Pledge\", which refers to actions which demonstrate and evidence to show that children and young people are: Our focus is on supporting independence and reducing inappropriate reliance on hospitals and other institutional care. 13\u0083 Healthy; \u0083 Enjoying, learning and achieving; \u0083 Living in safety and with stability; \u0083 Experiencing economic and environmental wellbeing; \u0083 Contributing positively to community and society; and \u0083 Living in a society whic h respects their rights. This strategy, combined with other overarching strategic documents issued by the DHSSP S, such as \"Care Matters\" and \"Families Matter\" provide the contex t in which services are being commissioned. There is recognition of the need for development and investment across the continuu m of children's services from prevention/early intervention to adoption/leaving and aftercare. There is an extensive body of ev idence which demonstrates the cost benefit analysis of an inve stment in our children. It is important that children are valued, protected and cherished as they are the foundation stone for future generations. \"Care Matters\" outlines the corporate role of Heal th and Social Care to assist those children and young people lo oked after and care leavers whose health and wellbeing requires to be improved. 1.11 Disability The Regional Strategy for People with Physical Disabilities and Sensory Impairment will be the strateg ic framework for services for this client group. The focus will continue to be on promoting health and wellbeing, independence and empowerment and improving the quality and responsiven ess of Health and So cial Care services for people with disabilities and t heir carers. The St rategy will adopt a life cycle approach co vering all age groups a nd will promote the importance of partnership work ing across community and independent sectors. 1.12 Reducing Inequalities and Promoting Health and Social Wellbeing Relative deprivation in Northern Ir eland is assessed by looking at income, employment, education, health, including disability and 14early death, local environment, cr ime and proximity of an area to services such as GP surgeries, hospitals or shops. Individual areas are ranked across Northern I reland based on these. The 20% of most deprived areas represent nearly 340,000 people. Populations from deprived areas in Northern Irel and experience:- \u0083 Lower life expectancy than the Northern Ireland average; \u0083 23% higher rates of emergency admission to 66% higher rates of respiratory lung cancer; \u0083 73% higher rates of suicide; \u0083 Self harm admissions at twice the Northern Ireland average; \u0083 50% higher rates of smoking related deaths; \u0083 120% higher rates of alcohol related deaths. It is clear therefore that we need to do more to narrow the gap in health inequalities and improve the health and wellbeing of our population. This means workin g to address the determinants of ill health and reduce risk factors, including those associated with poverty and social exclusion. This Commissioning Plan contains specific measures to address this challeng ing agenda, but it is equally important that health prevention and improvement is actively considered as an integral part of all of our commissioning strategies. The focus will be on the wider pu blic health a genda, addressing the determinants of health that co ntribute to and sustain health and social wellbeing inequalities. Inequalities in health arise because of inequalities in society. Addressing inequality therefore requires co-ordinated action across many di fferent sectors and government. The reform and modernisation of the commissioning process can greatly assist this goal. Firs tly, by taking a leadership role championing the issue and work ing collaboratively with other sectors to address the challenge; se condly, by shifting resources and commissioning 'upstream' interventions; and thirdly 15developing exemplar roles in crea ting healthy workplaces and by ensuring that the entire health and social care workforce use every interaction with the public to promote health and wellbeing. We will therefore aim to identify and encourage new models of care that facilitate the transfer of resources to this end. We will also consider the potential value of changes to relevant legislation where this may be a vehicle for pr omoting change. The aim will be to: \u0083 Make tangible difference to health and wellbeing outcomes; \u0083 Decrease incidence of major causes of ill health; \u0083 Maximise independent living; \u0083 Improve mental population; \u0083 Reduce health inequalities gap; \u0083 Build sustainable communities and increase social capital and community engagement; \u0083 Impact on the full pathway from community to service. 1.13 Performance Management The ability to positively impact on health and social inequalities cannot be exclusively addressed by the Health and Social Care Board. Meaningful partnerships and a common agenda need to be developed with our Trusts, our colleagues in local government, housing, education and the environm ent, and our communities if we are to effectively deliver on improving the health of our population. The Public Health Agency will have a key role in developing programmes to drive th is agenda forward in the context of the review of the Investing for Health Strategy and the work that will be developed on a new Inve sting for Health Strategy for beyond 2012 Strong performance management will be key to achieving an outcome which is positive and publicly understood, and ensures compliance with standards, statutory obligations and Priorities for Action targets set annually by the DHSSPS. In 2010/11 we will 16 Our first obligation is to ensure safe, sustainable services which respond effectively to the population's needs. continue to develop the use and publication of a range of high level commissioning milestones as a benchmark of performance. While performance management of our care providers such as Trusts, General Practitioners and other primary care providers will be conducted in a supportive manner , we will be clear our first obligation is to ensure safe, sust ainable services which respond effectively to the population' s needs and repres ent value for money. 1.14 Evidence Based Commissioning Commissioning needs to be carri ed out within a framework of formal evidenced based guid ance about the standards and outcomes we need to achieve. There are two key drivers in developing this approach: Managed Clinical Networks Managed Clinical Networks are a way of supporting the provision of high quality, sust ainable, safe and effective services to our population. Integration and partners hips with clinical colleagues, either regionally, nationally or with the Republic of Ireland means that in Northern Ireland, despite our small population, we can be assured that our services are delivered to the highest possible standards. We already have some networks in place for paediatric cardiac surgery, adult intens ive care, cancer and pathology services, and we will continue to develop these arrangements as appropriate. Service Frameworks Service Frameworks are sets of gu idance on the highest quality of care and good practice spanning specific conditions or service areas. This guidance encompasse s nationally supported evidence based standards, as well as the input of local clinical experts, in the development of recommendations applicable to our local services. Work is currently underw ay on the implementation of the Service Frameworks for Cardiovascu lar and Respiratory Services. Other Service Frameworks for Cancer, Mental Health and 17Wellbeing, Learning Disability, the Health and Wellbeing of Children and Young People and the We llbeing of Older People are at various stages of development. Commissioning will make progress with the implementation of these recommendations. However, there will be a need to balance how and when the recommendations can be fully implemented with affordability, workforce sk ills and capital investment. Approaches in the near future are therefore likely to focus on standardisation of good practice and reprofiling of care systems in the first instance, rather than as suming that significant additional resources will be available for service development. 182. Ensuring Financial Stability and Effective Use of Resources The key objective of the Commissioning Plan is to use all available resources to ensure the overall inve stment in services secures as broad a range as is practicable al ong with the best possible outcomes for local populations. In developing the Commissioning Plan the Health and Social Care Board, supported by the Public Health Agency, recognises that si gnificant resources are available to support its succe ssful delivery. In 2010/ 11 this will include access to almost \u00a33,559.4m of the commissioning revenue resources. To deliver a successful Commissioning Plan requires us to be sensitive to the financial param eters within which commissioning operates. It is vitally important that we provide as much clarity as we can to the public in relation to the financial climate within which commissioning will operate in 2010-13. It is unlikely that the level of growth funds that has charac terised the last decade will be available in the period 2010-13. Opportunities to develop new s ervices remain but will require transformational change in the curren t service patterns. Absolute growth in resources will be very limited. Decisions about how we make the be st use of the resources at our disposal will be complex, chall enging and at times controversial. Such decisions will need to take account of rising demand, existing shortfalls, the financial chal lenges and quality and service outcomes. Change is therefore an integral part of commissioning. The direction of travel set out in the Commissioning Plan will involve a greater focus on va lue for money, efficiency and improved outcomes in respect of the health and wellbeing of our local populations. Ensuring value for money will be driven forward through new models and pathways of care with greater use of benchmarking of standards for existing services across Health and Social Care. New accountab ility arrangements between providers and the Health and Social Care Board will underpin this process. This chapter covers: \u0083 An overview of the existing investment of Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency resources; 19 \u0083 An overview of the financia l plan for 2010/ 11 and key financial targets. 2.1 Existing Investment In 2009/10 the DHSSPS received an overall budget of recurrent resources, \u00a34.3bn. Of this, the Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency received \u00a33. 1bn for commissioning Health and Social Care on behalf of the 1.7m people resident in Northern Ireland. The balance was used by the DHSSPS to directly fund a range of areas such as prescripti on drugs costs, general practice costs as well as dentistry and opt ician services. (During 2010 the responsibility for these services will transfer to the Health and Social Care Board).

These have been broadly mapped in Figure 5 (below) to the Pr iority for Action areas around which the 2010/11 Commissioning Plan has been developed.

Taking account of the diverse needs of local populations is also key. Different popula tion profiles in localities result in the requirement to target resources to reflect the different levels of need; for example, where there are p articularly high levels of the very elderly or very young as t hey are the primary users of health care. It is also the case that where there are high levels of deprivation within population areas th is will result in a higher than average need for investment in ar eas such as social care and health improvement. The Health and Social Care Board uses a validated statistical resource allocation formula to inform its investment decisions made for the population in their localities. This is known as the \"capitati on formula\". It reflects the different levels of needs across the populatio n for Health and Social Care resources. Figure 6 shows the rel evant capitation shares mapped to localities. 21Figure 6 Figure 7 Investment in Local Populations 21.9% 18.0% 24.2%18.8%17.1% Belfast LCG - Resource Framework 2009/10 A further \u00a3483m Ireland - LCG Boundaries and Capitation Shares This material is Crown Copyright andNorthern LCG - 24.3% Western East LCG - 18.0% Capitation shares based on 2007 Mid Year Estimates 22Figure 7 illustrates how existing resources are invested in local populations. It is important to appreciate that services provided to a population may not always occur in the lo cal geography. Whilst the Health and Social Care Board is committed to local services for local people, it must also ensure that the population has a safe and sustainable service. For exampl e, specialist residential care for children or cardiac surgery w ill be provided on a province wide basis. 2.2 Overview of Financial Plan 2010/11 The DHSSPS previously publishe d three year resource plans for Health and Social Care spa nning 2008/09-2010/11. These were fully approved by the Northern Irel and Executive. These indicated baseline recurrent allocations at the end of the 2009/10 financial year to the Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency with plans to allocate around \u00a3107m for priority service improvements and developments in 2010/11. However, the financial climate for 2010/11 has changed since the publication of these original pl ans. The changes were confirmed when the Northern Ireland budget was ratified by the Executive in April 2010. The key facts for H ealth and Social Care planning assumptions in 2010 are now threefold: \u0083 Pressures identified at Nort hern Ireland Block level impacting on all government Departments leading to \u00a3105m less for Health and Social Care than was planned within the original three-year 2008/09-2010/11 Comprehensive Spending Review settlement; \u0083 New and emerging inescapable pressures across Health and Social Care which were not included in the original resource plan must be met. For example the cost of continuing to meet waiting time targets; \u0083 Provider Trusts are faci ng unprecedented challenges in maintaining financial stability and meeting efficiency targets e.g. two Provider Trusts ne eding temporary financial support 23to manage deficits in 2009/10 and enable a recovery plan to be implemented in 2010/11. The key financial targets for 2010/11 remain financial breakeven and delivery of efficiency savings , therefore the commissioning system will expect all organisation s to live within the resources allocated. To achieve this object ive the financial aspects of the Commissioning Plan have robustly fo cused on ensuring there is a source of funds for all expenditure and prioritisation of inescapable funding requirements. At times there can be a debate about bureaucracy and inefficiency in the Health and Social Care sy stem and the Health and Social Care Board will wish to drive down costs and add to productivity. However, the notion that th e financial constraints can be exclusively addressed as a conseq uence of these issues is not accurate and diverts from the real public debate that will be required on resources a nd its utilisation. In order to address the impact of the above and to plan for potential further inescapable pressures emerging across Health and Social Care, the DHSSPS and the Health and Social Care Board/Public Health Agency have undertaken in-depth reviews of the financial position in 2010 -11 using the following approach. The outcome of the work is centra l in shaping the commissioning finance plan for 2010/11. 1. A detailed assessment was undertaken to quantify the scale of funding required to addre ss both the emerging financial pressures and the planning assump tions identified above. 2. Potential sources to address the funding gap were identified, focusing on those sources which will have the least impact on the health and wellbei ng of our population. 3. Priority areas for servic e investment in 2010/11 were identified and resourced in the financial plan. 2.3 Quantification of Funding Pressures A review of the impact of th e emerging 2010/11 HSC financial environment identified total pressures of \u00a3275m to \u00a3300m 24including the third year of th e Comprehensive Spending Review. The consequences for the Commissio ner are therefore substantial. Recent pressures at the N orthern Ireland Block Level have resulted in the Northern Ireland Assembly advising of further reductions to Departments' 2010/ 11 baselines. However, not withstanding this, almost \u00a310m will be spent every 24 hours on our health system. The Commissioning Plan must al so reflect the reality of the financial operating position of the Trusts. Rising demand, for example in hospital care, providing care at home or in child care are demonstrable. Inflation and ch anging cost patterns in such areas as water charges hav e added to the pressure. Notwithstanding this, as a Commissioner we will want to audit such pressures to ensure that all is being done to manage efficiently in a difficult financial climate. 2.4 Existing Efficiency Savings Targets 2010/11 Within the context of the original financial plan, co vering the three- year period 2008/09 to 2010/11, the Health and Social Care system was required to achieve some \u00a3260m of recurrent Cash- Releasing Efficiency Savings by the conclusion of 2010/11, as detailed in Table 1. 25Table 1 Organisation Cumulative Cash Release Targets -97.89 Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency RPA -0.84 -3.88 -10.90 -7.03 Total per allocation letter -67.80 -157.77 -259.68 -104.91 Based on these earlier Comprehensive Spending Review plans, the Health and Social Care Board and Trusts are currently required to achieve \u00a3104.9m of recurr ent cash efficiency savings in 2010/11, before consideration of the additional cash releasing requirements of \u00a3105m in 2010/11 arising from the recently announced budget change from the Northern Ireland Executive. 2.5 Trusts' Financial Positions Trusts have experienced increasing financial difficulties during the course of 2009/10. Indeed, in 2009/10, Trusts found it necessary to initiate in-year Trust Conti ngency Plans, in order to fulfil their statutory duty to financially break even. In the c ontext of 2010/11, the Health and Social Care system anticipates that it will need to invest in maintaining existing se rvices as well as developing new provision. 262.6 Planned Investments in 2010/11 As with any year, there are a large number of new service proposals to be cons idered. However, we balance the maintenance and reshape of existi ng services in parallel with the development of new services as the correct way forward. Consequently the speed of new investment will be carefully controlled. 2.7 Sources to Address Identified Funding Gap Health and Social Care is being asked to deliver sa vings of \u00a3284m in 2010/11 arising from: \u0083 The third year of the Co mprehensive Spending Review efficiency savings as agreed in 2008; \u0083 The additional reductions deci ded by the Northern Ireland Executive in 2010; and \u0083 The need to cover elective care costs consistent with the Minister's decisions as set out in Priorities for Action. The consequences of the total fina l position is that the DHSSPS's commissioning direction of the Health and Social Care Board means that it has to plan for sa vings of \u00a3204m. The sources of funds identified are summarised in Table 2. 27 Table 2 Proposed Sources of Funds Description \u00a3m Comprehensive Spending Review Year 3: Trust Payroll; Strategic Service Redesign and efficiency Additional Income 40 15 3 Deferral of funds associated with Maintaining Existing Services 42 Deferral of originally planned Service Developments 58 Family Health Services Pharmacy Control 46 Total 204 2.7(i) Comprehensive Spending Review - Year 3 This covers the period 2008-2011 and to deliver these targets a series of actions over 2 010/11 (Year 3) will be required, specifically; \u0083 Payroll expenditure control whic h includes the use of agency, locum and overtime alongside containing recruitment within normal turnover parameters; \u0083 The redesign of services focuses on improved outcomes and efficiency. Despite the complexity of the financial environment these changes are principally driven by the need to respond to organising serv ices to achieve efficient, sustainable quality; whilst \u0083 Additional income will come f rom regularising such issues as staff meal charges across the province. 282.7(ii) Family Health Services Pharmacy Control It is anticipated that improved procurement procedures and monitoring mechanisms together with other efficiencies such as working with prescribing pharmacists will allow these savings to be delivered from the Family Health Services budget. 2.7(iii) Maintaining Existing Services and Service Developments The changing financial scenario ha s required us to look again at the additional funding we proposed to make available for the maintenance of existing services and to curtail some elements of the new service developments origi nally planned for 2010/11. This will impact across all service areas . The following describes the broad deferral areas. In Mental Health investment of \u00a39.6m will be deferred. This will impact on plans to increase adv ocacy services and the number of dementia respite places. In Learning Disability of the \u00a38m in service developments originally identified we will not be ab le to invest \u00a35m. The majority of respite and autism services as originally planned will now be deferred. In Children's Services we are not investing \u00a31.7m into family and child care services. In Physical Disability the figure is \u00a33.8m. Consequently we will not provide the increased level of respite provision originally planned. In Cardiovascular, Stroke Services and Long Term Conditions we will not be able to progress the scale of community based rehabilitation services, monitori ng and specialist support for long term conditions as anticipat ed. We will also have to defer implementation of some of the recommendations in the Cardiovascular and Respiratory Service Frameworks. All this means a deferral in the order of \u00a312.6m. In Acute Services the deferral figure is \u00a316m. Consequently we will need to defer some additional pl anned intensive care capacity, 29consultant appointments and extr a radiotherapy capacity and be prudent about the rate of the expan ded use of specialist drugs. In Elective Care \u00a310m less will be inve sted. We will not therefore be able to ensure that all patients receive surgery as quickly as we would wish. The majority of pati ents will still benefit from 9 weeks for outpatient waits, 9 weeks for diagnostics and 13 weeks for inpatient treatment. However some inpatients may wait up to 36 weeks in a small number of specialities. In Public Health we are not able to invest in planned developments in interventional services, screening and community infection control initiatives. The Health and Social Care Board recognises that the deferral of new services is disappointing but it is considered better to focus on the consolidation of existing s ervices. If the financial climate permits the deferral decisio ns will be reviewed. 2.8 Planned Service Investments in 2010/11 There are major and complex manag ement challenges involved in meeting financial pressures of \u00a3204m and these will be carried forward by a Programme Board c haired by the Commissioner. Nonetheless, there will be a range of planned service investments of \u00a3117.8m in 2010/11. These are summarised in Table 3. 30 Table 3 Description \u00a3m Hospital Drugs 13.85 Long term conditions 0.1 Demographics/Elderly 15.1 Mental Health 2.8 Learning Disability 3.09 Physical Disability 1.22 Acute Services and Complex Needs 2.03 Children's Services 2.36 Public Health Public Health Agency (*inc Tele- health \u00a32.1m) 4.8 * Managing Reform 2.4 * Elective Access 40 * Maintaining Services 30 Total 117.8 * Non-recurrent funding in 2010/11 Hospital Drugs - \u00a313.85m These funds will be used to provide drug therapy for a range of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, HIV, multiple sclerosi s, age related macular degeneration, cancer, orphan enzyme conditions, cystic fibrosis, new National Institute for Clinical Excellence approved treatment s and high cost blood products. Long Term Conditions - \u00a30.1m These funds will be used to f und a British Heart Foundation nurse and a post with Macmillan Canc er regarding palliative care which is match funded. 31 Elderly and Other Speciali st Homecare Services - \u00a315.1m This funding will meet the growi ng needs of an ageing population for community care and adult protecti on. It will provide up to 3,000 additional packages of care to enable older pe ople to remain living at home or to return to home following a stay in hospital. Mental Health - \u00a32.8m To fund Mental Health resettlem ents from hospital, psychological therapies, community infrastruc ture, personality disorders and substance misuse liaison nurse. Learning Disability - \u00a33.09m To fund Learning Disability resettlements from long stay hospital, respite and autism. Physical Disability - \u00a31.22m These funds will support wheelchairs and prost hetics services and cover the costs of a process to provide essential replacement of prosthetic equipment. Acute Services and Complex Needs - \u00a32.03m This will be used to support renal services, obstetrics, statutory care assessments for autistic children, and stroke services. Children's Services - \u00a32.36m This will provide for Fa mily Support Interventi ons/Packages in the voluntary and community sector, t ogether with funding for Gateway Services and Post Adoption Support. Public Health Public Health Agency - \u00a34.8m To support bowel and \"Triple A\" screening, vaccinations and tele - health, pandemic flu and swine flu immunisation for pregnant women. 32Managing Reform - \u00a32.4m These funds are to fund preserv ed rights cases, cleaning pressure and activity in the Mater Hospital. Managing Elective Care - \u00a340m These funds, in combination with an additional \u00a325m in 2009/10, have been identified to continue to support the maintenance of Elective Access Standards. Maintaining Existing Services - \u00a330m This funding is intended to support Trusts in addressing cost pressures arising from areas such as increased utilities costs. In total therefore, \u00a3117.8m will be spent in the year 2010/11 to help maintain existing service de livery and to allow for the development of new services. It is evident that 2010 and bey ond is a very challenging year. It may be that revisions will need to be made in light of the new government's budget. However, it is clear that any further requirements levied would be very challenging with the potential to fundamentally change the current pat tern of Health and Social Care provision. 333. Personal and Public Involvement Personal and Public Involvement is about people and communities influencing the planning, commissi oning and deliver y of health and social care services. It means actively engaging with those who use our services and the public to discuss: their ideas, our plans; their experiences, our experiences ; why services need to change; what people want from services; how to make the best use of resources; and how to improve the quality and safety of services. Whilst the concept of Personal an d Public Involvement is not new, we have made considerable effort s in 2009/10 to further embed Personal and Public Involvem ent in our everyday work. For example, under the Health and Social Care Reform Act (NI) 2009, Health and Social Care Organi sations were required to have in place Draft Consultation Sc hemes on Personal and Public Involvement in accordance with Articles 19 and 20 of the legislation. A workshop was hel d in November 2009 with voluntary and community sector representatives to develop the Draft Consultation Schemes and to coll ect opinions on how to move Personal and Public Involvement fo rward. The Draft Consultations Schemes, influenced heavily by the outcome of the workshop, were submitted to the DHSSPS by 31 st December 2009 for approval. Further advice from this workshop was that Health and Social Care Organisations should, in relat ion to Personal and Public Involvement, find ways to work in a more co-ordinated way. In response to this advice a meeting with the relevant organisations was held in January 2010. As a result, it was agreed that t he Public Health Agency would take a lead role in establishi ng a regional Personal and Public Involvement Forum and develop a clear work plan for Personal and Public Involvement activities of Health and Social Care Organisations. This Forum will work to promote a whole system approach and reduce unnece ssary duplication. The specific roles for the DHSSPS, Health and Social Care Board, the Public Health Agency and T rusts at a strategic level will be complemented by the unique rol e of the newly formed Local Commissioning Groups. In preparing their input to this 342 Covers: religious belief, political opinion, racial group, age or marital status or sexual orientation, gender, disability, dependants 3 Covers: religious belief, political opinion and racial group. Commissioning Plan, Local Commissioning Groups engaged with their local populations, includ ing community and voluntary networks, to assist them in the development of their local priorities. The Local Commissioning Groups in tend to build on this process throughout 2010/11 and beyond. The Health and Social Care Board, including its Local Commissi oning Groups, and the Public Health Agency are committed to wo rking in partnership with the Patient and Client Council, other Health and Social Care Organisations and statutory bodies such as Local Councils, to promote Personal and Public Involvem ent and identify joint Public Involvement opportunities and reduce duplication. The Patient and Client Council undertook a major consultation exercise from August to No vember 2009 to inform the development of the DHSSPS's Prioriti es for Action 2010/11. As an example of our commitment to work with the Patient and Client Council, we ensured that the recommendations from this consultation exercise have also informed the development of this Commissioning Plan. We recognise Personal and Public Involvement as an integral process linking human rights and eq uality, patient and client experience, user involvemen t and community development. Section 75 of the Northern Irel and Act 1998 provides a legislative framework for the promotion of equality of opport unity and good relations. The Commissioning Plan, in both its developmental stage and implementation stages , has the potential to impact on Section 75 categories 2 and the categories3 under Good Relations. It also impacts on the human rights of individuals. In this context, substantial work has been undertaken to ensure that the development of our Personal and Public Involvement consultation schemes were in compliance with the requirements of Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act (1998), the Human Rights Act (1988) and the Disability Discrimination Act (1995). 35Once the Commissioning Plan has been approved by the DHSSPS, consideration will be gi ven to screening/equality impact assessment by the DHSSPS, Health and Social Care Board or Trusts as appropriate and where screening indicates a need for more thorough examination, an equa lity impact assessment will be considered. 36 4 Local Commissioning Groups 4.1 Background Legislation enacted on 1 April 2009 created a new commissioning system with the establishment of a region-wide Health & Social Care Board, including 5 Local Commissioning Groups, and a Public Health Agency. The obj ectives of the new commissioning arrangements will support lo cal sensitivity with the creation of 5 Local Commissioning Groups reflect ive of their geography. Local Commissioning Groups are made up of local political representatives and professional s and have a strong role in shaping local services and contribu ting to the formulation of Board policies. Local Commissioning Groups ar e charged with providing local leadership in commissioning health and social care. They are responsible for assessing the needs of the local population, planning to meet those needs and se curing delivery of Health and Social Care in line with the Plan. They will do this through wide ranging engagement with local communities, users and carers, and voluntary and statutory partners.

In addition there is an expectation that they will have a central role in the development of Primary Care Partnerships. As part of this process they will be req uired to contribute to a greater understanding of demand managemen t. Finally, they will be required, as part of the Health and Social Care Board, to contribute to the full range of decisions it is required to take. Local Commissioning Groups will, in the course of 2010/11, produce a Local Commissioning Plan providing a profile of their local population, needs assessment and commissioning priorities over the next 12 months. 395 Overarching Themes 5.1 Introduction This section summarises the key commissioning themes for the future and highlights the main changes which will need to take place if we are to secure safe , sustainable and high quality services for people of Nort hern Ireland. There are powerful arguments about why we need to make changes in how we commission services and we will need strong processes to drive these forward over the next three ye ars. However, it is essential that these begin to take effect in 2010. We are faced with the need to gene rate efficiency savings of 9% while simultaneously addressing t he potential impact of financial pressures from the wider enviro nment on the Northern Ireland Block. The net effect of this will be less resources for health and social care. The need to deliv er savings and respond to pressures generated by the current financial environment will be challenging. However, it is important that t hese are seen against the scale of our spending on Health and Social Care services. We will still continue to spend \u00a311m per day on Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland. 5.2 Tackling Health Inequalities Historically, much of our attention has been focused on specific targets and goals however the P ublic Health agenda has the potential to make a huge impact on the overall health and wellbeing of the population. The main elements of this agenda are: Tackling Health Inequalities Challenging health and social ineq ualities cannot be exclusively addressed by Health and Social Care organizations but requires meaningful partnerships and a co mmon agenda to be developed with our Trusts, our colleagues in local government, housing, education and the environment and o ur communities if we are to effectively deliver on improving t he health of our population. Public Health Agency is committ ed to ensuring the IFH strategy is fully implement and will use t he opportunity for developing new 40ways of working in collaborati on with our partners in local Government to drive this agenda forward. PHA is also committed to exploring new partnership workin g with other agencies in terms of the wider inequalities age nda in terms of how we share intelligence, agree joint objective s and seek new opportunities for engagement and collaboration Health Improvement We also need to give a much greater emphasis to health promotion and disease preventio n. For example, research suggests that up to 70% of all a ttendances at general practice are directly related to weight, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, poor sleep or stress. Clearly a diff erent approach to lifestyle and targeted interventions can materi ally change the population's health status and address inequalities in health. Public Health Agency will work across both regi onal and local domains to promote greater lifesty le choices an d addressing the wider determinants of health. This will include directly influencing the joint commissioning plan, the tr ust delivery plans and the work the Public Health Agency is taki ng forward with the community and other key stakeholders through Inve sting For Health Partnerships and joint working arrangements. Screening Programmes Population screening is an important public health activity that focuses on the early detection of disease. This allows for earlier interventions contributing to improved outcomes. 5.3 Primary Care Partnerships In order to support necessary cha nges in the way in which acute services are provided across N orthern Ireland, the Health and Social Care Board will explore th e feasibility of Primary Care Partnerships in 2010/11. Demand is an indicator of expressed need and this approach will suppo rt the underst anding of demand and, as a consequence, enable th e redesign of local services through the active involvement of clinical and care professionals, the voluntary sector and service users. The Health and Social Care Board's five Local Commi ssioning Groups will engage with and support partnerships so t hat primary and community care 41practitioners and staff receive the information and resources required to manage demand thro ugh more accessible local services. Partnerships will be built around local communities numbering around 100,000 and will include GP practices, pharmacists and other providers of health and care based in their area. They will have a key and central relationship with the Local Commissioning Groups and be in a position to provide more loca l expression of need into the commissioning process. Through assigning indicative budgets covering areas such as prescribing, outpatient care, diagnostics and community se rvices, Partnerships will be afforded the opportunity to reinvest a proportion of savings in local services. They will be clinically led to ensure strong clinical governance and decision making. Local Commissioning Groups will en sure that, in their formative phase, Primary Care Partnerships are supported with information on referral activity, budget and expenditure reports, quality outcomes and user experience. Part nerships will be ideally placed to exploit the benefits of the GP contracts' Quality and Outcomes Framework in terms of assessing the level of chronic disease in their local communities, with Practitioners overseeing the analysis of this important public health in formation. By focusing resources on patients with long term conditi ons and those most at risk of acute complications leading to ho spital admission, Primary Care Partnerships will be in a position to improve quality of life through early intervention and a reduced de pendence on specialist care. As the budget to support the prescribing of dr ugs by GPs transfers to the Health and Social Care B oard in 2010/11, it will be important to ensure that prescribing activity accurately reflects need and is of the highest quality. Primary Care Partnerships will support local prescribers through the expertise of pharmacists working within the Health and Social Care Board' s Medicines Management Team. Efficient and effective prescribing will help to maximise the quality of care provided to patients, particularly those suffering from chronic disease, and reduce the potential impact of budgetary pressures, within prescribing on ot her essential services. Under the leadership of Local Commissioning Groups, Primary Care Partnerships will be in a position to reinvest savings in developing improved services for local co mmunities including prevention alongside treatment. 42In developing this local model it w ill be important to take account of a wide range of views and the Heal th and Social Care Board will, through its Local Commissioning Groups, consult with stakeholders. Partnershi ps will seek approval for investment plans through their 'parent' Local Commissioning Group and their success in delivering change will be subject to evaluation in 2011/12. 5.4 Reshaping Acute Hospital Services The overall aim in commissioning is to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland have timely access to high quality services and equipment responsive to their needs and delivered locally where this can be done safely, sust ainably and cost effectively. To maintain and to continue to achieve this standard of service for our comparatively small population of 1.7m won't be possible unless we change the ways in wh ich we deliver care to people. Hospital acute services are changing. Commissioning hospital care in a different way does create anxiety but the primary driving force in this is about securing safe, high quality, sustainable services. As standards for training increase our Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Professions staff are work ing in an increasingly complex clinical environment. Senior c linical staff need to work in a different way, with access to a signi ficant clinical in frastructure, sub speciality expertise and larger t eams of senior colleagues to discuss and to make decisions ab out the best treatment and care for patients. There are also issues about needing to work in a different way to ensure that staff in training can gain the necessary experience which will best qualif y them to provide the highest quality of medical and nursing care. A critical issue in terms of how hospital services are commissi oned in the future will be to have a much closer relationship with the training bodies. In this way we can work together to dev elop approaches about training in systems or networks rather than in institutions to make training better for staff and the pat ients they care for. For many years Health and Social Care has tried its best to secure the right clinical staffing profile to maintain acute services but this is becoming increasingly difficult. Many of our services - and not 43just those provided in smaller units - are becoming more dependent on the use of locum cover which by its nature must impact on the continuity of c are because we cannot attract or retain permanent specialist staff. The drive for change in how we commission and provide acute care is not about money, it is about making sure that all of our populati on, irrespective of where they live, has access to the same stan dard of high quality, safe clinical care. Some of the changes in how we commission hospital care have already happened. Over the last 10 years Northern Ireland has streamlined its care for cancer patients by consolidating services into the major acute hospitals with streamlined access to the regional cancer centre as needed and we are seeing better outcomes for patients as a result. Progress with the 2002 DHSSPS Strategy \"Developing Better Services\" has also resulted in changes to acute hospital care in Downpatrick, Lisburn, Enniskillen and Omagh. Around 80% of hospital care is made up of diagnostics, outpatients, day care and ambulat ory services. Therefore it becomes clear that, irrespective of some of the changes that will have to happen in inpatient care, there remains a very important and key role for smaller local hospita ls where much of this activity takes place. We want to main tain, where it is safe, sustainable and appropriate to do so, as much local access for local people as possible. The local hospital has a key role in refining the diagnosis for patients and referring them through the system as appropriate. We want Local Commissioning Groups to work closely with local hospitals to shape the service care pathways so that they are responsive to local need and connect seamlessly to the rest of the hospital network. The next steps in terms of a detai led programme will follow, but we want to signal in this Commissioning Plan specifically what the changes and developments are likely to involve: \u0083 Investments in the order of \u00a3 13.85m to offer access to a range of specialist drug therapies; These approaches will ensure ... timely access to the best possible configuration of clinical expertise to meet health needs and improve outcomes consistently across the whole population. 44 \u0083 Recurrent investment of \u00a325m in local infrastructure to support waiting time targets to reduce the use of the Independent Sector; \u0083 Further developing the role and function of the local hospital network in providing access to diagnostics, outpatients, day and ambulatory care and estab lishing care pathways through the rest of the hospital system; \u0083 Supporting the changes which have occurred in 2010/11 in Magherafelt and at Whiteabbey by developing their outpatient, diagnostics, rehab ilitation and minor injuries capacity and putting in place new services such as bowel screening; \u0083 Redesign the system of A ccident and Emergency provision so that people have access to safe and sustainable services in line with their treatment needs; \u0083 Review the current profile of inpatient emergency surgical services to support emergi ng sub specialisation and appropriate staffing and expertise; \u0083 Avoiding inappropriate duplication of inpatient specialities in each of the Trust sites; \u0083 Ensure that the current profile of paediatric inpatient services provides appropriate staffing and expertise in line with best clinical practice; \u0083 Commission services in line with the recommendations of the Review of Maternity Services; \u0083 \"Right Sizing\" the number of acute medical inpatient beds for our population in line with national standards to release resources for reinvestment in front line services; \u0083 More rigorous adherence to the effective use of resources; Enabling people to live at home is a key objective in this Commissioning Plan. 45\u0083 Developing new clinical partnerships with larger acute providers in the Republic of Irel and and other fa cilities in the UK as well as continuing with the programme for establishing local Clinical Networks to en sure our servic es are delivered to the highest possible standards; \u0083 Acknowledging that a population of 1.7m may be too small to sustain some highly specialised services, but securing new arrangements which make sure our population gets timely access to these services when they are needed; \u0083 Specifying and addressing the impact these changes will have on emergency transport services; \u0083 Ensuring that the acute serv ice developments arising from the investment of \u00a351m in 2009/ 10 are fully in place in this financial year. Making these changes won't be easy. It will require dialogue with the population and involve fundamental strategic shifts in the current pattern of care, but we need to do this to secure good outcomes and provide safe services. We need to be innovative in how we establish networks of different elements of care and how we connect them to populations and to each other to ensure continuity. These approaches will ensure that the people of Northern Ireland get timely access to the best possible configuration of clinical expertise to meet their health needs and improve outcomes consistently across the whole population. We recognise the importance of patient choice and need We will work closely with individuals and their families when there is a change to services, being sensitive to their concerns. Local Area Coordination for disabled people in two Trust areas which opens up opportunities in people's communities for access to, and involvement in, work, leisure, training and further education. Supported living schemes for older people, disabled people, those with mental health problems and young people leaving care provide housing and support as alternatives to institutional care. 46for people to have confidence in how our services are provided. Choice will therefore be a major theme in driving commissioning. It must however recognise that th ere are limits to the extent of choices available and they must be consistent with the delivery of safe, effective care. 5.5 Living at Home People do better when they live at home. The outcome of people's care is better when provided as clos e as practicable to their home. This holds true for older people, children, those with disabilities and those with mental health issues. Enabling people to live at home is a key objective in this Commissioning Plan. Health and Social Care services need to be designed to promote i ndependence, recovery and rehabilitation and to support individuals to live fulfilling lives. Strong and effective partnerships wi th service users, families and carers and communities will be ess ential in order to provide person centred support to meet people's needs; that is support based on an individual's express wishes. Th is means looking at the support we give in a different way; based on the conc ept of recovery rather than long term care and in creasing community capacity to create greater opportunities f or people to be engaged in employment, education, leis ure and social activities. We will need to re-shape our serv ices in the following ways: \u0083 Promoting self care and se lf management of long term conditions such as asthma, c hronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure and diabetes; \u0083 Providing an agreed support pl an for all service users that promotes recovery; \u0083 Involving individuals more in decisions about their care; promoting the use of direct payments and exploring the potential for individual budgets; \u0083 Improving partnerships with t he voluntary and community sector to provide community based services; 47\u0083 Providing more rehabilitation at an earlier stage and reviewing domiciliary care and day care services to support this model; \u0083 Reviewing institutional care and the way in which long term support and care is provided; \u0083 Providing greater support to child ren and families; supporting parents in their parenting role and helping young people who are leaving care. There are already many examples of community based services that are promoting the principles outlined above, and most people will agree that such alternatives to institutional care are preferable and that more people should be able to avail of them. However, there are many challeng es in realising this shift in services; not least some peopl e will be concerned that appropriate and adequate support will be avail able in the community. Local Commissioning Groups, with the Pub lic Health Agency, will have a critical role in working with communities to increase community capacity; help re-design existing community support services and bringing forward plans fo r their local area. 5.6 Detailed responses to Priorities for Action 2010/11 In the next section, we set ou t in detail our response to the Priorities for Action for 2 010/11 reflecting the Commissioning system's obligation to progress an d deliver on the Priorities for Action Targets. 48 Section Two Detailed Proposals and Funding 49 Priorities for Action 2010/11 - Detailed Proposals and Funding This section sets out in detail the areas identified for action and funding in 2010/11 by the Minister and DHSSPS and the actions the Health and Social Care B oard and Public Health Agency propose to take to ensur e that targets are met. The DHSSPS has grouped this year' s priorities into a number of broad themes. These are: 1 Keeping adults and children well, improving their health and reducing health inequalities; 2 Ensuring services are safe, sustainable, accessible and patient centred; 3 Integrating primary, community and secondary care services; 4 Helping older people to live independently; 5 Improving children's health and wellbeing; 6 Improving mental health and care for people with disabilities; 7 Ensure financial stability and t he effective use of resources. 50Priority Area 1: Improve the Health Status of the Population and Reduce Health Inequalities 51 6.1.1 Strategic Content Improving health and wellbeing re mains one of the most fundamental ways of improving people 's quality of life. The key aim is to maintain and improve th e health status of the entire population and to reduce inequalit ies in health status between population group and geographical areas. Effective sustained improvements in health and wellbeing can best be achieved by promoting and deliv ering care at earlier stages in 'life pathway' of people. Shifti ng the focus 'upstream' towards prevention, health promotion and earlier diagnosis of disease through the provision of app ropriate and timely population screening and interventions will pos itively impact on the health and wellbeing of our population. In shifting and tailoring this focu s, account needs to be taken of differences in the health and well being status in our population. Significant inequalities exis t between local geographies and communities and are most often re lated to levels of deprivation and poverty. Action needs to be taken to improve everyone's health as well as those who are most disadvantaged in order to narrow this gap. 6.1.2 Commissioning Themes In addition to the Priorities for Action Targets the Health and Social Care Board and the Public Health Agency will progress a number of specific themes related to Keeping Adults and Children Well, Improving Health and R educing Inequalities: 6.1.2(i) Preventable ill Health It is estimated that there are so me 4,000 premature deaths per annum in Northern Ireland. There are, moreover, unacceptable inequalities in health often associated with socio-economic status and disadvantaged areas. Addressi ng these issues through the promotion of good health and well being, the prevention of illness and injury, early intervention and good long term care remains a key priority for the Health an d Social Care bodies and a major priority as they directly contri bute to the process of intelligent 52commissioning including needs assessment, engagement and demand management. Some of the most common characteristics associated with being born into poverty as opposed to more affluent circumstances are: \u0083 You are 40% more likely to die before the age of 75; \u0083 You are 5 times more likely to di e of drug or alcohol related diseases; \u0083 You are 3 times more likely to be a parent before you are 20; \u0083 You are twice as likely to die of a smoking related disease or lung cancer; \u0083 You are likely to die 7 ye ars earlier than someone from a less deprived area; \u0083 You are 3 times more likely to ta ke your own life by suicide; \u0083 Poor Mental Health Status - 19% of adults in Northern Ireland have a high GHQ12 4 Score and a 25% higher incidence of Mental Heal th problems than England and Scotland5 ; \u0083 In addition, it is recognised that other groups also experience disadvantage eg life expectancy for Travellers if estimated at some ten years less than the most disadvantaged settled communities. 6.1.2(ii) Health Improvement The theme of health improvement is also an integral element of other sections of the Commissioning Plan. Delivery must address the up-streaming of interventions designed to tackle inequalities. This will require a broad collaborative approac h with other sectors, including local government, educat ion, and local communities. 4 Northern Ireland Health and Social Wellbeing Survey 2005/06 5 Frieddi I, Parsonage M. Mental health promotion: Building an economic case. Belfast: Northern Ireland Association for Mental Health (NIAMH) 2007. 53However in terms of Priorities fo r Action performance, the primary issues for improving outcomes for adults and children include: \u0083 Implementation of the Investi ng For Health strategy and the commitment to work in part nership with other partners including local Government on agree priorities targeting life expectancy, wider determinant s and lifestyle choices. \u0083 Implementation of the mental health promotion strategy and subsequent review \u0083 Implementation of the Suicide Prevention Strategy (Protect Life) and supporting the review \u0083 Implementation of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy \u0083 Promotion of good Sexual Health \u0083 Addressing the rise in obesity levels, to include the roll out of the regional review on obesi ty framework consultation, promotion of breastfeeding, prom otion of physical activity and healthy diet and nutrition \u0083 Prevention of accidents in the home, workplace and on the roads \u0083 Implementation of the New Strategic Direction on Alcohol and Drugs, with support services for those with addiction, targeting binge drinki ng and young people \u0083 Implement the Tobacco Control action plan and development of a new regional strategy - wi th a focus on manual workers, young people, pregnant women etc \u0083 Promotion of good oral health linked into the wider Health Promotion strategies including obesity, smoking, accident prevention etc. 6.1.2(iii) Service Frameworks Service frameworks set standards with associated performance indicators, performance levels and ti meframes for specific service areas designed to: \u0083 Improve the health and social wellbeing of the population of Northern Ireland; \u0083 Reduce inequalities and promote social inclusion; \u0083 Improve the quality and safety of care; \u0083 Safeguard vulnerable in dividuals and groups; and 54 \u0083 Improve partnership working with other agencies and sectors. The Public Health Agency will work with relevant stakeholders to implement the health improvement performance indicators set out in the Cardiovascular and Resp iratory Service Frameworks. These are aimed at reducing cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Some apply to both F rameworks and include activity to stop smoking, increase physical ac tivity, encourage healthy eating and reduce consumption of alcohol. Some are Framework specific eg, increasing the percentage of pe ople trained in emergency life support, enhancing social and emot ional support to people with chronic respiratory illness and in creasing access to maintenance exercise classes. Implementation will focus on tack ling known areas of inequality and link carefully with the em erging joint working arrangements with local councils and existing par tnerships. This work will be progressed as part of a planned an d coordinated approach with the Health and Social Care Board to framework implementation. A similar approach will be used to implement the health improvement standards in the Cancer Service Framework when it is published. 6.1.2(iv) Population Screening Population screening is an important public health activity that focuses on the early detection of disease. Screening programmes currently in place in Northern I reland, and those wh ich are planned for implementation, can be grouped into four categories: cancer, vascular, newborn/child and antenata l, a number of these have already been covered by specific Pr iorities for Action targets. Quality assurance helps to en sure the benefits of screening are maximised and harm minimised. St ructures to support the quality assurance function are well est ablished within the cancer screening programmes. T hese mirror the arrangements elsewhere in the UK. However, the structures for non-cancer programmes are less well developed. The Public Health Agency will lead on the development of the quality ass urance function across Health and Social C are to support these programmes. 6.1.2(v) Health Protection 55The Public Health Agency will take the lead in ensuring that a full range of health protection services are provided. This includes the direct provision of services by th e Public Health Agency, including its statutory obligations (relating to notifiable diseases etc), working with other organisations such as Environmental Health Departments and Northern Irel and Water and commissioning services in areas such as childhood vaccines, healthcare associated infections and the antenatal infect ions screening programme. In addition the Pub lic Health Agency together with the Health and Social Care Board, Business Services Organisation and Health and Social Care Trusts wi ll continue to review, test and update emergency plans, taking into account lessons learned from recent incidents and the response to swine flu. Vaccinations have been cited along with clean water by the World Health Organisation as the biggest contributors to improvement in health over the last 100 years. They are also considered among the most cost-effective health in terventions. Northern Ireland now has uptake levels for all vacc inations well above the UK average and the Public Health Agency will seek to build on this position during 2010/11. In particular we will aim to reduce inequalities of MMR vaccine, targeting those in geographic areas with relatively low uptake. We will also aim to further improve uptake of HPV vaccine, improving on the good start that has been established in the first two years of the progra mme. Any new vaccines will be introduced with the aim of achi eving the same high uptake of the established vaccines. 6.1.2(vi) Community and Voluntary Sector The Public Health Agency is commi tted to working closely with a wide range of organisations to bes t enable us to reach out to communities and individuals to im prove their health and wellbeing. This will include working with and through the Health and Social Care Trusts, other statutory organisations (and especially developing our partnerships with local government) as well as voluntary and community organisati ons. The legacy organisations already fund a large number and variety of voluntary and community groups, and the new organisations are committed to building on this expertise. The Public Health Agency and Health and Social Care Board will seek to bring an increased rigor and meaningfulness to managing how we use the budget available to 56fund health and wellbeing improvem ents across the full spectrum of organisations, in order to realise anticipated outcomes. 6.1.2(vii) Primary Care Family Practitioner Services are a ke y setting for health promotion. The Public Health Agency is co mmitted to working on existing and future Direct and Local Enhancem ents opportunities which have long-term health improvement and addressing inequalities at the core. Increased focus will be given to: \u0083 Health Promotion standards in the service frameworks eg smoking cessation , brief in tervention on alcohol, and nutrition and physical activity; \u0083 Mental Health promotion a nd support and referral to other services. In addition, access to and reduc ing barriers to services will be encouraged, alongside increasi ng activity in disadvantaged communities. Practices will also be encouraged to build strong links with access to welfare right s groups as an important means of maximising the income of disadvantaged individuals and communities. The Health and So cial Care Board and the Public Health Agency will take t he opportunity to review current information systems, their e fficacy and ease of using the information captured to char t progress and inform future developments. There are unique opportunities to dev elop further partnerships with Community Pharmacies to promot e health improvement. The Building Community Pharmacy Partn ership initiative has evaluated positively and demonstrated the im portant role that pharmacists can play in promoting health acro ss a whole range of issues. The Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency will wish to build on this progress. 6.1.2(viii) Oral Health and Dental Despite improvements in the oral he alth of our population, there remains a strong pattern of inequa lity in those with good and those with poor oral health. 57It is well recognised that many chronic diseases including oral disease share common risk factors such as diet and nutrition, tobacco and alcohol. A collaborative approach needs to be adopted in order to tackle local oral health inequalities. Dental registration for childr en under five year s are another key indicator of health inequalities. The Public Health Agency and the Health and Social Care Board will wo rk with the Trusts through the Regional Service Level Agreement to encourage families from disadvantaged areas to register with a dentist. This will require working in partnership with ot her stakeholders such as General Dental Practitioners and Comm unity Groups. In addition, emphasis will be placed on the prevention of disease and promotion of oral health, working with communities, and in particular parents. 6.1.2(ix) Quality Assurance The Public Health Agency and t he Health and Social Care Board are committed to the highest standards of service. Specifically the Public Health Agency has prioriti sed the need to build effective working links with academic instit utions. Research and evaluation are embedded into the development of all programmes. Setting standards for new service areas wh ich can be rigorously evaluated will be essential in order to ensure be st use is made of resources. Whenever possible the Public Health Agency will seek to integrate and illuminate knowledge on the nature of inequalities and effective action. 6.1.2(x) Health Intelligence and Communications Public health priorities across health protection, service development, screening and health and wellbeing improvement all require a wide range of 'health intelligence' and 'health communications' support. For example, good quality health and social wellbeing intelligence is a fundamental requirement to: \u0083 Enable rapid response to i mmediate public health risks and demands; 58\u0083 Inform and influence public health interventions and measure impact and outcomes; and \u0083 Improve understanding and aid decision making. Similarly health communications play an essential role in informing, influencing and motiva ting individual, institutional and public audiences about im portant health matters. As a learning organisation the P ublic Health Agency is committed to the critical examination of w hat is most effective, including testing and developing new and in novative practice and seeking greater understanding about the nat ure of health inequalities and the impact of action. In addition to providing bespoke Health Intelligence support the Public Health Agency will ex plore partnership arrangements with key Health and Social Care partners and academic institutions in order to optimise the use of ex isting data sources and the commissioning of new research. We will also undertake to develop an effective and effici ent knowledge base which enables flexible, shared access to public health knowledge and helps to influence the strategic agenda of other organisations and interests. We will seek to ensure that t he optimum mix of communication tools is applied to help realis e the targets addressed throughout this Commissioning Plan. 6.1.2(xi) Reducing Demand on Acute Services As part of the wider reform a nd modernisation agenda the Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency will support Trusts in ensuring that acute se rvices address the wider primary and secondary preventio n agenda. It is in the interest of the Trust to ensure that patients make a speedy recovery and avoid re- admission. Acute settings are also important locations in terms of promoting the health improvement agenda both for staff and patients/clients. The Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency will support the development of an integrated approach across primary, secondary, tertiary and community care so as to maximise the opportunities to avoid unnecessary admissions and improve population health and social wellbeing. This will include 59addressing issues such as falls prevention, alcohol abuse services, soft tissue injuries, emotional wellbeing, all which have a major impact on A&E services and ac ute admissions. In relation to specific areas such as sexua lly transmitted infections, HIV and other sexually transmitted infectio ns are increasingly presenting as an important public health problem in Northern Ireland, as is the case elsewhere in the UK and Europe. The Public Health Agency will work with partners in the Heal th and Social Care Board, Trusts, primary care and voluntary sector to meet these needs. Health improvement plans for sexual he alth will also focus on the opportunities for prevention of sex ually transmitted infections. The Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency will exploit partnership opportunities to work with the NI Ambulance Service on the preventative agenda and raising awareness on the impact of issues such as road traffic collisions, attacks on emergency staff/services, community based first responders and so forth. Addressing the causes of demands on trauma and orthopaedic services will have ben efit on both the wider community and service pressures; this will in clude targeting information and support at the most vulnerable communities. The promotion of good lifestyle ch oices on diet, nutrition, physical activity, sexual health, smoking and so forth will impact on service demands for Stroke Services, chroni c diseases such as diabetes and respiratory disease, and the ne ed for specialist treatment such as HIV drugs. 6.1.2(xii) Improving Mental Health Services The Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency are committed to ensuring that key health improvement priorities including early intervention, prev ention and tackling inequalities are integral to the redes ign and delivery of ment al health services. Because of the Bamford vision and the establishment of a Mental Health and Learning Disability Commissioning Taskforce, working groups for Promoting Mental Heal th/Suicide Prevention and Drugs and Alcohol will be established. These will sit alongside a number of service groups including adults, learning disability, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and Eating Disorders. Within the framework structure there will be significant opportunities to ensure the key health improvement priorities are addressed in each of the working groups and at the overarching Commissioning 60Team. A major priority will be promoting personal development and early interventions that are ef fective, accessible and person centred supported with advocacy for the involvement of clients and carers. Core to this will be working with organisations in the statutory, community and voluntary sectors t hat can provide evidence based services such as build ing resilience, family support and counselling for those in crisis and in need of support. The continued roll out of the Lifeline Contract will be a major investment in terms of ensuring that those in crisis and/or their carers have immediate support when they require it. Other priority areas will include deliv ery of the Hidden Harm action plan, review of addiction se rvices, taking forward the recommendations from the Health Committee Inquiry into the Prevention of Suicide and Self H arm, and joint working to provide better services to meet people's needs. 6.1.2(xiii) Workforce Development Workplace health and wellbeing is gathering momentum as an issue for consideration by empl oyers and management teams. The growing evidence base demonstr ates clearly the benefits to organisations of adopting an approac h that considers the health and wellbeing of employees in thei r everyday business. Health and Social Care bodies must advocate this approach and recognise the importance of providi ng support and accurate advice to workplaces on the subject. The Investing for Health Strateg y identified the potential for our Health and Social Care services to play a major part in promoting health and wellbeing and in addressing inequalities in our population. The modernisation age nda acts as a springboard for wider co-operation and new partnerships . The Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency would see future developments building bridge s between various health care settings and communities ensuring an integrated and effective contribution to health and wellbeing at regional and local level. 6.1.2(xiv) Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence 61Health and Social Care has conj oined the two regional groups on Domestic Violence and Sexual Violen ce to strengthen the work of both areas. Health and Social Care will ensure the implementation of the revised Sexual Violence and Domestic Violence Action Plan for 2010/11. Each of the five Trusts/Local Commissioning Group areas, have a multi-agency domestic violence pa rtnership which identifies local needs and proposals fo r programmes and services to those in need. 6.1.3 Challenges and Constraints In order to maximise impact and target resources in areas of greatest need a number of communities who experience greatest inequalities have been identified as requiring particular attention in commissioning interventions to bring about change. For example, Travellers, whose life expectancy is some ten years less than the settled community, other target ed groups include children and young people, lesbian, gay, bise xual, transgender, ex prisoners and their families etc. In broad terms action w ill be required at the leve l of the individual, the community, statutory and vol untary sector agencies, and with policy makers. The Public Heal th Agency and the Health and Social Care Board will develop effe ctive evidence based policies and practice. A unique opportunity presents, given the size and scale of the population, to make a meaningful impact with a long term commitment of Government. There is urgency and speed required on this agenda - inequalitie s and the impact of inequity on individual's health and wellbeing across the lifespan is stark. Equally, there is a need to address the burgeoning costs of health care and the predicted inability of government to meet this burden if nothing is done to arrest, res ize and scale the challenge. However, many of these challenge s are a result of cultural or intergenerational issues and will take the development of partnership arrangements and a considerable time to change before sustainable trans formation can emerge. Locally the change in responsibili ties of the new Health and Social Care structures also provide an opportunity for focusing on the prevention agenda. Health and Social Care Trusts are now 62charged with a duty to improve health and wellbeing and whilst services will be commissioned via the Health and Social Care Board there is also the op portunity of working closely with Trusts to ensure that the efforts of the H ealth and Social Care 'family' as a whole are used to greatest effe ct to bring about change. Commissioning better outcomes for those experiencing the greatest disadvantage is a strong theme in this Commissioning Plan. Specific attenti on will also be given to: \u0083 Continuing to build on the progress made with partners in developing effective collabor ative approaches which address the determinants of health. In particular, work which will integrate approaches includi ng community regeneration, education, health and wellbeing in partnership with communities experiencing disadvantage through the Investing for Health Strategy; \u0083 Changes to the physical envi ronment which promote mental and physical wellbeing; \u0083 Community development approaches to health and wellbeing and service delivery; \u0083 Securing a strategic approach to Early Years Intervention and family support, includin g implementation of DHSSPS \"Families Matter\". In addition to the roll out of a variety of early years investment, the esta blishment of internationally successful and evidence based early intervention models including 'Family Nurse Part nerships' and 'Roots of Empathy' into Northern Ireland w ill be pursued in 2010/11; \u0083 Improving Breast Feeding support and implementation of co- ordinated action; \u0083 Continuing to build on work in the prison setting to meet the health and wellbeing needs of the prison population; \u0083 Developing and building on integrated planning approaches at local level; \u0083 Strengthen developments with the education sector, in particular using the school as an important setting for health improvement. 63 6.1.4 Summary of Commissioning Proposals/Responses to Priorities for Action Priorities for Action Target: Improving Life Expectancy By March 2011, the Public Health Agency should implement agreed actions contained in its Health Improvement Plan to address inequalities at a regional and local level, including any actions arising from the Investing for Health Review: Life expectancy is impacted by m any factors which include socio- economic status, gender, age, et hnicity, poverty and lifestyle factors. Many are outside the direct remit of health but Health and Social Care will advocate and infl uence other policy initiatives as well as seek shared goals through inter-sectoral work which will ultimately impact on inequalities. The material and structural barriers which are so important in respect of poverty will also be addressed by Health and Social Care . Health and Social Care are committed to building on social capi tal as part of the process of addressing root causes through initia tives that tackle issues such as fuel poverty, access to welfare rights and so forth. Health and Social Care will invest in initiati ves that build resilience, ensuring that community development programmes empower individuals and groups as well as encouraging their active participation. Health and Social Care will ensure that the broader range of health improvement strategies, including Investing for Health, Health Promotion Strategies such as Accident Prevention, Suicide Prevention (Protect Life), Mental Health Promotion, Fit Futures, New Strategic Direction and Toba cco control etc will be fully implemented. This approach will be taken in conjunction with the planned brief interventions at primary, community and acute settings and will contribute to improving life expectancy with a particular focus on disadvantaged and vulnerable communities. A key focus must be on early years and ensuring that all children have the best possible start in lif e and taking forward the strategic drive outlined in the Marmot Revi ew into health inequalities. In addition the varied individual action plans across the various health improvement agenda will targe t interventions at a regional, 64local and neighbourhood level ensuring cross reference is made with other relevant PfA target s addressed in this plan. Priorities for Action Target: Smoking By March 2012, reduce to not more than 22% and 28% respectively the proportion of adults and manual workers who smoke. Consistent with th e achievement of these outcomes, by September 2010 the Public Health Agency should take forward its action plan to improve access to smoking cessation services for manual workers. By September 2010, the Public Health Agency should also have in place arrangements for obtaining enforcement activity reports from local government and for analysing and reporting this information (including views on value for money) at least twice yearly to the Department. And by December 2010 the Public Health Agency and Tr usts should establish additional support arrangements for pregna nt women to help them stop smoking. Health and Social Care will give a renewed emphasis to reducing levels of smoking, in particul ar to stopping young people starting smoking and to helping smokers stop. Multi faceted actions including use of media, access to smoking cessation services and working with communities, alongside ensuring robust enforcement of legislation. Health and Soci al Care bodies will review current interventions and focus on setti ngs which will include enhanced support to women smoking duri ng pregnancy, schools, primary care, ante-natal services, co mmunity and voluntary sector partners, employers and working wi th other statutory agencies to connect with otherwise 'difficult to reach' groups with a particular focus on manual workers and devel oping innovative approaches to engage with, and support, this target group. Priorities for Action Target: Reducing the Rise in Obesity By March 2012, reduce to not more than 9% the proportion of children that are obese. Consi stent with the achievement of this outcome, the Public Health Agency should throughout 2010/11 ensure timely and effecti ve arrangements are in place in each Trust area to provide targeted support to children identified through the ongoi ng BMI monitoring process in schools. By February 2011, the Public Health Agency should 65produce an integrated action plan to take forward the obesity prevention strategic framework to address overweight and obesity across the whole life course. Health and Social Care will have in place effective arrangements for the collection and recordi ng of BMI data through the School Nursing Service. This will incl ude a completed ev aluation of the various pilot initiatives undertak en by each Trust area to provide support for those children identif ied through the monitoring process as being obese or at parti cular risk. (Health and Social Care will be guided by any revised DHSSPS guidance on changes to the Year of Measurement in 2010/2011. Monitoring arrangements are in place within each Local Commissi oning Group area to ensure the collection and recording of this data). Health and Social Care will devel op an evidence based integrated approach at a number of levels to address obesity, including the implementation of the strategic ob esity framework currently being developed by DHSSPS. This w ill require a population approach as well as working within the Health and Social Care system to target 'at risk' individuals and groups wi th information, advice and referral to appropriate services. In the context of Fitter Future for All Frameworks Health and Social Care will work with key stakeholders to promote increased physical activity, improved diet and nutrition and a general sense of wellbeing. Changes to the environment are crucial and the us e of Health Impact Assessment and evidence based interventions w ill be central to future action. Priorities for Action Target: Reducing the harm related to Alcohol and Drug Misuse By March 2012, reduce to 29% the proportion of adults who binge drink, reduce to 27% th e proportion of young people who report getting drunk, and re duce to 5.5% the proportion of young people taking illegal drugs. Consistent with the achievement of these outcomes, the Public Health Agency should from April 2010 further develop and evaluate the brief intervention pilot designated to support primary care to undertake screening and brief intervention on alcohol misuse. By December 2010, the Public He alth Agency should produce 66an effective training methodology and determine the feasibility of rolling this out acro ss GP practices. And, from April 2010 the Public Health Agen cy in partnership with the Health and Social Care Board should, through the implementation of the joint Hidden Harm Action Plan, increase awareness of relevant se rvices and ensure that more young people affected by pare ntal substance misuse are effectively signposted to existing services. The Health and Social Care bodies will take forward the implementation of the New Strategic Direction on Alcohol and Drugs and build on existing mult i-sectoral work and in particular will give increased focus to t he implementation and evaluation of: \u0083 Education, Training and Prevention Programmes for GPs , pharmacies, communities and other settings; \u0083 Enhanced collaborative approaches and joint working with communities and local govern ment at a local level; \u0083 Services for Chronic Street Dr inkers and outreach \u0083 Family support schemes; \u0083 Alcohol Liaison Services; \u0083 Collaboration with Community Safety Partnerships on wider determinants and anti social concerns. Health and Social Care will review the outcome from the pilot brief intervention support in a primary care setting and based on the learning examine the opportunity to develop a broader initiative and training programme that coul d be rolled out on a programmed basis to all GP practices. Health and Social Care are fully committed to the implementation of the Regional Hidden Harm Acti on plan to support those children and young people affected by parental substanc e misuse so that they can avail of the appropriate support service and intervention. 67There is also a need for a programme of wider public awareness. There remain major challenges fo r Health and Social Care to address the growing impact of al cohol misuse on service pressures and demands. Priorities for Action Target: Suicide By March 2012, ensure that the suicide rate is reduced below 14.5 deaths per 100,000. Consi stent with the achievement of this outcome, by September 201 0 the Public Health Agency should ensure that a Deliberate Self Harm Registry pilot is established in the Belfast HSC Tru st, and a first draft report produced by March 2011. By September 2010, the Public Health Agency should produce an action plan to implement recommendations arising from Mental Health Promotion/Suicide Prevention Trai ning in Northern Ireland. Each locality has established multi sector partnerships which oversee the development and deliv ery of the \"Protect Life\" and Promoting Mental Health action plans at local level. These partnerships will continue to ensur e that local plans are revised regularly and fully implemented in response to locally identified need. All of the plans will be ta ken forward within the recently established Bamford Taskforce framework and will also take account of regional initiatives such as Life Line and public information campaigns. Examples of local action includes: \u0083 Building capacity in comm unities (geographic and / or community of interest) to ad dress suicide prevention and the wider determinants of suicide and mental ill health. \u0083 Community Support for thos e bereaved through suicide \u0083 Joint working with the Trusts to improve access to services \u0083 Family support for those who self harm \u0083 Liaison with Coroner's office and PSNI to improve communication and early identific ation of suspected suicides in locality. 68Regional actions will include: \u0083 Developing regional co or dination and quality standards for training \u0083 Taking forward model of locality 'Suicide Cluster' plan \u0083 Regional Lifeline telephon e helpline and wrap around support services \u0083 Self Harm register and mentoring support (Initially in West now extending to include Belfast) \u0083 Public information campai gns and evaluation of same \u0083 Media monitoring Health and Social Care bodies will establish the All Ireland Deliberate Self Harm Registry within Belfast Trust area by September 2010, building on the work in the Western Trust and have a draft report by 31 March 2 011. Health and Social Care bodies will assess the recommendati ons of the review of mental health promotion/suicide prevent ion training and have an action plan in place by 30 September 2010 addressing the priority recommendations. Priorities for Action Target: Mental Wellbeing By March 2011, the Public Health Agency should produce an action plan to take forward the relevant regional and local elements contained within the Mental Health and Wellbeing Promotion Strategy Health and Social Care bodies will support the proposed public consultation on the Draft Emotional Wellbeing Strategy with the final strategy being completed by the early autumn. Health and Social Care bodies will ensure that the process bu ilds on important links with early years and the devel opment of interventions to improve mental health and wellbeing. This will explore the evidence base for the strategy ta rgets and begin th e consultation process with key stakeholders for an action plan to deliver the targets. The Public Health A gency and Health and Social Care Board will work with all partners including Trusts to finalise a plan by March 2011. 69 Priorities for Action Targe t: Early Years Intervention By March 2011, the Public Health Agency and Trusts should ensure that the updated child h ealth promotion programme is fully implemented. The impact of the programme will be measured through the Chil d Health System and the introduction of a new schedule of visits to be undertaken by health visitors. The Public Health Agency will le ad the implementation of the revised Child Health Promotion Programme. Arrangements need to be put in place to use the Ch ild Health System to ensure the uptake of the revised Programme . The Programme will be fully implemented by March 2011. Priorities for Action Target: Births to Teenage Mothers By March 2012, the Public Heal th Agency should ensure that the rate of births to teenage mothers under 17 is reduced to not more than 2.7 births per 1,000. Consistent with the achievement of this outcome, by December 2010 the Public Health Agency should compl ete a review of the latest evidence of effective intervention for reducing teenage pregnancy, take forward agreed actions to secure further reductions in the rates of teen age pregnancy linked to the Sexual Health Promotion Action Plan. Each of the five Trust/Local Commissioning Group areas has a multiagency group which identifies local needs and proposals for programmes and services to meet th ose needs. These plans are brought together regionally, comm on issues and approaches identified, and these form th e sexual health commissioning priorities for the Commissioning Plan. Achievability of this target is particularly depend ant on factors outside health and social serv ices as higher rates of teenage pregnancy are, as identified in the regional 'Sexual Health Promotion Strategy & Action Plan 2008-2013', linked with poor educational attainment, poor physi cal and mental health, social isolation and poverty. 70The Public Health Agency is therefore committed to joint approaches with a wide range of pa rtners. Engagement with and commitment from other sectors such as education, the community and voluntary sector are critic al for achieving success. The Health and Social Care will ensure a review of trends and effective interventions and agree acti ons that will include key areas such as: \u0083 Programmes to support Looked After Children; \u0083 Sexual health services focused on young people; \u0083 Personal development and training programmes; \u0083 Work with the education sector to support Relationships Sexuality Education. In respect of Sexually Transmitt ed Infections (STIs) HIV and other STI's are increasingly presenting as an important public health problem in Northern Ireland, as is the case elsewhere in the UK and Europe. Between 2000 and 2008 \u0083 HIV diagnoses increased by 384%. \u0083 Chlamydia diagnoses increased by 102%. \u0083 Syphilis has become re-established. The PHA will work with partners in the HSCB, Trusts, Primary Care and Voluntary Sector to meet these needs. Health improvement plans for sexual health will also focus on the opportunities for prevention of STI's and a second workshop will be held to examine trends and the evidence base for effective interventions. Priorities for Action Target: Bowel Cancer Screening During 2010/2011, the Public Health Agency, Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should establish on a phased basis a bowel screening program me for those aged 60-69 (to include appropriate arrangements for follow-up treatment). 71Health and Social Care bodies will introduce a bowel cancer screening programme for people ag ed 60-69 in April 2010. The Public Health Agency will be es tablishing the re quired quality assurance structures to sup port this programme and working jointly with the Health and Social Care Board, the Business Services Organisation and releva nt Trusts, to ensure that diagnostic and treatment services are provided at the required standards. Priorities for Action Target: Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm and (\"Triple A\") During 2010/2011, the Public Heal th Agency should work with the Health and Social Care Board and Trusts to commence preparatory work for the phased introduction of screening arrangements for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Every effort will be made to suppo rt the introduction of this programme. Priorities for Action Targe t: Emergency Preparedness By March 2011, all relevant HSC organisations should review, test and update their emergency plans, including building on the lessons learned from recent incidents, exercises and the response to swine flu together with any regional and national developments for pandemic flu preparedness. The relevant Health and Social Care organisations will seek to update their emergency preparednes s arrangements in line with this target. Priorities for Action Target: Business Continuity Planning By March 2011, each HSC organisation should ensure it has a fully tested and operational business continuity plan in place. The Health and Social Care B oard, Public Health Agency and Business Services Organisation w ill work together to review legacy arrangements for Emergency Preparednes s and Response. This review will be the initial step in a process to develop and test new Public Health Agency, Health and Social Care Board, Business Services Organisation Emergenc y Preparedness and Response 72Interim Arrangements which will incl ude the development of joint protocols and reporting arrangements between the various Health and Social Care bodies including Trusts and the DHSSPS. The review will include implementat ion of the lessons from the response to recent incidents and the swine flu response. It will also build on regional and na tional developments and good practice in the area of Emergency Preparedness and Response. In addressing key health and well being inequalities, the Public Health Agency will refocus \u00a31.25m of programme funds in 2010/2011 as follows:- Area Part Year Effect Full Year Effect Interventions with local government partners (other core programme funding also supports this work) \u00a30.250m \u00a30.500m Early Years Intervention Nursing (\u00a3100,000 set up and \u00a3300,000 for team of 4 in 1 Trust; additional team is \u00a3300,00) \u00a30.100m \u00a30.400m Parent Support Officers (to help mainstream initial work in this area) \u00a30.075m \u00a30.100m Roots of Empathy (for phase1) \u00a30.075m \u00a30.250m Non recurrent funding for evidence based campaigns (tobacco / mental health / suicide) \u00a30.750m 73Priority Area 2: Ensuring Services are Safe, Sustainable, Accessible and Patient Centred 746.2.1 Strategic Context The overall aim is to ensure t hat the people of Northern Ireland have timely access to high quality services responsive to their needs and delivered locally w here this can be done safely, sustainably and cost effectively. This aim will provide a strategic and operational approach to how we secure consistency of proven clinical, quality and safety standards across the region to improve outcomes and reduce health inequalities. There will be challenges to progress. Some of the changes will be controversial and some of our goals will be financially unaffordable in the current environment. Key to the Commissioning role however is to challenge the standa rds by which we deliver care and make a positive difference to the health and experience of our patients and clients. The last three years have seen some significant improvements in waiting times for elective treatment and for A & E services, albeit many of our A & E Departments have experienced considerable pressures during 2009/10. Thes e improvements have been achieved despite a growth in demand. We will continue to focus on meeting these needs but at the sa me time seek to gain a better understanding of the nature of what is driving the demand and how it might be better and more effici ently managed. We recognise the importance of patient choice and engagement and need for people to have confidence in how our se rvices are provided. Choice will be a major theme in driving commissioning though it must be balanced with our commitment to deliver safe, effective and sustainable services. The approach to commissioning must also address inequalities, ensure equitable access to serv ices and deliver patient treatment in the most appropriate setting. 6.2.2 Commissioning Themes, Challenges and Constraints 6.2.2(i) Evidence Based Commissioning 75Consistency of standards across th e service by using evidenced based approaches with recogni sed good practice and proven outcome measures will be driven forward. Service Frameworks and nationally accepted guidance available from the National Institute for Clinical Excelle nce and NHS Evidence will underpin our approach. Northern Ireland has a formal relationship with the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in endorsing clinical guidance and appraisals for introduction locally . Whilst we are committed to introducing new technologies and therapies in a timely manner, this will be constrained by the fi nancial environment. We will be more active in using the evidence from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and NHS Evidence sources to guide us on treatments that are proven not to be effective so that we can reinvest more effectively. We also need to better understand the uptake levels of therapies and the resultant differences in outcomes for our population compare d with other regions in the UK. There is some evidence to suggest that we are higher users of some of the high cost drugs an d this needs further review. Over the last number of years a num ber of Service Frameworks for the region have been developed wh ich set out recognised standards for good practice and care to be ad opted across the spectrum of provision. Where there is good evid ence of proven outcomes we must take steps to ensure these a re put in place. Affordability in fully implementing the Service F rameworks will be an issue given the constraints on funding. Howev er, we recognise that Health and Social Care has received substa ntial funds over the last 2 years for cardiovascular services , respiratory services, cancer and stroke care and not all of these developments have been fully consolidated. In implementing Frameworks, we will give appropriate attention to all elements of the Framework and not just 'new leading edge' type developm ents. The impact on health which can be progressed through ma nagement of chronic disease is hugely valuable. At a broader level, there will be a fo rmal focus identifying evidence of improving clinical outcomes such as mortality and su rvival rates. Data from Trusts in thes e areas will be monitored and benchmarked against peer comparat ors locally and nationally. 6.2.2(ii) Quality and Safety 76Our services need to be delivered in an environment which is safe for patients and improves the qualit y of their experience. It will be essential to focus on minimising risk though robust infection control, high standards of hygi ene, reducing adverse incidents, early detection of preventable ill ness and taking better care of our most vulnerable patients. In the coming year, the Public Heal th Agency, in partnership with the Health and Social Care Board, will establish arrangements to ensure that lessons learnt from adverse events are taken forward by Trusts, primary care and other providers. During this time period, Trusts will have a lead role in implementing quality improvement pl ans with specific targets for ventilator associated pneumonia, surgical site infection, central line infection, crash call rate, prev ention of venous thromboembolism and mental health inpatient care. Trusts will also prepare quality improvement plans to implement World Health Organisation surgical checklists in 80% of cases by March 2011 and promote initiatives in collaboration with the HSC Safety Forum aimed at reducing the incidence of falls and medication errors. Considerable progress has been made over the last 24 months to ensure a reduction in both the number and rates of Healthcare Associated Infections occurring ac ross Health and Social Care. To date, Healthcare Associated Infections improvement work has focused mainly on se condary care settings. 'Changing the Culture 2010' aims to eliminate the occur rence of preventable Healthcare Associated Infections in all Heal th and Social Care settings. The Public Health Agency will conti nue its regional leadership role to ensure ongoing Healthc are Associated Infect ions reduction during 2010/11. In particular, the Pub lic Health Agency will work to maintain and build on reducti ons already achieved across secondary care and to address H ealthcare Associated Infections associated with and/or occurri ng in community and primary care settings. During 2010/11 the Public Health Agency will work in partnership with Trusts, supporting work to deliver clean safe healthcare including work to achieve performance targets for MRSA (Methicillin - resistant Staph ylococcus aureus) and Clostridium difficile infections, and full im plementation of quality improvement plans. The Public Health Agency will extend the 'cleanyourhands' 77hand-washing campaign to include primary, community and independent care settings. T he Public Health Agency will establish robust systems for surveilla nce of surgical site infections in neurosurgery and card iac surgery. The Public Health Agency will develop a rolling educational programme in respect of Healthcare Associated Infections, including a regional annual symposium to facilitate learning ac ross Health and Social Care. The Health and Social Care Board will lead performance management in respect of Healthcare Associated Infections, supported by the Pub lic Health Agency. 6.2.2(iii) Accessibility In 2005 the DHSSPS initiated an Elective Care Reform Programme designed to reduce the access times in Northern Ireland for assessment, diagnosti cs and elective treatment to a level similar to that in the rest of the United Kingdom. The longer term intent is that this shoul d be achieved and maintained through more efficient waiting list management allied to additional investment in Health and Social Care services. It was accepted that, until this investment was fully in place, treatment might also have to be paid for in Indep endent Sector treatment centres. The elective access standards applying in 2009/10 were that patients should wait no longer th an 9 weeks for assessment, 9 weeks for diagnostics and 13 weeks for treatment. These standards were substantia lly (though not universally) achieved by March 2010. However, reduc ed waiting times have triggered substantial increases in demand in many areas. Consequently, we will focus attention on ensuring that waiting times for assessment remain at 9 weeks and that waiting times for treatment are kept as short as resources allow. 6.2.2(iv) Modernising and Reconfiguring Services Ensuring services are delivered in ways which continue to be of high quality and are safe and effective will be an increasing challenge over the next few years and will result in a reconfiguration of services. To maintain and to continue to achieve this standard of servic e for our comparatively small population of 1.7m will not be pos sible unless we change the ways in which we deliver care to people. 78As standards for training increase our Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Professions staff are work ing in an increasingly complex clinical environment. Senior c linical staff need to work in a different way, with access to a signi ficant clinical in frastructure, sub speciality expertise and larger t eams of senior colleagues to discuss and to make decisions ab out the best treatment and care for patients. For staff in t raining there are also issues about needing to work in a different wa y to ensure they can gain the necessary experience which will best qualify them to provide the highest quality of medica l and nursing care. A critical issue in terms of how hospital services ar e commissioned in the future will be to have a much closer relations hip with the training bodies. In this way we can work toget her to develop approaches about training in systems or networks rather than in institutions to make training better for staff and the patients they care for. For many years the Health and So cial Care has tried its best to secure the right clinical staffing pr ofile to maintain acute services but this is becoming increasingly di fficult. Many of our services - and not just those provided in sm aller units - are becoming more dependent on the use of locum cover (which by its nature must impact on the continuity of c are) because we cannot attract or retain permanent specialist staff. The drive for change in how we commission and provide acute care is not about money, it is about making sure that all of our populati on, irrespective of where they live, has access to the same stan dard of high quality, safe, clinical care. There has been progress in networking of clinical teams across Northern Ireland and beyond and in creasing use of new medical technologies in diagnostics and telemedicine which have helped support safe and effective practice across the country. However, it has to be recognised that even wi th such innovations and other initiatives, Northern Ireland is a small country with a small population and it simply won't be po ssible to sust ain the current pattern safely for much longer. For more specialist services, the ne ed for access to expert teams in centres of excellence is a key quality driver for securing the best outcomes for what are often small numbers of complex patients - even within much larger populations than ours. Strategies need to be developed within Northern Irel and as to how we can best secure equality of access to s pecialist care, taking into account 79that it may well not be possible or desirable to try to provide all of this care locally. Different models need to be developed involving formal clinical networks and other innovative relationships with UK services and within the Republic of Ireland. Some of these changes in how we are commissioning hospital care have already happene d. Over the last 10 years Northern Ireland has streamlined its c are for cancer patients by consolidating services into t he major acute hospitals with streamlined access to the regiona l cancer centre as needed and we are seeing better outcomes for patients as a result. Progress with the 2002 DHSSPS Strategy 'D eveloping Better Services' has also resulted in changes to acute hospital care in Downpatrick, Lisburn, Enniskillen and Omagh. Around 80% of hospital care is made up of diagnostics, outpatients, day care and ambulat ory services. Therefore it becomes clear that irrespective of some of the changes what will have to happen in inpatient care, there remains a very important and key role for smaller local hospita ls where much of this activity takes place. We want to main tain, where it is safe, sustainable and appropriate to do so, as much local access for local people as possible. The local hospital has a key role in refining the diagnosis for patients and referring them through the system as appropriate. We want Local Commissioning Groups to work closely with local hospitals to shape the service ca re pathways responsively to local need and to seamlessly connect this to the rest of the hospital network. The next steps in terms of a det ailed programme will follow but we want to signal in this Commissioning Plan specifically what the changes are likely to involve: \u0083 Optimise the role and function of the local hospital network in providing access to diagnos tics, outpatients, day and ambulatory care and establishi ng care pathways through the rest of the hospital system; \u0083 Supporting the changes which have occurred in 2010/11 in Magherafelt and at Whiteabbey by developing their outpatient, diagnostics, rehab ilitation and minor injuries capacity and putting in place new services such as bowel screening; 80 \u0083 The concentration of acute inpat ient services on fewer sites with the necessary clinical inf rastructure to provide safe high quality services with improved patient outcome; \u0083 Changes to the current prov ision of 24/7 Accident and Emergency Services will improve performance and deliver consistency of care across the region; \u0083 Changes to the current prof ile of inpatient emergency surgical services to provide for sub-specialisation and appropriate staffing and expertise; \u0083 Avoiding inappropriate duplication of inpatient specialities in each of the Trust sites; \u0083 Changes to the current profile of paediatric inpatient services to provide for appropriate staffi ng and expertise in line with best clinical practice; \u0083 Changes to maternity servic es to provide for appropriate staffing and expertise in line with best clinical practice; \u0083 'Right Sizing' the number of ac ute medical inpatient beds for our population in line with national standards to release resources for reinvestment in front line services; \u0083 More rigorous adherence to the effective use of resources (demand management); \u0083 Specifying and addressing the impact these changes will have on emergency transport services; \u0083 Taking account of the impac t of developments in new technologies and therapies will have on both our capital and staffing infrastructures needs and planning flexible options to accommodate these; \u0083 We also have a substantia l agenda in progressing service developments which commenced in 2009/10 but have yet to be consolidated fully. 81Making these changes won't be easy. It will require dialogue with the population and involve fundamen tal strategic shifts in the current pattern of care but we need to do this to secure good outcomes and to provide safe servic es. We need to be innovative in how we establish networks of different elements of care and how we connect them to populat ions and each ot her to ensure continuity. 6.2.2(v) Personal and Public Involvement Personal and Public Involvement is about people and communities influencing the planning, commissi oning and deliver y of health and social care services. It means actively engaging with those who use our services and the public to discuss; their ideas, our plans; their experiences, our experiences ; why services need to change; what people want from services; how to make the best use of resources; and how to improve the quality and safety of services. Whilst the concept of Personal an d Public Involvement is not new, we have made considerable effort s in 2009/10 to further embed Personal and Public Involvement in our everyday work and a draft Consulting Schemes document has been submitted to the DHSSPS. The Health and Soci al Care Board and Public Health Agency are committed to working in partnership with the Patient and Client Council, other Health and Social Care Organisations and statutory bodies such as Local C ouncils, to promote Personal and Public Involvement and identif y joint Public Involvement opportunities and reduc e duplication. 82 6.2.3 PFA Targets PFA Target: Specialist Drug Therapies for Arthritis From April 2010, the HSC Boar d and Trusts should ensure no patient waits longer than nine months to commence specialist drug therapies for the treatment of severe arthritis. It is anticipated that around 290 addi tional patients will need to be commenced on treatment during 2010/ 11. Funding up to a level of \u00a33.150m will be made available to Trusts to support the drug and infrastructure costs to allow thes e additional patients to commence treatment and maintain the maximum waiting time at nine months. During 2009/10, the number of patients on treatment increased by approximately 500 which was in e xcess of the estimated growth. Should the recurrent annual costs of this pati ent group exceed the monies available from 2009/10, it may not be possible to commit the totality of the new monies for additional patients. If this transpires it may not be possible to meet the target. Over the coming months the Heal th and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency via the Regi onal Medical Services Group will engage in a process with each of the Trusts to agree business cases for development of this serv ice. The service profile will need to support opportunities for pati ents to be treated locally and funds allocated to Trusts will reflect t he usage patterns from each of the Local Commissioning Group areas. The Regional Medical Services G roup has concerns with regard to a differential uptake in usage of these drugs both across Local Commissioning Group areas and in comparison with national peers. During 2010/11 work will be undertaken to confirm this position and the rational e, if any, for same. PFA Target: Elective Care (Consultant-led) By March 2011, the HSC Board and Trusts should ensure no patient waits longer than 9 weeks for a first outpatient appointment and 9 weeks for a diagnostic test, the majority of inpatients and daycases treated within 13 weeks and no patient waits longer than 36 weeks for treatment. During 2010/11, Trusts should take steps to ensure review patients 83are seen in a more timely fashion; from March 2010, all reviews should be completed wi thin the clinically indicated time. 84 PFA Target: Diagnostic Reporting From April 2010, the HSC Boar d and Trusts should ensure all urgent diagnostic tests are reporte d on within two days of the test being undertaken, with 75% of all routine tests being reported on within two weeks and all routine tests within four weeks. It is expected that full implem entation of the Northern Ireland Picture Archive and Communicati on System across all Trusts during 2010/11 will contribute to improved performanc e in this area and the Health and Social Care Board's Performance Management and Service Improvement Directorate will continue to support Trusts to identify and implement the necessary service reforms. PFA Target: Elective Care (AHP) From April 2010, the HSC Boar d and Trusts should ensure no patient waits longer than 9 weeks from referral to commencement of AHP treatment. The DHSSPS has identified a tota l of \u00a340m (\u00a325m recurrent; \u00a315m non recurrent) in funding to assist in the delivery of these targets. It is anticipated that this, allied to \u00a325m in elective investment already allocated to Trusts in 2009/ 10, should be sufficient to allow these targets to be substant ially met, although resource constraints will still pres ent real obstacles to delivery. It is proposed that: \u0083 The levels of demand expe rienced in 2009/10 will be used as an indicator of where resources should be allocated; \u0083 Providers will be encouraged to implement approved service developments as quickly as possible; \u0083 Short term funding will be pri oritised for those providers able to deliver additional assessm ent and treatment capacity within Health and Social Care; \u0083 Trusts will only be allowed to use the Independent Sector in exceptional circumstances; 85 \u0083 Greater emphasis will be plac ed on Effective Use of Resources policies to ensure that resources are targeted to service areas with the greatest clinical need. PFA Target: Fractures From April 2010, the HSC Bo ard and Trusts should ensure 95% of patients, where clinically appropriate, wait no longer than 48 hours for inpatient fracture treatment. The ability to achieve this standard is impacted upon by the flows and fluctuations in the number of patients presenting at the fracture units across Northern Irel and on a daily and weekly basis. This has resulted in all Trusts ex periencing difficulties in meeting the standard on an ongoing basis. The Health and Social Care Board is working with Trusts to ensure that during periods of pressure arrangements are in place to ensure that the maximum number of patients are treated within 48 hours with priority given to procedures with evidenced based outcomes and a focus on ensuring that no patient waits longer than 7 days. PFA Target: Cancer From April 2010, the HSC Boar d and Trusts should ensure all urgent breast cancer referrals ar e seen within 14 days, 98% of cancer patients commence treatm ent within 31 days of the decision to treat, and 95% of patients urgently referred with a suspected cancer begin their fir st definitive treatment within 62 days. This target requires additional capacity in oncology and radiotherapy services. Investm ents already agreed in 2009/10 are expected to be implemented during 2010. These will include an increase in the number of consultant oncologists. Where investment in cancer drugs is made this will include the appropriate level of infrastructure to provide timely treatment. Investment in Elective Access St andards will also contribute to the achievement of this target. Inve stments agreed in 2009/10 include additional radiography and medica l physics staff to provide an increase in radiotherapy in BCH C ancer Centre. Every effort will 86be made during 2010/11 to optimis e the capacity by using extended operating days on the current equipment. 87PFA Target: A & E From April 2010, HSC Board a nd Trusts should ensure 95% of patients attending any A & E DHSS PS are either treated and discharged home, or admitted within four hours of their arrival in the DHSSPS. No pati ent should wait longer than 12 hours. Trusts have indicated difficulties in achieving and maintaining the required level of performance acro ss the current configuration of A&E Departments. This has been reflected in the commissioning statements earlier in this docum ent which recognises the need to review A&E provision across the region. The Health and Social Care Board will continue to engage with Trusts to ensure that the best possible standard of perform ance is delivered through the implementation of agreed good practice. PFA Target: Stroke Services By March 2011, the HSC Board and Trusts should ensure 24/7 access to thrombolysis and that high risk transient ischaemic attacks are assessed and treated within 24 hours. Trusts should also work towards a door to needle time of 60 minutes for thrombolysis by March 2011. The Health and Social Care Board and the Public Health Agency will work closely with the Trusts to develop these services during 2010/11. Allocations made in 2009/1 0 will also be consolidated or reprofiled as appropriate to s upport the serv ice further. The additional funding of \u00a31.75m w ill be used to achieve the PFA targets for 24/7 thrombolysis and assessment within 24 hours of high risk TIA's. In view of the reduced funding available in 2010/11, the number of thrombolysi s sites in Belfast will be reviewed to take account of this. PFA Target: Renal Services From April 2010, the HSC Boar d and Trusts should ensure all patients should continue to have timely access to dialysis services. From April 2010, at least 60% of patients should receive dialysis via a fistula. By March 2011 the Belfast HSC Trust should deliver a minimum of 50 live donor transplants. 88 The number of patients needing treatment for end - stage kidney disease grows each year by about 40 cases. These patients are largely treated by hospital haemodial ysis (HD), with some patients undertaking home peritoneal dialysis (PD) or home haemodialysis (HHD) and some receiving kidney transplants. Transplantation is the best treatm ent in terms of offering increased survival and improved quality of life . It is also cost effective, particularly after the first year. During 2009 the process to assess patients and their relatives for live kidney donation was strengthe ned and streamlined. This has resulted in a significant number of potential pairs coming forward as suitable for transplantation. Th is is very positive for both the individuals and the service. T he increased activity will be challenging due to both operat ional and resource issues. In order to address the need generated by th is approach an increased number of cases will need to be delivered over the next 12-18 months through a specif ic, time limited arrangement. By March 2011, it is expected t hat the PFA Target of 50 live donor transplants could be met by usi ng a combination of enhanced local provision, a level of inreach to the Belfast Trust from a UK NHS Trust and a smaller number of patients being offered transplantation in an NHS Trust in England. Every effort will be made to deliver this target but it presents a significant financial challenge. Early discussions and agreements will need to take place at Commissioner, Trust and Departmental level on the resource issue if we are to achieve the target within the necessary timescale. All available recurrent and n on-recurrent resources for this programme in 2010/11 will be targeted at increasing the transplantation numbers. It is expected that approximately 35 live donor kidney transplants would be needed each year thereafter in Northern Ireland to meet demand. This would almost bal ance out the need for growth in hospital haemodialysis places, off er substantially better outcomes for patients and has the potential to reduce future costs in the longer term. 89 There is already sufficient funded hosp ital haemodialysis capacity in Northern Ireland to meet the 2010/11 growth in this demand. However the pattern of capacity may not always be in the unit closest to the patient's home. Trusts will be expected to take measures to minimise the need for pat ient travel in such cases by making available other dialysis treatments such as supported peritoneal dialysis or home haemodial ysis as alternative options where clinically suitable, which will be cost neutral. The demand on haemodialysis c apacity will be monitored throughout the year. Where t here is opportunity to release substantial goods and services re source these will be re-directed to support the in-year costs of additional live d onor transplant programme. The provision of dialysis via fistula will continue to be developed and opportunities to support the ac hievement of this target via vascular as well as transplant su rgical skills will be pursued and developed in a managed way. PFA Target: Ambulance Services From April 2010, the HSC Bo ard and Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) shoul d ensure an average of 72.5% of Category A (life-threatening) calls are responded to within eight minutes, increasing to an average of 75% by March 2011 (and not less than 67.5% in any LCG area). Every effort will be made to ensure th at this target continues to be delivered. PFA Target: Healthcare Associated Infections In the year to March 2011, th e Public Health Agency and Trusts should secure a further reduction of 20% in MRSA and C. difficile infections compared to the position in 2009/10. The target reductions for each Trust in 2010/11 are based on benchmarking against peer organisations in England. The Public Health Agency will work with Trusts to ensure a further reduction in MRSA and C difficile infe ctions compared to the 2009/10 baseline within the context of the funding available. 90PFA Target: Hygiene and Cleanliness From September 2010, each of the five HSC Trusts should put in place arrangements to routin ely review compliance with updated and consolidated region al standards of hygiene and cleanliness. Trust review a rrangements should include consideration at Trust Board. This target will be addressed by Trusts. PFA Target: Mortality From September 2010, each of the 5 HSC Trusts should put in place arrangements to routin ely review the Trust's standardisation mortality rates, both over time and against comparator organisations in NI and GB. Trust review arrangements should include consideration at Trust Board. This target will be addressed by Trusts. PFA Target: Trust Quality Initiatives From April 2010, the Public Heal th Public Health Agency and Trusts should continue to en sure satisfactory progress is made towards the full implem entation of approved quality improvement plans and the ach ievement of Trust - specific targets for ventilator associated pneumonia, surgical site infection, central line infection, the crash call rate, the prevention of venous thromboem bolism and mental health inpatient care. By July 2010, Trusts should submit to the Public Health Agency, for a pproval and monitoring, quality improvement plans to implemen t WHO Surgical Checklists in 80% of cases by March 2011, and in collaboration with the HSC Safety Forum promote in itiatives aimed at reducing the incidence of falls and medication errors. The Public Health Agency and t he Trusts will work towards full implementation of approved quality improvement plans and achievement of targets as specified. PFA Target: Patient Experience 91Following the adoption of the Patient and Client Experience standards in 2009, Trusts should extend the clinical care areas monitored and increase the range of monitoring tools and ensure appropriate reporti ng and follow - up, consistent with direction from the Public Health Agency. This target needs to be addressed by Trusts consistent with the direction of the Public Health Agency. 92 PFA Target: Patient Involvement By March 2011, the Public Health Agency in partnership with the HSC Board should: establish a regional Health and Social Care forum, with appropriate P atient Client Council and Public representation, to drive the PPI agenda; develop and implement a regional Health and Social Care Action Plan for PPI including arrangements to promote and evidence active PPI; arrange for the publication of an annual summary of PPI activity across Health and Social Care Organisations. The Public Health Agency, in partnership with the Health and Social Care Board, will take forw ard this target as outlined by March 2011. PFA Target: Service Frameworks By March 2011, Commissioners and Trusts should have action plans in place to ensure the implementation of agreed standards from the Cancer Fr amework in accordance with guidance to be issued by the DHSSPS in October 2010. The Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency will seek to have an action plan in place by March 2011. 6.2.4 Summary of Commissioning Proposals in 2010/2011 6.2.4(i) Specialist Drugs (\u00a313.85m) A total of \u00a313.85m has been allo cated regionally in 2010/11 to support the continued introduc tion of specialist drugs. Allocation by Local Commissioning Group (LCG) for specialist drugs (FYE) Belfast Northern South Eastern Southern Western \u00a32.943m \u00a33.363m \u00a32.492m \u00a32.681m \u00a32.371m 93The Health and Social Care Board proposes the following use of the funds available. Local Commissioning Groups will be expected to commit their share of resourc es based on the pattern of usage by their populations by Trust. 6.2.4(ii) High Cost Drugs Inflationary Uplift (\u00a33m) Allocation by LCG (FYE) Belfast \u00a30.638m \u00a30.728m \u00a30.540m \u00a30.580m \u00a30.514m A total of \u00a33m is required across the region to meet the baseline price uplift associated with the current usage of high cost drugs. Funding will need to be provided to T rusts in a pattern reflective of the Local Commissioning Group service usage. 6.2.4(iii) Treatment of Severe Rh eumatoid Arthritis (\u00a33.150m) Allocation by LCG (FYE) \u00a30.669m \u00a30.765m \u00a30.567m \u00a30.610m \u00a30.539m PFA Target - By March 2011, the HSC Board and Trusts should ensure no patient waits longer than nine months to commence specialist drug therapies for the treatment of severe arthritis. It is anticipated that around 290 ad ditional patients will need to start treatment during 2010/11. F unding up to a level of \u00a33.150m will be made available to T rusts to support the drug and infrastructure costs to allow thes e additional patients to commence treatment and maintain the maximum waiting time at nine months. During 2009/10, the number of patients on treatment increased by approximately 500 which was in e xcess of the estimated growth. Should the recurrent annual costs of this pati ent group exceed the monies available from 2009/10, it may not be possible to commit all of the new monies for additional patients. If this transpires it may not be possible to meet the target. 94 Over the coming months the Heal th and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency via the Regi onal Medical Services Group will engage in a process with each of the Trusts to agree business cases for development of this serv ice. The service profile will need to support opportunities for pati ents to be treated locally and funds allocated to Trusts will reflect t he usage patterns from each of the Local Commissioning Group areas. The Regional Medical Services G roup has concerns with regard to a differential uptake in usage of these drugs both across Local Commissioning Group areas and in comparison with national peers. During 2010/11 work will be undertaken to confirm this position and the rationale, if any, for differences. 6.2.4(iv) Age Related Macular Degeneration (\u00a32.200m) Allocation by LCG (FYE) Southern Western \u00a30.467m \u00a30.534m \u00a30.396m \u00a30.426m \u00a30.377m Services have been established in both the Western and Belfast Trusts to provide treatment f or age related macular degeneration for the population of Northern Ireland. Resources have been made available to both Trusts to ensure that timely treatment is provided to preserve the sight of pe ople affected by this condition, in accordance with therapies and regimes approved by the National Institute for Clinical Exce llence. The additional funding being made available in 2010/11 will ensure that new patients continue to access this treatment. Over the coming months the Heal th and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency via the Regi onal Medical Services Group will engage in a process with each of the Trusts to agree business cases for development of this serv ice. The funds allocated to the Western and Belfast Trusts will need to reflect the usage patterns from each of the Local Commissioning Group areas. 6.2.4(v) Immunoglobulins and Haemophilia Blood Products (\u00a31m) 95Allocation by \u00a30.213m \u00a30.242m \u00a30.180m \u00a30.194m \u00a30.171m The Regional Medical Services G roup will continue to work with Trusts in order to profile the inc reased usage of these products by Trust and speciality. Over the coming months the Heal th and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency via the Regi onal Medical Services Group will engage in a process with each of the Trusts to agree business cases for development of this s ervice. The fund s allocated will need to reflect the usage patterns from each of the Local Commissioning Group areas. 6.2.4(vi) Disease Modifying Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis (\u00a30.100m) Allocation by LCG (FYE) Belfast Northern South Eastern Southern Western \u00a30.022m \u00a30.024m \u00a30.018m \u00a30.019m \u00a30.017m This treatment is provided by t he Belfast and Western Trusts for the population of Northern Ir eland. The amounts above are required to support the continued maintenance of the 13 week maximum waiting time for these specialist drugs. Over the coming months the Heal th and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency via the Regi onal Medical Services Group will engage in a process with each of the Trusts to agree business cases for development of this serv ice. The funds allocated to the Belfast and Western Trusts will need to reflect the usage patterns from each of the Local Commissioning Group areas. 6.2.4(vii) Tobramycin for Cystic Fibrosis (\u00a30.088m) Allocation \u00a30.019m \u00a30.017m \u00a30.015m Northern Ireland has significantly gher survival rat es for patients with cystic fibrosis. This service is provided from the Belfast Trust and the funding earmarked for 2010/ 11 will support the increasing number of patients receiving this drug. Over the coming months the Heal th and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency via the Regi onal Medical Services Group will engage in a process with the Be lfast Trust to agree a business case for development of this serv ice. The funds allocated to the Belfast Trust will need to reflect the usage patterns from each of the Local Commissioning Group areas. 6.2.4(viii) HIV and GUM Drugs (\u00a31.500m) Allocation by LCG (FYE) Belfast Northern South Eastern Southern Western \u00a30.319m \u00a30.364m \u00a30.270m \u00a30.290m \u00a30.257m Over the past two to three years there has been a significant increase in the notifications of patients with HIV in Northern Ireland. Around two thirds of these patients have required the introduction of early treatment for their condition. The funding earmarked for 2010/11 w ill fund the full year effect of patients commenced on treatm ent during 2009/10 and the projected increase in patient numbers during 2010/11. The Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency will seek to direct some of the total funding available to early detection and preventative programmes given t he very significant potential health gain that can be achieved. Over the coming months the Heal th and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency via the Regi onal Medical Services Group will engage in a process to agree business cases for development of this service. The service prof ile will need to su pport opportunities for patients to be treated locally. The funds allocated will need to 97reflect the usage patterns from each of the Local Commissioning Group areas. 6.2.4(ix) Orphan Enzyme Therapies (\u00a30.650m) Allocation by LCG (FYE) Southern Western \u00a30.138m \u00a30.158m \u00a30.117m \u00a30.126m \u00a30.111m These funds are to support patie nts with enzyme deficiencies - estimated at 2 to 3 additional patients per year. Over the coming months the Heal th and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency via the Regi onal Medical Services Group will engage in a process to agree t he patient profile for these resources. Funding to support this will be provided on a capitation basis from each of the Local Commissioning Group areas on a risk sharing basis, irrespective of the area of residence of the patient. 6.2.4(x) Cancer Drugs an d Infrastructure (\u00a31m) Allocation by LCG (FYE) Belfast Northern South Eastern Southern Western \u00a30.212m \u00a30.243m \u00a30.180m \u00a30.194m \u00a30.171m A process is in place between the Regional Medical Services Group and the Northern Ireland Canc er Network Haematology and Oncology Drug and Therapeutics Committee to guide the introduction of new cancer drugs. The Northern Ireland Cancer Netw ork Haematology and Oncology Drug and Therapeutics Committee assesses formal business cases and cross references agains t the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and Scottish Medicines Consortium guidance before providing a prioritised s hortlist of potential drugs for introduction. The current list being reviewed in cludes a number of drugs which were identified by the Committee in previous years but have not yet been funded re currently and drugs which have been approved by the National Inst itute for Clinical Excellence but 98for which the Committee has not yet had the opportunity to consider business cases. In 2010/11 there is \u00a31m availabl e regionally for new cancer drugs. The introduction of new drugs will need to be prioritised within this funding. The Northern Ireland Cancer Netw ork Haematology and Oncology Drugs and Therapeutics Committee has recently submitted a number of potential proposals for new developments in 2010/11, which are under consideration by the Regional Medical Services Group. The majority have already been approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellenc e while a number of the remainder are expected to be approved dur ing 2010. Previously, the Regional Medical Services G roup has committed funding to introduce new drug regimes pending an indication that the National Institute for Clinical Excellenc e approval was expected shortly, only for this approval to be delay ed or, on occasion, rescinded. This has meant that these ring fenced resources have not been fully utilised as planned whilst at the same time, other drug pressures have not been supported. There is balance to be struck betwe en ensuring there is sufficient funding to introduce new drug th erapies in accordance with the National Institute for Clinical E xcellence whilst trying to ensure a degree of flexibility to allow funding to be reprofiled if a significant delay in approval occurs. Final decisions have yet to be made on the distribution of funding for cancer drugs and in frastructure in 2010/11. Over the coming months the Heal th and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency, via the R egional Medical Services Group, will engage in a process with each of the Trusts to agree business cases for the introduction of the cancer drugs which will be supported in 2010/11 in the c ancer centre and the cancer units. The service profile will need to sup port opportunities for patients to be treated locally where clinically appropriate. The funds allocated will need to reflect the usage pa tterns from each of the Local Commissioning Group areas. 6.2.4(xi) Other uses of Anti TNF Drugs (\u00a30.500m) 99Allocation by LCG (FYE) \u00a30.121m \u00a30.090m \u00a30.097m \u00a30.086m The use of Anti-TNF therapies ha s been approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence for the treatment of Psoriasis. These therapies have also been app roved as short term induction regimes for the treatment of Crohn's disease and for acute exacerbations of ulcerative colitis. A National Institute for Clinical Excellence Multiple Technology Appraisal for infliximab and adalimumab in Crohn's disease wa s expected to be published in May 2010. This is expected to give approval for maintenance use. The funding earmarked for 2010/11 will allow an increased number of patients to have timely access to these drugs. Over the coming months the Heal th and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency, via the R egional Medical Services Group, will engage in a process with each of the Trusts to agree business cases for development of this serv ice. The service profile will need to support opportunities for pati ents to be treated locally. The funds allocated will need to reflec t the usage patterns from each of the Local Commissioning Group areas. 6.2.4(xii) Introduction of other National Institute for Clinical Excellence approved therapies (\u00a30.663m) Allocation by LCG (FYE) Belfast Northern South Eastern Southern Western \u00a30.142m \u00a30.161m \u00a30.119m \u00a30.128m \u00a30.113m This funding has been earmarked to fund drug regimes likely to be approved by the National Institut e for Clinical Excellence during 2010/11. However, due to the pressures to fund cancer treatments that have already been approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, this resource may instead have to be reprofiled to support the la tter. This may delay the implementation of future National In stitute for Clinical Excellence recommendations/Technical A ppraisals in 2010/11. 100 Over the coming months the Heal th and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency, via the Regional Medical Services Group will engage in a process to agree th e profile of new drugs to be introduced and business cases to support these. The service profile will need to support opportunit ies for patients to be treated locally. The funds allocated w ill need to reflect the usage patterns from each of the Local Commissioning Group areas. 6.2.4(xiii) Renal Services (\u00a30.130m) Discussions will take place with renal services providers in respect of these funds in the context of reduced demand for dialysis. 6.2.4(xiv) Stroke Services (\u00a31.7m) Discussions will take place with providers in respect of how services will be developed in line with objectives set out in the Priorities for Action Target. 6.2.4(xv) Support for Ward Sisters/Charge Nurses The sum of \u00a31.2m will be invested ac ross the five Trusts to allow ward sisters/charge nurses to spe nd an additional 20% of their time on improving safety, quality and the patient experience. 101Priority Area 3: Integrating Primary, Community and Secondary Care Services 1026.3.1 Strategic Context 6.3.1(i) Integrating care servic es involves removing organisational and professional boundaries, promoting coordination and cooperation, in order to prov ide 'person-centred' health and social care. The right care, by the right person, in the right place, at the right ti me: evidence-based care, which is timely and cost-effective. 6.3.1(ii) The Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency will continue to devel op and support initiatives to build a continuum of responsi ve, integrated health and social care; balancing health promotion and illness prevention with effective interventions to diagnose and treat illness in the most app ropriate setting. Providers will be encouraged to continue to focus on supporting individuals to live independent lives and reduce unnecessary and inappropriate reliance on hospitals or other institutional care. Local Commissioning Groups will play a vital role in consultation with Councils, Trusts, Local Area Partnerships and Voluntary Organisations, to review health and wellbeing needs across their respective localities, working with local communities to seek ways of looking beyond the traditional organisational construct for the delivery of local care. 6.3.1(iii)Commissioners will seek to ensure continued progress in aligning investment with need. The aim of increasing the proportion of care delivered in a community setting will necessitate some redistribution of funding, investment being closely aligned with de mand and provision, at the most appropriate point of delivery. Investment in new services will also be link ed to rigorous evaluation of delivery and outcomes. In the context of a difficult economic environment, it w ill be essential to focus on efficiency, value for money and outcome measurement, in order to maximise the benefits for all. 6.3.1(iv)For effective commissioning it is essential that reliable information is available upon which to base commissioning decisions. Integrat ion of care will place an increasing onus upon providers to cooperate in the 103collation of reliable information, measuring activity and outcomes, to support the deliver y of effective quality care. 6.3.2 Commissioning Themes Through the vertical integration of Health and Social Care services, Commissioners will seek to enable the removal of traditional primary / secondary ca re boundaries. The aim is to assist a shift in emphasis thr ough the enhanced loca l provision of services within the primary care setting, while supporting secondary care providers to fo cus on specialist secondary care interventions. Supporting the di agnosis, treatment and holistic care of the majority within a loca l setting ensures that only those who genuinely require secondary care intervention are managed within that domain: improv ing access and decreasing the unsustainable growth in demand. This will deliver an improvement in the quality of the patient exper ience, while driving greater overall efficiency in health and social care provision. The Health and Social Care Board and Public Heal th Agency will require enhanced access to diagnostic services in primary care, supported by clinical decision support tools, so that G eneral Practitioners can efficiently and effectively diagnose more complex conditions, offering a greater range of services to m anage increased case complexity, and improving the quality of refer rals, with a higher proportion being referred appropriately (requiring intervention that is only available in secondary care). A significant proportion of second ary care outpatient activity (up to 70%) involves reviewing patients wh o have already been treated in secondary care. There is evidence that a substant ial proportion of these patients could be reviewed and managed in primary care; increasing efficiency and convenience for patients. New models of review are required, to ensure th at patients are not required to attend secondary care providers needlessly. Trusts will be encouraged to engage in the devel opment of a new approach to reviewing patients in partner ship with primary care. Delayed discharge of individuals requiring complex support in the community setting causes significant inefficiency. The Health and Social Care Board will seek to enga ge in partnership, with the Local Commissioning Groups and T rusts, to improve the efficiency of discharge planning. There will also be a requirement for Trusts to improve communication of information into primary and 104community care, to accompany pati ents, ensuring the safe transfer of responsibility of care. This will build upon work undertaken by the Registration and Quality Improv ement Authority in this area. General Practitioners and prim ary care teams, acting as gatekeepers to health and soci al care services, are a major determinant of health care utilisatio n in terms of the care that a patient/client receives and how patient choice is exercised. Linking gatekeeper clinical and fi nancial responsibility has the potential to reconfigure commissioner investment in a way which develops more integrated care whilst raising the standard of care, improving provider efficiency and making services more responsive to patients and client s. The Health and Social Care Board will work with Local Commissioning Groups and healthcare professionals to develop a support ive structure to promote the federation of GP practices to deliver this aim. Local Commissioning Groups ar e exploring new and innovative approaches to integrating healthc are and will deliver this on the ground through local partnersh ips. 'Primary Care Partnerships' will be built around local communities of circa 100k population and will include GP practices, pharmacist s and other providers of health and social care based in their area . Through assigning indicative budgets covering areas such as pr escribing, outpatient care, diagnostics and community servic es, partnerships will be afforded the opportunity to reinvest a proportio n of savings in local services. They will be clinically led to ens ure strong clinical governance and decision-making. Through Regional Clinical Networ ks we have seen significant engagement between the range of he alth care professionals, and organisations, across health and soci al care, for the benefit of patients. Such cooperation is es sential, and should be routine professional activity, across the sp ectrum of health and social care. Key to improving the qua lity of care is the agreement of clinical pathways and implementatio n of agreed standards. Trusts will be encouraged to build on t he achievements to date, with increased support to clinicians and practitioners to engage across interfaces, delivering continui ng improvement. By encouraging healthy lifestyle choice s, health improvement can contribute to reducing demands on prim ary and community services. With demographic changes and increased life expectancy, the Public Health Agency is keen to ensure that people living longer enjoy 105healthier and happier lives. T hrough targeted health improvement measures, partnership with Loc al Commissioning Groups and community support, the Public H ealth Agency will ensure that older people will remain active longer an d have less requirements for health and social care interv entions; promoting increased independence and improved se lf management of long-term conditions through healthier choices. Support will be given in private care settings, such as residential and nursing homes, to ensure th e development of a health promotion ethos. Carers providing support to individuals in their own homes will not be overlooked, be ing considered as a thematic community, prioritised for targeted intervention. Horizontal integration of health and social care s ervices will be an important development, redefining professional responsibilities, and improving the utilization of all health and social care professionals within the primary care setting. Commissioners envisage a redistribution of the resp onsibility of elements of care provision, with improved communica tion and coordination of care. The aim is to provide a genuinel y multidisciplinary team approach, with 'person-centred' care, and not care which is organisationally or professionally focused. 6.3.2(i) Demand for services Trusts have experienced continuing pressure to respond to an ever increasing demand for services . Whilst in the context of delivering significantly imp roved access to secondary care services, the average growth in demand is estimated at 10% to 12%. This level of growth in demand would be unsustainable in the longer term. To maintain the quality of care, and further improve access to services, it is envisaged that a significant proportion of services will be delivered more appropriately, in primary care and community settings. 6.3.2(ii) General Medical (GP) Services General Medical Services are a ke y location to target health improvement initiatives from promotion of immunisation initiatives, targeting emotional wellbeing t hrough to more general health and wellbeing initiatives on diet, exerc ise, alcohol and smoking. In 2009/10 \u00a343.9m was invested by the Health and Social Care 106Board in the General Medical Services Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), supporting professionals in General Practice to deliver a range of health promotion and disease prevention activity. \u00a327.3m was invested in Enhanced Services*.

The Health and Social Care Board is currently engaged in a review, and regional harmonisation, of Enhanced Services to ensure effectiveness, equality of access, and value for * Services for patients, delivered to a higher specified standard than, and not routinely delivered though the essential/core contract for General Medical Services (GP Services). 107money. Engagement with profession als, across health and social care is ongoing, to deliver the ai ms of the Service Frameworks. Integrated primary, community a nd secondary care services, and the provision of effective Enhanced Services, will be essential for delivery. A re-focus of existing investment and bids for additional funding are being considered by the Heal th and Social Care Board, to complement the work undertaken in General Practice in managing chronic illness, through improved in tegration of care in the delivery of Service Frameworks. For exam ple, in implementation of the Respiratory Framework, the intention is to implement a chronic disease management model, us ing a self-management approach, and basing services within prim ary care supported by specialist community input. The focu s will be on the avoidance of unnecessary admissions and facilita tion of early discharge; with services operating across acute a nd community interface, to increase effectiveness and efficiency. The implementation plan has identified investment priorities for Trusts, to establish community multi-disciplinary teams, with a range of professionals such as N urse Specialists, Physiotherapists and Clinical Psychologists; support ed by General Practitioners. Such teams will facilitate a r ange of activities, including early supported discharge, admissions avoidance, support and training to GP practices, nebuliser an d long term oxygen therapy assessments, case management of moderate to severe cases, pulmonary rehabilitation and palliati ve care. These developments are aimed at an improvement in th e quality of life of patients and a reduction in mortality, in an evi dence-based and cost effective re- organisation of the delivery of care. \"The right care, by the right person, in the right place, at t he right time: evidence-based care, which is timely and cost-effective\". 6.3.2(iii) Dental Services The Health and Social Care Board w ill continue to work with both independent contractors and Trusts to prevent dental disease. The Health and Social Care Board has a central coordinating role in the Northern Ireland Caries Prevention in Practice trial, the largest primary care based resear ch study into the prevention of tooth decay ever undertaken in the UK. The trial began in November 2009 and recruitment of practices commenced in May 1082010. The Health and Social Care Board will also continue to work collaboratively with the Public H ealth Agency and the Trusts to reduce oral health inequalities through the five Investing for Health funded toothpaste schemes. An evaluation of the schemes undertaken by the Health and So cial Care Board in May 2009 found them to be effective and recurrent funding has now been secured. Registrations with Dental Serv ices for children under-5 are a key indicator for health i nequalities and the Public Health Agency will work with communities to enc ourage more parents to be aware of their own and their children's dent al hygiene. The Health and Social Care Board is keen to im prove access to dental services across the region, and improve the q uality of care provided. The Health and Social Care Board will seek to improv e access by new approaches to contracting servic es, where traditional models of provision have not delivered. To t hat end, the Health and Social Care Board has invested \u00a317.1m in enhancing access through partnership with the private sector. The Health and Social Care Board entered into a contract with Oasis Dental Care Limited in September 2009 to provide dental services in the areas of Northern Ireland where access was considered problematic. The contract requires that by S eptember 2010, Oasis will have 38 new dentists, working out of 15 practi ces, in the areas perceived to have the greatest requirement for imp roved access. To date, two practices have opened in the West ern area, and plans remain on the schedule for the remaini ng 13 practices. To ensure appropriate levels of dental access in the long term, the Health and Social Care Board is working co llaboratively with DHSSPS and the British Dental Association on the piloting arrangements for three new dental contracts: one for G eneral Dental Services, one for Orthodontic Services and one for O ral Surgery. In contracting for General Dental Services, there is an aim to shift the emphasis to holistic quality of care, rather t han the traditional model, based on 'item of service' payments. The Health and Social Care B oard is committed to improving outcomes and securing best value from the services it commissions. There are currently three centralised out-of-hours dental services in Northern Ireland H ealth and Social Care, each of which operate in different ways. In 2010-2011 the Health and Social Care Board plans to review these services to ensure that across Northern Ireland out-of-hours dental care is provided in the 109most equitable, effective and e fficient manner. Specialist Oral Surgery services in Northern Irel and are provided in both the primary and secondary care setting . To maximise efficiency and access to care, it is important that the most complex cases are seen in the most specialised centre s and, where possible, that less complicated conditions are treated locally. The Health and Social Care Board will review the pr ovision of Oral Surgery and Maxillofacial Surgery to ensure that the twin goals of efficiency and access are met. 6.3.2(iv) Pharmacy and Medicines Management There are unique opportunities to dev elop further partnerships with Community Pharmacies to promot e health improvement messages and campaigns. The Building Co mmunity Pharmacy Partnership initiative provides one opportuni ty but other approaches include tackling sexual health, obesit y prevention and oral health. Medicines are an important interventi on in healthcare. With over 30 million prescription items being di spensed annually costing over \u00a3400m, it is important that we opt imise the use of medicines to ensure maximum benefits to patients. The use of medicines can inadver tently lead to adverse incidents with between 5% and 10% of acute admissions to hospitals linked to the use of a medicine. It is important that there are good processes in place to monitor and review medicines and provide support to patients so that their safety is assured. The cost of medicines used is an im portant factor to consider. In Northern Ireland we spend \u00a3224 per head of population, the next highest administration being Wales at \u00a3194 per head of population. The Regional Twenty Year Strategy for Health and Wellbeing \"A Healthier Future\" recognised that medicines matter and identified the need to \"... embrace appropri ate Medicines Management services to improve the way medi cines are used both by individual patients and by the Health and So cial Care\". Much work has been done by practitioners and by l egacy HSS Boards, Trusts and DHSSPS in providing directi on and support under a range of initiatives. The Pharmaceutical Clinical Effectiveness Programme, led by DHSSPS, has provided a fo cus on safety and quality to drive efficiency and effectivene ss and in so doing has supported the delivery of higher attainm ent of generic prescribing and dispensing; the implementation of repeat dispensing; adoption of a 110methodology to assist in the appro priate selection of therapeutic choices; and the commissioni ng of Integrated Medicines Management within Health and Social Care Trusts. In 2010/11, the Health and So cial Care Board will implement a programme of medicines governance in primary care. This will build upon the project carried out in the legacy SHSSB and encourage practitioners to report prescribing, dispensing and administration incidents so that lessons can be learned on how to make the management of medicines safer. 6.3.2(v) GP Out-of-Hours Service The need for integration of health an d social care is not confined to normal working hours. The Heal th and Social Care Board will focus attention on improved int egration of unscheduled care and regionalisation of the GP Out-of-H ours Service. The GP Out-of- Hours Service has provided a quality service to patients since its inception. With increasing demand on services, the ability to continue delivering a quality service, within budget, is limited without reorganisation. Regionalisat ion of the service will deliver efficiencies in service provision, to sustain the delivery of a quality service, and maintain access . In partnership with Local Commissioning Groups, the Health and Social Care Board will seek to improve integration of th e service with other forms of community and unscheduled care, bui lding on progress that has already been made, and ensuring eq uality of access across the region. This will include access to a range of services, for example nursing, dental, pharmacy, mental h ealth and social care. It will also include voluntary and chari table providers. The key is to ensure that GP Out-of-Hours services and unscheduled care are linked with daytime care with si gnificant benefits for essential service such as palliative and 'end-of-life' care. Underpinning this requirement for gre ater integration of services, development of new care pathways, integration and extension of professional roles, is the need f or professional development. The Health and Social Care Board will, in partnership with educational and training agencies, seek to fa cilitate professional development to support the changing health and social care environment. It is important to ensure that Appraisa l, Governance and developments in service delivery are more robustly linked to educational provision. 1116.3.3 PFA Targets PFA Target: Pathway Management By March 2011, the Health and Social Care Board should establish pilot programmes to evaluate: (i) models of integrated care in communit y settings which incorporate integration along clinical car e pathways and address the wider determinants of health; and (ii) models of unscheduled care in hospital settings which integrate primary care out-of- hours services with ambulance and A&E services. The Health and Social Care Board will, through Local Commissioning Groups and the development of 'Primary Care Partnerships', establish pilot programmes to evaluate new models of integrated care in community setti ngs. This will build on existing work in developing clinical care pathways, placing a focus on the patient-centred integration of serv ices. The Health and Social Care Board/Local Commissioning Groups and Public Health Agency will work in partnership to address the wider determinants of health, helping a shift in emphasis to prevention. Trusts will be supported to develop improv ed models of unscheduled care delivery, integrating primary care Out-of-Hours and community unscheduled care services with A&E services, and acute hospital care provision. PFA Target: Hospital Discharges From April 2010, the Health a nd Social Care Board and Trusts should ensure that 90% of complex discharges take place within 48 hours, with no disch arge taking longer than seven days. All other patients should be discharged within six hours of being declared medically fit. Timely discharge promotes better patient outcomes and reduces demand on the acute sector, even when the coordination of care and support services is complex. Moreover, timely discharge is frequently the expresse d preference of the pat ients. It requires a discharge ethos to be well embedded across the community-acute interface, in the use of Estima ted Dates of Discharge, proactive discharge planning (including t he use of existing discharge coordinators) and the focus of a ll professionals on rehabilitation potential. 112 At the point of discharge, there must still be the appropriate use of Enhanced Intermediate Care, with the Care Management of patients taking place outside of the ward setting, enabling all involved to make informed a nd coordinated post-discharge care decisions, eliminating unnecessary delay. The Health and Social Care Board will continue to prom ote the development and implementation of discharge protocol s which are consistent with timely discharge, while facilitat ing patient choice and the need for carers to be integral to the discharge planning process. The majority of the necessa ry elements cited above are established, or are in development, but this activity in development and implementation will need to be sustained. Complementary to this, will be a drive towards g reater integration of statutory, independent and voluntary servic es in the community; stronger partnership with local government, housing, rural development etc. The Health and Social Care Board, through Local Commissioning Groups, will seek to extend the continuum of support, or care services, in place in the loca l community, facilitating optimal discharge planning and delivery. Su ch 'whole-systems' working and continuing improvement is at the heart of integrating care, delivering the best outcomes for individuals, and for Health and Social Care across the region. It is the aim of the Health and Social Care Board to work with Trusts, in order to ensure that 90% of complex discharges take place within 48 hours, with no di scharge taking longer than seven days. It is also intended that a ll other patients will be discharged within six hours of being declared medically fit. PFA Target: Unplanned admissions By March 2011, the Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should further develop early intervention approaches to support identified patients with severe chronic diseases (e.g. heart disease and respiratory conditions) so that exacerbations of their disease which would otherwise lead to unplanned hospital admissions are reduced by 50%. 113In seeking to reduce exacerbatio ns of chronic disease leading to unplanned admissions the Health and Social Care Board will progress parallel approaches to deliver a holistic solution. In the first instance the Health and Social Care Board will work with general practitioners, through the General Medical Services Contract, seeking to ensure optimal care of all pat ients through the Quality and Outcomes Framework and Enhanced Services for the management of chronic disease. The Health and Social Care Board will engage general practitione rs to review variation in referral rates and unscheduled adm issions, in order to optimise effectiveness in the community - based management of such patients. To ensure an integrated approach across primary and secondary care, the Health and Social Care Board will continue to progress the implementation of current and future Service Frameworks standards in order to optimise the management of chronic illness within the population. Communication at the Primary/Secondary care interface will be examined to ensure effective and timely communication underpinning refe rral, outpatient attendance and discharge; with an emphasis on ensu ring sufficient information and care planning is provided to s upport patients in the community, and prevent avoidable readmissions. In order to ensure that resource is focused to provide maximum benefit, the Health and Social Care Board will support clinicians in primary and secondary care in the identification of those patients most likely to benefit from more intensive care management. Research conducted in North ern Ireland, and in England has shown the potential to identify pat ients with chronic diseases at risk of hospitalisation, at an early stage. PARR (Patient At Risk of Re Hospitalisation) tools have been developed to model risk, and identify patients for intervention in order to prevent hospitalisation rather than react to it. The Health and Social Care Board is exploring approaches taken else where, including those undertaken by the Nuffield Trust in the development of risk modelling for patients in Northern Ireland. Once patients at risk have been identified evidence is lacking to determine the most effective form of intervention. The Health and Social Care Board/Public Health Agency will seek to evaluate models of intervention across each He alth and Social Care Trust in 114order to determine effectiveness. The intention will be to monitor deliver delivery of the PfA Target in relation to predicted risk while measuring the relative effectivene ss of interventions, in order to optimise care across the region. Work will be undertaken with Local Commissioning Groups / Primary Care Partnerships to develop integrated and coherent interventions across the Primary/Secondary Care interface. P art of this work will involve focus on improved health prom otion and outcome focused management of long term c onditions, evaluated through measuring the rate of unscheduled admissions to hospital, in absolute terms and relative to the predicted risk. The Health and Social Care Board will expect to see a downturn in rates as a measure of effective care. PFA Target: Direct Payments By March 2011, the Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should increase the number of direct payment cases to 1,750. Considerable progress has been ma de by Trusts in response to the target for achieving an addi tional 1,750 clients on Direct Payments between 2008 and March 2011. Commissioners expect Trusts to continue to promote the take up of Direct Payments across all client groups in 2010/11 as a means of ensuring responsive services and value for money. Trusts are expected, through thei r Carer Coordinators, to increase the number of carers' assess ments offered and the number of completed carers' assessments re corded. In addition the Health and Social Care Board will work with Trusts and relevant independent sector agencies, to ens ure that information for carers is up to date and appropriate. Through General Medical Services Quality and Outcomes Fram ework investment, General Practitioners are encouraged to identify carers and put in place a mechanism for the referral of carers for social services assessment. PFA Target: Palliative Care By March 2011, Trusts should establish multi-disciplinary palliative care teams and sup porting service improvement programmes to provide appropriate palliative care in the community to adult patients requiring such services. 115 Trusts are tasked to progress t he development of palliative care teams to provide support and care to palliative and end-of-life patients in the community on a 24/7 basis, with the aim of decreasing the number of inappropriat e admissions to hospital. Trusts have been required to put in place service improvement programmes to support these teams; delivered in the context of the Gold Standards Framework, Care Pathway for the Dying and the best standards of multi-profes sional education. The Health and Social Care Board will seek to facilitate engagement and integration of these services wi th Family Practitioner Services, both in-hours and Out-of-Hours. PFA Target: Primary Care Access From April 2010, the Health a nd Social Care Board should ensure 70% of patients receive an appointment within two working days with a GP or a ppropriate practice based primary care practitioner, increasing to 80% from April 2011. The Health and Social Care Board is committed to ensuring good access to General Practitioner serv ices. The Health and Social Care Board will continue to promote this through implementation of nationally agreed Quality and Outc omes Framework measures of the 'Patient experience of a ccess', and the current Regional Directed Enhanced Service for access. PFA Target: Medicines Management By March 2011, the Health and Social Care Board should introduce a Northern Ireland Medicines Formulary. The Health and Social Care Board will give due consideration to the capacity to achieve this target and in particular build on the excellent work that has been led by the DHSSPS through the pharmaceutical clinical effectiv eness programme. In support of this target the Health and Soci al Care Board will convene a Medicines Management Forum to advi se on the safe, effective and efficient use of medicines within Health and Social Care. A key output of this group will be to advise on the development and application of a formulary fo r Northern Ireland by March 2011 116Supplementary Information on Pf A Medicines Management Target A number of products have been identi fied to develop a formulary in 2010/11: 1/ The Medicines Management F orum will support the corporate governance controls in respect of development and implementation of a formulary. T herefore the establishment of the MMF will be a key output. 2/ A process for developing, rev iewing and authorising the content of the formulary. This includes linkage into secondary care to ensure consistenc y of approach. 3/ Formulary sections - the following will be developed and produced by year end: Gastro-intesti nal; Cardiovascular; Central Nervous System; Antimicrobials ; Wound Dressings. The delivery of these sections constitutes 60% of products in primary care 4/ Preparatory work to establish the remaining elements of the formulary (respiratory (which will lin k to the Respiratory Services Framework); endocrine; NSAI Ds; dermatology; nutrition). 5/ Implementation plan to incl ude the development of IT infrastructure to support the use of the formulary; and the process for update, review and control of entry onto the formulary. PFA Target: Greater use of generic drugs The Health and Social Care Board should ensure the level of dispensing of generic drugs increases to at least 64% by March 2011. On prescribing, in England and Wa les there has been a focus on Better Care, Better Value. These indicators are based upon National Institute for Clinic al Excellence guidance and are supported by a clear evidence ba se. Within the context of a Medicines Management Programme, the Health and Social Care Board will pay due regard to the following targets by March 2011: \u0083 Generic dispensing to increase to 64%; \u0083 Repeat dispensing to increase to 5%. 117 The Health and Social Care Board will also encourage the alignment of prescribing to Better Care, Better Value, for the following indicators, by March 2011: \u0083 Increase low cost lipid lowering therapy to 60% of total; \u0083 Increase low cost proton pu mp inhibitors to 80% of total; \u0083 Increase the proportion of lo w cost Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors, as a percent age of total use of drugs affecting the rennin-angiotensin system, to 72% of total. Through the application of these initia tives, it is envisaged that the cost of prescribed medicines will be reduced by some \u00a37m. 118Priority Area 4: Helping Older People to Live Independently 1196.4.1 Strategic Context To date Northern Ireland has not ha d the advantage of a Regional Strategy for Services for Older People, rather each legacy Board developed their own local strategic statements of intent. Priorities for Action has continued to set t he direction of travel for the programme of care, towards the building of a continuum of integrated primary and community care services that focus on people at greatest risk, support ing independence and reducing inappropriate reliance on hospitals and other institutional care. The launch of the plan to develo p a Service Framework for Older People's Health and Wellbeing in January 2010 established a regional process to agree evidence based standards, targets and measurable outcomes for the indivi dual's journey from prevention to ongoing support and care, incl uding where necessary, palliative care. The strategic direction for commissio ners in respect of the needs of people with dementia will be set by the forthcoming NI Dementia Strategy which is expected to be published in mid 2010. The Strategy will reflect the recomm endations about dementia included in the Bamford Review report wi th specific reference to the identification, treatment and c are of people with dementia and the provision of better support for carers. A key priority will be improvements in integrated work ing across prim ary, secondary and community care. Commissioning must aim to stri ke the balance between the need to shift resources towards dis ease prevention, health promotion and active ageing while also ensuring the delivery of a network of care and treatment services for those at the dependent end of the scale. 6.4.2 Commissioning Themes Section 1.1 of this Commissioning Plan, 'Demographic Changes', has highlighted already the challe nges for Health and Social Care arising from an ageing population. However, it is important to acknowledge the fact that increas ing numbers of older people are enjoying active and independent li ves for longer. Commissioning needs to build on this positive tr end by pursuing a healthy ageing agenda through \"Investing for Health\" partnersh ips to address key issues such as isolation, abus e, fuel poverty and the need for improved transport services. 1206.4.2(i) Demand for services Population ageing is a key driver f or policy. It is well recognised that the conditions that account for most diseases in the UK are primarily related to old age. Older people are proportionately the main users of acute hospitals and community health and social care services. The greatest concen tration of health care costs occurs in the last year of a p erson's life, whatever the age at death. The DHSSPS Capitation Formula Review Group work shows that the cost per pers on by age group across all programmes of care rises steeply fr om an average annual cost of \u00a31,800 in the 60-64 age band to over \u00a311,000 in the 85+ band. An increasing pressure for resource s is resulting from the growth in the number of people with dementia . The cost is high in terms of both public and private resourc es. In Northern Ireland 16,000 people are understood to be living wi th dementia, 400 of these with early onset dementia. The ageing of the popu lation means that by 2017 the figure is likely to rise to over 20,000 people. Research estimates that the annual average co st of care for someone with dementia ranges from \u00a314,540 for a person with mild dementia living in the community, to \u00a3 28,527 for someone with severe dementia in the community. T he average cost for someone in supported accommodation was estimated to be \u00a331,300. This demonstrates both the human and financial challenge to the commissioning system. 6.4.3 Priorities for Action The specific standards and targets to be achiev ed in 2010/11 are: PFA Target: PSA 4.1: Supporting People at home From April 2010, the Health a nd Social Care Board and Trusts should ensure at least 45% of people in care management have their assessed care needs met in a domiciliary setting. PFA Target: Assessment and treatment of older people From April 2010, the Health and Social Care Boards and Trusts should ensure older peopl e with continuing care needs wait no longer than eight weeks for assessment to be completed and should have th e main components of their care needs met within a further 12 weeks. PFA Target: Individualised Care Plans From December 2010, the Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should ensure any patient receiving a new care package at home is provided with a copy of their individual care plan to enable them to unde rstand the level of care to be 121provided and who to contact if difficulties arise with care package arrangements. In respect of the Priorities for Action targets for 2010/11, the Health and Social Care Board will cont inue to monitor performance specifically in respect of wait ing times for assessment/treatment and hospital discharges. Trust performance against the unplanned admissions target for people with severe chronic diseases will continue to be monitored closely. Work will be undertaken through the developmen t of the Service Framework for Older People's H ealth and Wellbeing to identify standards which are evidence-ba sed, and to describe the key performance indicators and benchm arks. As with all Service Frameworks, the process of audit and measurement of the standards will be built in from t he start. Likewise, the Northern Ireland Dementia Strategy w ill represent the main future monitoring framework for dementia provision. 6.4.4 Challenges and Constraints In 2010/11 the priority for th e programme of care for older people will be to continue to reform serv ices to achieve an integrated system which responds flexibly to demand and addres ses capacity issues more effectively. The cu rrent Health and Social Care Board community care demand/capacity w ork will analyse variations in charging, costs, demand and applicat ion of eligibility criteria. The lessons from best practice el sewhere will be considered for application across NI, particularly the Care Services Efficiency Development programme, or reablement initiative, being implemented in GB and piloting in Southern and Northern Trusts. The emphasis on prevention, detecti on and early intervention will grow and the role of General Medical Services and the independent sector will be at the forefront of the outcome driven modernisation process. New models of care reflecting innovative practice and the active prom otion of Direct Payments and personalised budgets will be si gnificant elements of future commissioning for the ca re and treatment of ol der people, as will the provision of sup port for carers, including formal assessment of their needs. The Carer's S upport and Needs Assessment component of Northern Ireland Si ngle Assessment Tool provides an effective, consistent framework for this. The Trusts, in partnership with primary care, and the independent sector, will be expected to cont inue to strengthen and streamline discharge planning arrangem ents and to consolidate the capacity for post-acute rehabilitation in a range of intermediate care settings. The restructuring of ex isting facilities, resources and 122workforce will be crucial to the ac hievement of the strategic shift away from traditional forms of pr ovision. Individualised care plans for people receiving care at home will be introduced in 2010/11, as an important element in the promotion of self-management. In previous years the growing need s of an ageing population have been met by a growth in funding. Trusts have already had to increase their spending to m eet demand into 2010/11 and an additional \u00a315m is being made availa ble to meet this. The Local Commissioning Groups will have a crit ical role in how this resource is commissioned within each of their areas. The Health and Social Care B oard will look to the Local Commissioning Groups to adopt a more consistent approach to charging where there are existing variations, aiming for greater equity between different localities. Trusts will also be expected to seek greater value for money in t heir use of service providers. The Local Commissioning Groups w ill also have a role in bringing greater consistency to the procur ement of community care. Beyond 2010/11 the main drivers f or the strategic development of services for older people will be the forthcoming service framework and the NI Dementia Strategy. The outcome of the demand/capacity work will also influ ence strongly the priorities for commissioning, as will feedback from effective performance management. 6.4.5 Summary of Commissioning Proposals in 2010/11 The Health and Social Care B oard Response/Intent for 2010/11 Based on Funding Intentions or Ot her Factors (e.g. Restructuring). The Health and Social Care B oard will deploy \u00a315.1m across 5 Trusts to meet the anticipated growth in demand for 2010/11 so that waiting time targets are maintained and to support adult protection. The Health and Social Care Board expects Trusts to continue to move away from providing care in institutional settings, in particular traditional forms of res idential care, and to work with housing agencies and others to develop accommodation which offers a home-based care setting with more flexible and responsive care and support. The Health and Social Care Board will expect Trusts to plan hospital discharge from the day of admission and to work with carers and other providers to ens ure that patient s are discharged from hospital as soon as is clinic ally safe, to appropriate settings, for assessment of their future care requirement. 123Priority Area 5: Improve Children's Health and Wellbeing 1246.5.1 Strategic Context The theme of improving children's health and wellbeing resonates with the six high level outcomes identified in the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister St rategy - 'Our Children and Young People - Our Pledge'. Achieving the outcomes from this strategy is the underpinning aim for all servic es to support children and young people in being: \u0083 Healthy; \u0083 Enjoying, learning and achieving; \u0083 Living in safety and with stability; \u0083 Experiencing economic and environmental wellbeing; \u0083 Contributing positively to community and society; and \u0083 Living in society which respects their rights. This strategy combined with other overarching strategic documents issued by the DHSSPS, namely 'Care Matters' and 'Families Matter' provide the contex t in which services are being commissioned. The planned Childre n's Services Framework will also influence future commissioning. There is recognition of the need for development and investme nt across the continuum of children's services from preventi on / early intervention to adoption /leaving and aftercare. There is an extensive body of evidence which demonstrates the cost benef it analysis of an investment in our children. It is important that ch ildren are valued, protected and cherished as they are the fou ndation stone for fu ture generations. \"Care Matters\" outlines t he corporate role of the state to assist those children and young people lo oked after and care leavers whose health and wellbeing requires to be improved. 6.5.2 Commissioning Themes 6.5.2(i) Demand for Services 125In Northern Ireland over 700 0 children and young people are referred each year to specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. The Health and Social Care Board under the auspices of the Bamford Implementation Taskforce has established a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services task group to take forward service improvem ent in line with the specific actions outlined in the Bamford Implementation Plan. Birth rates across Northern Ireland as a whole ha ve fluctuated in recent years but show a general upward trend part icularly over the past five years. This is illustrated in the following table: Birth Rate per 1,000 population by Trust for 2000 - 2009 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 BHSCT 12.0 11.9 11.5 12.0 12.4 12.0 12.5 13.4 14.2 14.0 NHSCT 12.5 12.6 12.6 12.3 13.1 12.8 13.0 13.4 14.0 13.1 SEHSCT 12.2 12.4 11.5 12.1 12.4 12.0 12.6 13.4 13.7 13.3 SHSCT 13.7 14.6 14.0 14.0 14.6 14.7 15.0 15.6 16.0 15.9 WHSCT 13.9 13.9 13.6 13.4 12.9 13.4 13.9 13.8 14.4 14.2 NI 12.8 13.0 12.6 12.7 13. 0 12.9 13.4 13.9 14.4 14.0 6.5.2(ii) Partnership Working The Health and Social Care Board/ Public Health Agency remains committed to working in partnership with service users and a range of stakeholders across the statut ory, voluntary, community and independent sectors. These partn erships, which are integral to commissioning People's Committees; Source: NISRA Notes: Population used is mid-y ear estimates for each year (2009 figures are provisional - 2009 rate is calculated using the 2008 mid-year estimated population). 126 \u0083 Hidden Harm Quality Assurance Group; \u0083 Regional Child Protection Committee; \u0083 Child Care Partnerships; \u0083 Investing For Heal th Partnerships; \u0083 Think Child, Think Parent, Think Family. There is commitment to bring f orward and consolidate work on outcomes based planning and m easuring how effective service interventions are with children and their families. There is a need to strengthen the arrangements fo r children and young people's participation in planning proce sses and ensure that there are mechanisms in place for feedback on the services available to these children. 6.5.2(iii) Reform and Modernisation The need to commission services which are fit for purpose has been high on the agenda of the Health and Social Care Board/Public Health Agency which is why there has been and will continue to be in 2010/2011 a fo cus on reform and modernisation. The Performance Management and Service Improvement Directorate within the Health and Social Care Board has a specific responsibility to take this age nda forward and within children's services the Children's Servic e Improvement Programme and the Reform Implementation Team have been the vehicles through which prioritisation, demand and capacity, modernisation and productivity have been pursued. This has resulted in multiagency engagement/involvement and the pr omotion of greater consistency across the Health and Social C are sector. This process will be ongoing in the forthcoming year to consolidate the need for collaborative working and th e recognition that more can be achieved for the population. 6.5.2(iv) Family Support 127 The Children's Services Planning process has effectively brought stakeholders together to plan and provide both local and regional services in line with the strategic direction as spelt out in 'Families Matter'. These services are moni tored and require to report on the progress measured against the Ch ildren's Strategy High Level Outcomes. This is the third year of Com prehensive Spending Review funding to a wide range of family support projects and the bulk of the reduced funding available to child ren's services for 2010/2011 will require to be used to adhere to th ese contractual arrangements. In the event that some of this fundi ng is mainstreamed in future years the Health and Social Care Board will need to consider the balance of investment between fa mily support and statutory services. The Childcare Partnerships operatin g as multiagency partnerships are financed by Department of Educat ion but led by the Health and Social Care Board and this will contin ue at least for the next year. The primary focus is on early years and family support services in the most deprived areas and the ag enda can only be effectively delivered if the partnership arrang ements are maintained, if communities continue to contribut e and if quality remains as integral to service provision. It will be important that Local Commissioning Groups are kept apprised of developments commissioned through these multiagency processes but which o perate at a local level and will impact on the work of t he Local Commissioning Groups. 6.5.2(v) Early Intervention Strategy The foundations for physical, intellectual and emotional development are primarily estab lished in early childhood. To have an impact on health inequalities ensuring the optimum focus on early interventions is therefore critic al. In addition to the roll out of 128a variety of early years inve stment the establishment of internationally successful and evidence based early intervention models including 'Family Nurse Partnerships' and 'Roots of Empathy/Seeds of Empathy' into Northern Ireland in 2010/2011 will be pursued. 6.5.2(vi) Healthy Child, Healthy Future The Healthy Child, Healthy Future programme is a universal public health service offered to all ch ildren and young people aged 0-19 years. This programme requires a se t number of contacts to be made to each family in Northern I reland to identify the health need(s) through a holistic assess ment which includes screening and surveillance, where necessary provide early intervention to ameliorate the potential early nega tive impact of any physical, social or emotional factors on a child or young person's health and wellbeing. The Commissioner and T rusts will fully implement the revised Child Health Promotion Programme by 31st March 2011. We will take into account the Marm ot Review of Health Inequalities 2010 which said that reducing healt h inequalities is a matter of fairness and social justice and t he fair distribution of health, wellbeing and sustainability are important social goals. 6.5.2(vii) Long Term Conditions In Childhood Partnership with parents and child ren and young people is central to the planning and delivery of children's services. Parents of children and children with long term conditions e.g diabetes, epilepsy and childhood disability sh ould be supported to manage their child's condition and help the child self manage whenever possible. A three year Northern Ir eland wide project for children and adolescents with diabetes, funded through Inte r-Reg IV, is piloting the introduction of St ructured Patient Education for all children with diabetes and thei r families in Northern Ireland. 129This will support familie s and children with diabetes to optimize diabetes control in childhood and prevent or delay the development of complications of di abetes in adulthood. There is a need to ensure children have access to effective interventions in managing their condition. 6.5.2(viii) Pre-pregnancy Care Evidence is increasing of the im portance to pre-pre gnancy care for the health of children, particul arly for women of child bearing age with long term conditions such as diabetes and epilepsy. A three year Northern Ireland wide project, funded through Int er Reg IV, is piloting pre-pregnancy care for dia betic women of child bearing age in Northern Ireland. This aims to reduce the increased perinatal mortality and congenital ma lformation rates observed in diabetic pregnancies. 6.5.2(ix) Pregnancy Care Births have increased in Northern Ireland since 2004. We have endorsed the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines for ante-natal, post -natal and in tra-partum care. Trusts need to ensure targeted intervention s are available for high risk pregnancies. 6.5.2(x) Child and Adolescent Men tal Health Services (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) In response to the growing demand for specialist intervention, legacy Health and Social Care Boards invested over \u00a31.6m over the last two years. This inve stment was largely focused on developing capacity within existing specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services teams, and in establishing eating disorder and crisis assessment teams. Wh ilst there has also been some modest investment in the dev elopment of w raparound/therapeutic care services for look ed after children, there remains a significant gap in earlier intervention servic es and in the range of available 130psychological therapies across th e Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services tiers. The H ealth and Social Care Board has promoted and will continue to appl y the Choice and Partnership Approach model in taking forward the modernisation and commissioning agenda. Currently in Northern Ireland there is a total of 27 regional beds, of which 12 are for adolescents (aged over 14) and 15 for children. This level of provision has hist orically led to higher levels of admissions of young people to ad ult mental health wards and Extra Contractual Referrals for th ose young people with intensive psychiatric/complex care needs. As a result of capital investment from April 2010 the number of beds will rise by 6 to 33 beds regionally, (16 adolescent, 2 Intens ive psychiatric care and 15 children's beds).These additional beds should reduce reliance on adult mental health beds and assist in the preventing some Extra Contractual Referrals for intensiv e psychiatric care. However in order to avoid unnecessary ad mission and to support earlier discharge there will be a need to develop the scope and range of community child and adolescent mental health services. The Health and Social Care Board in partnership with the Trusts will review the range and scope of tier 4 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services provision. 6.5.2(xi) Children with Disabilities Trusts should ensure progress is achieved against the regional Autism and Acquired Brain Injury Action Plans. This necessitates that Trusts develop service c apacity across the Children's Mental Health and Disability servic es and encompasses the child, adolescent and adult age range. A key requirement is to ensure that existing infrastructure and practitioners across the wider range of Children's Mental Health and Di sability Services are better able to meet the needs of both chil dren and adults with Autism and Acquired Brain Injury. Trusts must evidence that individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Acquired Brain Injury are considered within a person centred framework and not restricted 131by specific criteria which risk ex cluding individuals from access to services. The Health and Social Care Board/ Public Health Agency will seek to engage with Trusts in scopi ng current access criteria to establish regional consistency in th e application of such criteria. Trusts should also ensure that app ropriate Transitions services for young people with a disability and t heir carers are in place and the relevant information around transitions between Children and Adults services is available to service users and their carers including information in relati on to carer's assessments and direct payments. 6.5.2(xii) Prevention and Community Engagement An important theme in community engagement is to avoid crises arising where possible through pr eventative approaches. Solutions to challenging structural proble ms require strong service user, carer and community engagement in planning services and new initiatives. Some communities, individuals and fa milies experience multiple social problems. For ex ample they may lack employment, skills and qualifications, are living in poor accommodation, live on a low income, have addiction and substance problems or may be at risk. Health and Social Care services work with some of the most excluded and vulnerable members of society and in working with people with limited capacity must be imaginative in promoting participation, user involvement and person cent red approaches. This kind of intervention promotes real empowerment and self help in the community and en ables service users and carers to speak for themselves, advocate for service improvements and fully engage with Health and Social C are Board/Public Health Agency in planning new services. User involvement and community based development supports confident active and sustainable communities, capable of meeting their own needs in partnership with Health and Social Care serv ices and others. The Health and Social Care Board/Public Health Agency will continue to employ community development principles in involving service users and carers in planning and developing services. 132 6.5.3 PFA Targets The range of targets pos ed particular challenges as they also reflect the continuum of care covering family support, child protection, looked after children, care leavers and family group conferencing. In view of the numbers of unalloca ted cases it has been necessary to put in place robust monitori ng processes to be assured that cases of a child protection na ture are responded to immediately and that cases are being screened and assessments completed along the pathway in a timely fashion. The Health and Social Care Board has made recurrent and non recurrent investment in the past year to assist Trusts to respond to an increased number of ref errals and will continue to see this as a priority area in the forthcoming year. It will be important to retain the commi tment to the targets as far as this is practically possible as these assist in promoting the outcomes relating to children livin g with safety and stability and young people experiencing ec onomic and environmental wellbeing. PFA Target: Children In Care From April 2010, the Health and Social Care Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should ensure children admitted to residential care have prior to their admission: (i) been the subject of a formal assessment to determine the need for residential care, and (ii) had their placement matched through the Children's Resource Panel process. For every child taken into care, a plan for permanence and associated timescale should be developed within six months and formally agreed at the first six-monthly Local Advisory Comm ittee review. 133PFA Target: Family Support Interventions By March 2011, the Health and So cial Care Health and Social Care Board and Trusts shou ld provide family support interventions to 3000 children and vulnerable families each year. By this date, Trusts should also have updated the Regional Information System with details of family support services which they provide. PFA Target: Care leavers in education, training or employment From April 2010, the Health and Social Care Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should en sure that at least 70% of all care leavers aged 19 are in education, training or employment. PFA Target: Care leavers living with former foster carers or supported families By March 2011, the Health and So cial Care Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should ensure that at least 200 care leavers aged 18+ are living with their former foster carers or supported family. PFA Target: Looked-after children on the child protection register By March 2011, the Health and So cial Care Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should en sure that the child protection status of all looked-after children on the current register is reviewed in line with Departme ntal guidance issued in April 2010. PFA Target: Family group conferencing During 2010/11, the Health and So cial Care Health and Social Care Board and Trusts shou ld ensure that at least 500 134children and young people pa rticipate in a family group conference. As regards the targets referring to Family Group Conferencing and Education, Training and Empl oyment opportunities for Care Leavers, some Trusts have stipulated that achievability is dependent on the young person's w illingness to be involved and that the economic climate will im pact on the careleavers target. The Board will continue to work closely with the Trusts to monitor progress and ensure that th e standards are met within the required timescale.\" PFA Target: Assessment of children at risk and in need \u0083 From April 2010, the Health and Social Care Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should ensure the following: \u0083 Child protection (allocation of referrals) - all child protection referrals are allocated within 24 hours of receipt of the referral. \u0083 Child protection (initial assessment) - all child protection referrals are investigated and an initial assessment completed within 10 working days from the date of the original referral being received. \u0083 Child protection (pathway assessment) - following the completion of the initial assessment, a child protection case conference is held within 15 working days of the original referral being received. \u0083 Looked-after children (initial assessment) - an initial assessment is completed within 10 working days from the date of the child becoming looked after. \u0083 Family support (family support referral) - 90% of family support referrals are allocated to a social worker within 20 working days for initial assessment. \u0083 Family support (initial assessment) - all family support referrals are investigated and an initial assessment 135completed within 10 working days from the date the original referral was alloca ted to the social worker. \u0083 Family support (pathway assessment) - on completion of the initial assessment, 90% of cases deemed to require a family support pathway assessment should be allocated within a further 20 working days. 6.5.4 Challenges and Constraints Within Child and Family Care S ervices there is a requirement on Trusts to effectively discharge a r ange of statutory functions and to provide assurances that this is th e case. The Health and Social Care Board will wish to strengthen Gateway and Family Intervention Teams to meet demand. The significant increase in chil dren's names placed on the child protection register reflects t he national perspective and the response to high profile situat ions where children are exposed to serious harm or even death. The Health and Social Care Board/Public Health Agency expect, as will service providers, that there is adherence to procedural requirements and that responses are timely, proportionate and robust. The needs of looked after children are diverse and complex. They must be informed by meaningful engagement of the children and young people as well as assessm ent processes which are multi disciplinary and recognise the role to be played by various partners if these children are to reco ver from previous traumatic experiences, or to form meaningf ul attachments to appropriate adults and go on to make a positive contribution to the community and society. The Health and Social Care Board will wish to ensure that previous investment in the development and maintenance of therapeutic fostercare schemes and therapeut ic inputs for children in residential care have been utilised and consi der which aspects can be regionalised to produce better outcomes. There is a need to consolidate the position and f or Trusts regionally to utilise investment in finalising structures. The need for post adoption support services is also recogni sed and the Health and Social Care Board will work with potential providers to further develop these services in the forthcom ing year. Care leavers must 136continue to receive support; practi cal, financial and therapeutic if their needs are to be met. This w ill allow statutory functions to be discharged whilst also beginning to break the cycle where a significant proportion of care leav ers will continue to experience various forms of disadvantage into adulthood which is a further call on public resources. The former foster care (Go the Extra Mile) scheme has been a positive example of promoting stab ility for care leavers and leaves Northern Ireland as a forerunner in this regard. The Health and Social Care Board would wish to see this further expanded. The Health and Social Care B oard has established processes for Trusts to report all placements of 16/17 year olds in unregulated accommodation. It is underst ood standards are to be issued via DHSSPS in relation to such a ccommodation and Trusts should seek assurance that appropriat e safeguarding arrangements are in place and that placements can meet the needs of the young people concerned. Multi-sectoral discussions have al so been ongoing in relation to young homeless and there is a po tential for this area to be a significant call on social care serv ices resource if this cohort were to require to be seen as looked after children. Residential child care is the preferred and necessary placement choice for some young people; th ere have been some occasions where Trusts have considered t heir needs can only be met in specialist placements outside Nort hern Ireland. These have been identified as high cost cases and the Health and Social Care Board has identified recurrent funds to t he Trusts for thes e cases in the expectation that this process and the available funds will be used appropriately with Trusts seeking to remain in budget. It is also the case that the number of young peo ple who experience this level of disruption should be minimised and the Health and Social Care Board will still therefore require to be advised where this is being considered to offer a view on the appropriateness of young people being placed outside the jurisdiction. Trusts now have a stock of resi dential care and all Trusts have access to the regional secure unit. The Health and Social Care Board will retain its commitment to the places provided within the regional voluntary children' s home during 2010/11 whilst a 137decision is reached in relation to regional provision. It is felt that there is a need for additional differ entiation and specialisation in this sector. The Health and Social Care Board would wish to engage further with providers in this regard to determine the specific needs and the potential to work across Trust boundaries to create a more receptive po rtfolio of provision. 6.5.5 Summary of Commissioning Proposals 2010/11 Investment Family Support Interven tions / Packages \u00a31.04 Gateway Services \u00a31.17m Adoption Support \u00a30.15m Children's Services Total \u00a32.36m 2010/11 Investment Statutory Carers Assessments for Autistic Children \u00a30.10m Out of Hours Cover re Obstetrics \u00a30.05m Children with Complex Needs Total \u00a30.15m 138Priority Area 6: Improve Mental Health Services and Services for People with Disabilities 1396.6.1 Strategic Direction The Bamford Report and the 'Prot ect Life' Strategy set out the vision for the reform and modernisa tion of Mental Health, Learning Disability and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services over a fifteen year horizon. Since the pub lication of the individual report, further evidence based models of service delivery have emerged and these will be integrated during the implementation of the Bamford recommendations. The H ealth and Social Care Board has established a number of core task groups to take this work forward and this will be monitored by the Bamford Implementation Taskforce, led by the Health and Social Care Board's Chief Executive. A core theme will be the need to strengthen community services to promote a recovery based model of care provided predominately in or close to people's homes. As outlined in 'Delivering the Bamford Vision' (DHSSPS, 2009), key themes include: 1. Promoting positive health, wellbeing and early intervention; 2. Supporting people to lead independent lives; 3. Supporting carers; 4. Providing better public serv ices to meet people's needs; 5. Providing structures and a legislative base to deliver the Bamford Vision. Additional strategic drivers incl ude the regional 'Protect Life', Suicide Prevention and Promoting Mental Health and Wellbeing strategies and the new Strategic direction for Drugs and Alcohol, which aim to promote mental health and wellbeing and foster resilience within communities. The strategic direction for L earning Disability service developments and service improvement is set out in the \"Equal Lives\" report of the Bamford Review. This envisages a similar model of community based care so that no-one remains in hospital unnecessarily and the people with a learning disability can enjoy the maximum quality of life possible, consistent with their needs. 140 In the absence to date of a regional strategy for Physical Disability/Sensory Impairment, le gacy Boards developed local strategies which reflected the aims of promoting independence and empowerment and improving the quality and responsiveness of health and social services for people with disabilities and their carers. Late in 2009, DHSSPS launched the process for developing a Regional Strategy for People with Physical Disabilities and Sensory Impairment and it is anticipated that this will be completed by early Autumn 2010. The Strategy will adopt a life cycle approach covering all age groups and will promote the importance of partnership workin g across statutory, community and independent sectors. The focus of Priorities for Acti on 2009/10 for this programme of care was the continued development of person-centred, seamless community-based services, informed by the views of users and carers. Key priorities were, and continue to be, the avoidance of inappropriate hospital admission, facilitation of early discharge, improved respite and carer s upport, and the enhancement of provision for those with acquired brain injury and for those who require Wheelchair services. The latter two areas have recently been the subject of regional review and implementation proce sses are currently progressing. The targets associated with the action plans for each review are being monitored through the perfor mance management process. The emphasis now must be upon th e reform and modernisation of our existing services. New investme nt may occur in strategically critical areas (i.e. to deliver Priori ties for Action and drive efficiency and effectiveness). The Health and Social Care Board will seek evidence that any new investment is linked to significant reform and service improvement as a co ndition of approving any new service developments. The Bamford Implementation Taskforce commenced in January 2009 and is jointly led by the H ealth and Social Care Board and the Public Health Agency in part nership with Trusts and other stakeholders. At a local level, this process will be led by Local Commissioning Groups. 141The Taskforce will be the principal source of advice and guidance regarding service development priori ties and will fa cilitate greater consistency and standardisation of service provision across NI. The Taskforce will also ensure that service users and carers become partners in the planni ng and delivery of services regionally. 6.6.1(i) Drivers for Change There will be a continuing focus on delivering existing, and any new, Priority for Action Targets. Service improvement activity will be focused on those areas where p erformance is weak or where there is a consensus about the need for whole system reform and modernisation. In particular, attention will concentrate on; \u0083 Consolidation of the stepp ed care model across all mental health services, in particular Tier 2 and the use of funding provided for the Depression Directly Enhanced Service within primary care; \u0083 A 9 week maximum wait time for all mental health services including within Child and Adoles cent Mental Health Services (13 weeks for psychological therapies); \u0083 Continue the process to eliminate hospital delayed discharges; \u0083 Community follow-up within seven days of discharge from; hospital \u0083 Resettlement of the long-s tay hospital population; \u0083 Growth in the development of alternatives to hospital admission; \u0083 Promoting the quality of the i n-patient through the 'Releasing You Leave' scheme; \u0083 Promoting cooperation between T rusts on specific topics of common interest, for example the coordination of access to in-patient resources; \u0083 Maximising the utilisation of existing capacity within community services; \u0083 Support the regional process to scope out the development of peri-natal mental health services; \u0083 Supporting the roll-out of th e Beating the Blues project; \u0083 Overseeing the regional Life Line contract; \u0083 Delivery of local Protect Life Action Plans with priority focus on community support; \u0083 Extension of Deliberate Self Harm registry to Belfast Trust; \u0083 Coordination and quality ass urance of training under 'Protect Life\" & Promoting Mental Health; \u0083 Evaluation of \"One Stop Shops\"; \u0083 Continued implementation of New Strategy Direction for Drugs and Alcohol and substitute schemes; \u0083 Increased awareness of, and signposting to, services for children and young people a ffected by Hidden Harm; \u0083 Development and evaluation of the brief intervention pilot designed to support primary care to undertake screening and brief intervention on alcohol misuse. Production of an effective methodology for training. \u0083 Continue to develop the range of psychological therapies in line with the 2010 strategy and the stepped care approach; 143\u0083 Begin to develop a Personalit y Disorder Service in each Trust to be built on as further funding is available; \u0083 Continue to develop Autistic Spectrum Disorder Services to meet the targets for timely di agnosis and intervention and the Autistic Spectrum Disorder Network Action Plan. 6.6.2 General Context including Indicators of Need/Demand A considerable proportion of the NI population experience problems associated with mental i ll-health, learning and/or physical disability. The direct/in-direct costs associated with mental ill health are estimated to be circa \u00a33 billion in NI. At any one time, 1-in-6 adults will experience a diagnosable mental health problem and a qu arter of all primary care consultations will be associated with mental ill heal th. The Health and Social Care Board will wish to support the efforts of Local Commissioning Groups in developing services em bedded within the primary care and at the interface wi th secondary care. Around 2-3% of the population have a significant learning disability. In comparison to else where levels of mental ill health and disability are relatively high in N I. For example, the NI Survey of People with Activity Limitations and Disabilities (NISRA July 2007: Bulletin 1) indicates that 18% of all people living in private households in Northern Ireland hav e some degree of disability. The prevalence rate for adults is 21% and 6% for children. 6.6.3 Commissioning Priorities 6.6.3(i) Mental Health The promotion of mental health/wellbeing across wider society is a central priority within the Heal th and Social Care Board/Public Health Agency commissioning intentions. The Health and Social Care Board/Public Health Agency are committed to ensuring that key health and wellbeing priorities including early intervention, 144prevention and tackling inequalities are integral to the re-design and delivery of mental health serv ices. There will be significant opportunities to ensure that im proving health and wellbeing is addressed in each of the Bamf ord Implementation Taskforce working groups. A major priority will be promot ing personal development and early interventions that are effective, accessible and person centred, supported with advocacy for the in volvement of clients and carers. Core to this will be working with organisations in the statutory, community and voluntary sectors t hat can provide evidence based services such as build ing resilience, family support and counselling for those in crisis and in need of support. The continued roll out of the Lifeline Contract will be a major investment in terms of ensuring that those in crisis and/or their carers have immediate support when they require it. Other priority areas will include developing regional co-ordina tion and quality standards for training, taking forward the reco mmendations from the Health Committee Inquiry into the Prevention of Suicide and Self Harm, and joint working to provide bette r services to meet people's needs. Therefore, local 'Protect Life' and Mental Health Promotion Strategy Action Plans will continue to be supported with existing investment levels during 2010/11. Mental Health promotion, prevention and earlier identification mu st be better reflected within front line mental health services . Trusts should therefore ensure these themes are fully incorporated as key objectives within all service development proposals. The continuing increase in Extra Contractual Referrals to specialist services outside Northern Irel and is not sustainable from a financial perspective. A more robust regional approach will be established to assist in the reduction of Extra Contractual Referrals. Clinicians, professionals and managers within Trusts should work collectively together in the context of this regional approach to deliver a significant reduction in Extra Contractual Referrals costs during 2010/2011. Fa ilure to achieve this objective will curtail the release of fundi ng to Trusts for planned new mental health services outlined within th is Commissioning Plan. In the first instance an agreed regional process involving Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency staff will be identified to oversee all proposed Extra Cont ractual Referrals. The Health 145and Social Care Board/Public Health Agency will take this forward in partnership with Trusts wi th a view to introducing a new regionally agreed process to be in place by end September 2010. The Health and Social Care Board expects Trusts to work in partnership with their respecti ve Local Commissioning Groups and the wider range of primary care st akeholders, to develop the Stepped Care model. Models should better reflect the provision of specific primary care mental health services (ie. Level 1/2 service provision as per the Stepped Care Model). The Health and Social Care B oard/Public Health Agency will support Trusts to develop and stan dardise the provision of Crisis Response/Home Treatment services in order to reduce variation between the models and reduce the n eed for inpatient care. This work will take into considerati on the regional princ iples (published January 2010) which are intended to guide the provision of services to people at risk of suicide or serious self harm. Efforts will be made to strengt hen specialist services. New 'Regional Networks' will be es tablished to oversee the development of Personality Di sorder and Forensic Services. These will be established as an integral part of the Bamford Implementation Taskforce. The development of Eating Disorders services should continue in accordance with the regional specification ag reed in 2009. Through the existing regional Child an d Adolescent Mental Health Services group efforts will cont inue to reform and modernise services in each Trust area duri ng 2010/11. Local Drug and Alcohol Co-ordination Teams action plans for the new Strategic Direction for Alcohol and Drugs , the Addressing Young People's Drinking Action Plan and the Hidden Harm Action Plan will be rolled forward. Trusts should co ntinue to implement and support the delivery of specialist subst ance misuse services including partnership working with key serv ice providers in the independent / voluntary sectors. Trusts should maintain progress towards existing 'resettlement' plans ie. from 2008/09 & 2009/10 baselines, in terms of the resettlement of mental health clie nts from long stay hospital based facilities. The Health and Social Care Board will al so lead a review of acute psychiatric inpatient services to determine how these 146services should be configured to most effectively meet the needs of users across the region. 6.6.3(ii) Learning Disability The main focus for service de livery and modernisation in 2010- 2011 will be to continue to promote inclusion and independence for people with Learning Disability in line with \"Equal Lives\". This will be done by further dev elopment and improvement of services to people with a Learning Disability. The services must better support people with a Learning Disability to be able to enjoy housing, training, further educat ion and employment opportunities which all citizens benefit from. Key to succeeding in this aim is adequate support for parents and carers which recognises that the ma jority of people in N.I. with a Learning Disability live with family members. All service plans and improve ments must be underpinned by a greater focus during 2010/2011 on recognising and meeting the physical and mental health care nee ds of people with a Learning Disability. In this regard the full implementation by Trusts of the Directed Enhanced Service for Learning Disability during 2010/2011 is necessary. Equally as important as specific health screening activity through the Directed Enhanced Service w ill be the involvement of people with a Learning Disability in a ll of the other physical and mental health promotion activities of Trus ts aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of the general population. New in-patient assessment and treatment servic es for children and young people from Belfast, South Eastern, Nort hern and Southern Trusts will be operational during 2010/11 at the Iveagh Unit in Belfast. Both the long term resettlem ent and the delayed discharge populations will be reduced in line with the target for 2010/2011 and help progress towards the 201 3 target that no one with a Learning Disability should remain unnecessarily in hospital. The continued growth in the numbers of children with complex needs alongside their Learning Dis ability will need to be met by 147improvements in the transiti on experienced by young people moving to adult services. Key to this will be renewed efforts by Trusts to rev iew day support services both in day care setting s and in integrated community activities. Additional improvement s in services for children and young people with a Learning Disability who have communication difficulties should be delivered by Trusts. Trusts should ensure progress is ac hieved against the priorities identified in the Regional Auti sm Spectrum Disorder Action Plan and Priorities for Action. This necessitates that Trusts should develop service capacity across Ch ild health, Mental Health and Disability Services and encom passes the child, adolescent and adult age range. A key requirement is to standardise the care pathway for children and adults acro ss Child Health, Mental Health and Disability services. Trusts must evidence that individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorder are considered within a person centred framework and not restricted by specific criteria which risk excluding individuals from acce ss to services. The Health and Social Care Board and Public Health Agency will continue to lead reform and modernisation thr ough the Autism Taskforce. 6.6.3(iii) Physical Disab In 2010/2011 the priority for the Physical Disability/Sensory Impairment Programme will be to continue to address specific Priorities for Action 2010/2011 tar gets, to implement the Regional Review Implementation Plans for Acquired Brain Injury and for Wheelchair Services and to seek to address a num ber of other key areas of need. These include the requirement to consolidate the baseline resource position of t he Regional Prosthetics service and the Wheelchair service. Critic al to ensuring the appropriate placement of people with severe brain injury following treatment and rehabilitation is the developm ent of suitable long term care options and reduction in the need f or Extra Contractual Referrals. This will also improve the operati on of the existing care pathway for this client group, releasi ng treatment and rehabilitation placement currently affected by prolonged discharge delays. Sensory impairment services will benefit from the intention to complete the implementation of the Challenge and Change inspection report recommendations, to implement the NI 148contribution to the UK Vision St rategy 2009-2012 and to procure a regional communication support service for people who are deaf/hard of hearing to ensure equity of provision across NI. The Trusts will be expected to ta ke forward these priorities whilst also addressing the need to promote strongly the take up of Direct Payments, to take account of, and respond to the nee ds of carers, and to engage effectively with service users throughout. Thalidomide: Commissioners and Trusts should also take forward the provision of any assessment required in allocating the additional support for Thalidom ide survivors generated by the provision of an extra \u00a31.1m, to be made available by the DHSSPS to the Thalidomide Trust over the next three years. 6.6.4 Priorities for Action - Standards and Targets 2010 The limited availability of Com prehensive Spending Review year 3 funding allocation will constrai n the scale and momentum of service developments and limit the ability to deliver the Priorities for Action targets. The specific standards and target s for Mental Health, Learning Disability and Physical/Sensory Impairment programmes are: \u0083 Reducing the harm related to Alcohol and Drug Misuse (linked to PSA 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7): by March 2012, reduce to 29% the proportion of adults who binge drink, reduce to 27% the proportion of young people who report getting drunk, and reduce to 5.5% the proportion of young people taking illegal drugs. Consistent with the achievement of these outco mes, the Public Health Agency should from April 2010 further develop and evaluate the brief intervention pilot designed to support primary care to undertake screening and brief intervention on alcohol misuse. By December 2010, the Public Health Agency sh ould produce an effective training methodology and determine the feasibility of rolling this out across GP practices. And, from April 2010 the Public Health Agency in partnership with the Health and Social Care Board should, through the 149implementation of the joint Hidden Harm Action Plan, increase awareness of relevant services and ensure that more young people affected by parental substance misuse are effectively signpo sted to existing services. \u0083 Suicide (linked to PSA 1.8) : by March 2012, ensure that the suicide rate is reduced below 14.5 deaths per 100,000. Consistent with the achievement of this outcome, by September 2010 th e Public Health Public Health Agency should ensure that a Deliberate Self Harm Registry pilot is established in the Belfast HSC Trust, and a first draft report produced by March 2011. By September 2010, the Public Health Agency should produce an action plan to implement recommendations arising from Mental Health Promotion / Suicide Prevention Training in Northern Ireland . \u0083 Mental Wellbeing (linked to PSA 1.8): by March 2011, the Public Health Public Health Agency should produce an action plan to take forward the relevant regional and local elements contained within the Mental Health and Wellbeing Promotion Strategy. \u0083 Unplanned admissions (PSA 6.1): by March 2011, the HSC Health and Social Ca re Board and Trusts should take steps to reduce the number of admissions to acute mental health hospitals by 10% \u0083 Assessment and treatment (PSA 6.3): from April 2010, the HSC Health and Social Care Board and Trust should ensure no patient waits longer than 9 weeks from referral to assessment and commencement of treatment for mental health issu es with the exception of psychological therapies for which no patient should wait longer than 13 weeks. \u0083 Card before you leave: from April 2010, the HSC Health and Social Care Board and Tr usts should ensure that all adults and children who self harm and present for assessment at A&E are offered a follow-up appointment with appropriate mental health services within 24 hours. 150\u0083 Resettlement of Learning Di sability patients (PSA 6.4): by March 2011, the HSC Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should resettle 120 long stay patients from Learning Disability hospitals to appropriate places in the community compared to the March 2006 total. (Note: PSA target 6.2 for the resettl ement of mental health patients has alread y been achieved.) \u0083 Discharge (both mental health and those with a learning or physical/sensory disability): from April 2010, the HSC Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should ensure that 75% of patients admitted for assessment and treatment are discharged within seven days of the decision to discharge, with all other patients being discharged within a maximum of 90 days. All mental health patients discharged from hospital who are to receive a continuing care plan in the community should receive a follow-up visit with in seven days of discharge. \u0083 Eating Disorders: further enhancement of a regional approach to eating disorder services recognising the need for specialist provision, and at least a 10% reduction in extra contractual referrals \u0083 Respite - Learning Disability (PSA 6.7): during 2010/11, the HSC Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should improve access to respite care through innovative approaches and service redesign, providing at least 125 additional dementia respite packages by March 2011 compared to the March 2008 total. Learning disability resp ite services will be commissioned across Trusts to achieve t he target of an additional 125 packages by 31 st March 2011 when compared to the 31st March 2008 baseline. These se rvices will be composed of residential, domiciliary and host family schemes. \u0083 Respite - dementia: during 2010/11 the HSC Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should improve access to respite care through innovative approaches and service redesign, providing at least 1,200 additional dementia 151respite places by March 2011 compared to the March 2008 total. The PFA 2010/11 target rem ains at the level set in PFA 2009/10 . The Health and Social Board is currently working with Trusts to finalise agreed def initions of respite and refine performance reporting to ensure achi evement of this target in 2010/11. Trusts invested the additional allocation for this purpose in 2009/10 to progress to wards the required level of provision by March 2010 and work will continue in 2010/11 to maximise the delivery of de mentia respite within the resources available, and in t he context of the forthcoming Regional Dementia Strategy. \u0083 Respite - physical/senso ry disability (PSA 6.5): during 2010/11, the HSC Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should improve access to respite care through innovative approaches and service redesign, providing at least 110 additional resp ite packages by March 2011 compared to the March 2008 total. The PFA 2010/11 target was uplifted by 10 packages over and above the PFA 2009/10 leve l.The Board is currently working with Trusts to finalis e agreed definitions of respite and refine performance reporting to ensure achievement of this target in 2010/11 .Trusts invested the additional allocation for this purpose in 2009/10 to progress towards the required level of provision by March 2010 and work will continue in 2010/11 to maximise the delivery of physical disability respite within the resources available through a range of approaches including partnership with the independent sector and the promot ion of Direct Payments . \u0083 Wheelchairs (PSA 6.6): by March 2011, the HSC Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should ensure a 13-week maximum waiting time for of all wheelchairs, including specialised wheelchairs. \u0083 Housing adaptations: from April 2010, the HSC Health and Social Care Board and Tr usts should ensure all lifts and ceiling track hoists are insta lled within 22 weeks of 152the OT assessment and option appraisal as appropriate, and all urgent minor h ousing adaptations to be completed within 10 working days. The Health and Social Care Board continue to monitor Trust performance against this target. The Health and Social Care Board the Public Health Agency are currently working closely with Trusts and DHSSPS on a regional group to review provision of housing adaptations in Northern Irealand. This work represents the Health and Social Care element of the wider Inter-Departmental Review of Housing Adaptations. The timescales for reporting recommendations is Autumn 2010. The outcome of this work will have implications for the future response to the PfA target. \u0083 Autism: from April 2010, the PHA, HSC Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should continue to progress the ASD action plan, ensuring that all children wait no longer than 13 weeks for assessment following referral and a further 13 weeks for commencement of specialised intervention. \u0083 Acquired Brain Injury: from April 2010, the HSC Health and Social Care Board and Trusts should ensure a 13 week maximum waiting time from referral to assessment and commencement of specialised treatment. \u0083 Domestic violence: during 2010/11, each Trust should ensure that appropriate social services staff has participated in at least 95% fo r the Multi-Public Health Agency Risk Assessment Con ferences (MARAC) held in their area during the year. 6.6.5 Outcome Measures and /or Other Indicators of Success While performance will be monitored in respect of the key Priorities for Action target areas, the Bamford Mental Health/Learning Disability Implementation Taskfor ce will develop a range of key indicators to determine wider progress towards achieving the Bamford vision. This will include not only indicators of service provision but also health and wellbeing focused targets and 153benchmarks. The Health and Soci al Care Board will maximise the potential of the Mental Health and Learning Disability Minimum Dataset to better inform all partners in a benchmarking and activity monitoring process. In respect of the Physical Disabilit y/Sensory Impairment Priorities for Action targets for 2010/11, the Health and Social Care Board will continue to monitor performance specifically in respect of waiting time for wheelchairs, housing adaptations, respite and acquired brain injury. In addition, the implementation pl ans associated with the regional reviews of wheelchair services and acquired brain injury have clear outcomes and milestones and work will continue throughout 2010/11, in partnership with Trus ts, service users and relevant independent sector agencies to achieve progress against these. It is expected that the forthcom ing Regional Strategy for People with Physical Disabilities and Sens ory Impairment will identify clear indicators of success across a bro ad range of areas of need, which will be incorporated into future commissioning intentions. 6.6.6 Commissioning Intentions and Associated Funds The 2010/11 proposed service inve stments are summarised in the tables below: 1542010/11 Proposed Service Development Investments in Mental Health Programme of Care Total Investment SHSCT: Resettlement of 12 patients from St Lukes which were due to be resettled in 2009/10 in advance of 2010/11 funding. 0.274 0.200 0.200 BHSCT : Costs of resettling MH patients from hospital that took place in 08/09 & 09/10 (\u00a3147k SEHSCT : Additional funding to enable the resettling of 16 patients from Downshire hospital.

However, as already noted, the emphasis for at least the short-to-medium term must be upon the reform/modernisation of existing serv ice infrastructure. While arguments may be placed regarding the relative under-resourcing of mental health/disability servic es compared to elsewhere, it is incumbent upon all stakeholders to pro-actively evidence added productivity and service improvem ent within existing resources. 156The Health and Social Care Board expects Trusts to continue the process of reform and modernisation of services to achieve efficiencies in process and streamline systems, for example, the LEAN methodology work on wheelchai r services. There will also be a continued focus on improving care pathways for specific conditions to enhance the quality of care for patient s and clients, for example, within Child and A dolescent Mental Health Service and psychological therapies. T he use of pers onalised budgets and Direct Payments will also be a priority. In addition to financial constraints, the availability of highly skilled practitioners, in particular, to work within relatively more complex areas of service provision is an ongoing challenge. Workforce plans will need to be developed fo r services, taking into account the recommendations of the W orkforce Report commissioned by the DHSSPS. 157Priority Area 7: Effective Use of Resources 1586.7.1 Commissioning Themes 6.7.1(i) Productivity and Efficiency The current financial context will require all organisations to transform their services, embedding a culture of prevention, earlier intervention and service ref orm and improvement to meet increasing population needs and demands and the expectations of local communities. Service users and their carers are increasingly well informed and expect modern, fit for purpose and evidence based care. They have a growing expectation that the services commissioned will result in maximum health gain for the resources deployed. Increasing throughput, streamlin ing patient and client care pathways, minimising delay and focusing on safety are some of the ways to improve quality of care and a more efficient and productive health and care service. Value for money and improved outcomes are not competing alternatives - they are one and the same thing. The improvements in outcome measurem ent and the associated ability to measure productivity are vi tal instruments for improving performance in Health and Soci al Care, expressed by better preventative measures and the prov ision of improved quality of care. Services should be assesse d in terms of t he outcomes they achieve from the resources availa ble. The achievement of better outcomes is the dominant conside ration in assessing effectiveness and efficiency. While steady improvements in efficiency and productivity have been made by Trusts in recent years, there still remains significant scope to secure further gains. F or example, audits carried out across Unscheduled Care during 2007/08 have sh own that of the 4362 patients audited, 42% of unscheduled admissions did not require an acute hospital bed on the post admission day, and of the 58% of patients who were approp riately placed, a proportion of these could have had a reduc ed length of stay. Further implementation of the Unschedul ed Care/Elective Reform Programme and the recommendations from the Rolling Audit and Improvement Programme will help to address these and other issues. Similarly, full implementation of the Integrated Elective Access Protocol and the recommendat ions from Elective Pathway 159Review visits will assist Trusts to secure further efficiencies in the elective pathway and deliver improved services for patients. The continuing development of home treatment services will enable Trusts to reduce their reliance on ho spital based treatment options, and the application of the service principles contained in the Choice and Partnership Approach w ill further enhance the capacity of community mental health serv ices. The 'Releasing Time to Care' project will improve patient experience by increasing the availability of therapeut ic interventions by trained nursing staff. 6.7.1(ii) Measuring Outcomes In order to demonstrate improved outcomes, the Health and Social Care Board will require service prov iders to develop, collect and report on outcome measures for a ll services. For example: \u0083 agreed elective surgery procedures; rates to acute psychiatric care; \u0083 child protection and fa mily support services; \u0083 waiting times for all services; \u0083 patient and client satisfac tion with the care received. The Health and Social Care Board will work with Trusts to develop a better understanding of the relat ive costs and benefits of local and regional services to help targe t expenditure most effectively, reduce unnecessary cost s and drive improvements in productivity. 6.7.1(iii) Agreeing a Framework for Delivery The Health and Social Care Board w ill work in partnership with Trusts to develop and agree accurate Service and Budget Agreement service volumes across a ll service areas and these will be closely monitored to ensure agree d productivity is delivered and 160to identify early deviation fr om these to enable appropriate corrective action. The Health and Social Care Board will support Trusts to improve the productivity and quality gains in care outside hospital by reviewing and rationalising the estate and effectively harnessing technology. 6.7.1(iv) Information and Comm unications Technology (ICT) Information and Communications Technology has a major role to play in supporting service deliver y and improving productivity and efficiency. The regional In formation and Communications Technology strategy aspires to havi ng a person centred electronic care record for every citizen and to ensure that Information and Communications Technology is e ffectively used to facilitate communication between care professi onals. If information is to be communicated and shared elec tronically, it must be recorded electronically. There is a range of new Information and Communications Technology syst ems at implementation stage and others at the planning stage. Existing systems such as Patient Administrative System and SOSCARE could be more effectively used and the Health and Social Care Board will assist Trusts in identifying areas where improved use of such systems could improve effectiveness. Data quality and the timelessness of recording data on Informatio n and Communications Technology systems must be improved. The H ealth and Social Care Board will support initiatives that improv e the use of Information and Communications Technology sy stems and the quality of data recorded in them. The Health and Social Care Board fully supports additional investment in Information and Communications Technology, however the scope for future increases in the level of investment is limited so new investment must be carefully targeted. This will require an increased focus on benefit s identification and benefits realisation. The major areas current ly targeted for investment over the next few years are:- \u0083 New integrated Information and Communications Technology systems supporting Social Care, Mental Health, Children's and Community Services; 161\u0083 Improved systems in the Primary Care area, particularly in those areas that improve comm unication across the interface between Primary Care and Secondary Care; \u0083 Information and Communications Technology improvements in specific areas of Acute Care; \u0083 A Health and Social Care wide Electronic Care Record system; \u0083 Information and Communications Technology support to improve general administration and support activities; \u0083 Trust Information and Communications Technology infrastructure modernisation. 6.7.1(v) Management Info rmation and Analysis It is vital that there is a regular flow of rich, timely and quality management information and analy sis to support the drive for greater productivity and efficiency. To date much work has been carried out between the Health and Social Care Board and the Business Services Organisation on developing a greater and more timely flow of data from core Health and Social Care information systems such as Patient Admini strative System, SOSCARE, Mental Health and Learning Dis ability systems, and latterly the Theatre Management System. This data is accessed via the regional data warehouse a nd is the primary sourc e for much of the required productivity and efficiency analysis. However in parallel with these developments, there needs to be an equal focus on data quality improvement, covering: \u0083 A much greater focus on administrative and clerical processes to produce higher quality and more timely data inputs into these core operational systems; \u0083 Richer and more timely coding; and \u0083 Greater standardisation of how these systems are used across the Health and Social C are e.g. Patient Administrative System Technical Guidance. 162This work is vital in order to produ ce better quality source data and needs to be driven by the inform ation and service improvement elements within the Health and Social Care Board working together with Trust colleagues. 6.7.2 PFA Targets PFA Target: Hospital productivity Each Trust should achieve a 3% improvement in hospital productivity, from its 2006-07 base year, for each year over the CSR period. PFA Target: Daycase rate Each Trust should secure improvements in daycase rates for a defined range of procedures in accordance with Departmental targets for March 2011. PFA Target: Pre-operative length of stay Each Trust should secure reductions in average pre-operative length of stay in accordance wi th Departmental targets for March 2011. PFA Target: Cancelled operations From April 2010, all surgical patients should have appropriate pre-operative assessment, and no more than 2% of operations should be cancelled for non-clinical reasons. Service redesign, based on a m ore sophisticated understanding of capacity is a key component of the reform and modernisation agenda and the Health and Soci al Care Board will continue to work closely with local Trusts, to progress this work in 2010/11. In particular Trusts will be expected to focus on the following key areas: \u0083 Reduced length of stay - Trus ts should review and improve admission and discharge processes, and be able to evidence a reduction in the average number of bed days patients spend in hospital settings; 163\u0083 Pathways of Care - Trusts s hould deliver effective integrated pathways of care that reduc e unnecessary steps in the process, improve the patient and client experience and lead to better outcomes; \u0083 Care in the right place - Trusts should demonstrate a commitment to intervening earlie r in the patient and client pathway that reduces ina ppropriate demand for beds and other care packages. This should include a focus on delayed discharges, early and sa fe discharge to community care and a more focused approac h to the management of specialist services including referrals to services outside Northern Ireland; \u0083 Implementing evidence - There is evidence from local audits that further efficiencies c an be gained through streamlining the patient pathway. Trusts have been asked to produce Unscheduled Care Action Plans to identify how they will implement recommendations fo llowing recent audits, and monitoring and support to T rusts will be embedded in the Health and Social Care B oard's work plan for emergency care during 2010/11; \u0083 Clinical decision-making and engagement - Trusts should demonstrate that they have systems in place to provide effective access to appropriate clinical opinions to facilitate good patient flows and that Clin icians are fully involved in service improvement processes; \u0083 New to review ratios - Trusts should benchmark ratios with high performing services el sewhere and should ensure that all review appointments are clinically appropriate. Consideration should be given to developing new ways of working and alternative models of service delivery; \u0083 Day surgery, treatment and c are - Trusts should work, in partnership with primary care and others, to increase the range and volume of procedures and services that are carried out without the need f or unnecessary overnight stays; \u0083 Short stay surgery and early di scharge - Trusts should work to reduce post operative leng th of stay by improving discharge processes and identifyin g suitable short stay beds 164(i.e. 24hrs stay beds) for elec tive procedures. They should also seek to better integrate co mmunity services that can in- reach to hospital care and promote earlier discharge; \u0083 Day of admission surgery - T rusts should put in place protocols to ensure that admissi on on the day of surgery is the default position for all clinically appropriate patients; \u0083 Cancelled Operations: Trusts will put in place protocols to ensure that all patients will have appropriate pre operative assessment and ensure that no more than 2% of operations will be cancelled for non clinical reasons; \u0083 Theatre utilisation - Trusts s hould produce consultant level data detailing theatre utilisation rates and use this data to benchmark against peer groups; \u0083 Did Not Attends - Trusts should continue to monitor Did Not Attends across all services and establish the causes for the non-attendance, and develop plans to address these; \u0083 Can Not Attends - Trusts shoul d monitor the level of both clinical and non-clinical cance llations across all services. Trusts should ensure that th eir booking process complies with IEAP guidance; \u0083 Service Provision - Trusts wi ll need to be cognisant of the Effective Use of Resources Re view and the potential impact on service provision. Consideration should be given to reviewing the clinical benefit and rationale for undertaking certain surgical procedures. These should not be regarded as se parate projects but as means to work with clinical teams to modernise and review the complete care pathway. It is important t hat Clinicians see and understand the benefits of measuring outcomes in their day to day work, and this should be linked to the principl es of good clinical practice. The Health and Social Care Board will adopt a whole systems approach and will work with Trus ts to ensure that proposed productivity and demand managem ent changes are balanced across the region. 165Underpinning all these processes is the need for org anisations to engage with their staff and their representatives to inspire, motivate and engage them in taking forward these service improvements. PFA Target: Absenteeism Each Trust should reduce its le vel of absenteeism to no more than 5.2% in the year to March 2011. The need to ensure an effective productive workforce within a changing healthcare environment will require a clear workforce strategy which will include the use of more effective workforce planning techniques. In the past workforce planning has tended to be based around a centralised model focusing on the development of the commissioning of training pl aces in the education sector. There has been recent investment in Human Resources, Nursing and Allied Health Professions ca pacity to undertake Strategic Workforce Planning using the \"Six Step Model\" developed by Skills for Health and the National Workforce Project. This model can be effectively used in both local service delivery planning but also at a Commission ing level. The forthcoming financial challenges provide a stim ulus for greater levels of cooperation and collaboration betwe en workforce planners both at Trust and Commissioning level to identify the workforce implications of the changes that are required of t he workforce not only on dealing with commissioning intentions but also the productivity agenda. An important tool in ensuring more effective planning is access to meaningf ul performance information. The engagement of the Trust work force planning network in a prioritised plan of work will be an important step in developing workforce plans in a manner whic h will enable the development of a workforce that can be deployed both numerically and with appropriate skills to provide sa fe and effective healthcare. PFA Target: Staff health and wellbeing All HSC organisations should put in place organisational health and wellbeing strategies including being pro-active in improving the quality of and speeding up access to occupational health services, and strengthen Health and 166Social Care Board accountabilit y for the management of sickness and absence. Work is underway not only in some Trusts but also in Review of Public Administration Phase 2 organisations to ensure the development of a strategic approa ch to improving the health and wellbeing of the workforce. T he importance of ensuring the health and wellbeing through the optimu m use of people and other resources is an important hu man resource approach at a time when the workforce is being a sked to improve productivity and potential responding to an increasi ng patient and client safety agenda. This will have to address the issues of the effective deployment of resources, skill mi x reviews and the need to ensure access targets are achieved. 167 SCHEDULES 168 Health and Social Care Board Commissioning Plan FP1 PLANNED INCOME AND EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS 2010/11 Income/Expenditure 70,418 68,097 3,653,247 3,627,489 3,559,392 70,418 68,097 3,653,247 3,627,489 RECURRING COMMITMENTS Agency 34,942 34,440 11425 11424 5.3 LCGs 0 0 5.4 other 0 0 6.0 Patient & Client Council 0 0 7.0 FHS 655,390 655,390 1615 Elective Other expenditure: (specify) 0 9.1 CSR bridging 30,000 0 30,000 9.2 AFC/Incremental drift 0 0 RECURRING COMMITMENTS 3,582,829 3,559,392 70,418 68,097 3,653,247 3,627,489 16910.0 SURPLUS / (DEFICIT) 0 0 0 0 0 0 Commissioning Plan RECURRING EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS BY LCG AND TRUST- HSCB FP2 Belfast Northern Southern South Eastern Western NIAS other Total IYE IYE IYE IYE IYE IYE and each LCG must reconcile to lines 3 and 4.1 to 4.5 of FP1 170 Commissioning Plan RECURRING EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS BY LCG AND TRUST- HSCB FP2 Belfast and each LCG must reconcile to lines 3 and 4.1 to 4.5 of FP1 171 Commissioning Plan RECURRING EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS BY LCG AND TRUST- PHA FP2 Belfast Northern Southern South Eastern Western NIAS other Total IYE IYE IYE IYE IYE IYE 7527 9230 Northern LCG 210 3145 892 0 0 0 6374 10621 Southern LCG 156 36 2437 0 0 0 5006 7635 South Eastern LCG 782 34 0 477 0 0 5822 7115 Western LCG 148 32 626 0 2178 0 5320 8304 Direct Commissioning 5457 for Board and each LCG must reconcile to lines 3 and 4.1 to 4.5 of FP1 172 Commissioning Plan RECURRING EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS BY LCG AND TRUST- PHA FP2 Belfast Northern 7081 8784 Northern LCG 210 3145 892 0 0 0 5864 10111 Southern LCG 156 36 2437 0 0 0 4599 7228 South Eastern LCG 782 34 0 477 0 0 5444 6737 Western LCG 148 32 626 0 2178 for Board and each LCG must reconcile to lines 3 and 4.1 to 4.5 of FP1 173 ALLOCATION OF FU NDING FOR PAY AND OT HER COSTS (FYE) FP3 (a) Name of LCG: All LCGS \u00a3'000 Belfast Northern Southern South Eastern Western NIAS Other TOTAL Pay pressures FOR PAY AND OT HER COSTS (FYE) FP3 (a) Name of LCG: Belfast LCG \u00a3'000 Belfast Northern Southern South Eastern Western NIAS Other TOTAL Pay pressures (line 229) 10690 19 3 833 2 214 2154 13915 Non-pay (line 233) 2990 5 1 239 1 63 230 3529 SCAPE (line 241) 6623 13 3 481 3 160 133 7416 Children & Young People (line 242) 2940 2940 TOTAL 23243 37 7 1553 6 437 2517 27800 175 ALLOCATION OF FU NDING FOR PAY AND OT HER COSTS (FYE) FP3 (a) Name of LCG: South Eastern LCG \u00a3'000 Belfast Northern Southern South Eastern Western NIAS Other TOTAL Pay pressures (line 229) 2464 16 26 6697 1 172 1704 11080 Non-pay (line 233) 695 4 6 1940 0 50 165 2860 SCAPE (line 241) 1491 14 26 3747 0 135 114 5527 Children & Young People (line 242) 2998 2998 TOTAL 4650 34 58 15382 1 357 1983 22465 ALLOCATION OF FU NDING FOR PAY AND OT HER COSTS (FYE) FP3 (a) Name of LCG: N o r t h e r n L C G \u00a3'000 Belfast Northern Southern South Eastern Western NIAS Other TOTAL Pay pressures (line 229) 2618 9452 2755 192 3854 SCAPE (line 241) 1564 5781 37 61 65 182 153 7843 Children & Young People (line 242) 3987 3987 TOTAL 4923 21975 117 207 228 516 2565 30531 176 ALLOCATION OF FU NDING FOR PAY AND OT HER COSTS (FYE) FP3 (a) Name of LCG: Southern LCG \u00a3'000 Belfast Northern Southern South Eastern Western NIAS Other TOTAL Pay pressures (line 229) 1375 9 8162 184 63 187 1754 11734 Non-pay (line 233) 386 3 2417 53 18 54 146 3077 SCAPE (line 241) 844 5 4798 104 42 145 123 6061 Children & Young People (line 242) 3063 3063 TOTAL 2605 17 18440 341 123 386 2023 23935 ALLOCATION OF FU NDING FOR PAY AND OT HER COSTS (FYE) FP3 (a) Name of LCG: Western LCG \u00a3'000 Belfast Northern Southern South Eastern Western NIAS Other TOTAL Pay pressures (line 229) 774 27 25 40 7696 208 1800 10570 Non-pay (line 233) 221 7 7 12 2244 65 217 2773 SCAPE (line 241) 449 20 21 22 4623 129 107 5371 Children & Young People (line 242) 2610 2610 TOTAL 1444 54 53 74 17173 402 2124 21324 177 ALLOCATION OF FUNDING FOR SERVICE AND SERVICE DEVELOPM ENTS (FYE) FP3(b) Name of LCG: All LCGS \u00a3'000 Belfast Northern Southern South Eastern Western NIAS Other TOTAL Mental Health 590 577 599 615 352 0 74 2807 Learning Disability 701 505 262 556 1061 0 0 3085 Stroke 0 0 0 0 0 0 1751 1751 Acute (incl renal) 130 0 0 0 0 0 0 130 Children with complex needs 21 24 70 18 17 0 0 150 Children 272 65 52 168 46 0 666 1269 Physical Disability 259 296 236 219 209 0 0 1219 Long-term Conditions -
