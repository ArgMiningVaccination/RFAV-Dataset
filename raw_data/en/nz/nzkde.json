Who are the unvaccinated and why are they choosing not to get a COVID vaccine? According to the U.S. Census Bureau's newest phase of the experimental [Household Pulse Survey (HPS)](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html), those who were unvaccinated against COVID in early December 2021, reported a variety of reasons why. \"Vaccinated\" here refers to adults who have received at least one dose of any COVID vaccine, and \"unvaccinated\" refers to adults who have not received any. Unvaccinated adults who responded to the survey could select more than one reason: The findings are based on the first data from Phase 3.3 of the HPS. These data were collected Dec. 1-Dec. 13 and released last week. HPS Phase 3.3 is the latest update to the Census Bureau's experimental data collection effort to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on U.S. households. The new version of the questionnaire is set to continue into February 2022. For adults 18 and over, a previous question about plans for receiving all required COVID-19 vaccinations was replaced with one focused on the specific number of vaccinations received. There is also a new question about vaccine brands. Adults who had not received any doses of the COVID vaccine differed from those who had received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine across several measures. The share of unvaccinated non-Hispanic White adults was not different from the share who were vaccinated. The same was true for Hispanic adults. But non-Hispanic Black adults were slightly more represented among the unvaccinated (13%) than the vaccinated (11%), a small but statistically significant difference. There were notable differences for the Asian population, however: 6% of the vaccinated were non-Hispanic Asian but only 1% of the unvaccinated were non-Hispanic Asian. Most of the HPS response options are either about information (\"Don't know if it will protect me\") or trust (\"Don't trust the vaccine\"). However, one involves access: \"It's hard for me to get a COVID-19 vaccine.\" Who are the people in the small subset of adults who responded to the HPS who reported that they had not gotten a vaccine because it was hard to get? Compared to all HPS respondents, the hard-to-reach: Approximately 1,044,000 housing units were selected from the sampling frame for this HPS collection period, and approximately 61,000 respondents answered the online questionnaire. Their responses were the basis of this analysis. The Household Pulse Survey was launched in April 2020, to quickly and efficiently gauge the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on households. Over the course of 40 collection cycles, HPS data were disseminated in near-real time to inform federal and state response and recovery planning. The data collected enabled the Census Bureau to produce statistics at the national and state level and for the 15 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas. More information is available on these HPS pages: [Household Pulse microdata](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html). developed with input from our [federal agency partners](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html), continues to measure core demographic household characteristics as well as ask about employment, household spending, food sufficiency, housing security and physical and mental health, and includes a variety of new and adjusted content. In addition to continuing to ask adults and households with children ages 12-17 about COVID-19 vaccinations and vaccine hesitancy, the survey now asks the same questions for households with children ages 5-11. Two questions on transportation have returned from previous phases: one about travel before the COVID-19 pandemic began and another about travel in the previous seven days. A series of questions about unemployment insurance benefits have also been restored. To reduce respondent burden, the Census Bureau removed a series of questions about summer educational activities for households with children. The HPS is sent to about a million households every two weeks. If selected, you will receive an email from COVID.survey@census.gov or a text message from 39242. Additional information is available on the [HPS respondent website](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html). Although previous phases of the survey collected and disseminated data every two weeks, Phase 3.3 has shifted to a two-weeks-on, two-weeks-off collection and dissemination approach, with the following anticipated collection periods and data releases: In addition to updated detailed tables, upcoming HPS releases will include refreshes to the interactive data tool. The COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker, which focused on the number of U.S. adults receiving at least one-dose of a COVID-vaccine and attitudes toward the vaccines, was discontinued following Phase 3.2 of the survey. The tracker was published from April 14-Oct. 20, 2021, and data users can continue to access an archived version of the visualization on the [HPS Research and Presentations page](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/research-presentations.html) or via the "}
