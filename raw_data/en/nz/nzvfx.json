It synergistically combines the philosophies of Anthroposophy, Chinese Medicine, and homeopathy to produce highly effective, healing remedies. The remedies called Unda Numbers, are plant and mineral based preparations that increase the natural ability of your cells, tissues, and organs to excrete toxins that may inhibit healthy function and contribute to chronic disease. Drainage is an elegant and deep acting way to rebalance, heal, and restore the body. The remedies are safe, non-toxic, will not interfere with other medications, and have a gentle yet deep acting effect. How does your body rid itself of toxins?Your body excretes toxins through organs called primary emunctories; that is, through specific organs that release waste products. Our primary organs of elimination are the bowels, kidneys, lungs, and skin and remove toxins though bowel movements, urination, breathing out toxic carbon dioxide, and sweating. Two additional primary emunctories that are commonly overlooked are the liver and the emotions. The liver converts toxic substances into non-toxic ones so they can be released by the body. If the liver is compromised, that process can become inefficient and toxins interfere with health. The other often overlooked emunctory is our emotions. If we have built up emotional toxins, they too can accumulate and interfere with our well-being. If the primary emunctories become inefficient or blocked, the body wisely tries to release toxins through different routes called secondary emunctories. Secondary emuctories are less efficient and include the mucous membranes, musculoskeletal system, skin and mental/emotional. Symptoms such as chronic sinus/vaginal infections/BPH, joint/muscle pain, skin rashes and infections or depression/anxiety can be signs that the primary emunctories are compromised and that the body is diverting toxic debris to the secondary routes of elimination; the secondary emunctories. The accumulation of toxins in the body can be a factor in acute and chronic illness, genetic weaknesses, and chronic disease as well as creating blockages to therapeutic treatment. Once the emunctories are supported, gentle elimination of toxins follows. Then, other therapeutics are utilized to help you achieve and maintain an optimum level of health. In addition to opening the emunctories, Biotherapeutic Drainage is also effective at balancing cell and organ function. This is particularly important for individuals with mold illness, chronically elevated viral loads, and Lyme patients because the fungus, virus and/or bacteria can inhibit intracellular processes that fight them off. This is one of the ways they are able to sustain themselves in the human body. Biotherapeutic drainage can activate enzymes and stimulate immune function to keep these microbes at bay. I was fortunate enough to work and study extensively with Dr. Dickson Thom who literally wrote the book on Unda Numbers and is one of the world's foremost experts in biotherapeutic drainage. I have incorporated this clinical training into my practice because I have found it to be an incredible tool to promote healing and achieve a state of wellness. "}
