Their careful reading is recommended.In December 2014, WHO published GAPIII: Global Action Plan,a for the main purpose of disseminating the global strategy to minimize the risk of reestablishment of circulation of poliovirus from infectious and potentially infectious samples that are stored in facilities in different sectors, including, of course, laboratories. The actions contained in GAPIII are justified in several global decisions that began with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in May 1988 (WHA41.28b and were updated in the recent \"Polio Eradication & Endgame: Strategic Plan (PEESP) 2013-2018.\" (3) The strategy to minimize the risk of reestablishing circulation of facility- associated poliovirus described in GAPIII a consists of its elimination through the destruction of materials considered to be known or probable sources of the poliovirus,c in all but certified, essential facilities and (2) proper biorisk management of these facilities through strict adherence to required safeguards. The reasons for carrying out this task of elimination and assurance of containment in appropriate facilities are based on different scenarios that are explained below. This document seeks to address the actions recommended by the WHO in the GAPIII guide for the containment of both wild and vaccine-derived polioviruses, as well as the PAHO's interpretation of and recommendations regarding these actions.

This document has been agreed upon by and adapted for the Region by the small working group of the PAHO, based on the World Health Organization document GAPIII: WHO Global Action Plan to minimize poliovirus facility-associated risk after type-specific eradication of wild polioviruses and sequential cessation of oral polio vaccine use. a The Basics of WHO's GAPIII and Regional-GAPIII The original document was developed by WHO at the global level. Only Sabin2 and WPV2 poliovirus were included in the WHO version. The PAHO adaptation includes containment of Sabin2 and wild poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, a decision based on the widespread use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the countries of the Region and the fact that the last confirmed case of paralytic polio caused by wild poliovirus occurred in 1991.

Introduction Launched in 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has been the largest international public health effort ever undertaken, involving billions of US dollars donated through GPEI partners, the dedicated efforts of governments at all levels, countless hours of volunteer services, and the immunization of billions of children with oral polio vaccine (OPV). The Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 (the Endgame Strategy) (3) set the goal of a polio-free world by 2018. Achieving this goal requires: i) completion of eradication to eliminate the risk of wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission; ii) cessation of the use of OPV to eliminate the risks 5); and iii) Implementation of poliovirus safe-handling and containment measures to minimize the risks of a facility-associated reintroduction of virus into the polio-free community. The first step towards cessation of trivalent OPV (tOPV) use will be the withdrawal of OPV type 2 (OPV2), which has caused over 90% of cVDPV cases since the eradication of WPV2 in 1999. The resulting bivalent OPV (bOPV, types 1 and 3) will replace tOPV in global immunization programmes, facilitated by the introduction of at least one dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), composed of all three virus types. Providing adequate IPV doses for all OPV-using countries will require both volume purchasing of existing IPV products and developing alternative low-cost IPV options (e.g. Sabin-IPV) for developing countries to meet programmatic needs. Until cessation of OPV use, bOPV will be the vaccine of choice to respond to any WPV type 1 (WPV1) and WPV type 3 (WPV3) outbreaks; while monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) will be the choice for responding to type 2 outbreaks. After OPV cessation, a combination of type-specific mOPV and IPV will be used to respond to any WPV or vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) outbreak. 1Global consensus to stop bOPV will require international assurance that: the transmission of wild and vaccine-derived poliovirus has been interrupted; affordable, safe and effective IPVs are available; potential outbreaks from undetected or newly emerged cVDPV can be controlled; and the risk from facility-associated reintroduction of wild or OPV/Sabin polioviruses can be minimized. The third edition of the GAPIII aligns the safe handling and containment of poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials with the WHO Endgame Strategy and replaces both the 2009 draft version of the third edition posted on the GPEI website and the second edition of the WHO Global Action Plan for laboratory containment of wild polioviruses (6). Thes third edition of GAPIII will do the following: Describes timelines and requirements to be completed in preparation for poliovirus containment, implemented throughout the poliovirus type 2 containment period, and applied in the post-eradication and post-bOPV phase. Balances the need for equitable access to polioviruses, e.g. for vaccine production, throughout the poliovirus type 2 containment and post-eradication period, against the risk based on assessment findings, consequence models (8) and management strategies (Annexes 2 and 3). Establishes the long-term goal of minimizing the risk of facility-associated poliomyelitis in the post-eradication/post-bOPV era by providing continued access to safe and affordable IPV or Sabin-IPV and by reducing to a minimum the number of facilities handling and storing polioviruses while serving critical functions and meeting all required safeguards. GAPIII is an evolving document, subject to revisions as new information emerges relevant to achieving the appropriate balance between community risk and the systems and controls to manage that risk. The poliovirus \"Biorisk management standard\" (Annexes 2 and 3) provides the framework for facility certification based on the principles of a biorisk management system. This standard requires the institution/facility to understand the risks associated with its activities and to manage those risks in ways acceptable to the national and international bodies responsible for the oversight of work with polioviruses. National authorities are responsible for reviewing the application of these risk management standards and principles in local circumstances. Although Annexes 2 and 3 are written specifically for wild polioviruses and OPV/Sabin strains, respectively, as they exist at the present time, should novel strains emerge that are considered to be more attenuated, less pathogenic, and safer than OPV/Sabin strains, the evidence will be reviewed by a panel of scientific experts convened by WHO to consider the controls applicable to their containment and safe handling. 2 / IntroductionOFICINA REGI ONAL PARA LAS ESCRITORIO REGION AL PARA ASRegional Plan for Containment of Poliovirus in the Region of the Americas, GAPIII-Regional 525 Rationale A reintroduction of an OPV/ Sabin strain from a facility risks unrecognized virus transmission, reversion to cVDPV, and again the potential serious consequences of re-establishing poliovirus transmission ( 8). When the use of OPV stops, many countries will continue high population coverage with IPV, other countries will have suboptimal IPV coverage, and still others may discontinue all national polio immunization activities. A reintroduction of WPV from a poliovirus facility risks the potentially serious consequences of re-establishing poliovirus transmission When WPV circulation is interrupted, interest in immunization against polio is expected to decline and population susceptibility will increase in many parts of the world. 3OFICINA REGI ONAL PARA LAS ESCRITORIO REGION AL PARA ASRegional Plan for Containment of Poliovirus in the Region of the Americas, GAPIII-Regional 525 countries will have no need to retain live polioviruses in the post-eradication and post-OPV era. Facility-associated risks in these countries can be eliminated by a thorough nationwide search for and destruction of all WPV and all OPV/Sabin infectious and potentially infectious materials. Some countries will host a limited number of poliovirus facilities that serve critical international functions, including IPV and Sabin-IPV production, production and storage of mOPV stockpiles, vaccine quality assurance, diagnostic reagent production, virus diagnostic and reference functions, together with crucial research. Each of these poliovirus-essential facilities should manage biorisk appropriately to minimize the risk of virus reintroduction into the community, with effective national certification and WHO verification programmes. The risk from a poliovirus reintroduction can be minimized by: i) locating poliovirus-essential facilities in areas with high levels of population immunity; ii) effective acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance, supplemented by iii) efficient public health and response capacity. Consequences can be further minimized by working only with OPV/Sabin or alternative, more attenuated strains, which have lower basic reproduction rates ( R0) than WPV (8). Minimizing the number of poliovirus-essential facilities worldwide further reduces the magnitude of the risk, facilitates national and international oversight, and strengthens the likelihood that global containment standards can be met and successfully maintained.4 / RationaleOFICINA REGI ONAL PARA LAS ASRegional Plan for Containment of Poliovirus in the Region of the Americas, GAPIII-Regional 525 strategy for minimizing poliovirus facility-associated risks consists of risk elimination by destroying poliovirus materials in all but certified poliovirus-essential facilities1 and biorisk management of these facilities by strict adherence to required safeguards. Risk Elimination Risk elimination in poliovirus-non-essential facilities is achieved through the destruction, or transfer to poliovirus-essential facilities, of: 1. infectious and potentially infectious WPV materials; and 2. OPV/Sabin materials, as described below. Destruction applies to all materials potentially contaminated with any type or strain of WPV or OPV/Sabin poliovirus, or where the presence of polioviruses cannot be ruled out, particularly with regard to untested virus stocks in facilities that in the past worked with polioviruses (9 ) and in non-polio facilities retaining valuable clinical materials potentially infected with polio or OPV/Sabin viruses. Successful global elimination of the risk requires each country to effectively prohibit retention and subsequent acquisition of poliovirus materials in all poliovirus-non-essential facilities following global recommendations (3). Biorisk Management Biorisk management in designated poliovirus-essential facilities (Annexes 2 and 3) is achieved through the implementation of international biorisk management standards that: 1. include polio-specific containment requirements to reduce the likelihood of release of polioviruses from poliovirus-essential facilities (primary safe-guards); 2. describe population immunity requirements (secondary safeguards) to minimize the consequences of the release of polioviruses from poliovirus- essential facilities; and 3. define the site-specific environmental requirements for poliovirus-essential facilities (tertiary safeguards), to further minimize the consequences of release. 1 Laboratories or polio vaccine production facilities.3. Strategy 5Primary safeguards of containment reduce the likelihood of accidental or malicious poliovirus release from a poliovirus-essential facility and are specified in the \"Biorisk management standard for poliovirus-essential facilities holding wild poliovirus materials\" (Annex 2) and \"Biorisk management standard for poliovirus-essential facilities holding only OPV/Sabin poliovirus materials (no WPV)\" (Annex 3). Key elements include: facility management, which practises continuous risk assessment and strict observance; of biosafety and laboratory biosecurity procedures; the containment facility, which incorporates appropriate design, construction and operation principles, addressing identified biorisk; the immunization of facility personnel, which can reduce the risk of infection in the facility and intra- or extra-household transmission, should infection occur (10; 11); reduction in the use of WPV and the substitution with Sabin strains or further attenuated strains where possible (10); and contingency plans for potential virus release or exposure, which specify actions and assign responsibilities for the facility, the institution, the ministry of health (MoH) and other concerned government agencies. Secondary safeguards of population immunity minimize the consequences of a poliovirus release into the community from a poliovirus-essential facility and consist of a national routine childhood polio immunization policy and the achievement of high national population coverage consistent with WHO policy (3) and eventual post-eradication strategies (12). Tertiary safeguards of facility location minimize the consequences of the unintentional release of highly transmissible WPV by placing poliovirus-essential facilities in areas with demonstrated low poliovirus R0, i.e. in areas with closed sewage systems with a minimum of secondary treatment of effluents. Primary and secondary safeguards are required for poliovirus-essential facilities that handle and store WPV or OPV2/Sabin2 materials during the poliovirus type 2 containment period and after cessation of bOPV use (Table 1). The potential for spread (R 0) is two to 10 times less for Sabin/ OPV strains than for WPV, which reduces the risk for infection at the community level if a breach of containment occurs, and the consequences of such a breach if transmission were recognized in time (11). Primary, secondary and tertiary safeguards are required for poliovirus-essential facilities that handle and store WPV materials after WPV eradication (Table 1) . National certification and regular annual recertification thereafter is required for all poliovirus-essential facilities. WHO verification of compliance with GAPIII may be requested on a regular (triennial) basis. National certification supported by WHO verification provides assurance that the required safeguards are met .6 / StrategyTABLE 1: GAPIII containment safeguards at a glance 2 Since the operator is considered to be one of the sources of poliovirus release from the facility, specific protection measures are required, including, for example, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), the use of primary containment devices and vaccination 3 Untreated release into a closed sewage system with secondary effluent treatment in the facility location (all waste from facilities, potentially containing live poliovirus, should be inactivated prior to release through adequate and validated inactivation procedures. In facilities without a dedicated effluent treatment plant, this would normally be done by applying heat or chemicals as part of a validated treatment process. Under no circumstances should raw poliovirus containing effluents be discharged to drains, unless the effluent treatment plant has been designed and validated to handle such effluents, effectively acting as part of the primary containment system). 4 Facility effluent treatment before release into a closed sewage system with secondary or greater effluent treatment in the facility location. 5 High-efficiency particulate arresting (HEPA) filtration on exhaust air. 6 Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine third dose (DTP3) immunization coverage (19). 7 Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020 (20).DTP3: Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine third dose.Poliovirus type 2 containment period Final poliovirus containment periods All type 2 poliovirusesAll OPV/Sabin poliovirusesAll wild polioviruses 1\u00b0 Safeguards: Prevent infection & release of contaminated materials Operator protection2Yes Yes Yes Decontamination of materials/equipment Yes Yes Yes Dedicated effluent treatment plant No3 Yes4 Air/exhaust treatment No No Yes5 2\u00b0 Safeguards: Population immunity in country hosting the facility IPV doses 1 1 3 IPV coverage = DPT3 coverage 90%7 3\u00b0 Safeguards: Environment and location Siting of facilities in areas with low transmission potential (R0) for wild poliovirusesNo No Yes Regional-GAPIII ASRegional Plan for Containment of Poliovirus in the Region of the Americas, GAPIII-Regional 525 Plan for Containment of Poliovirus in the Region of the Americas, GAPIII-Regional 525 Regional-GAPIII: Description and Implementation of Phases Two situations were broadly analyzed in the adaptation of the containment plan for the Americas: i) no cases of acute flaccid paralysis caused by wild poliovirus in approximately 25 years (last case in 1991) and ii) use of OPV in the majority of the national immunization programs in countries of the Region.

(Annex A). National inventory of facilities with WPV/VDPV/OPV/Sabin infectious and potentially infectious poliovirus materials. (Annex A). Destruction of unneeded WPV/VDPV/OPV2/Sabin2 infectious and potentially infectious poliovirus materials. Initiation of destruction of all unneeded WPV1 and WPV3 materials. Transfer of needed WPV/VDPV/OPV2/Sabin2 infectious material and potentially infectious materials to poliovirus-essential facilities. Inform to governments, institutions and poliovirus facilities about the upcoming need for poliovirus containment. Preparation for poliovirus containment. Certifying designated poliovirus-essential facilities. Check boxes where applicable.Regional-GAPIII / 11During Phase I, countries shall conduct the following activities: Activity Done Survey all biomedical facilities to identify those with infectious or potentially infectious WPV materials and encourage the destruction of all unneeded materials. The survey starts with the establishment of a national database of biomedical facilities that includes all facilities with the following types of laboratories: poliovirus/enterovirus, general virology, clinical bacteriology, parasitology, environmental, industrial (polio vaccine and general microbiological filter manufacturers and disinfectant manufacturers), or any other laboratory handling and storing poliovirus. Facilities listed in the database are surveyed to confirm whether WPV infectious or potentially infectious materials are being stored; Develop a national inventory of facilities that handle and store WPV materials, and report to the PAHO Regional Certification Commission (RCC) for poliomyelitis eradication. The national inventory serves as a current record of poliovirus facilities. National inventories are assembled into regional inventories maintained by WHO regional offices. Submit reports to the RCC on the current status of the national inventory of facilities with poliovirus materials. (Annex A, B and C). Complete national surveys and inventories and submit documentation to the RCC that the Phase I survey and inventory requirements have been met. The MoH submits the complete reports on Phase I survey and inventory activities and supporting documents to the National Certification Committee for review and endorsement before submission to the RCC (Annex C). After completion of national surveys and inventories and in preparation for Phase II, all countries shall: Activity Done Adopt international goals (3) for the timely destruction or containment of WPV materials and OPV2/Sabin2 materials and decide to either: prohibit the retention of all GAPIII-specified poliovirus materials by any facility after achieving specific milestones; or prohibit the retention of all GAPIII-specified poliovirus materials except in designated certified poliovirus essential facilities. 12 / Regional-GAPIII: Description and Implementation of Phases Countries considering the need for poliovirus-essential containment facilities shall weigh the risks and benefits of such facilities in consultation with all relevant ministries (e.g. health, education, defense, environment, etc.) and the responsibilities inherent in complying with the crucial primary, secondary and tertiary safeguards. They will: Activity Done Alert biomedical facilities to national policies and international agreements (14) pertaining to the retention of WPV materials or OPV/Sabin materials to permit orderly planning for compliance. Instruct facilities that work or have worked with poliovirus, enteroviruses, rhinovirus, rotavirus or norovirus to confirm the identity of all virus stocks, reference strains and derivatives of such viruses grown in poliovirus- permissive cell cultures to rule out the presence of poliovirus (10). Where and when necessary, virus stocks of uncertain histories or multiple passages must be replaced with stocks of documented authenticity from an international culture collection or from other investigators using appropriate reference techniques. Laboratories wishing to retain historic collections of clinical materials shall explore options for handling and storage arrangements with designated poliovirus-essential research and reference facilities. Request that facilities on the national inventory submit plans for compliance with poliovirus retention policies and/or regulations (14), including the status of materials and action timelines. Request that non-essential facilities not intending to retain poliovirus infectious or potentially infectious materials (6): destroy unneeded WPV poliovirus (infectious and potentially infectious materials and any OPV/Sabin materials); or transfer all needed poliovirus type 2 material to poliovirus-essential facilities.

A non-retention policy for OPV2/Sabin2 materials as of the beginning of Phase IIb of the poliovirus type 2 containment period; If wild or Sabin2 poliovirus are isolated after the initiation of Phase IIa, the facility must immediately notify the MoH and WHO, and transfer the isolate to a designated certified poliovirus-essential facility; Activity Done Notify the general biomedical laboratory community that, according to the globally endorsed Endgame Strategy (3), the retention of WPV materials will no longer be permitted in Phase IIa and the retention of OPV2/Sabin2 materials will no longer be permitted in Phase IIb, except in designated certified poliovirus-essential facilities. Facilities are fully responsible for compliance with national policies and/or regulations (14), including: the destruction of WPV infectious and potentially infectious materials and any OPV2/Sabin2 materials or the transfer of such materials to a designated poliovirus-essential facility.Phase I: Preparation for containment of poliovirus Regional-GAPIII / 13Facilities in the national database of biomedical laboratories with a history of performing activities that place them at risk of having potentially infectious poliovirus materials or contaminated stocks must respond to the MoH or another designated national authority documenting the absence of such materials. Countries with plans to designate poliovirus-essential facilities shall, in addition: Activity Done Request that candidate facilities assess and submit documentation demonstrating compliance with secondary and tertiary safeguards, as applicable to the type of material being held (WPV or OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus). Implement national certification procedures to assess the compliance of poliovirus-essential facilities with provisions regarding the containment of poliovirus type 2, including primary and secondary safeguards. Designated polioviruses-essential facilities wishing to handle and store WPV materials must be fully certified before Phase II. Establish national contingency plans for responding to the potential release of or exposure to poliovirus (15). Request that candidate poliovirus-essential facilities8 planning to handle and store infectious WPV materials be certified in the implementation of provisions regarding the containment of poliovirus type 2, including primary and secondary safeguards (Annex 2), before Phase II. If facilities are unable to meet the requirements, all WPV materials must be transferred to a country and facility meeting the requirements, or be destroyed. Request that candidate poliovirus-essential facilities9 planning to handle and store only OPV2/Sabin2 materials (but no WPV materials) be certified in the implementation of provisions containment of OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus, including primary and secondary safeguards (Annex 3), no later than three months after the switch. If facilities are unable to meet the requirements, all OPV2/Sabin2 materials must be transferred to a country and facility meeting the requirements, or be destroyed. Countries or concerned facilities may apply through their national authorities for WHO verification of poliovirus- essential facilities, certified by the MoH or another designated national authority, and declared to meet all biorisk management criteria consistent with Annex 2 or 3 (Annex 4). Preparing for the tOPV-bOPV switch The WHA resolution (14) on the tOPV-bOPV switch (16) provides details on the process for implementing each step leading to OPV2 withdrawal, recall of unused tOPV and the containment of OPV2/Sabin2 polioviruses: Countries using tOPV shall respond to the WHA resolution (14) with detailed plans for compliance. All countries shall review or expand the Phase I institution or facility database to include new or other biomedical laboratories that might have infectious or potentially infectious OPV2/Sabin2 materials of any origin. Physicians' offices, pharmacies and health facilities that may have tOPV vials will be notified through other government channels as part of the tOPV-bOPV switch process. Plans and actions to prepare for the tOPV-bOPV switch continue in Phase II. 8 Laboratories or IPV production facilities 9 Laboratories or OPV/Sabin-IPV production facilities14 / Regional-GAPIII: Description and Implementation of Phases Phase II Poliovirus type 2 containment period Phase II commences as soon as the criteria for global readiness of OPV2 withdrawal are met, and continues until certification of global WPV eradication.

Inventory of facilities with poliovirus materials (wild, OPV/Sabin) by serotype. Destroy or transfer all unneeded WPV and OPV/Sabin2 infectious and potentially infectious materials. Containment of poliovirus type 2. All facilities that want to keep WPV and OPV/Sabin2 must apply to PEF's certification. Advance with a process of destruction of all unneeded WPV1 and WPV3 materials. Successful global elimination of risk requires each country to adopt a policy of no retention and subsequent acquisition of poliovirus materials in all non-essential facilities. Having an inventory of facilities with WPV/VDPV or OPV/Sabin infectious poliovirus materials by serotype will allow more rapid implementation of Phase III of GAPIII. The reason is that there may be some laboratories that keep poliovirus type 1 and/or type 3, these facilities should be considered in GAPIII Phase III. In this way, it is expected that not only laboratories that have applied for certification in Phase II of GAPIII will continue as the only facilities that should be considered in Phase III, for example, most Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) facilities and several university and research facilities will definite to continue working with poliovirus type 1 and/or type 3. 25* Applies only to samples collected from countries in the Region of Americas. ** If the switch is confirmed by April 2016. Laboratories that retain biological samples collected from: countries outside of the Americas, should review the status of the polio eradication program in the country of origin of the samples and apply consistent containment criteria as defined in the Regional- GAPIII. countries of the Americas Region should review the status of the national polio program and apply consistent containment criteria as defined in the Regional-GAPIII.Regional considerations for classification of potentially infectious materials: Divisions of the historical period of collection of potentially infectious materials are set into two components (Figure 2). FIGURE 2: Division of historic collection of poliovirus potentially infectious materials* If sample* was collected in 1991 or earlier it is considered as WPV potentially infectious material , and should be destroyed, transferred or contained 31st December 2015. If sample* was collected in 1992 or afterwards it is considered as Sabin 2 potentially infectious material , and should be destroyed, transferred or contained before 31st July 2016. Before 31/12/20151991 or before Sample obtained Before 31/07/2016**1992 or after26 / Regional-GAPIII: Additional ConsiderationsDecision regarding whether or not to include cerebrospinal fluid as a poliovirus potentially infectious material In the GAPII Phase I document, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was considered potentially infectious, and since GAPIII does not include CSF in its current version, the PAHO working group carried out a review of the scientific literature to assess its inclusion in the inventory survey. Although there have been published articles mentioning cases in which poliovirus was detected in CSF, it is estimated that the probability of isolation or detection of poliovirus is too low, and accordingly it was decided not to include CSF as a specimen subject to containment. Summary of work for compliance with Regional- GAPIII: 1. Identification of laboratories with WPV or OPV/Sabin poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials, along with a regional survey that updates information on wild poliovirus infectious materials by serotype and provides data on handling and storing OPV/Sabin materials. 2. Decision making with respect to holding and final disposal of WPV and OPV/Sabin poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials. Procedures for the handling and disposal of materials should be in accordance with current national and international policies and regulations. 3. Include in the national report the name and address of the designated poliovirus-essential facility and information on the point of contact or responsible person (name, title, email address, and phone number) for each PEF.4. Submission of the national report of containment of poliovirus to the National Certification Committee (NCC). Attach or quote resolutions or administrative acts that support the creation or delegation of the National Certification Committee (NCC) and the National Polio Containment Coordinator (NPCC). 5. Submission of the national report of containment of poliovirus to the Regional Certification Commission (RCC). 6. The RCC for the Americas is composed of experts in public health, immunization, epidemiology, pediatrics, infectious diseases, and virology, acting in their personal capacity, without direct accountability for polio eradication in their country or the Region. The RCC is responsible for assessing the achievement of the four main objectives of the Endgame, which includes the revision and validation of National/Subregional reports on poliovirus containment. The RCC uses the form found in Annex D to evaluate containment reports to ensure they meet the minimum standards. Each time the RCC finished reviewing a report, they provide detailed recommendations to the National/Subregional committee. Countries that decide to have at least one PEF designate should: 7. Provide an official communication from the entity designated as the NAC and include the name and address of the institution and information (name, title, email address, and phone number) on the point of contact or responsible person. 8. The designated PEF should initiate the Containment Certification Scheme and the process of application to Certificate of Participation.

This form aims to collect relevant data to develop the final process of containment of poliovirus (polio) in compliance with the recommendations established in the GAPIII document (WHO, December 2014), which were revised and adapted for the Region of the Americas in GAPIII-R (PAHO, April 2015). The questions are intended to identify and update information concerning facilities (such as laboratories, sample storage entities, etc.) and proprietary institutions and to understand the current status of handling and storing samples that can be classified as wild poliovirus (WPV), vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), or oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) infectious or potentially infectious materials. In this activity, VDPV is included within WPV. This survey should be completed by the following facilities: All facilities that extract, handle, or store biological samples from humans or animals under experimentation and from wastewater, drinking water, or bodies of water. These entities can be laboratories for research on clinical samples, biological laboratories, or laboratories related to public health, environmental studies, or water, as well as institutions that store samples from laboratories or research. Structure of the survey: This survey has an internal structure that is divided into modules labeled A1, A2, A3, B, and C. The A1 and A2 modules must be completed by all facilities. The A3, B, and C modules need to be completed only by selected facilities according to the instructions.Once the survey is completed, its content must be revised and approved before it is sent. As proof of submission, it is necessary to fill out the validation module. Some questions have detailed instructions (in italics, in a smaller font size, and in color) for easy completion.

All cultures and contaminated materials should normally be autoclaved in leak-proof containers (e.g., autoclavable color-coded plastic bags) before disposal. Packaging should allow the penetration of steam. After being autoclaved, the materials may be placed in transfer containers for transportation to the disposal point. Autoclaves should be validated in order to ensure that sterilizing conditions are fulfilled under all loading patterns. IncinerationIncineration is the method of choice for final disposal of contaminated waste, including carcasses of laboratory animals, preferably after autoclaving. Incineration of materials is an alternative to autoclaving only if: the incinerator and transport to the incinerator are under laboratory control; and the incinerator is equipped with an efficient means of temperature control and a secondary burning chamber. Final disposalThe disposal of laboratory and medical waste is subject to various national regulations. In general, ash from incinerators may be treated in the same way as normal domestic waste and removed by local authorities. Autoclaved waste may be disposed of via off-site incineration or in licensed landfill sites. Source: World Health Organization.
