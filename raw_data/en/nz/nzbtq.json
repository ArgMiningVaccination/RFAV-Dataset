These practices each help build the resilience, openness and stability with which to move through daily life. The weekend includes teachings, discussion and practice, allowing us to explore how each form of meditation is helpful and how they complement each other. - Stillness Meditation: Linked to serenity, stillness meditation is designed to quiet an active mind by focusing on the breath, concentrating on a single topic, or practicing a centering meditation that helps release painful emotions and negative thought patterns. - Walking Meditation: In essence, walking meditation is an examination of time; we will use it to help root our awareness in the present moment. - Qigong: Using Hunyuan Qigong as a starting point, we will explore the use of mind-intent in the development, nurturing, gathering, moving and storing of Qi. We will also practice Zhanzhuang Gong, still standing meditation. - Reiki: Exploring meditative practices from the tradition of the Reiki System of Natural Healing, we will do a series of centering practices and breathing exercises to increase energy awareness and energy flow. - Tibetan Singing Bowls: Sound and vibration with Singing Bowls can be used to achieve deep relaxation, reduce stress and create a healthy flow of energy through the physical and etheric body. - Yoga: We will practice mindful movement, coordinated with the breath, followed by guided relaxation, in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of body and mind, and enjoy a deep sense of well-being. Together these practices provide a strong mind-body foundation to help transform daily living. When not in class, relax in the Center's beautiful, tranquil environment. Enjoy the view from the patio or a nearby hike, curl up with a book in the library or contemplate the stars while sitting by the fire pit. EVENT HIGHLIGHTS - Intimate setting with personal access to the teacher - Interactive sessions with question and answer periods - Shamatha and guided meditations - Delicious all-vegetarian meals with locally sourced ingredients - Option to extend stay on Personal Retreat - Extensive library of dharma books - Expansive wooded grounds with beautiful flora and fauna OPEN TO ALL There are no prerequisites for this program.
