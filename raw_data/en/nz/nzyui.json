The notion that we had any sort of ability to wield energy for the purposes of healing ourselves and others was a bit too far out there for many to grasp, especially if it wasn't something you were able to see with the naked eye or tangibly hold onto. These days, however, the extensive array of therapeutic techniques that involve the directing and utilizing of energy as a healing and grounding practice are becoming as widely accepted as [yoga](https://chopra.com/articles/quiz-what-kind-of-yoga-is-right-for-you) and meditation. At the beginning of a [new year](https://chopra.com/articles/7-strategies-to-attract-everything-you-want-in-the-new-year), you may be coming rushing out of the gate at full speed heading toward the new goals you have set. Driven by a new spark of motivation, you're probably feeling ready to take on the world. This can feel exhilarating. And yet, it requires a certain stamina, focus, and discipline to sustain the energy that's driving you to re-engage in this new way. Science has long since provided evidence that the universe, and everything in it, is made up of energy. You know that it requires energy to turn on your lights, run generators, and power pretty much everything you do. In today's crazy busy world of chasing your to-do's, you may think and talk more about energy in the context of being the fuel in your tank, your \"get up and go.\" If you're feeling particularly jazzed up, you may see yourself (or others) as having a lot of energy. If you're feeling depleted at the end of a stressful day, you may say things like \"my energy is drained\" or that you need to recharge. You are made up of [energy](https://chopra.com/articles/5-mind-body-practices-to-boost-your-energy) so it's a misconception that there can ever be a shortage of energy within you. It's not that you're depleted of your energy at the end of a long and stressful day, it's that you're mentally, emotionally, or physically tired. Your tank doesn't run dry, so to speak. How you utilize your energy is what will have an effect on your mindset, emotions, and physical body. Energy is always moving, shifting, and transforming based on the intentions you have, the beliefs that drive your actions, the environment you find yourself in, and what you choose to focus on. Energy will attract like energy. All you have to do is notice the way you respond to the news, social media, and interactions with other people to clearly see the transference of like energy. When the evening news is hyped up around something, you may feel hyped up mentally and emotionally. When social media breeds anger and separation, you may respond with your own anger and behaviors that perpetuate that sense of separation. And so on. Learning how to know and direct your own [energy](https://chopra.com/articles/8-yoga-poses-for-an-on-the-go-energy-boost) will enable you to have more control over your mental and emotional states, which will influence the action you take in any given moment and that may also determine the state of your current physiological health. So, how do you get to know your own energy and use it to ground, heal, or transform you? The ancient teachings of many cultures and societies would have you begin with the foundational building blocks of working with the four major elements: You're familiar with these elements in your external environment and everyday life experience, and they also exist on an energetic level within you. Each of these elements is what the universe is made up of, in the form of their own individuated energies and expressions. In many energy healing programs and therapies available today, connecting with the elements on both the physical and metaphysical planes is taught first, as they are the building blocks for understanding your own energetic makeup. Learning to master working with the energy of the elements within yourself enables you to have greater levels of awareness and control of yourself and how you navigate life's ups and downs. You are currently living in a time when to-do lists are never-ending, causing you to feel as though you're not able to keep up. Deadlines at work take priority over your health, your relationships, and your families, causing internal and external conflicts. You're always rushing to get someplace, do something, or arrive at a destination that never seems to materialize. And yet, there are examples of people out there who seem to be managing their energy output pretty well. They appear to have found their own system for maintaining a level of harmony between their responsibilities, achieving inspiring goals, and also taking extensive downtime. Most of all, they come off as being so calm, centered, and grounded. So, what is the secret? How can you get the secret formula for balancing children, relationships, career, health, and personal growth in a way that feels harmonious? There are several mindfulness-based practices that promote spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Meditating, [spending time in nature](https://chopra.com/articles/7-reasons-to-spend-mindful-time-in-nature), and steeping yourself in gratitude are just a few of the most common daily practices that can help you achieve a Zen state. One of the best ways to create a sense of calm is to ground your energy using the [Earth element](https://chopra.com/articles/8-yoga-poses-to-connect-you-to-the-earth-element). Earth's qualities are that of structure, foundation, consistency, and stability. By learning to direct your own energy to connect with the Earth element, it helps you to anchor into the qualities and characteristics of that element within you. Whenever you are feeling like you're spinning out, things are moving too quickly, or there's too much activity for you to be able to focus, take a few moments to do this guided visualization to help you ground into a place of safety, security, and solidity. Grounding your energy is one of the quickest, simplest, and most effective ways of bringing yourself back into a calm, centered, and balanced state. The best part is that you can do it yourself, anywhere and anytime you need to, and the more often you do it, the better you will become at taking back control of your mental and emotional states in any given moment. Many people pay high dollar for someone to help them get back in the driver's seat of their own lives. With just a few minutes of your time and focused intention, you can begin to wield the power of your own energy in a simplistic and yet powerful way.
