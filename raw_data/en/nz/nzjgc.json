Here we report label-free and live-cell imaging of mammalian cell, Escherischia coli, and yeast, using interferometric scattering microscopy, which reveals the underlying structures of a variety of cytoplasmic organelles as well as the underside structure of the cells. The contact areas of the cells attached onto a glass substrate, e.g., focal adhesions and filopodia, are clearly discernible. We also found a variety of fringe-like features in the cytoplasmic area, which may reflect the folded structures of cytoplasmic organelles. We thus anticipate that the label-free interferometric scattering microscopy can be used as a powerful tool to shed interferometric light on in vivo structures and dynamics of various intracellular phenomena. - This article is part of the themed collections: [2018 Chemical Science HOT Article Collection](/en/journals/articlecollectionlanding?sercode=sc&themeid=af929dfa-0882-413a-9013-3057a068eaf6)and [Collection to "}
