People diagnosed with cancer may have spiritual health needs. They may start looking for ways to: - Find meaning and purpose in life - Express themselves - Connect to their faith or beliefs. Spiritual distress is a conflict between your belief system and your current reality. It is when your core spirituality is challenged and you do not have spiritual well-being. Spiritual distress can happen when: - You are waiting for a diagnosis. - You have a major setback or complications. - You are in pain or are suffering. - Your beliefs do not support the treatment your health care team has recommended. - You are wishing for a ritual of faith, such as prayer or having Communion. Spiritual distress can also affect family members and caregivers of people with cancer. It can often happen if you are: - Responsible for making hard or life-changing decisions for your loved one. - Experiencing compassion or caregiver fatigue. Spiritual Care is a holistic approach to healthcare. It values and affirms spirituality and faith as part of healing. We support patients and families during their cancer care. We help connect them to their spiritual resources and practices. At BC Cancer we recognize Indigenous spirituality and cultural backgrounds, traditional ceremonies, practices and traditions, are integral parts of holistic healing. Our Indigenous Patient Navigators can connect our Indigenous Patients (M\u00e9tis, First Nations and Inuit) to Elders in various regions throughout the province, and you can also request traditional healing, practices, and medicines.
