The visionary Hawai'i State Plan and its related functional plans were among the first planning documents in t he nation that provided integrated, far- reaching policies for the economic, social and environmental future of an entire state. Now, a generation later, it has been my pleasure to work wit h the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Task Force, per Act 8 of the 2005 Hawa i'i State Legislature, to develop a statewide sustainability plan for the 21 st century - the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan. This two-year e ffort has solicited input from citizens throughout our islands using tools ranging from community meetings to Internet communications to scientific polling techni ques. It is the most comprehensive statewide planning process in over three decades. This report to the Legislature is the result of our collective efforts in creating a long-term plan for Hawai'i's sustainable future. On behalf of the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Task Force, we express our appreciation for the thousands who shared their views and opinions about sustainability and the future of this state. The expertise and input from stakeholders groups were of great value as well. We also thank our technical consultants, the Hawai'i Institute for Pub lic Affairs (\"HIPA\"), and its research partner, the University of Hawai'i's College of Social Sciences Public Policy Center, for their assistance and dedication. It is with great pleasure that I submit t he Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan to the Hawai'i State Legislature. Sincerely, MARION M. HIGA State Auditor -iii- MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIR Aloha! On behalf of the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Task Force, it is with great pleasure that we submit for your review the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan. This document embodies the expressed thoughts, opinions and values of communities across our islands. The Hawa i'i 2050 Sustainability Plan is truly the \"people's plan.\" The Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Task Force believed steadfastly that the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan should reflect the will and sentiments of its citizenry. Our outreach has been extensive and rigorous. Three rounds of statewide meetings drew thousands of residents. We conducted two statistically sound general population surveys. We met with county pl anning directors, policy makers, and experts, as well as dozens of youth, community, business, environmental, labor and other stakeholders and organizations. In total, more than 10,500 participants provi ded input to Hawai'i 2050. The Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Task Force has learned that the overwhelming majority of people in Hawai 'i want a balanced approach to Hawai'i's future, where economic, social and environmental goals are in balance. Our citizens inherently recognize that these three pillars of our society are interdependent. We want a vibrant, diversified economy; a healthy qual ity of life that is grounded in a multi- ethnic culture and Kanaka Maoli values; and healthy natural resources.. The \"triple bottom line\" concept - where our economic, community and environmental goals are in balance - is the foundation of the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan. It is the Task Force' s hope that this approach will guide all of us as we collectively determine the pref erred long-term future of our state. Sincerely, SENATOR RUSSELL S.

Kennedy, in his s peech on the Nation's Space Effort, Rice University, September 12, 1962. Kennedy pledged that the goal was to leave the Earth's atmosphere and land on the moon, which inspired many people around the world that day. Although Kennedy was assassinated the following year, on November 22, 1963, his dream of winning the space race was fulfilled on July 20, 1969, when NASA's Apollo XI mission successfully landed the first men on the moon. ***** What do the people of Hawai'i want for the future of our islands in the 21 st century? What is the community's will for the future of our economy, society and environment? What steps can we take now to achieve that preferred future for our children and their children? In 2005, the Hawai'i State Legislature s ought answers about the long-term future of our state. In the pa st, state leaders and decision makers have been ably guided in these matters by the Hawai'i State Pl an. But with a new century comes a new generation, new opportunities and new challenges. A new plan is needed. In response, the Legislature created the Ha wai'i 2050 Sustainability Task Force, a group of twenty-five citizens with a di verse range of experience in planning, community, business, the environment and government. They were charged with developing the Hawai'i 2050 Sust ainability Plan, the State's first long-range plan in 30 years. In creating the plan, the Task Force placed the wisdom of our communities first. The Task Force initiated and implemented one of the most comprehensive and inclusive planning pr ocesses in our state's history. A community-based planning effort A two-year planning proc ess engaged thousands of re sidents through multiple rounds of community meetings on ever y island, Internet outreach through a website and online surveys, and dozens of focus group meetings with stakeholders and experts. More than 10,500 participant s provided input on the Hawai'i 2050 plan. -1- Data was also collected through public opinion polls and the Hawai'i 2050 Issue Book, which contains extensive research on many aspects of sustainability such as natural resource use, population, economic development, water and social issues. The Task Force used its resources to gather the mana'o of everyone with a stake and an interest in Hawai'i and to incl ude their voice in the conversation. What did the Task Force find? What is Hawai'i 2050? The State's first definition of sustainability A Hawai'i that achieves the following: Respects the culture, character, beauty and history of our state's island communities Strikes a balance among economic, social and community, and environmental priorities Meets the needs of the pr esent without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs This definition is the foundation of Hawai'i 2050. It is the beginning of a shared vocabulary about sustainability and the future of our state. The five goals for Hawai'i 2050 The Hawai'i 2050 goals are in tegrated philosophies that express the sustainable future of Hawai'i. They reflect a deeply held sense of where Hawai'i should be headed. Living sustainably is part of our daily practice in Hawai'i. Our diversified and globally co mpetitive economy enables us to meaningfully live, work and play in Hawai'i. Our natural resources are responsib ly and respectfully used, replenished and preserved for future generations. Our community is strong, healthy, vi brant and nurturing, providing safety nets for those in need. Our Kanaka Maoli and island cultures and values are thriving and perpetuated. -2- Strategic actions to implement these five goals, and indicators to measure success or failure More detailed strategic actions and indicato rs are contained in Hawai'i 2050. They serve as a guide towards meet ing our sustainability goals. Priority actions: Intermediat e steps for the year 2020 Once this planning and community engagement process was complete, the Task Force recognized that while the community respected the vision of 2050, residents also wanted a sense of urgency. People desire tangible targets and benchmarks. In response, the Task Force established pr iority actions for the year 2020 in these areas: 1. Increase affordable housing opport unities for households up to 140% of median income 2. Strengthen public education 3. Reduce reliance on fossil (carbon-based) fuels 4. Increase recycling, reuse and waste reduction strategies 5. Develop a more diverse and resilient economy 6. Create a sustainability ethic 7. Increase production and consumpt ion of local foods and products, particularly agriculture 8. Provide access to long-term care and elderly housing 9. Preserve and perpetuate our Kanaka Maoli and island cultural values Next Steps: Recommendations for Action Focus on priority actions The Hawai'i 2050 planning process unveiled nine (9) priority actions that need to be addressed immediately. These action items were identified through an extensive community engagement process, and are needed to kick-start Hawai'i's sustainability process. Take action on those items, and we're on our way towards a sustainable future. Establish a Sustainability Council The Task Force recommends that an implementing entity - the Sustainability Council - be established to implement Hawai'i 2050. This is critical to the success of this plan. This non-regulatory go vernment body would be in charge of coordinating, marketin g and implementing Hawai 'i 2050 initiatives and recommendations. Similar in concept to the State's Council on Revenues, it would help to promote sustainability, determi ne intermediate and long-term benchmarks, measure success, coordinate cross sector efforts and dialogue, and report to government and private sect or leaders on progress. -3- Develop Sustainability indicators Hawai'i 2050 indicators would be an annual aggregation of the data that will tell us how we are doing. While our state measur es its economic position mostly by tax revenues, building permits and visitor arrivals, Hawai'i 2050 indicators will be the primary measure of the over all progress of our societ y. There are fifty-five recommended indicators to measure Hawa i'i's overall economic, environmental, community and cultural characteristics. Report on progress We need to be held accountable to these goals and objectives, so we recommend an annual report card be produced by the Sustainability Council and presented to government and ot her leaders. What's next? In January of 2008, Hawai'i 2050 will be submi tted to the Hawai'i State Legislature. We recommend the immediate establishm ent of the Sustainability Council and statutory guidelines for its role. By la w, the Task Force ceases to exist in the summer of 2008, so the Sustainability Council must be giv en the authority to continue these efforts by the end of the 2008 session. Through Hawai'i 2050, we have develop ed the most comprehensive, forward- looking, data-driven guide to achi eve Hawai'i's preferred future. -4- BACKGROUND AND ORIGINS OF HAWAI'I 2050 How did Hawai'i 2050 come about? The 2005 Legislature expresse d its belief that government is responsible not only for resolving daily and pressing issues and public needs, but also for providing guidance to assure that the pr eferred future of our state is met. Recognizing that present and subsequent generations must addr ess sustainability issues essential to Hawai'i's quality of lif e, the Legislature enacted Act 8 (SSLH 2005), which provided for the development of a sustainab ility plan to address the vital needs of Hawai'i through the year 2050. Act 8 established the Hawa i'i 2050 Sustainability Task Force (hereinafter \"Task Force\") to review the Hawai'i State Plan and the State's comprehensive planning system, and it required the Office of the Auditor to create the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan (herei nafter \"Hawai'i 2050\"). Specifically, the purpose of Act 8 is to: Establish a Hawai'i 2050 Sustain ability Task Force to review the Hawai'i State Plan and other fundamental components of community planning, and to develop recommendat ions on creating the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan; and Require the auditor to prepare the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan to define and implement stat e goals, objectives, policies and priority guidelines, incorporating some or all of the recommendations of the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Task Forc e to aid in the future long-term development of the state. The twenty-five member Task Force has a mix of public and private sector representatives with a diverse range of experience. Its members include representatives appointed by or representing the Governor , Speaker of the House, Senate President, the Mayors of the c ounties of Hawai'i, Kaua'i, Maui and Honolulu, the director of the Office of Planning, t he University of Hawai'i Department of Urban & Regional Planning, and the State Auditor. Hawai'i at a crossroads Creating Hawai'i 2050 comes as the stat e faces a growing number of pressing issues. The steady deterioration of pub lic infrastructure, lack of affordable housing, continued reliance on a servic e-based economy, the vulnerability of Hawai'i in a volatile glo bal energy market, possible interruptions in travel and critical food supplies, threats to our fragile island ecosystems, and the ever increasing numbers of residents and visitors all raise questions about the direction -5- of our state, the long-term limits of growth on these islands and the need to plan and act now to assure that the preferred future for the people of Hawai'i is met. The signs are evident. The average cost of a home is $650,000, well beyond the means of most. The price of oil is heading towards $100 per barrel. We're sitting in traffic much too long. We can't find a parking s pace just to go to the neighborhood grocery st ore. Our options to care for the elderly are severely limited. In 2006, we were forced to dump 50 million gallons of raw sewage into the Ala Wai Canal due to old, cracked sewer lines. We are over-reliant on outside sources, importing about 85 and 95 percent of our food and fuel, respectively. And, intuitively, these pressures ar e gnawing at us. Some are questioning whether our aloha spirit is eroding. Tempers are flaring a little more than they used to a decade ago. Comments that \"Hawai 'i is not what it used to be\" are becoming noticeably more frequent. The di sputes between the sectors are a bit more fierce, most recently with the Hawa i'i Superferry incident where the issues of growth and access between our islands were in conflict. Furthermore, no discussion of Hawai'i's future would be complete without addressing the most basic question we have in our island state: What is our carrying capacity? We anticipate thousands of new homes coming on line, tens of thousands of additional residents to move he re, millions of tourists every year, and yet no serious look at our overall capacity has been undertaken recently. These concerns, observations and feelings all lead to the two most commonly questions asked: Where are we going? What is Hawai'i's preferred future? Before Hawai'i 2050: The Hawai'i State Plan The predecessor to Hawai'i 2050 was the Hawai'i State Plan, Hawai'i's first attempt at comprehensive long-range planni ng for our islands. Conceived in the mid-1970s, the Hawai'i State Plan was developed under the leadership of Governor George R. Ariyos hi. It was a visionary effo rt to provide balanced guidance to government officials as well as the private sector in the use of our state's precious natural and cultural resources. The Hawai'i State Plan was complement ed by twelve functional plans that provided the vision and goals in priority ar eas for our state such as agriculture, conservation lands, employment, energy, health, higher education, historic preservation, housing, recreation, tourism, transportation and water resource development. As part of its developmen t, citizens and public advisory committees were formed for each functional pl an, engaging thousands of government, business and community leaders and public ci tizens who deliberated the future of Hawai'i. -6- The State Plan process resulted in many key directives for the state such as making Hawai'i a world-class tourism destinat ion; investing in public infrastructure like airports, harbors and roads to suppor t Hawai'i's development; expanding and strengthening the University of Hawa i'i system; and implementing community initiatives like the Pre-paid Health Care Act which serves as the foundation for healthcare in Hawai'i. Ha wai'i 2050 honors the work of the Hawai'i State Plan and builds upon its foundation for developing a strategic approach to Hawai'i's preferred future. In the years after Governor Ariyoshi left office in 1986, the Hawai'i State Plan fell into disuse. Over time it has becom e outdated, and awareness of the State Plan and its goals has dwindled. The last co mprehensive review and revision of the Hawai'i State Plan occurred in the mid-1980s. The State Functional Plans were last updated in 1991, and over the years, comprehensive statewide planning, which integrates all the disciplines of Hawai'i's long-range future, has languished. Hawai'i 2050 is the most comprehensive statewide plan ning process conducted in over three decades. -7- CRITICAL CONCEPTS: A USER'S GUIDE TO HAWAI'I 2050 About the term Kanaka Maoli Throughout this plan, you will see the term Kanaka Maoli. This term is a more appropriate description for Hawai'i's indi genous people - Native Hawaiians. This description of Native Hawaiians was s uggested by Kanaka Maoli leaders who participated in the Hawai'i 2050 proce ss, and subsequently was adopted by the Task Force. Ahupua'a: An overarching metaphor Our Hawaiian islands are blessed with a K anaka Maoli tradition and heritage that make our state uniquely spec ial. The Task Force is co mmitted to integrate the values and principles of the tradi tional Kanaka Maoli concept of the ahupua'a resource and behavioral management system as a philosophical basis for a sustainable Hawai'i. The values of the ahupua'a system ensure that people respect the air, land, water and other sca rce natural resources that make life sustainable from the m ountains to the sea. Education is key for a sustainable Hawai'i A major premise of Hawai'i 2050 is that education and awareness of sustainability is essential to the plan's success. It is important that Hawai'i's community be engaged and committed to the concept of su stainability, and be an active partner in ensuring Hawai'i's sustainable future. Such public acceptance, including the need to change social behavior, requires an aggr essive effort to educate Hawai'i's people on the value and necessity of sustainability. The Task Force also recognized the need to educate Hawai'i's people by integrating the concepts of sustainability within Hawai'i' s educational curriculum. This involves teacher preparation, professional development, curriculum development and assessment, and course requirements in sustainability. Such core concepts could provide the f oundation for lifetim e awareness about sustainability in the same way that Ha wai'i's students learn about math, reading and history. There may be important strategic actions not included in this plan While Hawai'i 2050 consolidates key acti ons and indicators, we may have missed a few important elements or action items. We did our best to include those that were identified by the community, stakehol ders and experts, but some may have been omitted. Likewise, some strategi c actions may have been left out because they were not identified as a priority at this time. This plan is a beginning, not the end, of the conversation about strategic actions relating to Hawai'i's future. The -8- intent is for this plan to be revised peri odically, making it continually relevant and applicable in the years ahead. No plan can predict or control the future, so we must plan to adapt In ten or twenty years, some of the strategic actions identified in this document may not fit because of changing priorities, technologies or other environmental, political or economic conditions, so we must be prepared for change. What about other planning effort s? How does Hawai'i 2050 fit in? There are many long-term strategic initia tives already in place, ranging from coastal zone and water resource managem ent strategies, to county general and development plans, to economic developm ent and visitor industry plans. Hawai'i 2050 is different from other government plans in that it creates a long-term action agenda for achieving sustainability for our state. Hawai'i 2050 consolidates into one document key goals and initiati ves that will - over time - create a Hawai'i that is stronger, more diverse and resilient because of its balanced approach to implementing sustainability goals and strategies. Hawai'i 2050 does not replace the Hawai'i State Plan. Similarly, Hawai'i 2050 does not \"trump\" other governmental plans, incl uding the county general and development plans. The Task Force is resp ectful of and is cognizant that each county has its own comprehensive planning process and plans. Hawai'i 2050 provides over-arching Stat e goals that the counties can use as a guide to further their sustainability efforts. With representation on the Task Force by all four counties, Ha wai'i 2050 has had direct input from county government officials and residents. Each mayor appoint ed three members from their county to be on the Task Force. Hawai'i 2050 is intended to augment and complement other existing government plans, and prov ides an action agenda that is oriented towards achieving sustainability goals and principles. -9- THE HAWAI'I 2050 SUSTAINABILITY PLAN Charting a Course for Hawai'i's Sustainable Future The Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan is a blue print for Hawai'i's preferred future. It is the most comprehensive planning process since the Hawai'i State Plan was developed over three decades ago. This plan reflects the hopes and aspirations of Hawai'i's people. They represent the heart and soul of our islands. Listen to their voices. There is a yearning for a more cohesive and planned future. Hear their calling . They want leadership and action. Give them hope. Help create a preferred future for Hawai'i for generations to come. ***** To put Hawai'i 2050 in to context, we offer these insightful words from one who came before us . . . The Hawai'i State Plan is not the end, it is a beginni ng. It is the beginning of us finally taking control of our destiny. It will serve notice that we know what is good for this State, what is proper and what is achievable. We share an awesome responsibility, you and I, a responsibility that transcends this time and this place. Direction comes only from an awareness of future problems and future needs and a willingness to step forwar d and address that future - as difficult and as overwhelming as that may sometimes be. - Governor George R. Ariyoshi in his State-of-the-Stat e Address to the Ninth State Legislature in Joint Sessi on, State Capitol, Honolulu, January 23, 1978. Governor Ariyoshi stated that as representatives of the people of the state of Hawai'i, it is the responsibility of the Legislature to find the right direction; the direction wh ich will leave Hawai'i in a better place than they found it. -10- WHAT IS SUSTAINABILITY? THE PEOPLE'S DEFINITION When the Hawai'i 2050 Sustai nability Task Force firs t asked the public what \"sustainability\" meant, it received a vari ety of answers. To some, it was about protecting the environment. To others, it meant creating agricultural self- sufficiency and self-reliance - living in a self-contained system. Others viewed it as a matter of economic resilience. We needed a common language and understanding. To achieve this, thousands of residents participated in nearly fifty public meetings across the state. Citizens from neighborhood boards, businesses, env ironmental groups, labor unions, high schools and colleges came out after work and on weekends to offer their vision for a sustainable Hawai'i in 2050. The meetings revealed that most Hawai'i residents wa nt balance between economic, cultural and environmental concerns because they understand that these three parts of our society are interdependent. In a sustainable society, systems repleni sh themselves. They don't rely on the consumption of economic, social and env ironmental assets for progress. Focusing on Hawai'i's main assets - economy, society and environment - and how to make them self-sustaining is not an academic or political exercise; it is a matter of the survival of Hawai'i as we know it. The following definition, vision and guidi ng principles of Ha wai'i 2050 are deeply grounded in the voices of our citizenry. They were not conjured by a blue-ribbon committee or adapted from another state, but given to us by Hawai'i's people. Definition of Sustainability in Hawai'i A Hawai'i that achieves the following: Respects the culture, character, beauty and history of our state's island communities Strikes a balance between economic, social and community, and environmental priorities Meets the needs of the pr esent without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs -11- Hawai'i's Vision for Sustainability The year is 2050 and Hawai'i is a sustainable community. Living responsibly and within our own means is top-of-mind for all individuals and organizations. We learn about the virtues and values of a sustainable Hawai'i. As a result, our goals of economic prosperit y, social and community well-being, and environmental stewardship ar e in balance and achieved. Our Kanaka Maoli culture and island values are perpetuated. We have a vibrant, clean, locally based and diversified economy that supports a living wage for island residents. Workforce development afford s economic and career opportunities for our children. Our land, water and natural resources are used responsibly, and are replenished and preserved for future gener ations. We respect and live within the natural resources and limits of our islands. In 2050, the energy we use is clean, renew able and produced mostly in Hawai'i. Much of the food we consume is produced locally. We minimize waste by recycling. We are a strong and healthy community with access to affordable housing, transportation and health care. Our public education system prepares our people for productive, m eaningful and fulfilling lives. We no longer measure economic vitality sole ly by statistics such as the number of building permits issued or by tax re venue, but by much more balanced sustainability indicators that guide the acti ons of the public an d private sectors. Every year, these indicators tell us how we are doing, and guide future action. In 2050, Hawai'i is where our hopes and aspi rations as individuals, families and as a community are realized now and in the future. -12- Guiding Principles of Sustainability We balance economic, social, communi ty and environmental priorities. We respect and live within the natural resources and limits of our islands. We must achieve a diversified and dynamic economy. We honor the host culture. We make decisions based on meeting the pres ent needs without compromising the needs of future generations. The principles of the ahupua'a system guide our resource management decisions. Everyone \u2014 individuals, families, communities, businesses and government \u2014 has a responsibility for achieving a sustainable Hawai'i. The Triple Bottom Line Approach: Where economic, community and environmental goals are in balance. -13- GOALS, STRATEGIC ACTIONS AND INDICATORS How is the Hawai'i 2050 plan organized? There are five major goals designed to achieve our preferred future by 2050. Each goal has a set of specific strategic actions that must be implemented in order to achieve each goal. Under each goal and strat egic actions are indicators, which are quantifiable measures of progress. Having indicators is critical, because without them, we will not be sure about our progress in implementing the plan. These statistics hold us accountable to deliver results. Goals: What we want to achieve Strategic Actions: How we will achieve our goals Indicators: How we measure our progress Goals for Hawai'i 2050 Goal 1. A Way of Life - Livi ng sustainably is part of our daily practice in Hawai'i. Goal 2. The Economy - Our dive rsified and globally competitive economy enables us to meaningfully live, work and play in Hawai'i. Goal 3. Environment and Na tural Resources - Our natural resources are responsibly and respectfully used, replenished and preserved for future generations. Goal 4. Community and Social Well-Being - Our community is strong, healthy, vibrant and nurturing, providing safety nets for those in need. Goal 5. Kanaka Maoli and Isl and Values - Our Kanaka Maoli and island cultures and values are thriving and perpetuated. These goals reflect the \"triple bottom line\" that resonated from our meetings with thousands of citizens, stakeholders and expert s. They reflect a deeply held sense of where Hawai'i should be headed. T hese goals are in no particular order or priority. They are of equal importance, inter-related and inter-dependent of one another. -14- The goals seem interdependent. Why separate them into five categories? Balance and integratio n are critical to this plan. Hawai'i 2050 strives not only to achieve the goals of each of the component s of sustainability, but to reach the necessary balance between goals. T he sustainability components are inter- related and inter-dependent. We divided the goals into five separate sections because that structure makes it easier to understand for the reader. In reality, and for implementation purposes, all goals and actions work together. For example, for higher wage jobs, we need a qualified work force, which requires strengthening our public schools, which includes addressing Hawai'i's high school drop-out rate. These strategic actions cu t across several of the goals of Hawai'i 2050 and must be coordinated and conduct ed simultaneously. The actions and outcomes of each component impact the other. Why doesn't education have its own goal? Education is a critical component of Hawai'i 2050. We chose to integrate education into each of the five goals, rather than have it stand alone, because separating it out would not do justice to t he fact that education is fundamental to the accomplishment of each goal, and is not distinct from them. It is certainly important enough to merit its own category, but our choice was to make education an integral part of all of the goals. What are indicators? What do they do? Measuring progress for Hawai'i 2050 is a parallel to companies measuring performance through financial statements or program ev aluations. Similarly, employee performance reviews, student r eport cards, and management audits all provide mechanisms to understand where we are in relation to goals and standards. More than anything, measures of progr ess set Hawai'i 2050 apart from previous long-term statewide planning initiatives. In our review of the bes t practices of other state and municipality sustainab ility plans, some sort of public report card is a crucial element in ensuri ng that the public, lawmaker s and opinion leaders know and understand both progress and failings rela tive to sustainability goals. We recommend fifty-five indicators which measure the overall economic, environmental, cultural and communi ty well-being of our state. We believe performance indicators are a crucial component of Hawai'i 2050. A good indicator helps the public understand the current status of an issue, whether the situation around it is improving or worsening, and how far we are from success. Effective indicators are rele vant, easy to understand, reliable and based on accessible data. -15- A WAY OF LIFE Goal 1: Living sustainably is part of our daily practice in Hawai'i A new way of embracing Hawai'i and the world By 2050, our goal is that sustainability will be a way of life for all Hawai'i residents; not a technical term used by environmentalists, planners and political leaders. Integrating this ethic cannot be confined to government policy, but rather it is a fundamental shift in our understanding of our economy, society and environment. This goal, more than any of the others, requires the collective action of all. Responsibility of all All sectors and individuals must play an ac tive and vital role. Individuals in their role as consumers must be conscious about how their actions impact our economy, community and environment. Th e informed and responsible person can determine what products and services are pur chased, what kind of energy is used, how much water is consumed, and how the environment is managed. In many respects, our individual daily practi ces can determine whether we achieve a sustainable Hawai'i. Government must lead and set an example. Government is the largest employer and consumer in the state. Its actions and policies can make dramatic shifts on whether we meet our sustainable future , including retrofitting old facilities, purchasing hybrid cars, and buying biodegradable products. The business community can also lead in finding opport unities to move towards sustainable practices. In the long-run, it can be more profitable, and consumers who are rapidly purchasing \"green\" products and serv ices will likely respond accordingly. Engaging young people Young people are our greatest asset. They are open and enthusiastic about sustainability as a mainst ream concept. They use technology to connect with each other on this topic, and are devel oping their own environmental and community-based movement to plan Hawai'i, Sustain Hawai'i, Sustainab ility Saunders and ot her efforts are independently building a sust ainability movement that doesn't resemble anything from a previous generation. This cu ltural phenomenon is best described by a t- shirt seen on a young Maui woman reading \"s ustainability is sexy.\" It is young people who will be able to popularize and energize planning for the future and embed it into the everyday ac tions of the nex t generation. -16- The role of education and public awareness Part of creating a sustainability ethic can be done through the Department of Education and through indepe ndent schools. Integrating a curriculum is a straightforward, measurable way to dire ctly educate the next generation about these concerns. But the effort has to expand beyond that. It has to be embraced by churches, temples, youth groups, canoe clubs and others. This social movement is already buildi ng and it cannot be confined to government action. We must also invest in a public aware ness campaign about sustainability, and encourage cross-sector dialogue to addr ess key long-term and sustainability issues facing our state. STRATEGIC ACTIONS 1. Develop a sustainability ethic. We must understand the implications and me rits of sustainable living. We must develop lifelong learning opportunities and public awareness programs to change behaviors and values in order to develop a sustainability ethic. \u00be Integrate sustainability principles and practices into public and private school curricula. \u00be Develop a statewide marketi ng and public awareness campaign on sustainability principles and practices. 2. Conduct ongoing forums and cr oss-sector dialogue to promote collaboration and progress on achieving Hawai'i's sustainability goals. Achieving sustainability requires the collabor ation of all sectors. It requires collective action, as well as dispute resolution to reconcile potentially competing goals. The thorniest issues occur when economic, cultural preservation and natural resource goals co llide. Providing forums and cross- sector dialogue is important not only for resolving and reconciling competing interests, but for collectively planning for Hawai'i's preferred future. 3. Continually monitor trends and conditions in Hawai'i's economy, society and natural systems. Benchmarks and monitoring systems will make Hawai'i 2050 accountable. The most effective way to implement an acc ountability system is the establishment of a Sustainability Council, a lean quasi- governmental agency whose job is to coordinate sustainability efforts and hold us all accountable to the goals, actions, and indicators in the Hawai'i 2050 plan. -17- INDICATORS We will accomplish this Goal and accompanying Strategic Actions by assessing the following indicators annually: Indicator Why It Matters Possible Data Sources Percentage of all schools that have adopted sustainability modules The more schools that have adopted modules, the more students will understand and embrace sustainability DOE, private schools Percentage of residents understanding and supporting sustainability practices We must reach a high level of awareness of sustainability principles Sustainability Council (proposed) Per capita water consumption Conservation is a leading indicator of a sustainability ethic DLNR, county water departments Per capita energy consumption Conservation is a leading indicator of a sustainability ethic DBEDT, PUC Percentage use of renewable and alternative energy Renewable energy use is a leading indicator of a sustainability ethic DBEDT, PUC Percentage use of solar or other alternative water heating sources Renewable energy use is a leading indicator of a sustainability ethic DBEDT, PUC Number of government, business, labor and community organizations that adopt sustainability practices and policies Sustainability depends on institutional as well as individual actions Sustainability Council (proposed) Percentage of new cars purchased that use renewable fuel technology This measures a community's awareness and practice of sustainability principles DBEDT, PUC -18- Indicator Why It Matters Possible Data Sources Percentage of households participating in recycling Voluntary participation in recycling efforts is a measure of a community's commitment to sustainability DOH, various county public works agencies -19- GRAPHS & CHARTS ON HAWAI'I'S SUSTAINABILY ETHIC Water Municipal water consumption: per capita (de facto population) Energy Percentage of energy used: solar hot water -20- Energy Per capita btu consumption (million btu) -21- WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW . . . ABOUT HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT HAWAI'I'S FUTURE 80.5% of Hawai'i residents believe we should have mandatory recycling programs 78.9% of Hawai'i residents think t he problems Hawai'i will face in the future are solvable 67.3% of Hawai'i residents would be willing to pay more for renewable energy 61.3% of Hawai'i residents would be willing to pay higher taxes in order to protect the environment 19.1% of Hawai'i residents are willi ng to accept moving to the mainland as a consequence of environmental protection 55% of Hawai'i residents are willing to restrict their own use of roads in order to alleviate traffic 68.1% of Hawai'i residents believe that we should protect sites of cultural importance, even if it hurts economic development 36.3% of Hawai'i residents believe the government will be effective in solving Hawai'i's problems Source: Hawai'i 2050 Public Opinion Survey (2007). -22- THE ECONOMY Goal 2: Our diversified and globally competitive economy enables us to meaningfully live, work and play in Hawai'i A sustainable Hawai'i cannot occur without a sustainable economy. For the past three decades, tourism, defens e, construction and agriculture have been the foundation of our economy, and will lik ely be major economic drivers in the years to come. Tourism alone generat es an estimated twenty percent of all economic activity and a quarter of the state's tax revenue. Most Hawai'i residents support keeping the level of tourism and military activity the same. But that shouldn't preclude progress towards creating a more diverse and sustainable economy. For example, the tourism i ndustry has tremendous potential to make progress by reducing its consumption of land, water, energy and other natural resources, as well as leading in the area of protec ting our natural areas. Protecting the environment and operating on a sustainable basis makes perfect sense for Hawai'i's tourism industry - after all, the product that they're selling is Hawai'i's natural and cultural beauty. The need for economic diversification The real challenge is not how to conti nue or improve upon the status quo, but to diversify. Economic diversification is critical for several reasons. Wages in emerging industries such as high tec hnology and knowledge-based industries are high, with an average starting wage of around fifty thousand dollars. Diversification makes our econo my more resilient in the face of an unpredictable future. With Hawai'i's Congressional Delegation procuring the lion's share of defense appropriations, a t ourism industry that depends on overseas economies and low-cost jet fuel, and a construction i ndustry that depends on available land and low interest rates, it is in our inte rest to hedge against these uncertainties. Diversified agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, and knowledge- and innovation- based industries such as high tech, heat h care, biotechnology, film and digital media are important components of building a sustai nable economy. While the private sector and the gover nment have made great strides and investments in these areas, it's vital to sustain and increase these efforts if we are to fundamentally transform our economic equation. We need a well-trained workforce A strong economy also requires a strong workforce. The availability and quality of our workforce needs to be improved. With a current unemployment rate of about 2.5%, we suffer from a worker shortage. Our high school dropout rate is between -23- 15% and 36%, depending on how and who is r eporting the data, reflecting an inability to train skilled workers. At the heart of this matter is the need to strengthen Hawai'i's public education system so that it adequately prepares our young people for the global economy. Functioning infrastructure is critical to economic health Many of our roads, harbors, water and sewer systems are overwhelmed by massive increases in population. We must plan ahead for the financing of infrastructure so that transportation and other vital economic systems are prepared to manage and accommodate planned growth. While this topic is about the public expenditure of funds , it's a high priority for bus iness, because without basic infrastructure, the economy will be ine fficient. From the $341 million education repair and maintenance backlog to the $1. 74 billion worth of sewer system improvements necessary to fix O'ahu's syst em, we need consistently significant investments to maintain public services. In addition to simply planning for inevitable growth, we must be more aggressive in directing growth towards areas that effici ently use infrastructure dollars. Adopting smart growth policies to guide our decisi on-making will maximize the efficient use of infrastructure dollars. STRATEGIC ACTIONS 1. Develop a more diverse and resilient economy. A more diverse and resilient economy will enable us to expand our economic base beyond our current industries. Diversified agriculture, knowledge- and innovation-based industries offer quality em ployment and greater diversity to our economy. However, we cannot simp ly replace one sector of the economy with another in the same way that the vi sitor industry supplanted agriculture as the state's main economic driver. Creating greater resiliency in the economy also means buying locally produced goods and services. As an island state, we may not become totally economically self-sufficient, but there are many products that we can purchase to reduce our dependence on outside sources. \u00be Provide incentives that foster su stainability-related industries, which include, but aren't limited to r enewable energy, innovation and science- based industries, and environmental technologies. \u00be Increase production and consumpt ion of local foods and products, particularly agricultural products. \u00be Increase commercialization and technology transfer between post- secondary institutions and the business sector. -24- 2. Support the building blocks for ec onomic stability and sustainability. The visitor industry, military, constr uction and agriculture are the state's primary creators of jobs and revenue. Ensuring that these pillars of our economy are solid is a basic component of the plan. As with new industries, we must work with mature industrie s to adopt sustainability principles and practices as part of their operations. \u00be Recognize and support established industries such as the visitor industry, military, construction and agriculture as strong components of the Hawai'i economy. \u00be Provide incentives for industries to operate in more sustainable ways. \u00be Attract local and outside capital an d investments in Hawai'i's economic activities. \u00be Reduce regulations and lower the cost of running a business. 3. Increase the competitiveness of Hawai'i's workforce. A qualified workforce has become one of the key issues for business success and economic sustainability. The growth of the technology and agriculture industries will be limited by the availability of skilled labor. For this reason, workforce development is critical to econom ic diversification. Hawai'i's workers must be trained to meet not only our state's workforc e needs, but to compete in the global marketplace. We must prov ide training opportunities to enable our workers to improve their skills. \u00be Invest in and improve our public education system to provide for a skilled workforce. \u00be Create incentives and opportunities for workforce skills upgrade training programs, including the availability of remedial educ ation programs. \u00be Increase student enrollment in pos t-secondary educational programs. \u00be Adopt living wage guideli nes and measurements. -25- 4. Identify, prioritize and fund infr astructure \"crisis points\" that need fixing. Public infrastructure is key to bu ilding a strong economy, protecting our environment and a better quality of life. Great strides have been made since statehood, yet for a sustainable future, we must ensure that our public infrastructure is intact and enables our citizens, business and communities to function properly. Roads, highways, dams, bridges, harbors, airports, water supply and wastewater systems are key functions of su stainable communities. It is essential that we identify and prio ritize our infrastructure needs to adequately allocate resources to maintain and improve them. INDICATORS We will accomplish this Goal and accompanying Strategic Actions by assessing the following: Indicator Why It Matters Possible Data Sources Percentage of local economy by industries and sectors We need to understand whether technology, agriculture, and health care are really making progress relative to the size of the state economy DBEDT, UH Percentage of science- and technology-based workers The number of science- and technology-based workers tells us whether we are diversifying our economy DBEDT, UH, DLIR Number of post-secondary science and engineering students This is a measure of having a high-tech workforce; without high-tech workers, there's no high-tech industry UH, private colleges Gross licensing revenue from commercialized university research Commercializing ideas developed at universities is an important component of a diversified economy UH, private colleges The level of university, government and private sector research and development Research and development activities reflect our ability to provide high-wage, technical jobs UH, U.S. DOD -26- Indicator Why It Matters Possible Date Sources The number of living wage jobs as a percentage of total jobs in Hawai'i, compared to the national average This will measure whether our economy is really creating decent jobs for its people DLIR, UH Dollars spent in locally owned businesses Measuring economic activity for locally owned businesses is one aspect of economic self-sufficiency DBEDT, UH Value of goods and services imported and exported Our economic self-sufficiency is critical.

ABOUT HAWAI'I'S ECONOMY Hawai'i's gross domestic product was $58 billion in 2006, compared to $41 billion in 2001. There are about 643,000 persons in the Hawai'i workforce. Federal spending in 2004 was about $12.2 billion, which exceeded total tourism spending of $10.9 billion. In October 2007, Hawai'i's unemploym ent rate was 2.6%, the lowest in the U.S. In 1956, 133,000 visitors traveled to Hawa i'i. Fifty years later, in 2006, 7.4 million visitors traveled to Hawai 'i. The statewide occupancy rate in 2006 was 79.7%, with the av erage room rate of $186. Since the 1950s, tourism rose from 2% of the economy to currently 20% of the economy. In 2005, high technology jobs compri sed 2.8% of the workforce. The technology sector empl oyed 13,813 workers at an average salary of $57,458, 66% higher than the average wage earner. Innovation-based sectors, including high technology, diversified agriculture, digital media, diversified agriculture, healthcare, biosciences and dual use, comprise of about 5% of the workforce. Between 1985 and 2005, Hawai'i had 1.5 patents per 1,000 people, compared to a nationa l average of 5.5. From 1990 to 2001, Hawai'i's standard of living declined by 0.2% per year, and from 2002-2006, it increased by 2.1% per year. Total agricultural revenue has gone up from $522 millio n to $576 million from 2000 to 2005. In 2006, revenues from the Universi ty of Hawai'i system were $1.2 billion.

Hawai'i's environment at a glance Hawai'i's environment is under signific ant stress. While air and drinking water quality are excellent, there are other disturbing signs. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 64% of Hawai'i's streams are considered \"impaired\" by pollutants. Our ratio of renewable energy (5%) vs. fossil fuel use (95%) is among the worst in the nation. We have not updated our capacity to manage water resources since the plantation era. While we still host some of the most amazing and diverse ecosystems on the planet, they are in peril from the invasion of alien plant and animal species. One- third of all endangered species in the United States are in Hawai'i. We still lack an aggressive, effective, well-funded mechanism to prevent the introduction of pests, even though proven models exist in other states and countries. Nevertheless, Hawai'i's environment is still among the most beautiful and biologically rich in the world. We are blessed with nat ural beauty that is unmatched, bringing millions to Hawai'i to vi sit and see this special place. If we are not careful, however, neglect and unfunded initiatives could threaten our fortunate situation. As we identify goals and actions needed to move towards higher environmental quality, we must remind ourselves that t he \"either-or\" proposition of growth vs. environment, prosperity vs. preservation, is rooted in the past. We must encourage economic growth that directly contributes to environmental progress. Energy and global warming As we look towards a sustainable future, we must also prepare for the realities of rising fuel costs and climate change. Our ener gy picture is a tale of two worlds. The U.S. Department of E nergy has indicated that we are one of the best positioned states for renewable ener gy potential, with abundant wind, solar, geothermal and other resources. Yet, we perform among the worst in terms of using renewable energy sources. This stems from a lack of political will and capital investment, a regulatory scheme that seems to disco urage renewables, and a not in my backyard attitude that seems to preven t projects from getting off the ground. The result so far is that we continue to rely almost solely on imported fossil fuels. -33- There is irrefutable evidence that globa l warming is real and occurring at an alarming rate. As the planet warms over t he next fifty years, sea levels are rising, impacting our coastal areas. Hawai'i could also be struck by stronger and more frequent storms because of these changes. Homes, hotels, businesses, harbors and waterfront properties are increasingly at risk. We must aggressively address the impact of global warming and rising sea le vels for our island state. Our state has some of the best scholars and res earchers in the world housed at the University of Hawai'i. We must take advantage of their exper tise and ensure that we are prepared to address the realities of climate change. Public support is strong for environmental protection As Hawai'i 2050 public opinion poll demonstr ated, the overwhelming majority of Hawai'i citizens are committed to protecting Hawai'i's environment. The depth of that conviction varies depending on one's pers pective, but the fact is that we are a community that understands what it means to aloha 'aina (love and respect for the land), and are willing to make sacrifices to keep what is special about our home. There is a tendency for people to think that economic productivity and use of natural resources inevitably must lead to its degradation, but that doesn't have to be the case. With proper planning and coordination, the goals of economic development and environmental protec tion can be mutually reinforced and simultaneously achieved. STRATEGIC ACTIONS 1. Reduce reliance on fossil (carbon-based) fuels. Energy use pervades all aspects of contemporary life, from vehicles to air conditioners, computers, dishwashers and dryers. About 95% of our primary energy supply is imported fossil fuel that contributes to global warming and the deterioration of our envir onment. There are other sources of energy that can be produced locally. We must reduce our reliance on fossil fuels by expanding renewable energy opportunities. We must rethink how we use energy by improving efficiencies in all that we do. \u00be Expand renewable energy opportunities. \u00be Increase energy efficiency in priv ate and public buildings, including retrofitting existing buildings. \u00be Improve energy efficiencies and options in transportation. \u00be Encourage the production and use of locally produced bio-fuels. -34- \u00be Adopt building codes that encour age \"green building\" technology. \u00be Encourage all government agencies to adopt sustainable practices, including purchasing hybrid cars , buying biodegradable products, and mandating recycling. 2. Conserve water and ensure adequate water supply. We consume the most water per capita in the United States, 18% higher than the national average. The decline in agriculture gives our aquifers temporary relief, but with projected development and t he use of agricultural lands for fuel production, usage will increase dramatically . A projected population increase of 300,000 residents by 2030 and increased demand for water from all sectors will further tax this precious resour ce. We must care for and manage our watersheds, uphold water quality standards, and support adequate infrastructure for residential, commercial and agricultural use. \u00be Reduce water consumption by means of education and incentives. \u00be Encourage greater production and use of recycled water. \u00be Continually review water-conserving technologies for possible incorporation in county building codes. \u00be Encourage price structures for wate r use that furthers conservation. \u00be Require water conservation plans from large private users. 3. Increase recycling, reuse a nd waste reduction strategies. Recycling, reuse and waste reduction cuts down on the amount of energy and raw materials to make products, and r educes waste in the landfill. Paper products, glass, plastics, building mate rials, petroleum products, chemicals, and even cellular phones can be recycled or reused. This is one of the most straightforward strategic actions that can be undertaken now. Hawai'i's people are enthusiastic and determined about recycli ng. In fact, most want recycling mandated, and they want it now. 4. Provide greater protection for air, and land-, fresh water- and ocean based habitats. We are home to the most rare and sensitive ecosystems in the world, from upland rainforests to coral reefs. They form the foundat ion of our society from a biological and cultural per spective. It's important to understand that our most pristine areas will not stay as they are if we just leave them alone. Because of -35- invasive species, we need conservation officers on the ground, in the forests and marine habitats, monitoring these places and making sure that their biological integrity is pres erved. The greatest threat to the health of our most biologically rich ecosystems is not ju st development - it is weeds. By protecting our habitat, we protect our native species. By protecting both, we ensure biological sustainability. \u00be Strengthen enforcement of habitat management. \u00be Fund public and private conservation education. \u00be Improve management of protected watershed areas. \u00be Incorporate the values and philo sophy of the ahupua'a resource management system as appropriate. \u00be Establish funding for invasive species control and native ecosystems protection. 5. Conserve agricultural, open space and conservation lands and resources. We need to better conserve agricultural lands, open space and conservation lands. Integrating \"smart growth\" pr inciples and compact patterns of urban development will enable us to better utilize urban lands and develop more sustainable communities. Building \"up\" ra ther than \"out\" will minimize sprawl, and better conserve our agricultural, open space and conservation lands. \u00be Create compact patterns of urban development. \u00be Encourage \"smart growth\" concepts in land use and community planning. 6. Research and strengthen management initiatives to respond to rising sea levels, coastal hazards, erosion and other natural hazards. With the realities of climate change, it is not outlandish to th ink that beachfront hotels in Waikiki could be under water some day. We must a ggressively address the impact of global warming and rising sea levels for our island state. -36- 7. Develop a comprehensive environmental mapping and measurement system to evaluate the overall health and status of Hawai'i's natural ecosystems. Caring for the environment cannot be done on a piece-meal basis. Streams impact lands; lands impact the coast; the coast impacts our fisheries. We need a comprehensive way to research, study and evaluate the status our ecosystem. INDICATORS We will accomplish this Goal and accompanying Strategic Actions by assessing the following: Indicator Why It Matters Possible Data Sources Percentage of renewable and alternative energy produced locally Production of local energy sources helps lessen the demand for imported energy DBEDT, PUC Percentage of solid waste recycled and diverted from landfills A sustainable society will re-use most waste, and landfills will not be constantly full DOH, county public works departments Percentage of treated wastewater reused This is one of the best large-scale ways to preserve the integrity of our aquifers DLNR, county water departments Percentage of lands and water protected for native plants and animals With the most biologically rich state in the union, the amount of land set aside will help determine how well we are likely to preserve these ecosystems DLNR Percentage of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-type building permits issued LEED-type design is a nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high performance \"green\" buildings.

One-fourth of these species are found only in Hawai'i 64% of Hawai'i's streams and one-half of bays and estuaries have been designated \"impaired\" 95% of Hawai'i's coastline areas have \"good\" water quality More than 98% of Hawai'i's dr inking water is from groundwater From 1980 to 2000, Hawai'i water use has dropped 52% largely due to the decline in agriculture Hawai'i imports nearly all of its fuel, and about 95% of it is either coal or oil Transportation accounts for half of Hawai'i's energy consumption (48%), compared with residential (13%), comme rcial (14%), and industrial (25% uses) For homes, electricity is 90% of the energy used, compared with liquid gas and propane (6%) and solar heated water (4%) Geothermal energy could generate more than 200 megawatts of electricity statewide 40% of solid waste is import ed paper products and petroleum-based plastics Source: Hawai'i 2050 Issue Book (2007). -43- COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING Goal 4: Our community is strong, heal thy, vibrant and nurturing, providing safety nets for those in need. Quality of life encompasses safe, ca ring, and engaged communities; healthy, sustainable surroundings; quality job opportunities for present and future generations; access to quality educati on, housing and health care; adequate, well- maintained infrastructure and government al services; access to recreational facilities and leisure activities; and positive interaction and respect among the citizenry. With Hawai'i 2050, we have a unique opportunity to identify the kind of society we want - where people live with dignity and respect, and the basic requirements of food, shelter, health care, safety and educati on are not only met but are exceeded. We are fortunate that our di verse and multi-cultural comm unity currently provides a strong foundation for such a quality of life. The aloha spirit is still pervasive, and there is respect amongst our cultures. Li ving on an island has created a culture of collaboration and working toget her. We have the makings of a community that when determined can achieve great things. Addressing social impediments now Over the years, however, it seems t hat we run into the same issues and challenges that impede our abilit y to provide for a high qua lity of life. Our unmet social challenges tear at the fabric of our communities, and undermine our economy, communities and environment. For example, at an average price of $650,000 for a single family home, our housing is among the highest in the United States. Our household median income in Hawai'i is approximately $51,400, which means that unless conditions change, the average family won't be able to buy the average house, an d they will be lucky to find an affordable rental. Our quality of life is also impacted by how our educational system prepares us for the job market and for dealing with life's complexities an d challenges. Excellence in education is especially important in this increasingly technology-based and globally competitive world. A mediocre system presents unacceptable risks for all of us. While we've made progress in te rms of educational a ttainment - 88% of residents over 25 have a high school degree and 27% have at least an undergraduate degree - we lag in terms of basic proficiency. In 2007, only 22% of our eighth grade public school students met proficiency standards for math, and 20% for reading. -44- Caring for our youth, families and the elderly How society treats our youth, families and the elderly is reflective of the overall health of our community. Hawai'i's elderly population is growing faster than our ability to provide quality care and housing. We have a dire shortage of nursing home beds, with 24 beds per 1,000, compared to a national average of 43 per 1,000. We must begin to treat elderly care as an urgent economic, social and moral issue. Likewise, we must ensure that our fam ilies and youth are suppor ted and nurtured. For example, after-school programs, s ports, musical and other extracurricular activities beyond the school day help keep kids out of trouble; provide expanded learning opportunities and interests; and enhance social skills that make for well-rounded citizens. The choices we make today ar e essential for tomorrow The quality of our lives in 2050 will depend on choices we make today. We can choose to be a place where jobs, productivity, wages and educational achievements grow and economic disparities are reduced. We can choose to make our transportation system more effi cient and create a sufficient quantity of affordable housing. We can choose to prevent abuse and discrimination, and end poverty. We can choose to be a compassi onate society. Or we can choose not to. Now is the time to boldly confront t hese social issues - once and for all. STRATEGIC ACTIONS 1. Strengthen social safety nets. Having a safe and decent place to live, access to health care, and a safe haven when difficult times are upon us are measures of a humane and compassionate society. In creating a sustainable Hawai'i, we must be sure that our social safety nets are in place to provide the basic necessities of living with dignity and respect. In particular, we must ensure that Hawai'i's poor and needy populations are taken care of, prov iding them with the basic necessities of a dignified life, as well as hope, opportunity and the necessary tools for gaining self-sufficiency once again. We must more effectively address major problems that put our societ y at risk, such as drug abuse, mental illness, crime and violence. \u00be Increase affordable housing opportunities for households up to 140% of median income. \u00be Ensure access to affordable health care for all residents. \u00be Reduce crime and violence. -45- \u00be Provide access to elderly housing, care-giving and other long-term care services. \u00be Invest in greater prevention and treatment of those suffering from substance abuse and mental illness. \u00be Increase awareness of and competency in financial literacy and asset building. \u00be Strengthen the nonprofit sector, philanthropy and volunteerism. \u00be Ensure that persons with disabilities are afforded equal opportunity to participate and excel in all aspects of community life. \u00be Provide after-school and extra-curri cular programs to enable Hawai'i's youth to broaden their life experiences. 2. Improve public transportation infrastructure and alternatives. A quality transportation system is more than getting from home to work quickly. It links people to places and provides oppor tunities for social interaction, recreation and community engagement. It enables the flow of commerce, ensuring that business will transport their goods and services to their destination in a timely and cost-effective way. We must alleviate traffic congestion through varied means, ranging fr om increasing access to varied modes of public transportations, to tele commuting, to providing alternatives to using motorized vehicles. \u00be Increase access to public transportation. \u00be Reduce traffic congestion. \u00be Encourage and provide incentives for telecommuting. \u00be Increase and improve bicycle and pedestr ian facilities, including multi- use pathways. 3. Strengthen public education. Our quality of life is impacted by how our educational system prepares us for the job market and for deal ing with life's complexities in general. Quality education is especially important in a rapidly evolving world that has become increasingly technology-bas ed and globally competit ive. The educational process begins before preschool in the preparation of our young children for an -46- environment of lifelong learning. This includes making sure that our schools are clean, cool, comfortable and safe ; providing teachers with adequate salaries and opportunities for profe ssional development; and ensuring that educational support services are provided to all children of Hawai'i public schools. We must, once and for all, fix our public education system. \u00be Support parenting, educational and financ ial literacy initiatives that span early childhood through lifelong learning. \u00be Increase high school graduation rates. \u00be Strengthen career pathways for te chnical and trade schools that enhance Hawai'i's workforce. \u00be Support post-secondary and distance learning programs that broaden personal and professional learning opportunities. 4. Provide access to diverse recreat ional facilities and opportunities. Parks, recreational and leisure activities enhance our quality of life by providing facilities, services and programs that m eet the emotional, social and physical needs of communities. This is especially critical given the inclinations that many young people have towards computers, handheld devices and video games. In a sustainable Hawai'i, our young people will continue to play sports, surf, paddle, dance hula, hike, and sing, and not become a culture singularly obsessed with iPods and the latest gadgets. Providing access to recreational facilities and activities to meet the va ried needs of differing communities (e.g., rural, urban, large and small communities ) are important aspects of a healthy quality of life. -47- INDICATORS We will accomplish this Goal and accompanying Strategic Actions by assessing the following: Indicator Why It Matters Possible Data Sources Percentage of rental and for purchase housing stock that is affordable for persons earning up to 140% of median income This is the most direct measure of the affordability of Hawai'i housing HPHA, HHFDC Percentage of population owning residential dwelling units as their principle place of residence Homeownership is a critical measure of a community's stability and prosperity HPHA, HHFDC Percentage of population covered by health insurance This is a direct measure of access to health care DOH, DHS Percentage of population using public transportation Public transportation reduces traffic congestion and enables many Hawai'i residents to be more mobile, increasing opportunities to work and play in Hawai'i DOT Percentage of population ridesharing Ridesharing eases congestion on our roads and highways DOT Commute time for residents Less time in traffic means a higher quality of life, and helps our economy to run efficiently DOT Percent change in annual vehicle miles traveled These data will show whether or not the implementation of smart growth results in people living, working, and playing in the same neighborhoods DOT Percentage of total non- motorized trips Walking and biking reduce congestion on the roads and pollution from vehicles DOT High school graduation rates A well-educated populace is critical to sustainability DOE, private schools -48- Indicator Why It Matters Possible Data Sources Proportion of high school students going on to post-secondary education Continuing education opens up opportunities for higher wages and better career opportunities DOE, UH, private colleges Substance abuse rates Social ills like substance abuse reflect the health and of our community DOH Proportion of family income spent on housing Hawai'i residents spend significantly more on housing than the U.S. national average DBEDT, HHFDC, HPHA Percentage of population engaged in volunteer work Volunteerism demonstrates the strong bonds in our community DLIR Percentage of population with Internet access at their residence Internet use shows our ability to communicate and gather information, and our inclination to use technology DCCA Out migration rates of high school graduates Demonstrates social and economic opportunity in Hawai'i DOE Percentage of children enrolled in pre-school Pre-school is one of the building blocks of future educational success DOE, privates schools Number and diversity of recreational facilities and activities per capita This measures the availability of recreational resources for Hawai'i residents DBEDT -49- GRAPHS & CHARTS ON HAWAI'I'S CO MMUNITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE Income and poverty Percentage of students receiving free or reduced-cost lunch in 2005 Education for a sustainable Hawai'i Percentage of population 25 years and over completing HS, Bachelor's Degree or more -50- Transportation Annual delay per peak traveler Housing Median home price relative to affordable price -51- Housing Home ownership rate Caring community Percent of adults who feel they can rely on others in their community in 2005 -52- Caring community Percent of adults who volunteer in 2005 AVERAGE SALES PRICES FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOME AND CONDOMINIUMS -53- WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW . . .

Hawai'i residents statewide expressed their respect and aloha for the traditions and values of the Kanaka Maoli and divers e island cultures that make our state unique. One of the strongest themes that emerged from Ha wai'i 2050 was that residents, whether they were born here or not, were attracted to and remain in Hawai'i because of our island values and lifestyle. Diversity in practice Although we are the most ethnically diverse state in the nation, Hawai'i's diversity isn't best appreciated or described through dat a. It's most eas ily understood at the beach parks, where multi-ethnic foods ar e eaten by tens of thousands of people every weekend, and people of all colors and backgrounds come together to enjoy each other and our natural environment. T hese celebrations occur for reasons large and small - baby luaus, marriages, f ootball games and surf contests. They show us what Hawai'i is all about - divers ity in practice, not in theory, and the joy that comes with a disorganized and unsel fconscious mixing of cultures, culinary traditions and people. Why are we able to behave this way wit h each other when so many other ethnically diverse places experience more strife, hardship and animosity? Hawaiian culture is where it all starts. This island way of life originates with Hawai'i's indigenous people - the Kanaka Maoli. The renaissance of Kanaka Maoli culture Over the last several generations, Kanaka Maoli culture has undergone a remarkable renaissance. Many of us can remember when only a few Kanaka Maoli cultural practitioners were left, and the Kanaka Maoli lang uage and cultural practices seemed on the brink of vanishing. Within t he lifetimes of many people today, research and practice in Kanaka Maoli culture, arts and history have flourished. The performances of music and hula have increased dramatically in Hawai'i and throughout the world. We mu st ensure that our Kanaka Maoli and island values and cultures are preserv ed and perpetuated. Such traditions and value systems bind and enrich us all, providing a values-based guide for behavior. -55- Building on diversity for the future Likewise Hawai'i's ethnic diversity and resu lting multi-culturalism have contributed significantly to making our state unique. Our many and diverse ethnic groups include but are not limited to African Am erican, Caucasian, Chinese, Filipino, Hispanic, Japanese, Jewish, Kanaka M aoli, Korean, Laotian, Portuguese, Samoan, Tahitian and Vietnamese; all contri bute to the vitality of our community. These cultures and traditions make for a colorful and diverse lifestyle. To preserve our island values, we need to recognize the primacy of the Kanaka Maoli while cultivating the ac tive participation of people of all ethnicities in their practices. Community and ethnic organizations must be supported to ensure that our traditions continue to live and thrive through dance, festivals, education and art. -56- STRATEGIC ACTIONS 1. Honor Kanaka Maoli culture and heritage. Kanaka Maoli culture is the foundation for living culture in Hawai'i. We must ensure that the Kanaka Maoli people are supported, and t hat culture is perpetuated. The success of this endeavor will ensure the way of the Kanaka Maoli will guide our actions and behaviors in the years ahead. \u00be Ensure the existence of and support for public and private entities which further the betterment of Kanaka Maoli. \u00be Increase fluency in Kanaka Maoli lan guage. It is one of the official languages of Hawai'i. \u00be Sponsor cross-sector dialogue on Kanaka Maoli culture and island values. \u00be Protect Kanaka Maoli intellectual property and related traditional knowledge. \u00be Provide Kanaka Maoli cult ural education for residents, visitors and the general public. 2. Celebrate our cultural diver sity and island way of life. Our diversity likewise defines us. Ensuring that our cultural practices flourish, through language, dance, song and art is cruc ial to sustaining who we are as a people. We must protect and nurture a ll aspects of our diverse history, traditions and cultures. \u00be Identify and protect the places, features and sacred spaces that give Hawai'i its unique character and cultural significance. \u00be Increase the number of educators w ho teach cultural and historic education. 3. Enable Kanaka Maoli and others to pursue traditional Kanaka Maoli lifestyles and practices. We must provide opportunities to those who want to pursue and perpetuate the way of the Kanaka Maoli. \u00be Provide Kanaka Maoli mentors with opportunities to pass on Hawaiian culture and knowledge to the nex t generation of Kanaka Maoli and others. The power of wisdom comes from communication. -57- \u00be Perpetuate Kanaka Maoli food produc tion associated with land and ocean traditions and practices. 4. Provide support for subsistenc e-based businesses and economies. We must create opportunities for the K anaka Maoli practice of subsistence- based businesses and economies, and remove the hurdles to their start-ups and development. Such traditional cultural practices are an economic alternative to Western forms of tra de and commerce. Subsistence fishing, gathering, hunting and farming on Moloka 'i are examples of subsistence-based economies that are viable. INDICATORS We will accomplish this Goal and accompanying Strategic Actions by assessing the following: Indicator Why It Matters Possible Data Sources Percentage of students enrolled in Kanaka Maoli language classes at the secondary and post-secondary levels Language fluency is a key characteristic of preserving culture DOE, UH, private schools and colleges Number of teachers teaching the language of the Kanaka Maoli Language teachers are the key to perpetuating the language and culture DOE, UH, private schools and colleges Number of hula halau and ethnic dance groups Residents participating in Hawai'i's cultural activities show the strength of our multi-ethnic culture OHA, SFCA Per capita government and private expenditures on culture and the arts Public and private expenditure for culture and arts tell us how dedicated we are in furthering our island culture and values SFCA -58- Indicator Why It Matters Possible Data Sources Attitudinal survey of the perpetuation of Kanaka Maoli culture and island values (aka the \"Aloha index\") To determine whether we embrace cultural and sustainability values, we will conduct an attitudinal survey. This will help us understand the level of awareness and commitment of our residents in living aloha. OHA, Sustainability Council (proposed) Number of laws enacted that protect Kanaka Maoli intellectual property and traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, art forms and site-specific areas including language, dialects, place names and resource practices The indicator reflects the willingness and ability to preserve our important Kanaka Maoli resources OHA Number of community programs and projects that promote Hawaiian culture, knowledge, traditions and practices through the means of the Hawaiian language The number of institutions and activities that promote Hawaiian culture is reflective of how we are progressing in perpetuating Kanaka Maoli and island culture OHA Amount of capital provided to sustain subsistence- based business and economies The level of investment in the development of cultural and economic opportunities to live and work in a subsistence-based community tells us how committed we are in furthering those cultural practices OHA, DBEDT -59- CHARTS AND GRAPHS ABOUT OUR ISLAND LIFESTYLE STUDENT ETHNIC DIVERSITY IN THE HAWAI'I PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM Hawai'i's Students by Ethnicity Percent Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian 26.1 Filipino 20.0 Caucasian 14.7 Japanese 11.0 Samoan 3.5 Chinese 3.2 Hispanic 2.6 African American 2.4 Portuguese 2.0 Korean 1.4 American Indian 0.5 Indo-Chinese 0.5 Other 12.3 Source: Department of Education STUDENT ETHNIC DIVERSITY OF AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI'I SYSTEM Source: University of Hawai'i -60- WHAT YOU KNOW . . .

This workforce earned $1.08 billion, which average wages of $42,000, 16% higher than the average wage earner in Hawai'i. Heritage and preservation grants fr om the State Foundation on Culture and the Arts include funding for Samoan fl ag day celebration in Hawai'i, the Okinawan cultural day camp fo r children, the Portugese ethnic festival and the Hawaiian Scottish festival. Last year, the Hawai'i Tourism Authority fund ed one hundred fifty nine festivals and natural resource events.

They are ranked in priority order. Thes e strategic actions are not all of the necessary activities to create a sustainable future for Hawai'i; but are essential to address immediately to ensure our goals are met in 2050. The Task Force identified the year 2020 as a target date to meet our interim goals. About the 2020 suggested benchmarks Below you will find a sampling of sugges ted benchmarks to measure progress in implementing the priority actions. We ant icipate that some of these benchmarks will be a useful starting point while others may be changed or modified as more information becomes available. However, even without complete information, the Task Force believed that it is critical to have numerical target s inserted at the outset, so that the dialogue on sust ainability goals can begin now. We recommend the Sustainability Council modify, correct, and improve upon these benchmarks as one of their first orders of business. Through expert testimony, obtaining and evaluating baseline dat a, and discussions with government and private instit utions with knowledge in these areas, they can finalize and ratify the benchmarks as offici al 2020 priority actions and targets. These benchmarks are intended to initiate discussion rather than be approved or ratified immediately. Additional benchmarks for each priority item can and should be added by the Sustainability Council if appropriate. Where available, we use official government benchmarks that are already established. 1) Increase affordable housing oppor tunities for households up to 140% of median income. (Goal 4, Strategic Action 1) Why this matters: We define affordable housing as for purchase or rental housing that households earning up to 140% of the area median income can afford. The Hawai'i Housing Finance Deve lopment Corporation (\"HHFDC\") states that another indicator of ho using affordability is the shelter-to- income ratio of 30% or below. A ratio exceeding 30% generally indicates cost burden or housing that is not affordable. Without affordable housing, Hawai'i's low- and middle-income cannot afford a place to live, and many of our most promising young people will move to the mainland. -62- Where we are now: According to the Housing Policy Study (2006), there were 435,818 housing units in 2006. Of that , 260,986 are owner-occupied. The remaining 174,832 units are rental units , of which 48.2% of renters are cost burdened. 51.8% or 90,563 of rental units are affordable. The Housing Policy Study also indicated that about 54.2% of households statewide pay less than 30% of income for housing. Housing for this group is affordabl e. 34% of households are cost burdened (11.3% of households pay 30- 40% of income for housing and 22.7% have housing payments ex ceeding 40% of income). 2020 Suggested Benchmarks: Hawai'i's shelter-to-income ratio is nearing the national ratio of 22% of income spent for homeowner housing, and 30% for rental housing (Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 2005). The HHFDC estimates that in the next five years (2007-2011) there is an estimated need for approximately 23,000 affordable and workforce housing units. HHFDC seeks to meet that demand. 2) Strengthen public education. (Goal 2, Strategic Action 3; Goal 4, Strategic Action 3) Note: This stra tegic action includes both workforce and community development aspec ts of public education. Why this matters: A high quality public education system builds a strong economy and skilled workforce, a more cohesive community, and fewer social problems. Where we are now: The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) conducts a national representative and continuing assessment of what America's public school students know in various subject areas. In 2007, 33% and 26% of Hawai'i's grade 4 students were \"proficient\" in math and reading, respectively. In grade 8, 21% and 20% of students were proficient in math and reading, respectively. According to DBEDT, in 2005, about 27% of adults age 25 or more had four year college degrees. The 2000 U. S. Census reported that 56.1% of adults age 25 or more had some college or higher. -63- 2020 Suggested Benchmark: The Department of Education projec ts that by 2019, 61% and 35% of grade 4 students will be proficient in math and reading, respectively. The DOE also projects that 31% and 22% of grade 8 students will be proficient in mathematics and reading by 2019, respectively. The Task Force suggest that the DOE projections serve as a starting point for discussion on 2020 proficiency goals. The P-20 Initiative, a public-private e ffort to improve l earning in Hawai'i, recommends that 55% of working adults living in Hawai'i have two- or four-year college degrees by 2025. 3) Reduce reliance on fossil fuels. (Goal 3, Strategic Action 1) Why this matters: Global warming is real, and the environmental and economic costs of fossil fuels are skyrocketing. Where we are now: About 5% of our total energy is fr om renewable sources. The remainder is fossil fuel-based. 78% of those sources were imported from foreign countries, and 22% from domestic sour ces, principally Alaska. About 8% of electricity generated is from renewable sources. 2020 Suggested Benchmark: Pursuant to Act 95 (SLH 2004), Hawai'i's existing renewable portfolio standard (RPS) goal was replaced wit h an enforceable standard. Under the new standard, 20% of electricity is to be generated from renewable resources by the end of 2020. 4) Increase recycling, reuse and waste reduction strategies. (Goal 3, Strategic Action 3) Why this matters: Much of our waste can be reused. As an island state we are running out of landfill space and must find alternat ives to reducing the amount of waste disposed in landfills. Where we are now: -64- Waste diversion or landfill divers ion can cut down on the need for more dumps. Landfill diversion can occu r through recycling, reusing or biological treatment of solid waste. The state wide landfill diversion rate is 31.4%. On O'ahu, about 57% of our solid waste is diverted by waste- to-energy and material recycling activiti es. The diversion rate for the Big Island is 24% (2006); Kaua'i's is 21% (2005); Suggested Benchmark: 50% of Hawai'i's municipal solid wa ste will be diverted. By 2014, the City & County of Honolulu expects to divert 79% of it s municipal solid waste. 5) Develop a more diverse and resilient economy. (Goal 2, Strategic Action 1) Why this matters: In order to withstand ex ternal economic shocks such as war, rising fuel costs, and recessions, we must have several pillars which anchor our economy. Technology and k nowledge-based jobs are potential pillars to diversify our economy. Where we are now: According to Enterprise Honolulu, the innovation sector, which includes technology, diversified agriculture, alternative energy, earth, ocean and space sciences, dual use, healthcare, biosciences and digital media industries, account for about 5% of all jobs in Hawai'i. Average wage (2004) of entire innovation industries workforce was $47,262. According to the Department of Bu siness, Economic Devel opment & Tourism, in 2005, just technology jobs alone tota led 13,813. This represents 2.8 percent of all private se ctor jobs in Hawai'i. The average wage in the high technology sector was $57,458, which is 66% above the overall private sector average. 2020 Suggested Benchmark: Enterprise Honolulu suggests that t he innovation sector comprise 7% of all private sector jobs. -65- 6) Develop a sustainability ethic. (Goal 1, Strategic Action 1) Why this matters: If Hawai'i's people understand and believe in sustainability, the goals of Hawai'i 2050 will be achieved. The result will be a change in consumer behavior - by individuals as well as institutional us ers. We will the conserve water and electricity, recycle, purchase biodegradable products, and buy local foods and products. Where we are now: No benchmark data on this polling question is available yet. However, according to a 2007 Hawai'i 2050 public opinion poll, about 80% of the population favors a \"triple-bottom line\" or balanced approach to Hawai'i's future, a key component of sustainability. 2020 Suggested Benchmark: 85% of Hawai'i residents consider sustainability to be a \"critically important\" issue to our state. The Task Force also suggests setting benchmarks on various aspects of consumer behavior, including per capi ta water consumption; per capita alternative energy consumed; use of solar water heating sources; and participation rate in recycling programs. 7) Increase production and consumpt ion of local foods and products, particularly agricultural products . (Goal 2, Strategic Action 1) Why this matters: Food self-sufficiency is one of the foundations of a sustainable community. Thriving local farms also help preserve green space and a rural way of life, and make us less vu lnerable to external catastrophes. Where we are now: About 15% of the food we consume is grown locally. About 35% of fruits and vegetables consumed are grown locally. 2020 Suggested Benchmark: The UH College of Tropical Agri culture and Human Resources (CTAHR) estimates that it is reasonable that 30% of food consumed can be grown -66- locally. CTAHR also estimates th at 85% of fruits and vegetables we consume can be grown locally. 8) Provide access to long-term care and elderly housing. (Goal 4 Strategic Action 1) Why this matters: The elderly population is growing mo re quickly than our current capacity to house and care for them. Where we are now: According to the Hawai'i Health In formation Corporation, Hawai'i's long- term bed rate of 24 beds per 1,000 re sidents aged 65 and older is about one-half that of the U.S. rate of 43 beds per 1000. 2020 Suggested Benchmark: Upward movement towards 40 beds per 1,000 residents aged 65 and older is desired. These amounts we re suggested by long-term care specialists in the field. 9) Preserve and perpetuate our Kanaka Maoli and island cultural values. (Goal 5, Strategic Actions 1 & 2). Why this matters: Hawai'i's ethnic diversity and multi-culturalism have cont ributed significantly to making our state unique. Support for cu lture and the arts ensures that our traditions continue to live and thrive thr ough dance, festivals, education and music. Where we are now: No data currently compiled. An annual population survey could be conducted to measure this activity. 2020 Suggested Benchmark: Hawai'i residents attend a cultural event at least once a quarter. -67- FROM PLANNING TO ACTION: SUSTAINABILITY COUNCIL We must act. Without a vehicle for im plementation, Hawai 'i 2050 could sit on a shelf. Without a mechanism for accountability, Hawai' i 2050 might answer to no one. While the Task Force has been instru mental in creati ng Hawai'i 2050, it wasn't empowered to implement the plan. By law, the Task Force will sunset on June 30, 2008. We have four specific recommendations to keep the momentum going. RECOMMENDATION 1: Focus on and impl ement policy priorities actions for an intermediate benchmark for 2020. Hawai'i's 2050 planning process identified nine (9) priori ty issues that our citizens, stakeholders and experts felt needed to be addr essed now. This will take us to the year 2020 as an intermediate benchmar k. These nine strategic actions will begin the process of addressing key element s of the Hawai'i 2050 plan. Do them now, and we're on our way towards a sustainable Hawai'i. RECOMMENDATION 2: Establish an implementing entity - The Sustainability Council. The Sustainability Council will be a continuing, governmental organization with a budget and staff. These resources will be essential to carrying forward the Hawai'i 2050 Plan, measuring results and building a publicly accessible bank of knowledge about sustainability. The specific responsibilities, budget, revenue source and authorities of the body will be determined by the Legislature. If the Legislature passes a law establishing the Sustainability Council, it would make Hawai'i a national leader in pursuing sustainability in a serious, strategic way. It is the single most important acti on that the Legislature can take to advance the cause of sustainability and move Hawa i'i towards its preferred future. It will also further cross-sector dialogue and accountability on these vital issues. In keeping with Hawai'i 2050's spirit of the \"people's plan,\" the Task Force recommends that the Council be a diverse cr oss-section of individuals, most of whom would be nominated by the public. A broad range of public representation on the Sustainability Council will ensure open communications and cross-sector dialogue among the stakeholders, a crucial factor in moving Hawai'i toward sustainability. Ultimately, the Council will serve as a focal point for action - a central entity, responsive to the public that will help Hawai'i navigate us towards a sustainable future. -68- What the Council woul d and would not do An overwhelming majority of those we asked, surveyed and polled recognize the need for creating an implementi ng entity. Some, however , are skeptical of the need for another government agency to ov ersee and coordinate the State's sustainability efforts. We agree that the establishment of a new government entity should be done deliberately, sk eptically and with precision. That is why we recommend that the Sustainability Council be small in its operational budget, and not regulatory in function. It should not r eplace the Office of Environmental Quality Control, Land Use Commission, Public Utilities Commission, county planning commissions, the State Office of Planning, or the Department of Land & Natural Resources. It would be similar in size and scope to the State's Council on Revenues, which annually predicts tax revenues, and is a highly credible entity that impacts both public and private action. It was also suggested that implement ing Hawai'i 2050 be administered by a nonprofit or private entity. It would be difficult for a nongovernmental entity to oversee the coordination, management and benchmarking of an official government plan and activity, particularly where many of the initiatives required government action and policy changes. T he proposed Sustainab ility Council will make sure that the strategic action s in Hawai'i 2050 are pursued, that the indicators are paid attention to, and that the effort towards a sustainable 2050 and our preferred future keeps its momentum. Details of the Sustainability Council This Sustainability Council woul d have: 1) a governing board; 2) authority to hire an executive director and st aff; 3) appropriate powers and duties to carry out its mission; and 4) a funding mechanism to support the agency's activities. The Sustainability Council is intended to be a gov ernmental entity, initially located in the Office of the Auditor, then tran sferred to the Office of Planning for administrative purposes only. Its vo ting board members would comprise both public officials and private citiz ens more fully described below. Council Composition and Nominations The Sustainability Council would comprise a diverse cross-section of community leaders that will provide the necessary leadership and expertise in creating a sustainable future for Ha wai'i. The Council woul d comprise the following members: *Total members: Seventeen (17). Fi fteen non-voting, ex-officio members. *Governmental appointments: Six (6) me mbers from the following: One (1) member appointed by the Governor; one (1) member appointed by each of -69- the four (4) Mayors; and one (1) mem ber appointed by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. These appointments need not be restricted to government officials. *Public members: Nine (9) members appointed by the Governor. The Governor shall consider the followi ng areas of statewide expertise and interests, including but not limited to, the Kanaka Maoli, business, science & technology, labor, environment, multi-cult ures, visitor industry, military, agriculture, education, health & human services, and young adults. The intent of representation in these suggested categories is to create a board that has statewide knowledge of key sectors and components of the community. Youth representation: One of the nine public members shall represent Hawai'i's youth under 25 years of age. County representation: F our of the nine public members shall reside in each of the four counties. Ex-officio (non-voting) members: Designees of t he Department of Education and the Office of Planning. Terms: Four (4) year staggered terms. Nominations: A call for nominations from the general public will be solicited. All nominees are subject to confirmation by the State Senate. Scope and Function of the Sustainability Council The Sustainability Council will coordinate, implement, measure and evaluate the progress of Hawai'i 2050 and activities. The primary functions of the Su stainability Council will be to: Coordinate and implement the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan Collect and analyze data on the approved sustainability indicators Publish and promot e an annual \"report card\" on the indicators Convene statewide summits and forums on sustainability Sponsor cross-sector dialogue to address key sustainability issues Direct an ongoing public awarene ss and education campaign about sustainability Recommend legislation and advocate for sustainability in Hawai'i's public policy arena Every five years, revise and amend the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan as appropriate Conduct a periodic review and audi t of sustainability activities -70- Negotiate and execute contracts as necessary to achieve the functions listed above. The Task Force recomm ends that the Sustainability Council be exempt from the Hawai 'i public procurement code. Advisory Sub-groups To implement and advise the Sustainability Council, advi sory sub-groups may be created in the following categories that are in accord with the Hawai'i 2050 Sustainability Plan: Educational Curricula, Mark eting and Public Awareness Economic Development and Diversification Environment and Natural Resources Social and Community Development Kanaka Maoli and Island Lifestyle Funding Source The Task Force recommends that the Su stainability Council be funded through the General Fund. \"Interim Sustainability Counc il\" Composition and Selection The Task Force recommends that an \"I nterim Sustainab ility Council\" be established to provide continuity and a transition mechanism from the Task Force to the permanent Sustainability Council. Because of the institutional knowledge the Task Force has gained over the pas t two and a half years, it would be beneficial for the Interim Sustainability Coun cil to include several members of the Task Force. These members could provide the background and context in which Hawai'i 2050 was developed, and assist the Sustainabilit y Council to get underway. The Task Force recommends that at least five (5) Hawai'i 2050 Task Force members of the fifteen (15) voti ng members of the Interim Sustainability Council be initially app ointed, to be ultimately transitioned out due to term limits. Attached Agency As a quasi-governmental agency, the Sustainability Council needs to be assigned to a governmental unit for administrative purposes. The Task Force recommends that the Interim Sustainabi lity Council be temporarily a ttached to Office of the Auditor for the first two years. T he Auditor has garnered a great deal of knowledge about sustainabil ity and Hawai'i 2050, and would serve as an ideal transition agency. In 2010, the Task Fo rce recommends that the Sustainability Council be permanently attached to the Office of Planning. -71- Periodic Financial and Management Audits The Task Force proposes an audit of the Su stainability Council's activities every two years to determine the appropriateness of its fiscal activities, and the progress made in implementing Hawai'i 2050. RECOMMENDATION 3: Establish Sustai nability Indicators, aggregating the best data annually, measuring progress towards specific sustainability goals. Utilizing the data in this report, from the community engagement process, and from future discussions, t he Council ought to establish an annual measuring tool of our efforts toward sust ainability. These indica tors would be the most comprehensive measure of how we are doing as a state - economically, culturally, and environmentally. It will be the primary mechanism to measure our progress. Our annual scores on each of the indicators must be the subject of enthusiastic attention and discussion, among all sectors. This is t he most effective way to quantify our progress to wards sustainability. RECOMMENDATION 4: Issue a Report Card - Measuring Our Progress. In our review of the best practices of other state and municipality sustainability plans, we've found that public report cards ar e an effective tool in ensuring that the public, lawmakers and opinion leaders know how we are doing in implementing our plan. We believe performance indicators are a crucial component of Hawai'i 2050. A good indicator helps the public understand the current status of an issue, whether the situation around it is improving or worsening, and how far we are from success. Effective indicators are rele vant, easy to understand, reliable and based on accessible data. The details of this report ca rd must be developed by the Council, but the core of it lies in the strategic actions and indicators set forth in this document. The report card will tell us how we measure up to this plan, and enable us to make adjustments according to what is working and what isn't. -72- PLANNING PRINCIPLES AND APPROACH TO HAWAI'I 2050 The People's Plan: Principles for a Community-based Planning Process From the outset, the Task Force determined that for Hawai'i 2050 to be effective, it must reflect the will of the commu nity. After all, Hawai'i 2050 is for the people of Hawai'i. In particular, the Task Force wanted to avoid a \"top-down\" approach to planning for Hawai'i's future. Rather, t he Task Force wanted the planning process to be an exciting, dynamic activity wh ich includes and engages a broad array of groups and perspectives. The Task Force also believed that stakeholder input, technical expertise, and adequate research was critical to augment this citizen- based process. Hence, stakeholder m eetings, public opinion surveys, and specialized research w ould need to be conducted. Because of these requirements, the Task Force recommended that the initial deadline for creating Hawa i'i 2050 be extended from 2007 to 2008, and that additional funds be appropriated for an ex tensive community outreach program. Pursuant to Act 210 (SLH 2006), Act 211 (SLH 2006) and Act 4 (SSLH 2007), the Legislature approved those recommendations , and the Task Force then embarked on what has been the most comprehensive citizen-based process since the 1970s. The Task Force identified five major characteristics that were embodied throughout the Hawai'i 2050 planning process: Fact- and research-based process . Because crucial components of Hawai'i 2050 relate to economic development, water, air, land use, energy, and environmental quality, access to and us e of recent and relevant Hawai'i- based information was essential in developing Hawai'i 2050. Representation of broad and diverse interests . In creating a dynamic and iterative process, the planning process should engage in information sharing from all sectors (business, labor, yo uth, government, nonprofits, media) of the state, as well as acti vely seek guidance from various venues to include but not limited to neighborhoods , churches and religious groups, environmentalists, schools, patrons of the arts, the mi litary, ethnic and cultural organizations, neighborhood boards, recreational clubs, senior citizens, chambers of commerce and economic development boards, and the like. A transparent and open process . The proceedings and information presented in creating Ha wai'i 2050 should be open an d available to the general public. The Task Force suggests that public meetings be conducted on all islands, and in vari ous neighborhoods to ensure that the essence and concerns of all residents become known; and a method for resolving disagreements should be developed. Further, an elaborate communications and interactive system which enables Hawai'i's community -73- to be engaged in the planning process should be developed. Public education, medi a and marketing component. To educate, engage and inspire community participatio n, a public education and media campaign should be launched. Adopting a sustainable lifestyle will involve creating a social movement to change human and community behavior and norms. Inspirational, visionary, and engaging process . Community gatherings and activities should be visionary, fun and inspirational to engage the public in providing meaningful ideas and i nput in creating Hawai'i 2050. In accord with the above-referenced plann ing characteristics, the Task Force embarked on an aggressive and comprehen sive community- and research-based planning agenda. Stakeholder Outreach: Candid Fee dback from Hawai'i's Leaders To broaden community input, the Task Force conducted meetings with key stakeholders and leaders from the various sectors. The Hawai'i 2050 Business Leadership Council was formed to gain input from the state's top business leaders. Input and guidance from Kanaka Maoli, env ironmental and labor organizations were also solicited through dozens of m eetings and presentations by the Task Force. Furthermore, 3point Consulti ng, a Honolulu-based research firm, conducted a series of interviews solic iting input on what Hawai'i 2050 should accomplish and achieve. Over the past two years, the Task Force met with and heard from a wide and diverse group of community leaders and stakeholders, including responding to invitations to speak and make presentations to various organizati ons and forums. To expand and engage community participat ion, key stakeholders were also asked to serve on working groups of the Task Force. For ex ample, the following working and stakeholder groups were formed: Definition Work Group (to create wo rking definition of sustainability) Accountability Work Group (to de sign Hawai'i 2050 implementation and governance system) Community Expansion Work Gr oup (to identify ways to expand participation in the community) Community Engagement Work Group (to design community input and planning process) Business Leadership Council (to solic it input from business leaders) Kanaka Maoli Group (to solicit input from the Kanaka Maoli) Environmental Group (to solicit input from environmental leaders) Human Services Group (to solicit input from nonpr ofit leaders) Education Group (to solic it input on ways to reach out to young people) -74- In so doing, the Task Force received input on Hawai'i 2050 from hundreds of representative organizations, ranging from Hawaiian civic clubs, to environmental organizations to Hawai'i's top 50 corporations. Engaging stakeholders was extremely helpful in getting candid feedback directly from Hawai'i's top leaders. Dozens of business CEOs, nonprofit executive directors, community activi sts and cultural practitioners participated. For example, in a series of stakeholder meetings with business, Kanaka Maoli, and environmental groups, key leaders provided direct input on early drafts and iterations of the policy outlines of Ha wai'i 2050. Many of the concerns and recommendations from these stakeholder groups were considered and integrated into Hawai'i 2050. This stakeholder proce ss also served as an important means to validate and reconcile the priorities of the community with the institutional stakeholders that would be impacted. Hawai'i 2050 Public Opin ion Polls: Voices from the General Public The Task Force commissioned two public op inion polls to gauge the attitudes of Hawai'i residents towards sustainability. The poll was intended to obtain feedback from the general population about the themes that em erged from the community engagement meetings. The Hawai'i 2050 poll consisted of an unbiased pool of Hawai'i residents from all ages, ethnicities and walks of life. The Task Force wanted to solicit Hawai'i residents' attitudes and opinions as a \"c ross-check\" to the views of stakeholders and communi ty engagement participants. Conducted by telephone, t he public opinion polls surv eyed a random sampling of residents with a carefully prepared questi onnaire. The questionnaire dealt with such topics as the environment, housing, tourism, economic development, land use, culture and governance. A larger-than-normal sample size was selected to ensure greater accuracy, as well as suffici ent sample size to evaluate the neighbor island counties. Respondents were asked what kind of future do residents of Hawai'i want for themselv es and their children, and were confronted with making choices and trade-offs on various thought-provoking issues. Hawai'i 2050 Summits and Forums One of the most effective methods to energize and engage stakeholders is large-scale public meetings. The Task Forc e conducted three summits as part of Hawai'i 2050. Hawai'i 2050 Kick-off Summi t (August 2006) (550 attendees) Hawai'i 2050 Summit (Sept ember 2007) (1000 attendees) Hawai'i 2050 Youth Summit (S eptember 2007) (250 attendees) -75- Hawai'i 2050 Planning Process Community Engagement Attendees and Responses Date Activity Purpose Attendees & Responses August 2006 Hawai'i 2050 Kick-off Summit Start of community 550 engagement process October to CE Round I Definition December 2006 *12 Statewide Meetings Vision 450 *Online & Printed Survey Guiding Principles 2250 April to May 2007 CE Round II Indicators 680 *12 Statewide Meetings Strategic Actions July 2007 Statewide Survey Sustainability Issues 2000 September 2007 Hawai'i 2050 Summit Draft Plan Unveiled 1000 Hawai'i 2050 Youth Summit Youth Input 250 Youth Survey Youth Input 575 October to CE Round III December 2007 *13 Statewide Meetings Review of Draft Plan 475 *Comments via Website Review of Draft Plan 145 University of Hawai'i Review of Draft Plan 150 Online Survey Key issues 345 Statewide Survey Key issues 1500 Stakeholder Meetings (a) Input on Plan 150 Review of Draft Plan Total 10520 Other Community Outreach Activities (a) Stakeholder Meetings with the following groups: 15 *Business, Labor, Environmental, Education, Nonprofit, Kanaka Maoli (b) # of Community presentations 20 Number of hits on Hawai'i 2050 Website during community engagement 14000 Number of times Hawai'i 2050 Draft Plan downloaded 800 -76- Lessons and Observations about Hawai'i 2050 Community Dialogue Over the course of eighteen months, the Task Force heard the voices of thousands. Our Hawai'i 2050 meetings were met mostly with optimism, enthusiasm, and occasionally with skepticism and hostility - but mostly optimism. Most participants agreed that creating a su stainable Hawai'i was important, and we needed to have a long-range vision for our state. Some saw no value in looking at Hawai'i's future beyond five to ten years out. Most wanted a balanced approach to Hawai'i's long-term future. Oth ers saw little room for compromise. Whatever their opinion or viewpoint, parti cipants from all walks of life approached Hawai'i 2050 with vigor and passion. They wanted to provide input. They wanted a say in Hawai'i's future. Participants often wanted more cross-sect or dialogue. They appreciated providing input as business, labor, community and environmental leaders, yet wanting an opportunity to dialogue beyond their own peer s. Stakeholders wanted a chance to exchange their views with other types of stakeholders. This willingness of people to engage in cr oss-sector dialogue suggests a strong and healthy community. Because achievin g our long-range sustainability goals will require interaction and collaboration among all sectors, the dialogue to date is a good indication that Ha wai'i 2050 has a fighting chance to succeed. Fact- and Research-based Approach to Sustainability: The Hawai'i 2050 Issue Book Planning for Hawai'i's sustainab le future requires a series of technical studies to ensure that public and community input was strengthened by necessary data, research and information to guide public decision-making. The Task Force identified a series of subjects to be re searched in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the component s of sustainability. The Task Force engaged scholars at t he University of Hawai'i at M noa to research key issues of sustainability, particular to Hawai'i. The \"Hawai'i 2050 Issue Book\" was subsequently published, and is used as the factual foundation for better understanding sustainability issues in our state. The research reflects the latest information on key aspects of sustainability as of the date of this report, and should be updated appropriately in the years to come. The following subjects were researched: Overview of Sustainability Practices . This paper provides a summary of key principles and best practices of sustainable communities, nationally and globally. -77- Population .

Hawai'i State Plan The Hawai'i State Plan, Haw. Rev. Stat. Ch. 226, was adopted into law in 1978 as a comprehensive guide for the long-range futu re development of the state. In particular, the Hawai'i State Planning Ac t (SLH 1978) set forth Hawai'i's overall themes, goals and objectives, which state the following: \"The purpose of this chapter is to set forth the Hawai'i State plan that shall serve as a guide for the future long-range development of the State; identify the goals, objectives, policie s, and priorities for the State; provide a basis for determining priorities and allocati ng limited resources, such as public funds, services, human resources, land, energy, water, and other resources; improve coordination of federal, state, and county plans, policies, programs, proj ects, and regulatory activities; and to establish a system for plan formulation and program coordination to provide for an integration of all major st ate, and county activities.\" The process of creating the Hawai'i St ate Plan engaged thousands of public and private citizens in a comprehensive co mmunity outreach campaign. Brochures, slide presentations and public service announcements and meeting notices informed participants of various opportunities to provide input into the creation of the Hawai'i State Plan. Various organi zations and community groups including businesses, chambers of commerce, stat e boards and commissions, rotary clubs and county agencies also contributed thei r ideas for a desirable Hawai'i. A preliminary draft plan was prepared and dist ributed as a newspaper tabloid in all of the major papers throughout the state. An interim joint House-Senate committee kept apprised of t he development of the plan. The Hawai'i State Plan Policy Council, an advisory body compri sing community representatives, state department directors and county planning di rectors, held the responsibility of overseeing the process. The Hawai'i State Plan c onsists of three parts: Part I sets forth the overall theme, goals, objec tives and policies of the state, covering population, economy, ph ysical environment, facility systems and socio-cultural advancement. Part II outlines planning, coordina tion and implementation of the Hawai'i State Plan, including: -79- The appropriation of funds under the State budget to be in conformance with the overall them e, goals, objectives and policies and to be guided by the Priority Gu idelines and State Functional Plans; The budget review process of the Department of Budget and Finance to be in conformance wit h the overall theme, goals, objectives and policies and to be guided by the Priority Guidelines and State Functional Plans; The appropriation of funds under the State Capital Improvements Program to be in conformance with the overall theme, goals, objectives and policies and be guided by the Priority Guidelines and State Functional Plans; State land use decision making processes of State agencies shall be in conformance with the overall them e, goals, objectives and policies and be guided by the Priority Guideli nes and State Functional Plans; State Programs shall be in conf ormance with the overall theme, goals, objectives and policies and shall be guided by the Priority Guidelines and State Functional Plans. Part III of the Hawai'i St ate Plan pertains to the Stat e's five priority areas (since last updated in 1986), including: economic development, population growth and land resources management, affordable hous ing, crime and criminal justice, and quality education. The last comprehensive review and revision of the Hawai'i State Plan occurred in 1986. Since then, the Hawa i'i State Legislature has made only specific and selective amendments to the Ha wai'i State Plan. For ex ample, in the late 1980s, objectives and policies on the information industry were added to position Hawai'i as the leader in information business in the Pacific Rim. In 1994, additions to objectives and policies on energy were made to increase energy self-sufficiency, greater energy security and telecommuni cations and to reduce the effects of greenhouse gas. Quality Growth Policy Chapter 223, Haw. Rev. St at., requires the Office of Planning to prepare a Quality Growth Policy to address issues of urban sprawl, open space and the environment, and to uplift the quality of life. A policy framework was to be developed to direct growth and land use and to identify state growth objectives. In 1975, Chapter 225, Haw. Rev. Stat. was enacted, requiring a statewide land -80- use guidance policy to address the concerns raised by the rapid growth of both the state and the tourism industr y. Chapter 225 was repealed in 1978, followed by the enactment of Chapter 226, Ha w. Rev. Stat., which ad opted the comprehensive Hawai'i State Plan. While a Quality Growth Policy has not been prepared, aspects of this growth policy are addressed in components of the State Plan. State Functional Plans The State Functional Plans are intended to further define the Hawai'i State Plan. Twelve (12) State Functional Plans were prepared in the early 1980s and adopted by concurrent resolution by the Hawai'i State Legislature. The State Functional Plans identified needed actions on both cost and non-cost items, e.g. legislation, budget and time-frame for impl ementation. As part of its development, citizens and public advisory committees were form ed for each functional plan, engaging hundreds of community leaders who deliberated the future of Hawai'i in the respective functional plan areas. The St ate Functional Plans were last updated in 1989 and 1991. The twelve (12) Functi onal Plans include the following policy areas: Agriculture Conservation Lands Employment Energy Health Higher Education Historic Preservation Housing Recreation Tourism Transportation Water Resources Development In the late 1990s, the responsibility for preparing guidelines for State Functional Plans was transferred from the Office of Planning to the Department of Budget and Finance to improve the linkage between the State Functional Plans and the Executive Budget. This function was tr ansferred back to the Office of Planning in 2001. Planning, Programming & Budgeting System (\"PPBS\") To optimize the expenditure of pub lic funds, the Planning, Programming & Budgeting System (\"PPBS\") was devel oped to improve the operational effectiveness of state agency programs and the effectiveness of agency budgeting. The Department of Budget & Fi nance is responsible for implementing PPBS to ensure that progr am plans and objectives, budget requests, and agency performance are in accordance with the State's financial, program and policy -81- goals. The budget instructions state t hat the agencies in submitting their budget requests must indicate how the budget reques t conforms to the goals, objectives, policies and priority guidelines of the Hawai'i State Plan. County General and Development Plans The County General and Development plan s were created to guide the physical development of lands within each county. Required by the respective County Charters, these plans generally provi de conceptual schemes for the desired direction for land use to meet the soci al, economic and environmental needs of each of the respective counties. County plans also include urban design principles and controls, plans, and maps that descr ibe the desired urban, rural, natural, scenic and cultural resources and uses. -82- APPENDIX B LISTING OF AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS Abbreviation Full Description DAGS Accounting and General Services DOA Agriculture B&F Budget and Finance DBEDT Business, Economic Development and Tourism DCCA Commerce and Consumer Affairs DOD Defense DOE Education DHHL Hawaiian Home Lands DOH Health DHRD Human Resources Development DHS Human Services DLIR Labor and Industrial Relations DLNR Land and Natural Resources DPS Public Safety DOT Transportation DoTax Taxation EOA Executive Office on Aging HHFDC Hawai'i Housing Finance and Development Corporation HPHA Hawai'i Public Housing Authority OHA Office of Hawaiian Affairs PUC Public Utilities Commission SFCA State Foundation of Culture and the Arts UH University of Hawai'i UHERO University of Hawai'i Economic Research Organization -83- -84- MAHALO Thank you to the following individuals and organizations which assisted in the Hawai'i 2050 plannin g process.
