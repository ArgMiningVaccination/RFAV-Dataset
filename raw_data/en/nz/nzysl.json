For the time being, vaccination remains the only way to prevent and reduce the impact of the novel coronavirus. However, the effect of each person's vaccination is different, and I will briefly explain it below! The reason why vaccines can effectively reduce the risk of COVID-19 is that the immune system is stimulated to produce antibodies and resist the virus. Therefore, in addition to the dose of the vaccine itself and the way inoculation will affect its efficacy, the function of each of our immune systems is an important factor. In conclusion, to maintain a strong body with vaccines during the epidemic, you also need to strengthen your immunity! Intestinal microecology can affect vaccine efficacy and the chance of infection So how can immunity be improved? Factors that affect our immune system include age, disease background, genetics, diet, living habits, work, rest, etc. At the same time, only a few people know that intestine is the largest immune system in the human body, and the influence of the balance of the microbiota in our gut is not trivial. Studies on patients with new COVID-19 have even found that patients have fewer beneficial bacteria in the gut including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectale,etc. They also had more harmful bacteria than the control group such as Ruminococcus torques, etc. Research confirms that our gut microbiome (the ratio of probiotics to bad bacteria) is associated with the risk of COVID-19. Improve immunity from the gut through food and probiotics Therefore, remember to maintain a healthy gut, to increase the efficacy of the vaccine and reduce the risk of disease! You can pay attention to your diet, eat more foods containing probiotics, such as cheese, pickles, natto, and supplement probiotics appropriately.

PGut medical professionals. PGut Probiotics was developed by the Hong Kong Science Park team for the intestines of Hong Kong people. Research has shown that its intestinal probiotic can effectively improve intestinal problems and enhance immunity ( [https://biomed.hk/pgut-premium/](https://biomed.hk/en/enhance_immunity/)).
