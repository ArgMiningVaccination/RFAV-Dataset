This method must be able to ensure that, for a specific reference-period, the number of products obtained which couldbe considered as 'originating' is the same as that which would have been obtained if there had been physical segregation of thestocks. 3. The customs authorities may grant such authorisation, subject to any conditions deemed appropriate. 4. This method is recorded and applied on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the country wherethe product was manufactured. 5.

Article 31 Amounts expressed in euro 1. For the application of the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) and Article 27(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currencyother than euro, amounts in the national currencies of theMember States of the Community, of Montenegro and of theother countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixedannually by each of the countries concerned. 2.

TITLE VIII FINAL PROVISIONS Article 39 Amendments to this Protocol The Interim Committee may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.28.12.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 345/221ANNEX I INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX II Note 1: The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 6. Note 2: 2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system forthat heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in somecases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an 'ex', this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2. 2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all productswhich, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings groupedtogether in column 1. 2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4. 2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied. Note 3: 3.1. The provisions of Article 6, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a contracting Party. Example:An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from 'other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging' of heading ex 7224. If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in theCommunity. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used. 3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processingcannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level ofmanufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not. 3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression 'Manufacture from materials of any heading', then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject,however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression 'Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading ...'or 'Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product' means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 ofthe list.L 345/222 EN Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.20073.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used. Example: The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or theother, or both. 3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule.(See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles). Example: The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals. However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture. Example: In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non- originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth \u2014even if non- woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stagebefore yarn \u2014that is, the fibre stage. 3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originatingmaterials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages mustnot be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply. Note 4: 4.1. The term 'natural fibres 'is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have beencarded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun. 4.2. The term 'natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of and'paper-making materials 'are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns. 4.4. The term 'man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507. Note 5: 5.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below.)28.12.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 345/2235.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials. The following are the basic textile materials: \u2014 silk, \u2014 wool, \u2014 coarse animal hair, \u2014 fine animal hair, \u2014 horsehair, \u2014 cotton, \u2014 paper-making materials and paper, \u2014 flax, \u2014 true hemp, \u2014 jute and other textile bast fibres, \u2014 sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave, \u2014 coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres, \u2014 synthetic man-made filaments, \u2014 artificial man-made filaments, \u2014 current-conducting filaments, \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene, \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester, \u2014 synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide, \u2014 synthetic man-made staple polyacrylonitrile, synthetic staple polyimide, synthetic staple synthetic fibres, \u2014 artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose, \u2014 other artificial man-made staple fibres, \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped, \u2014 yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped, \u2014 products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film, \u2014 other products of heading 5605., Example: A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed10 % of the weight of the yarn.L 345/224 EN Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.2007Example: A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (whichrequire manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combinationof the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric. Example: Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures. Example: If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is,accordingly, a mixed product. 5.3. In the case of products incorporating 'yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped', this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn. 5.4. In the case of products incorporating 'strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent orcoloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film', this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip. Note 6: 6.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product. 6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles. Example: If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the samereason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles. 6.3. Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated. Note 7: 7.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 'are the following: (a) vacuum-distillation; (b) by a very thorough fractionation-process; (c) cracking; (d) reforming; (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;28.12.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 345/225(f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-activeearth, earth, activated charcoal or bauxite; (g) polymerisation; (h) alkylation; (i) isomerisation. 7.2. For a very thorough fractionation-process; (c) cracking; (d) reforming;(e) extraction by means of selective solvents; (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, charcoal or bauxite; (g) polymerisation; (h) alkylation; (ij) isomerisation; (k) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur-content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method); (l) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;(m) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 oC, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, oflubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improvecolour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process; (n) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 oC, by the ASTM D 86 method; (o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high- frequency electrical brush-discharge; (p) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation. 7.3. For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a resultof mixing products with different sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do notconfer origin.L 345/226 EN Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.2007ANNEX II LIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS IN ORDER THAT THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED CAN OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUS The products mentioned in the list may not be all covered by this Agreement.

The Parties recognise the need that Montenegro addresses promptly any structural weaknesses of its steel sector to ensurethe global competitiveness of its industry. 2. Further to the disciplines stipulated by Article 38 para- graph 1(iii) of this Agreement [SAA Article 73 paragraph 1(iii)],the assessment of the compatibility of State aid to the steelindustry as defined in Annex I of the Guidelines on nationalregional aid for 2007-2013 shall be made on the basis of thecriteria arising from the application of Article 87 of the ECTreaty to the steel sector, including secondary legislation. 3. For the purposes of applying the provisions of Article 38 paragraph 1(iii) of this Agreement [SAA Article 73 para-graph 1(iii)] with regard to the steel industry, the Communityrecognises that, during five years after the entry into force of thisAgreement, Montenegro may exceptionally grant State aid forrestructuring purposes to steel producing firms in difficulties,provided that (a) it leads to the long-term viability of the benefiting firms under normal market conditions at the end of therestructuring period, and (b) the amount and intensity of such aid are strictly limited to what is absolutely necessary in order to restore suchviability, and aid is where appropriate progressivelyreduced; (c) Montenegro presents restructuring programmes that are linked to a global rationalisation which includes the closingof inefficient capacity. Every steel producing firm benefitingfrom restructuring aid shall, as far as possible, provide forcompensatory measures balancing the distortion ofcompetition caused by the aid. 4. Montenegro shall submit to the European Commission for assessment a National Restructuring Programme and individualbusiness plans for each of the companies benefiting fromrestructuring aid which demonstrate that the above conditionsare fulfilled.The individual business plans shall have been assessed and agreed by the State aid monitoring authority of Montenegro in view oftheir compliance with paragraph 3 of this Protocol. The European Commission shall confirm that the National Restructuring Programme is in compliance with the require-ments of paragraph 3. 5. The European Commission shall monitor the implementa- tion of the plans, in close cooperation with the competentnational authorities, in particular the State aid monitoringauthority of Montenegro. 6. If the monitoring indicates that aid to the beneficiaries which is not approved in the National Restructuring Programmeor any restructuring aid to steel firms not identified in theNational Restructuring Programme has been granted from thedate of signature of this Agreement onwards, the State aidmonitoring authority of Montenegro shall ensure that any suchaid is reimbursed. 7. Upon request, the Community shall provide Montenegro with technical support for the preparation of the National Restructuring Programme and the individual business plans. 8. Each Party shall ensure full transparency with respect to State aid. In particular, as regards State aid granted to steelproduction in Montenegro and the implementation of therestructuring programme and the business plans, a full andcontinuous exchange of information shall take place. 9. The Interim Committee shall monitor the implementation of the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 above. To thiseffect, the Interim Committee may draft implementing rules. 10. If one of the Parties considers that a particular practice of the other Party is incompatible with the terms of this Protocol,and if that practice causes or threatens to cause prejudice to theinterests of the first Party or material injury to its domesticindustry, this Party may take appropriate measures afterconsultation within the Sub-Committee dealing with competi-tion matters or after thirty working days following referral forsuch consultation.L 345/314 EN Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.2007PROTOCOL 5 Protocol on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters Montenegro Article 1 Definitions For the purposes of this Protocol: (a) 'customs legislation' shall mean any legal or regulatory provisions applicable in the territories of the ContractingParties, governing the import, export and transit of goodsand their placing under any other customs regime orprocedure, including measures of prohibition, restrictionand control; (b) 'applicant authority' shall mean a competent administrative authority which has been designated by a Contracting Partyfor this purpose and which makes a request for assistanceon the basis of this Protocol; (c) 'requested authority' shall mean a competent administrative authority which has been designated by a Contracting Partyfor this purpose and which receives a request for assistanceon the basis of this Protocol; (d) 'personal data' shall mean all information relating to an identified or identifiable individual; (e) 'operation in breach of customs legislation' shall mean any violation or attempted violation of customs legislation.
