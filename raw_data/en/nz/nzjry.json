The demand for the product is anticipated to be driven by its wide usability as a catalyst that helps in preventing various diseases as well as improving the feed digestion, vitamin intake, and rate of weight gain. The global essential oils & plant extracts for the livestock market are highly competitive owing to the presence of a number of market participants globally. These companies compete with each other to gain a competitive advantage based on product innovation, raw material procurement, nutritional value, advertising & promotion, convenience, and prices. Manghebati SAS, Indian Herb Specialties Pvt.Ltd., and Olmix S.A., among others, are some of the major manufacturers in the marketplace. The supportive regulatory scenario, which bans the use of antibiotics in the U.S. and a few countries in Europe, is expected to open growth opportunities for replacement products such as [amino acids](/industry-analysis/amino-acids-market), acidifiers, [enzymes](/industry-analysis/enzymes-industry) as well as natural or herbal extracts including essential oils as growth enhancers in the global market. This has benefitted market growth in the past years and the trend is expected to continue in the coming years. Plant extracts mainly comprise vitamins, micro minerals, fatty acids, peptides, oligosaccharides, and proteins. They generally belong to the classes of derivatives of flavonoids and isoprene. Plant extracts such as capsicum, cinnamon, and clover benefit animals in terms of average daily gain, and improved feed conversion rates. Moreover, feeding natural extracts to cows is known to restrict dairy farm odors and the overall feed costs. Popular essential oils include spearmint, lime, cloverleaf, lemon, peppermint, citronella, eucalyptus, mint, corn, and orange. Hence, the production of these oils is subject to the respective raw materials. The choice of essential oils and plant extracts to be used depends on livestock manufacturers. The choice mainly is based on the intended animal diet, type of livestock, and applications. Plant extracts dominated the market with a high revenue share of more than 79% in 2021. This is attributed to its properties like the stimulation of the immune system in animals, enhanced nutrient utilization, and better water and food absorption. Furthermore, it aids in improving the antimicrobial activities in farm animals, reducing mastitis, and strengthening gut microbiota. Botanical herbs and extracts are gaining importance as [animal feed additives](/industry-analysis/animal-feed-additives-market) due to the ban on dietary antimicrobial agents and reduction in the use of antibiotic growth promoters. Phytochemicals and plant extracts influence the secretion of digestive fluids and enzymes, total feed intake, and food consumption patterns. Essential oils are organic compounds that are volatile with a delicate balance of beneficial minerals, vitamins, and other components. Essential oils enriched with cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol are mostly preferred by farmers and feed producers to promote immunity, gut health, and yield and to regulate blood pH levels. Anti-inflammatory properties along with the immunomodulation potential of various essential oils are expected to drive their demand in the livestock sector. Solid form dominated the market with a high revenue share of more than 62% in 2021. This is attributed to its high digestibility property in farm animals. In addition, these products are soluble in liquid, which eventually helps in cost-saving, and makes feed delivery methods more efficient. The solid form of animal feed supplement includes mono powders, spray-dried powders, pellets, and capsules. Consumption of forage, treated with essential oils and plant extracts, by animals is anticipated to have many benefits such as improved gut health, increase in yield (meat, wool, eggs, and milk), and bolstered immunity. Some of the dry feeds include a short amount of molasses to enhance palatability. Essential oils & plant extract-based liquid feed supplements provide benefits to animal producers which include increased safety margin, ease of fat addition, greater vitamin stability, lower equipment cost, reduced supplement shrinks, less feed waste, and increased forage intake & utilization. The higher bioavailability of organic trace elements in comparison to other inorganic substitutes is expected to be a key factor driving the growth of the market. Gut health dominated the market with the highest revenue share of over 36% in 2021. This is attributed to the shift in focus of farmers and feed manufacturers to improve the performance as well as gut health of animals. For this purpose, various plant extracts are used along with some essential oils in animal feed additives. Optimal gut functioning along with a decrease in antibiotic growth promoters plays a crucial role in livestock farming. A product portfolio that suits the customized needs of livestock producers, the development of efficient carrier mediums for better delivery in the intestinal tract, and essential oil blends along with plant extracts for livestock are anticipated to benefit the segment growth during the forecast period. A combination of plant extracts & essential oils which include clove, garlic, oregano, rosemary, thyme, and cinnamon have a higher potential for increasing yield in livestock. These feed additives can be given in doses with a specific amount complying with the formulated recipe of feed to increase yield for beef, cattle, and poultry. Poultry feed dominated the market with a high revenue share of more than 37% in 2021. This is attributed to the increased demand for high-quality poultry meat due to the rise in awareness about poultry health care diseases. To satisfy the surging demand from the consumer, poultry feed is produced extensively worldwide. The inclusion of essential oils & plant extracts in swine feed is done extensively by meat producers to improve meat quality and boost immunity. With rising trade, the demand for feed additives for swine is anticipated to increase due to rising concerns over safety and meat quality. On the other hand, Islamic countries, such as Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the UAE, are expected to limit the demand for pork meat and feed additives, mainly due to religious causes. With a global increase in per capita consumption of fish, especially in some countries such as France, New Zealand, Australia, India, and China are showing a significant upward trend for aqua livestock. The demand for fish and fish-based products is rising globally. This rise in per capita fish consumption has contributed to increasing demand for fish farming. This, in turn, is propelling the demand for feed and additives supplements in the seafood market. The Asia Pacific region dominated the global essential oils & plant extracts for livestock market with a revenue share of 33% in 2021. This is attributed to the strong economic prospects of emerging countries of the region, ever-increasing population, and increasing disposable income of the average household. Increasing meat consumption, especially in the U.S., and Canada along with the presence of stringent rules and regulations regarding safety and meat quality is anticipated to drive the market in the coming years. Other factors such as increasing incidences of animal diseases, trade liberalization, and income growth in emerging economies have a significant impact on the North American livestock market. The European market is highly regulated, and innovation-driven. Rising health awareness in the region and increasing consumption of pork and poultry, both of which require high amounts of additive input, are some factors which are expected to drive the market in Europe during the forecast period.
