Boa rd staff members, Schnabel, Davis and MacLean. Su mmary of Oral Testimony RUL ES PROPOSED: Proactive ratio) AMEND: 855- 007- No comments. RULES PROPOSED: State that pharmacists should do everything they can to improve patient safety and that the proposed rule will not clarify . She st ated that she did not know what \"Reasonably fit\" means and is c oncerned pharmacists will choose to use insert vs. labels . She stated that i nsert is not nearly as safe and that r eal estate on container is at a premium. Flagging, fold over labels, and bigger bottles are an option and s upplemental insert cannot be a substitute for labels . Stated that she wants \" if it fits on bottle in English, then it should fit on the bottle in the patient's language . Cheryl Coon, RAC Member Stated that the proposed rules conflict with the language of the statute. Not permissible under Oregon law. Legislation was clear that informational insert may only be in addition to the label and that there was extensive testimony - conclusion of sponsors was that using informatio nal 3 insert . There is a process where there are so many instructions that this would need to be worked out ORS 689.505 provision that says that labeling requirements may be changed or an exemption and must be done by special permit. Clear standard in best i nterest of public health and safety. Pharmacists should not be able to make personal conclusion that the directions will not fit on the label. Sophie Krensky - nursing student at OHSU Stated that c ompletely appropriate for a complex titration regimen and r easonable is subjective - since these rules have a cost burden then pharmacy would utilize insert in lieu of a dual language label. Translated labels and dual translated labels are the standard/expectation. RULES PROPOSED: Drug Take Back AMEND: 855 -041- 1046 No 0005, 855 -110- 0007 No comments.

CVS Health, the largest pharmacy health care provider in the United States, is uniquely positioned to provide care with diverse access points to patients in the state of Oregon through our integrated offerings across the spectrum of pharmacy care. We appr eciate the opportunity to comment on proposed rules . CVS Health has concerns with this rule as currently proposed . We request the language be amended to require photographs and recordings be kept to the minimum necessary for investigations and that personal identifying information (PII) and protected health information (PHI) only be recorded if required for a specific investigation . An additional concern is the lack of exclusion for Patient Safety Work Product (PSWP) , which includes patient safety event reports. CVS Health , and ma ny other pharmacies, report through a n Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality listed Patient Safety Organization (PSO) to enhance the patient safety and quality improvement activities. Confidentiality and privilege protections are provided for patient safety and quality improvement information through the Patient Safety Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Patient Safety Act ). We additionally request exceptions for this information to not be photographed, recorded or required to be produced upon inspection. Furthermore, we request language be added to not allow personal devices of the Compliance Officer be used for video and audio recording . Finally, we ask the Board to add language , in accordance with the NABP Model Act, Section 16, that requires Compliance Officers to secure photographs and recordings taken during the inspection as confidential and privileged . Without this proposed re vision , proprietary information that may be copied or recorded during an inspection may be subject to a public records request. Suggested Language 855-001-0040 Inspections (2) The Compliance Officer is authorized and must be permitted to perform the following to determine compliance with ORS 475, ORS 689, and OAR 855 and board orders including, but not limited to, (a) Inspecting conditions, structures, equipment, materials, and methods for compliance; (b) Inspecting all drugs and devices; (c) Taking photographs, recording video and audio if: (A) Photographs and recordings are kept to the minimum necessary for all investigation s; (B) Personal identifying information or protected health information are only obtained when required for a specific investigation ; (C) All patient safety work product, including patient safety event reports, that are protected under the Patient Safety Quality Improvement Act of 2005 are not photographed or recorded ; (D) Personal devices of the Compliance Officer are not used; and Lauren Paul , PharmD , MS | 200 Corporate Drive | Woonsocket, RI 02895 | T: 540-604-3661 (E) All photographs and recordings are securely stored remain ing confidential and privileged .; (d) Reviewing, verifying and making copies of records and documents required by ORS 475, ORS 689 and OAR 855 (4) All licensees and employees must fully comply and cooperate with all questions and requests made by the Compliance Officer at the time of inspection , except for those rel ated to Patient Safety Work Product protected under the Patient Safety Quality Improvement Act of 2005 . CVS Health appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to the Board for review. As you consider our comments, please contact me directly at 540 -604-3661 if you have any questions. Sincerely, Lauren Paul , PharmD. , MS Sr Director, Pharmacy Regulatory Affairs CVS Health From: Sandra Guckian To: PHARMACY RULEMAKING * BOP Subject: Comments Rule: 855-007-0080 Friday, May 21, 2021 6:52:54 AM Dear Rachel: NACDS is in support of the proposed amendments to 855-007-0080 - Emergency Immunization and Drug Distribution that will allow immunizing pharmacists to supervise additional interns at immunization clinics. We agree that allowing immunizing pharmacists to supervise as many Oregon-licensed immunizing interns that a pharmacist determines, in their own professional judgment, will increase the number of individuals being vaccinated and maintain public health and safety. Thank you for your consideration of our comments. If you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Kind regards, Sandra Sandra Kay Guckian, IOM, MS, RPh Vice President, State Relations sguckian@nacds.org P: (703) 837.4195 F: (703) 549.0772 C: of Chain Drug Stores ( NACDS) 1776 Wilson Blvd. Suite www.twitter.com/@NACDS 4/22/2021 Testimony regarding: to an entity 855- 041-2320 Epinephrine I am writing on behalf of myself (RPh 7034), as well as Consonus Pharmacy . We are very thankful that the Board is considering removal of the quantity limit on dispensing of epinephrine under this rule. This is a big step forward, but leaves challenges for the future. While we are in favor of the proposed changes, we feel that they don't go far enough to support long term care pharmacy and patients. Here are some challenges that we face as long term care pharmacies: 1) RCF/ALF facilities are not licensed to have e -kits. 2) ALFs do have to have licensed staff, though not as much a s a nursing home. 3) The OHA class for \"trainees\" is a classroom class (at least that's what it says on the webpage). It seems onerous to require a nurse or other professional already trained to give injections to attend a n in- person class as if they weren't trained. 4) The online class is only for those who wish to help administer an epi -pen to a patient that already has a prescription for one. 5) In phase 1 of COVID vaccination we had dentists, EMTs and nurses helping out with vaccinations in ALFs. 6) The current OBOP rules are really for non -licensed people, not for dentists, EMTs and nurses. 7) ALF/RCF facilities do not have a house physician, so it is difficult to get a prescription written for the facility to have epi -pens. 8) ALF/RCF facilities would fall under the \"entities\" classification for the rule, but this requires that there be a prescription. OHA has recently created a protocol that solves # 7 above, but it may revoke the protocol when the pandemic emergency is over. This will leave us unable to provide epinephrine auto -injectors to RCF/ALF facilities because of the prescription requirement for us to dispense to an \"entity\". It is likely tha t COVID vaccination will need to continue, but we won't be able to provide the most important anaphylaxis medication. What we are hoping to accomplish would be to get an OBOP rule that would do the following: 1) Waive the training requirement for anyone tha t is already able to give shots. 2) Since vaccinating in long term care is related to a specific facility, the pharmacy would be able to dispense to the facility, not to an individual nurse/dentist/EMT, etc. This is currently allowed, but it requires a prescription. This requirement is currently met by the OHA protocol, but it is likely limited in duration. Thank you Eric Lintner, RPh, BCPS 1 Testimony for Rulemaking Ch 855 May 26, 2021 Members of the Board of Pharmacy Executive Director Joe Schnabel, Oregon Board of Pharmacy Dear Board Members and Director Schnabel, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on proposed rules to implement SB 698 (2019), now codified at ORS 689.564. I was pleased to serve as a member of the Board's RAC on this rulemaking. During 44 years of legal practice, I served for a decade as a Sen ior Assistant Attorney General in the Oregon Department of Justice, advising state agencies on, among other matters, rulemaking, and legislative interpretation. I am also part of the small group of proponents for SB 698 who worked closely with Senator Monnes Anderson, Rep. Alonso Leon and Rep. Mitch Greenlick on the bill that ultimately was passed. The Board's rulemaking notice of April 16, 2021, states that the proposed rules are needed to \"clarify the definition and requirements for an informational ins ert when applicable for prescription drugs dispensed directly to Limited English Proficiency (LEP) patients.\" The Board's draft meeting minutes (April 2021) state that \"It appears that the intent [of SB 698] was to allow information inserts in specific situations, such as when directions for use were lengthy and could not fit on the container label.\" Draft Minutes, p. 12. ISSUE RAISED BY THE PROPOSED RULES Does the Board have authority to promulgate a broad rule to permit the use of informational inserts instead of translated labels for instructions for the safe administration of prescription drugs? DISCUSSION I. The Board lacks authority to allow the use of informational inserts, instead of translated labels, based on a standard that instructions \"will not reasonably fit on the label.\" A. The statute is clear that informational inserts may be added to but may not be substituted for, translated labels. The Legislature's intent, that informational inserts may be added but cannot serve as a substitute for translated labels, is clearly articu lated in ORS 689.564, which provides: (1) The State Board of Pharmacy shall adopt rules to require that, if a patient is of limited English proficiency and the prescribing practitioner, patient or an authorized representative of the patient so requests, a pr escription drug dispensed by a pharmacy 2 bear a label in both English and in the language requested and , if authorized by the board by rule, include an informational insert in both English and the language requested. The rules adopted under this section must: ... (c) Determine for which prescription drugs it is appropriate to include an informational insert in addition to the label. In adopting rules under this paragraph, the board shall consider the complexity and length of the directions for use of the pr escription drug.\" (Emphasis added.) ORS 689.564 authorizes the Board to determine when it is appropriate to include an informational insert in addition to the label; nothing in the law permits the Board to allow information inserts in place of labels, reg ardless of the complexity or length of the directions for use. It is, of course, well -accepted that administrative rules may not conflict with statute. Planned Parenthood Assoc. v. Department of Human Resources , 297 Ore. 562, 574 (1984).1 B. Legislative history does not support the use of informational inserts as an alternative to translated labels Although the law is clear on its face, it is also noteworthy that informational inserts, in place of translated labels, is an issue that was extensively dis cussed during the negotiations and hearings on SB 698. Some folks advocated for informational inserts rather than translated labels, but the Oregon Legislature ultimately concluded that informational inserts were not a substitute for placing the key infor mation directly on the label itself, both in English and in a language the patient could read. The legislative history of the law on this specific issue includes the following: Rep. Alonso Leon, the primary House sponsor, testified and submitted a tabl e, in which she stated explained legislative intent generally as well as the - 3 amendment that was incorporated into the final legislation: \"We know that some medications directions are lengthy, and the instructions are currently provided separately, in those cases the translation can also be in supplemental materials as determined by the Board of Pharmacy.\" (Emphasis added). Testimony and submission of Rep. Alonso Leon. 1 In Planned Parenthood , the Department of Human Resources tried to impose limitations on state -funded abortions based on factors other than those listed in the statute. The Oregon Supreme Court held \" ... the Division's authority to determine the types and extent of medical services to be made available in the program is limited by the policies expressed in the enabling act. That statute states explicitly that the aim of the program is to provide services on the basis of need to individuals in the program and directs how need is to be de termined. Under ORS 414.042(1) the only factors to be considered in determining such need are the requirements and needs of the individual, his or her income, the responsibility of his or her spouse, parent or guardian and individual circumstances. The rul e at issue here is inconsistent with that directive. It arbitrarily limits the number of elective abortions a woman in the program may receive without regard to any of the factors that the enabling legislation requires the Division to consider. We, therefo re, declare the rule to be invalid as being outside the authority of the Division.\" 3 Rep. Alonso Leon clearly intended to make sure that it was well -understood that , unlike the then- current situation, in which information about drug administration was often provided in supplemental materials, the intent of the new legislation was to ensure that while instructions could also be in supplemental materials, they could not be solely in supplemental materials. Alicia Temple of the Oregon Law Center testified at the House Health Care Committee concerning amendments to SB 698: The amendments to SB 698 in the Senate and the - 3 have considered some of the implementation concerns expressed by pharmacists. Advocates have worked with the Board of Pharmacy to make key changes while still maintaining the most important parts of the bill. This includes ensuring that the translation remains on the label for any information that would be on the label in English. Testimony of Alicia Temple, on behalf of The Oregon Law Center, May 9, 2019. Lauren Kaplan, an Oregon psychiatric nurse practitioner, specifically emphasized in her testimony before the Senate Health Care Committee the importance of placing critical instructions on the label itself, rather than on informational inserts: Prescription container labels are the primary source of medication information used by patients and the least likely to get lost because they are affixed to the medication. Testimony of Lauren Kaplan, March 6, 2019. Kate Ballard, an Oregon nurse, also emphasized the critical difference between inserts and the label on the bottle as she testified on whether Oregon should follow California's lead: The California law also allows pharmacies to just translate the supplemental documents, instead of the labels. This would completely undermine the effectiveness of SB 698. The reality is that many patients have upwards of 5 medications, plus kids with medications of their own. It is not realistic to expect a patient to keep track of 5+ instruction packets every time they get a refill of their medication, and then expec t them to match the correct packet with the correct medication. If it is not on the label, the safety of Oregonians will continue to be at risk. Testimony of Kate Ballard, March 9, 2019. Oregon Pharmacist Marius Ibuye testified before the Senate Committee on Health Care: I want to emphasize 2 key aspects of SB 698: First, that while some have suggested that medication information be translated on a paper handout \u2014 we have not incorporated this idea because we know from experience that the paper handouts ar e kept separate from the medications and frequently get lost, they do not include patient -specific directions and thus, this approach will not improve patient safety. Second, SB 698 requires dual translation so that both patients, pharmacists, providers, and caregivers can all understand the medication directions. 4 C. The Legislature has provided a process for the Board of Pharmacy to authorize variations in labelling requirements Although the language in ORS 689.564 makes clear that an informational insert may not be substituted for a translated label for providing critical instructions, the Legislature has provided limited authority for the Board of Pharmacy to allow variations generally with regard to prescription drug labelling requirements. ORS 689.505 provides: Labeling requirements regarding any drug may be changed or exemption therefrom granted by the State Board of Pharmacy in the form of a special permit if the board determines that a change or exemption is in the best interest of public health and safety. The standard \"in the best interest of public health and safety\" is well -understood in Oregon law and capable of being administered by the Board. This is the sole available approach under Oregon law. In contrast, the proposed rules employ a vague term, undefined in rules or statute: \"will not reasonably fit on the label.\" Even if ORS Ch 689 were not so clear with regard to what information must be on translated labels, the proposed rule would allow substitution of an informational insert based on an unacceptably imprecise standard. The proposed rules do not define \"will not reasonably fit\", nor do proposed rules provide a process for making that determination, nor who is vested with that responsibility. Certainly, individual pharmacist s should not be permitted to make their own determination on an ad hoc basis of what will not reasonably fit on a label, with no standards to guide them or insure uniformity in their decisions. II. Recommendation If the Board desires to provide relief in situations in which the Board concludes that a translated label cannot alone contain all necessary information, the Board should develop rules covering the definition, criteria, and process the Board will use for a pplications for and consideration of special permits, as authorized in ORS 689.505. Respectfully submitted, Cheryl Coon Dear Rachel Melvin, Thank you for allowing me to present oral comments today regarding SB698. I would like to submit a copy of these comments in writing. My name is Kristen Beiers -Jones, I use she, her pronouns and I am an assistant professor of clinical nursing at Oregon health and science University. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on proposed rules to implement SB 698. My students and I, along with many community advocates and equity -committed legislators, helped to pass SB698 in 2019. It was a long journey to pass this critical medical safety, health equity and cost savings bill. The pivotal moment to get this bill passed was a meeting called by Sen Monnes Anderson and Representative Alsonso Leon who asked us to sit down with represent atives of the Board of Pharmacy and hammer out our differences. What we learned at that meeting is that we were all on the same page. We were allies. Pharmacists believed the same thing we did ---namely that pharmacists should do everything they can to make sure their patients understand how to take their medications. I know the board is trying to help pharmacists follow the law through clarifying rules. However, this proposed rule will not help pharmacists follow the law. The law is clear that supplemental inserts may not be a substitute for a label. This proposed rule suggests that pharmacists have discretion to decide when to not use a label. What is preventing a pharmacy from saying \"I don't think this label reasonably fits on the bottle, I will just sen d home an insert\". What does \"reasonably fit\" mean? This rule opens the door for pharmacists to provide inequitable service, providing a label to an English speaker, but not to somebody who does not speak English. It allows a pharmacist to take a path of l east resistance and bypass the dual language label process that the law mandates and can be found frequently discussed in the legislative hearings. A long time ago some smart people decided that safe practice was to put prescription directions directly o n the pill bottle where they would NEVER be misplaced. I believe everyone listening today has the privilege of having our medication labels right there on the bottle. And I believe that everyone knows that a supplemental insert that is not affixed to the bottle is not nearly as safe. We have repeated often ---\"if it appears on the bottle in English, then it should appear on the bottle in the translated language.\" We know that real estate on the container is at a premium. Dual -language labels affixed to the prescription containers takes more of that real estate and requires some innovative solutions. This is NOT an insurmountable problem. We demonstrated possible solutions at the hearings of the Senate and House committees on health care. These solutions included flagging and fold- over labels as well as bigger bottles for those patients who need dual labels. I am sure there are other solutions in this high tech world we live in. One more point ---I did not know about this proposed rule until just 2 days ago when one of my remarkable nursing students discovered this hearing. With more notice, we would have had many others here to testify on behalf of Oregonians who have limited English proficiency. But I know that, as a nurse who spends much time in the home s of immigrants and refugees trying to help them manage their complex medication regimens, that I speak for and with them when I tell you that the suggestion implied by this rule, that supplemental inserts can be a substitute for a label is absolutely wron g. I have seen a young mother from Burma who did not read English arrive home from the hospital with a bag of medications for her and her children. These were dangerous medications and I sleep better at night knowing that soon, these pill bottles will have labels on them that she can read and thus safely give to her children. I cannot imagine anybody would think it safe practice to send her home with a bag of medications AND a stack of translated supplemental inserts that she is expected to match to each bo ttle every time she gives the medicine to each of her ill children. I know the board of pharmacy has been our ally in these efforts to right the inequitable and unsafe practices for people with limited English. I know you want to prevent medication errors by using the safe practice of providing directions on the label. And I sure hope you will not accept a rule that allows pharmacists to replace inserts for labels. Inserts must be a solution of last resort. I propose a modification to the rule that states \"if it fits on the bottle in English, then fit it on the bottle in the dual translation\". Thank you so much for your work with this. I was incredibly heartened to see...right on the front page of the Board of Pharmacy website your stand against racial injus tice and your commitment to \"take steps to promote diversity, equity, inclusion and racial justice\". I applaud your huge steps towards equity by supporting the implementation of SB698. I now hope that the rules you create are the same for English and non -English patients. May 26, 2021 To: Rachel Melvin, Rules Coordinator Members of the Board of Pharmacy Executive Director Joe Schnabel, Oregon Board of Pharmacy From: Anna Christina Macari, Student, OHSU School of Nursing Class of 2021 Re: Proposed rules on LEP inserts Dear Board Members and Director Schnabel, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on proposed rules to implement SB 698 (2019), now codified at ORS 689.564. I am unable to attend today's meeting, but I would like to comment on the proposed rules regarding informational inserts as an alternative to translated labels for patients with Limited English Proficiency (LEP). As a nursing student having worked with patients from Ethiopian and Eritrean refugee communities, I am acutely aware of the health disparities they face in this country and the challenges of managing chronic health conditions with LEP. Implementation of ORS 689.594 has the potential to change the way these patients interact with a complex health care system. I am concerned that the proposed rules permitting the use of informational inserts instead of translated labels when instructions \"will not reasonably fit on the label.\" Managing chronic conditions often means managing multiple prescriptions; if patients are unable to read their pill bottles, they will be unable to effectively implement the instructions provided on the inserts. Translation of crucial instructions, such as those already listed on the label in English, is essential to providing safe and quality care. I am unable to attend today's meeting because I am accompanying a client from Eritrea to an appointment with a diabetic educator and pharmacist. This client has multiple medications for multiple chronic conditions, but he has been unable to effectively self -manage his conditions because he is unable to read the labels on his pill bottle or produce an informational insert. This challenge can have dire consequences for his health. I hope the Board will reconsider this proposed rule and ensure that all labels for patients with LEP contain instructions in their native language. Sincerely, Anna Christina Macari Newhall OAR Comments 1 of 2May 26, 2021To: Rachel Melvin, OBOP Rules CoordinatorFrom: Kate Newhall, Student, OHSU School of Nursing Class of 2022Re: Proposed ruled on LEP inserts__________________________________________________________________________________Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on proposed rules on LEP inserts to go along with prescription labels as required by SB 698 (2019). I appreciate the Board's continued work on implementing this important legislation, but do have a few concerns to share. My comments are primarily centered on ensuring prescription information is readily accessible to all and LEP patients in particular are easily able to refer back to critical medication in a language they understand. I am currently a third year nursing student at OHSU School of Nursing, class of 2022. While I was not involved in the original passage of SB 698, I am very aware of the work and research that was put in bynursing students and faculty to pass this landmark legislation. I also immediately saw the need for such a provision in my clinical rotations - patients who take many medications to manage chronic health conditions, yet are unable to read their prescription labels at home. They are unable to reference back tocritical prescription information once they are away from clinicians and translators to help. This frequently leads to patient confusion and increases the risks of medication errors. I think this is an important new law that will help countless of Oregonians and help avoid medication errors - a goal I know is shared by nurses and pharmacists alike. My concern with the proposed rule is in 855-041-1132(4), 855-043-0436(4) and 855-044-0061(5) and who makes the determination that directions \"will not reasonably fit on the label affixed to the prescription container\" and when an insert should be used. Ideally, full translations would always stay affixed to the bottle and exceptions would be limited. I think its important to ensure the final rules don'tmake it easier to use an informational insert when an affixed label may actually be possible. Most importantly, I think the statute directs the Board to identify which specific medications merit inclusion of informational insert in addition to the affixed label. In 689.564(1)(c), the Board is directed to: \"Determine for which prescription drugs it is appropriate to include an informational insert in addition to the label. In adopting rules under this paragraph, the board shall consider the complexity and length of the directions for use of the prescription drug.\" (emphasis added)I don't think the Board has the latitude to allow individual pharmacists to determine what does or doesn't fit on the label as is currently contemplated in the proposed rule. This feels like a very subjective standard that could lead to different interpretations and applications across the state, to the detriment of patients. I feel like the Board could also consider exemptions on a case by case basis as allowed by 689.505(1)(b), which allows for \"special permits\" to be granted by the Board from labeling requirements. I realize this is a more overarching statute on general labeling provisions, but could provide an option to explore for LEP affixed labels and informational inserts. I also worry about the subsequent provision in each rule that would require an in-language label be affixed to the prescription bottle when an informational insert is being used isn't as strong as it could beNewhall OAR Comments 2 of 2(ORS 855-041-1132(5), 855-043-0436(5) and 855-044-0061(6)). I believe this language should also include a requirement to clearly tie the affixed label to the specific informational insert to which it refers. Ideally, both the insert and affixed label would include the name of the patient and medication it refers to. In the field we see a great need to keep prescription information attached the prescription bottle. Once separated, they can be easily confused with other medications - especially when there are many medication to manage.Somewhat unrelated to the current rule proposal, I want to flag another important point on SB 698 implementing rules. I noticed in reviewing the legislation and subsequent rules, one provision of the original legislation seems to have been overlooked in rule making: there don't appear to be rules to implement ORS 689.564(5) and the posting requirement. This may not be specifically related to this rule-making, but I think it is a critical component of the original legislation that should not be overlooked. I encourage the Board to promptly initiate this rule making so pharmacists have clear guidance on the posting requirement and a model poster to post. Last, while I do not speak for the School of Nursing, I do encourage the Board to work with the legislative advocates at the School of Nursing around implementing this very important law. Students and supervising faculty are very knowledgable about the law, the needs that they see in the LEP community and valuable thoughts on the posting requirement. In particularly, I refer you to Kristen Beier-Jones who has been the supervising faculty in advocating for the legislation. Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments. I am happy to discuss any in more detail or answer questions. With kind regards,Kate Newhallnewhallk@ohsu.edu503-302-4895May 26, 2021 To: Rachel Melvin, OBOP Rules Coordinator From: Sophie Krensky, Student, OHSU School of Nursing Class of 2021 Re: Proposed ruled on LEP inserts Good morning all, my name is Sophie Krensky, my pronouns are she/her, I'm a nursing student at OHSU and have been working with patients with limited English proficiency from the Ethopian and Eritrean refugee communities here in Portland. I've seen firsthand how challenging English- only materials and labels can be for our clients, and I'm thrilled with the renewed effort to implement SB 698. Seeing the proposed rules, however, I am concerned. The rule would seemingly allow inserts to be used in lieu of la bels when dual language directions for use \"will not reasonably fit on the label.\" This is perfectly appropriate in cases where even directions in English do not fit on a label, like the complex titration regimen of a cystic fibrosis drug. This is an examp le where an insert would be appropriate for an English- speaking patient or a patient with limited English proficiency, ideally with robust patient education. But the word \"reasonable\" is subjective; with new rules that have both the element of some cost burden and a learning curve for pharmacies, I fear that it may be interpreted that the most \"reasonable\" course of action for LEP patients' prescriptions is to provide them inserts instead of dual language labels in all cases, not just those rare, unusual ones. I can tell you that when I ask my patients with LEP to look at their prescriptions, they appear in a plastic bag pulled from a closet and there is not an insert to be found. It's already an uphill battle to help them interpret and feel confident in the medication directions that are on the bottle itself, and I fear that an insert, even one in Tigrinya or Amharic, will end up in the trash can unread. An insert in lieu of a dual language label may appear \"reasonable,\" but I can assure you that it's not a reasonable solution for our clients. What is most reasonable for them is also what is most intuitive: medication directions, in their language and the language of their provider, on the bottle that contains that medication. Anything short of that ru ns contrary to the spirit of the law, and it would be a shame to stop just short of the robust implementation that this law initially envisioned at this stage. I urge you to reconsider this proposed rule in a way that makes it clear that translated labels are the standard expectation, not the exception.

Related to Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the MOU acts as an agreement between the state boards of pharmacy and FDA to collect information about the distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded human drugs, as well as complaints about compounders . The MOU better positions regulators to address patient safety and improve communication between FDA and boards.NABP Information Sharing Network FDA worked with NABP to develop a standard MOU for use by the state boards of pharmacy to aid with their compliance of section 503A(b)(3)(B)( i) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. As part of the MOU, boards must identify pharmacies that are compounding human drug products and distributing inordinate amounts of such products interstate and report those pharmacies to FDA. Boards can use the NABP Information Sharing Network, accessible via e-Profile Connect, to meet the obligations outlined in the FDA MOU on compounded human drug products.NABP Information Sharing Network Signing the MOU does not require boards to enter data into the network . Boards are encouraged to use the Information Sharing Network to create a uniform and streamlined reporting process with FDA. Boards can rely exclusively on the data reported through the network and easily transmit data to FDA electronically.What is an \"Inordinate Amount\"? If the MOU is signed by Oregon, greater than 50% distribution of compounded products interstate by a 503A compounding pharmacy is considered an \"inordinate amount\" If the MOU is notsigned by Oregon, greater than 5% distribution of compounded products interstate by a 503A compounding pharmacy is considered an \"inordinate amount\"What is an \"Inordinate Amount\"? \"For purposes of this MOU, a pharmacy has distributed an inordinate amount of compounded human drug products interstate if the number of prescription orders for compounded human drug products that the pharmacy distributed interstate during any calendar year is greater than 50 percent of the sum of: (i) the number of prescription orders for compounded human drug products that the pharmacy sent out of (or caused to be sent out of) the facility in which the drug products were compounded during that same calendar year; plus (ii) the number of prescription orders for compounded human drug products that were dispensed (e.g., picked up by a patient) at the facility in which they were compounded during that same calendar year.\"What Specific Information Needs to be Reported? Pharmacies that are compounding human drug products and distributing inordinate amounts interstate , including their compounding data Complaints of serious adverse experiences or quality issues relating to human drug products compounded by pharmacies and distributed interstate Complaints of adverse experiences or quality issues relating to human drug products compounded by a physician and distributed interstate Information relating to the distribution interstate of any amount of human drug products compounded by physiciansWhat Pharmacy Complaint Information is Reported to FDA? 1. Name and contact information of the complainant, if available Note: Oregon law prohibits sharing the identity of the complainant, so it is not available 2. Name and address of pharmacy that is the subject of complaint 3. Description of complaint, including description of any compounded human drug product that is the subject of complaint 4. The board's assessment of whether the complaint was substantiated, if available 5. Description of any actions the board has taken to address the complaintDeadline for Signing the MOU FDA is providing a period of one year, which concludes on October 27, 2021 , for states to consider signing the MOU before it intends to enforce the 5% limit in section 503A of the FD&C Act in states that have not signed the MOU. NABP has asked for a delay in this deadline due to the COVID -19 pandemic challenges faced by boards of pharmacy.Policy Discussion for the Board Should Oregon Sign the FDA MOU, if allowable under Oregon law? If yes, this would require: Utilizing the NABP network to assist in determining whether any 503A compounding pharmacy in Oregon is distributing \"inordinate amounts\" interstate Sharing complaint information with the FDA, not including the identity of the complainant , involving a serious adverse drug experience or serious product quality issue related to human drug products compounded by a pharmacy and distributed outside the stateQuestions?SBAR: Oregon Veterinary Medical Examin ing Board (OVMEB) Dispensing Practitioner Drug Outlet (DPDO) Registration Exemption Extension Request SSituation: O VMEB is requesting an Extension to DPDO Registration Exemption . B Background: OAR 855-043- 0510(12) The Board may grant a time -limited waiver exempting DPDO registration when a practitioner licensing board submits a request to the Board with a plan to annually inspect the dispensing facility to the standards of the Board. J une 2018 Board Meeting: OVMEB members Dr. Emilio DeBess, Dr. Allison Lamb , and Executive Director Lori Makinen appeared. The OVMEB members discussed their request to have dispensing veterinariansexempt from OBOP DPDO registration. OVMEB stated they have new facility registration and inspection regulations for veterinary compliance. The OVMEB has two employees for these new processes, 1 inspector and 1investigator allotted. They have approximately 700 registered facilities and their plan is to inspect asoften as feasible, but not less than once every three years and probably closerto once every 1.5 years. OVMEB stated they have 68 clinics that have American Animal HospitalAssociation (AHHA) accreditation which are currently excluded from proactiveinspections, because they have to meet a series of standards and have strictguidelines they have to follow in the areas of dispensing, controlled substances,etc.; these locatio ns will be inspected pursuant to a complaint. They also discussed the ability for OVMEB inspections to clearly address drugacquisition, storage, labeling and recordkeeping and be willing to use the OBOPDPDO self -inspection form as a foundation for those aspects. The members of each board discussed additional similarities and differences inOBOP and OVMEB facility oversight rules. The Board motioned to accept the Oregon Veterinary Medical Examining Board proposal to exclude veterinary dispensing locatio ns from Dispensing Practitioner Drug Outlet registration via exemption for 3 years of OAR 855 -043- 0510(2) and was unanimously carried.

Be sure to include your term and meeting frequency. I h ave been on the OBNM Formulary Council since August 2011, with my current term ending June 20 21. We meet every six months, typically in March and September, though due to waiting on two new appointees to the council we met in April 2021 this year. I would like to express my interest at remaining on this Council for another term and provide a summary of my activity on the council over the last year. In this past year, we worked to clarify the injection and ozone therapy rules. They have not been clear enough for naturopathic physicians to know what is and is not allowed in certain types of injections or the use of ozone therapy , and we wanted to update them and review training requirements. We formed an Ozone Therapy sub-committee that reviewed the current rules and conducted research to better advise the council. In our March 2020 meeting we reviewed their findings and approved a draft rule OAR 850 -060-0212 to be submitted to the Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine for their review. and determined that the rules should be separated by type of injection and therapy. We made recommendations for training and/or CE requirements for different types of injection therapy and how to allow waivers of these requirements for currently practicing naturopathic physicians. We also determined that ozone is oxygen and therefore a biological substance not requiring a prescription, and therefore not necessary to be added to the formulary. We also discussed the prescribing limitations of mifepristone and misoprostol as abortifacients due to statutory restrictions. At th e September 2020 meeting, we reviewed the applications by Carmen Ionescu and Adam Alani for reappointment to the council. We discussed COVID -19 restrictions and remote work limitations. We reviewed the OAR 850 -060- 0212 Education Requirements for Injections/ IV Chelation Th erapy approved by the Board. At this meeting, I was appointed the new chair starting in 2021 . At the April 2021 meeting, we welcomed new members Laura Williams and Stephanie Culver. We covered HB 3369 which specifies which licensed health care providers may recommend marijuana for medical use. We discussed the status of the OHA Psilocybin Advisory board and current lack of naturopathic physician member as required by law. The implementation of OAR 850 -060-0212 in January 2021 discovered some issues and confusion regarding the procedure, dates and deadlines for reporting education requirements so there is now an open comment period prior to another rulemaking hearing. Lastly, we reviewed updates on the OBNM budget and legislative update. As far as my role on the council, I bring value as chair given that I have been a member for ten years and have knowledge of the history and formulary changes that have occurred over that time. I also bring valuable knowledge in the area of compounding, as there as still many changes occurring in that area that will impact naturopathic physicians. This area has been especially confusing, as the anticipated rule changes to USP Chapter <795>, <797> and <800> regarding nonsterile and sterile compounding practice requirements did not go into effect December 1, 2019 as anticipated and are currently under review. I JUNE 2021/E3awill be able to provide updates on this situation as it continues to evolve . I have enjoyed my time on the council and look forward to continuing to bring value as a mem ber and chair. Thank you for your consideration.

I oversaw budgeting, with staff assigned to purchases, local and international logistics, and grants management. The organizational budget annually is approximately 5 million with ~2 million from endowments, <2 million from donors, and >1 million from grants and contracts. During the five years I worked with BRIT the endowment was tripled to about 45 million based primarily on our expanding research and educational reputations, and the diversity and increase of competitive federal and private funding sources received. In particular, I worked with ranchers in Texas and Brazil to both produce new research on their lands and to address general conservation issues that impact their production efforts. The most import ant lasting success in this regard was a change in members of our non -profit board of directors to include several ranchers with strong conservation values and abilities to help raise funding for local and international research on human interactions with environments. The research director's role has been one of facilitating communication between staff and a wide range of constituents, funding agencies, donors, and community members. I strongly believe that effective communication is the key to successful project and program management, and is critical for pharmacist interactions with patients and other professionals. Effective communication involves thoughtful development of substantive plan s and actions that are shared in ways that can empower people to g et their primary jobs done with a minimum of interruption. Texas Christian University Affiliate Professor, Institute for Environmental Studies 2011 - 2015 Although I more or less left academia when I moved to Texas, TCU offered the opportunity to c ontinue to mentor graduate students and to help teach courses in conservation of natural resources. University of North Texas, Health Science Center Affiliate Graduate Faculty , Biomedical Sciences 2012 - 2015 When the decision was made to move to Te xas, I still was supervising several students from UH and working collaboratively with graduate students from Thailand.

I was hired to produce the world's first unde rgraduate degree in Ethnobotany, which happened in 2002. Since then the program has been copied in variations at five other U.S. universities. I supervised more than 30 graduate students, hundreds of undergraduates in botany and biology, and at times up to 5 staff members and multiple federal grants and private contracts for research. I am vested in the state of Hawaii retirement system so will retire as a full professor in the future. JUNE 2021/E4 4 William L.

While I have usually easily picked up languages (Thai being a notable exception that was very difficult), I have also made little effort to maintain them so do not feel I am currently fluent in any other languages. The following are languages that I have used for comp leting work and in formal publications: Babatana, Fijian, German, Rotuman, Spanish, Thai. I am also familiar with geographical, mythical, and biological terms that are common to many Polynesian languages such as Hawaiian, Samoan, and Tongan. Languages and linguistics are something I have long enjoyed dabbling in and therefore look forward to new opportunities to learn and practice. During 2015 I have been working to relearn Spanish, particularly for communication with pharmacy patients. JUNE 2021/E4 5 COMMUNITY DEVELOPM ENT and APPLIED ETHNOBOTANY EXPERIENCE During my PhD research, I was fortunate to receive funding for a series of small field research projects in several Pacific island countries. In the second one of these, in Samoa, we worked quite closely within the t raditional community structure. The research took less time than we had planned, and produced results that could not have been achieved without the community participation. This lesson was then carried over in subsequent projects where I specifically engag ed local communities and spent growing amounts of time and energy working toward their objectives without any degradation of the primary research mission. After beginning as a faculty member at University of Hawai`i, that work history began to pay off as p eople from different island groups began to approach me and my department for work based on the good reputation developed with prior projects. The net result was that most of my work during 15 years at University of Hawai`i was conducted with communities a nd there was never a shortage of opportunities to address interesting research questions and for high quality student projects. Because of these relationships the only resource we really lacked was time. E.U. ( France, Germany, Italy, Spain, & United Kingd om) Various small -scale orchards . Studies with local apple orchard managers and cider producers focusing on two aspects: 1) How is knowledge developed and passed -on, and how can this be used to develop practical instructional curriculum in science, an d 2) What are the elements of orchards as artificial ecosystems that have been engineered to produce cider, and are these resilient in the face of climate change?

Care for rural and underserved patients has been the primary area of focus in my practice and what I have shaped my career around in academia. I am motivated and passionate about seeing the expansion of pharmacists and clinical pharmacy services in rural Oregon in order to be the next generation of providers that improve health access and patient outcomes. I see involvement on this council as an opportunity for me to expand my impact in this area beyond my local community and the students I teach. I w as born and raised in the state of Oregon and over the years I have been blessed to have the opportunity to experience the vas t open country and the beautiful people that reside there. While I do not live in a rural location, I have tried to stay connected to the care of rural and underserved patients through my practice at Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center. Practicing in a team -based environment, as an ambulatory care pharmacist, allows me to work at the top of my license and demonstrate to my patients and healthcare team the impact pharmacists can have in patient care outcomes and in the advancement of clinical services. While at Virginia Garcia I have worked on revenue generating projects such as pharmacist ran annual wellness visits, spirometry programs and comprehensive medication review billing opportunities. All of which can potentially open doors for more healthcare positions and resource allocation in rural locations. As a rural and underserved track faculty member at Pacific University in partnership with the Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) program and course coordinator of an underserved healthcare elective , we are able to spread awareness of rural health and encourage future pharmacists to become engaged and experience the challenges, rewards and opportunities that healthcare outside the urban setting can provide. Through involvement with student projects at the school we have been able to assess Oregon pharmacist comfort and knowledge in naloxone prescribing to identify and improve educational gaps, created provider centric educational materials on how to deliver culturally appropriate diabetes care to patients from the islands of the South Pacific, and mapped connections to low food access and diabetes outcomes to ultimately recognize how access and resources can be used to improve glycemic control . In addition to educating students, I have strived to imp rove rural healthcare through my time with the Oregon ECHO network focused on team -based, interprofessional care in diabetes management. W henever possible I look for opportunities to work in rural health and welcome the chance to join the council in improving and advis ing on ways to advance rural healthcare in Oregon. Thank you for your consideration and please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions the council may have.

I have had experience in working in the rural communities of Coos Bay, Maupin, Madras, and Bend.. I chat often with my local independent pharmacist in Hermiston about pharmacy issues. I am a retired physician but still have an active pharmacy license. I believe my over twenty five years as being the physician representative to the Rurall Health Council would be of benefit to the representation of rural pharmacy. My CV is attached.

JUNE 2021/E6Saly Daoud 6775 SE Blanton St, Apt 2306 Hillsboro, OR 97123 May 2 7th, 2021 To Whom It May Concern: My name is Saly Daoud, I 'm a registered pharmacist here in the s tate o f Oregon. Currently serving as director of pharmac y of westside Oregon region for Providence Health and S ervices. I obtained my PharmD in 2009 and recently completed my MBA in 2020. I've served in many different roles and pharmacy settings throughout my career and hav e always had a passion for underserved communities and rural communities with minimal access to health care. The purpose of this letter is to express my interest in serving on the Rura l Health Coordinating Council. Prior to the COVID pandemic , I helped plan and provide oversight to many com munity events to extend c are to underserved communities. These events included health fairs in rural location where patients can receive wellness checks and preventative care pr ovided by pharmacist s and pharmacy interns. The services p rovided included blood glucose monitoring , diabetes education, blood pressure monitoring, MTM, ... and many others. As COVID surges began and continue d to persist , we had to be creative in how we provide the same quality care and opportunity for our surrounding communities. We started providing many of these services virtually thr ough our ambulatory care setting. As vaccines became available , we partnered with various counties to help vaccinate the community as well as served vita l roles in the Oregon convention center mass vaccination clinic. This wor k is very rewar ding and fills me with grati tude to be a ble to make quality healthcare more accessible to communities in true need. If I am privileged to represent the Oregon Board of Pharmacy on the Rural Health Coordinating Council, I will provide insight and recommendation s to meet the identified needs of rural co mmunities throughout Oregon. As well as, represent the valuable impact our profession has on our surrounding communities. Thank you so much for you r consideration, I look forward t o hearing from you soon Sincerely , Saly Daoud , SE Blanton St Phone: E-Mail salydaoud@gmail.com FL License # PS45428 Consultant License # PU6882 OR License # RPH -0017714 EDUCATION Doctor of Pharmacy Florida A&M University- College of Pharmacy Tallahassee, FL August 2004- May 2009 , Cum Laude Masters of Business Administration - Executive University of Florida Gainesville , FL August 2018- April 2020, Cum Laude Lean Six Sigma and Operations Excellence Green Belt Certificate Optness Institute Milan, Italy June 2020 PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE Providence Health and Services 2020 - current Regional Director of Pharmacy Services - Westside Oregon Providence St. Vincent Medical Center/ Newberg Medical Center/ Seaside Hospital Implementation of Heart Transplant program Lead caregiver team through COVID -19 pandemic Set up of COVID vaccination clinics throughout westside Oregon region Served as chief pharmacist for mass vaccination clinic at the Oregon convention center Helped serve as incident command operations chief for the largest ministry in the region during the pandemic Oversight of major construction project of building new pharmacy location as well as IV room construction projects at multiple sites for 797 and 800 updates Transformed pharmacy structure to a shared governance model JUNE 2021/E72 Major inventory optimization project to increase inventory turns.
