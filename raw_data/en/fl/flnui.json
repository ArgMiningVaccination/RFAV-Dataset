Hagen, PhD Associate Director for Research Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY ANNUAL RESEARCH REPORT 2004 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 WORDS FROM THE CHAIRMAN Josef E. Fischer, MD Welcome to the Annual Research Report for the Department of Surgery at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This Research Report Summary covers the period from January 1, 2004 through January 31, 2004. As I have stated previously, a truly academic department of surgery not only has a commitment to clinical excellence and the teaching of residents, medical students, and progression in the skills of the faculty, but also has a commitment to laboratory bench work in molecular biology, physiology, as well as in clinical research. These components are essential if we are to produce an academic product, such as residents that go on to be the leaders in their respective specialties. These components are also crucial for residents who go into the laboratory for two years, something which I personally believe is essential for residents, not only to their mental well-being, but to increase their understanding of their clinical skills and prepare them for an academic career. Drs. Hasselgren and Hagen continue to do an excellent job in documenting the growth of this academic department. What is contained herein represents the documentation of a sustained academic effort to which we are committed. The initial effort was to build a clinical entity for the benefit of the hospital as well as the Department, given the depletion of the clinical ranks of the Department. However, as you can tell by the increase in external funding, this commitment has not been carried out to the exclusion or detriment of the academic and research component of the Department. i ii Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 In most divisions, we stated that if the initial recruitment of, for example, the division chief entail more clinical criteria, then the next recruitment had to be based upon research and academic criteria as well as clinical. In general, as we have continued to recruit younger members of the faculty to fill out divisions, we have stressed that they must have a truly significant research component, either bench research or outcome related in clinical research. This approach has certainly aided in an increase in total funding for this year, which we estimate at $12.5 million. This increase from $11.8 million last year is 6% as opposed to the 22% increase that we experienced last year when we had a large influx of new research-oriented surgical faculty. With the addition of new junior faculty that have a research component and the continued growth of existing research groups, we hope to continue these steady gains in funding each year. Most departments of surgery are medical school based, so the NIH methodology for calculating departmental rank is limited to medical schools and not hospitals. Although the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center is third in the country in NIH-funding for hospitals, no such ranking exists for departments of surgery that are part of hospitals exclusively like the ones in the Harvard hospitals. We will have to be content with an estimate. We continue to strive to be in the top five departments of surgery in terms of NIH funding, but I think more realistically we are likely to be sixth or seventh in the country and will continue to strive to achieve our goal. I would like to thank the Division Chiefs and all of the members of the Department of Surgery, both faculty and staff, for their continued superb efforts in making the Department of Surgery at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center a true academic department. Keep up the good work! This introduction would not be complete without my thanking the Administration of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Mr. Paul Levy, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Michael Epstein, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Dianne Anderson, M.S., R.N., Senior Vice President for Clinical Operations, for their strong support. I would also like to provide a special thanks to Dr. Jeffrey Flier, the Chief Academic Officer, whose cooperation in our effort to build the department is so valuable and without which I believe we would not have been as successful.

Hagen, Ph.D. Associate Director for Research T. Andrew French, B.A. Administrative Coordinator The mission of the Division of Surgical Research is to help create an environment in the Department of Surgery that supports both basic and clinical research. Although it may be debated how the success and progress of a research program should be monitored, external funding and publications are tangible measures of the vitality of research. Based on those criteria, research programs in the Department continue to be successful. In this section of the Annual Report we provide an overall description of the goals and responsibilities of the Division, a summary of funding and publications generated by researchers in the Department of Surgery, and other aspects of research 1 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 within the Department. More detailed accounts are found for individual members of the different Divisions in subsequent sections of the Report. The Division of Surgical Research has the following responsibilities. 1) Pre- award approval of all grants submitted by investigators in the Department of Surgery. Our responsibilities include assisting in the process of submission of grant applications and interaction with the BIDMC Office of Sponsored Programs. 2) Management of research space, including laboratory and office space, and shared research equipment. For this, we oversee the allocation of research space within the Department and represent the Department at ReAc space sub-committee meetings. 3) Monthly Surgical Research seminars. 4) Preparing the Department of Surgery Annual Research Report. 5) Organizing laboratory and shared equipment maintenance and telecommunications. 6) Supporting and Mentoring junior faculty in the establishment of research laboratories. 7) Interacting with and providing information to Surgical Residents who plan to spend time in the research laboratory. 8) Obtaining visas for foreign scholars in Research and in preparing application for HMS appointments (Research Fellow-Instructor) to Harvard Medical School. 9) Making recommendations concerning research faculty appoint-ments (Assistant-Full Professor) and reappointments in Surgery. 10) Assisting with the development of existing and new research areas within the Department of Surgery, including both short- and long-term strategic planning and recruitment. The Division of Surgical Research is headed by Per-Olof Hasselgren, MD, PhD, who is the Vice Chairman for Research in the Department of Surgery. Susan J. Hagen, PhD, is Associate Director and is responsible for the day-to-day administration of Surgical Research. In 2004, Jessica Figueroa provided administrative support for the Division, under the supervision of Dr. Hagen. The Division of Surgical Research worked closely with Research Administration (Team 5), headed by Jennifer Sabbagh, Research Administrative Director, Shannon Joyce, Ruth Coburn, Jennifer Clark-Croes, and Lani Radford, Sr. Research Administrators and Research Administrators, respectively. Team 5 is responsible for post-award grant management, research-related purchases, compliance, staff payroll, and the management of new hires for research in Surgery. Susan J. Hagen, PhD Research Activity for Fiscal Year 2004 External research funding in the Department of Surgery increased by 6.1% from $11,831,596 in fiscal year 2003 to $12,553,220 in this fiscal year (Figure 1). The increase in research funding this year is due to a general increase in NIH funding per Division, with the most significant increases in Podiatry, Transplantation, and Urology (Figure 2). Approximately 68% of the awarded funding was from federal sources, primarily from the NIH, and 32% from Other Sponsors (Table 1). Documented for the first time this year, there were numerous awards for clinical trials in fiscal year 2004. The dollar amount indicated is for funds received in this fiscal year and not for awarded funds, due to the long recruitment process for patients in clinical trials. 2 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Table 1.

All surgical residents who are or have recently been in a research laboratory or who are involved in a clinical research project were invited to submit a research abstract. Among the contributions, four finalists are selected to present their work at a Surgical Grand Rounds in early June. The finalists and the winner were selected by a committee consisting of faculty involved in research. The four finalists in 2004 were: Tenveer Khan: \" Aprotinin \"A20 Confers a Proliferative Advantage after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass\". Research Sponsor: Dr. Dan Jones, General Surgery (Minimally Invasive Surgery). Thomas Monahan: \"Preoperative Cardiac Evaluation does not Improve or Predict Perioperative or Late Survival in Asymptomatic Diabetic Patients Undergoing Elective Lower Extremity Arterial Reconstruction\". Research Sponsor: Dr. Frank LoGerfo, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery. The winner of the 2004 Residents' Research Competition was Tenveer Khan. Faculty Accomplishments During fiscal year 2004, research in the Department of Surgery was conducted by 55 faculty, 27 postdoctoral research fellows, 7 surgical residents, 34 research associates and assistants, 2 visiting scientists, and 23 undergraduate, graduate, and medical students. Numerous research coordinators, administrative assistants, and administrative coordinators provided important administrative support for research-related efforts. In all, these figures represent a significant increase in overall research staff when compared to last year, mostly due to new recruitments in Urology and Transplantation. Many new grant applications were funded in this fiscal year. New NIH grants, in the R01, R03, and R21 categories were awarded to Drs. Blackburn, Zhou, Hasselgren, and Veves. Dr. Karp received a K08 grant from the NIH and a Faculty Development Award from the American College of Surgeons. Dr. Evenson was awarded a postdoctoral research fellowship from the NIH and Dr. Sellke was awarded a T32 training grant from the NIH for residents interested in research in cardiovascular surgery. New research grants from other sources were awarded to Drs. Blackburn, Zhou, Jones, Parangi, Malek, and Olumi. Drs. Sellke and Slavin both obtained large awards from private donors to support research by residents and fellows. 6 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Faculty in Surgery continued to be active at the national and international levels. Dr. Archer continued service this year as Councillor on the Executive Committee of the Association for Academic Surgery and joined the nominating committee of the Association for Academic Surgery. Dr. Levitsky was President-elect for the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Several faculty in Surgery were appointed to NIH study sections including Drs. Blackburn, Zhou, Hagen, Hasselgren, Gaston, Kiessling, Ferran, and Otterbein. Dr. Veves also reviewed grant applications for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and for the American Diabetes Association. In the International arena, Surgery faculty were invited speakers around the world. Many honors were also given to faculty in Surgery this year. Dr. Levitsky received the 2004 Surgery Mentoring Award from the American Heart Association. Dr. Slavin received the Jubilee Metal from the Swedish Medical Society and Dr. Veves was the Roger Pecoraro Lecturer for the American Diabetes Association. The Transplantation Division was featured this year at the BIDMC Research Day and Drs. Bach and Maki gave Plenary presentations. Researchers in Surgery also continued a strong commitment to teaching. This includes acting as mentors in the NIH in-service teacher program, MIT Bioengineering Undergraduate Research Program, Biomedical Science Careers Program, Project Success, Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, and Research Scholars Institute Summer Program. The Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Division continues to be actively involved in the William J von Leibig research training program for both medical and postdoctoral students. At Harvard Medical School, many investigators in Surgery teach in the Body, Cell Biology, Pharmacology, and/or GI Pathophysiology courses and nearly all of the Surgeons participate in the surgical clerkships. Dr. Jones is Course Director for the MIS course series and laboratory. Bibliography (1/1/04-12/31/04) A total of 69 original articles were published and 30 articles were accepted for publication by faculty members in the Department of Surgery in 2004. This represents a 15 % increase when compared to the previous year. The number of Reviews, Chapters, and Editorials more than doubled, from 35 in 2003 to 77 in 2004. Contributions to Books, Monographs, and Textbooks, as well as Clinical Communications, Educational and Non-Print Materials, and Abstracts also increased from last year.

Frank Sellke was awarded a grant to examine the effects of statin drugs on the angiogenic response to protein growth factors. Two new research fellowships were created to fund the laboratory work of residents, through the generosity of a grateful patient. Drs. Levitsky and McCully continued to examine the mechanisms of ischemic preconditioning and myocardial protection. Drs. Sellke and Bianchi investigated changes in vascular function and signal transduction during cardiac surgery and myocardial ischemia, as well as therapeutic angiogenesis through the use of protein growth factors in a hypercholesterolemia setting. Dr. Ellis is looking at changes in the molecular characteristics of the GE junction leading to malignant transformation. Finally, Drs. Ralph Delatorre and John Liddicoat examined minimally invasive techniques for valve repair. The division at BIDMC continues to be one of the best-funded divisions of Cardiothoracic Surgery in the country in terms of NIH grants. 35 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Cardiothoracic Surgery 36 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Cardiothoracic Surgery F. Henry Ellis Jr., M.D., Ph.D. I. Narrative Report A tumor suppressor gene, p27, controls progression of cells from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. It is reduced or absent in resected specimens from patients with Barrett's Associated Adenocarcinoma (BAA). This loss of p27 is correlated with tumors of high grade, with increased depth of invasion, greater lymph node involvement and a decreased postoperative survival rate. These findings influenced us to develop an experimental mouse model of BAA by performing an esophagojejunostomy to promote reflux of alkaline and acid juices into the esophagus, and the administration of a carcinogen (N-methyl N-benzyl nitrosamine). Subsequently, we showed that malignant transformation of the esophageal mucosa was enhanced in p27 knockout (KO) mice, but could be reduced by administration of flavopiridol, a CDK inhibitor, as a chemopreventive agent.

Division Accomplishments in the Past Year 1. Having shown that flavopiridol could act as a chemopreventive method to reduce the high cancer rate in p27 KO mice after esophagojejunostomy and carcinogen administration, we began studies designed to evaluate chemotherapeutic approaches to treating BAA after its development. Flavopiridol combined with gemcitabine were administered to mice four months after esophagojejunostomy and carcinogen administration. Results of these preliminary studies and plans for the future will be discussed in section VII. 2.

Plans for the Coming Year 1. Having identified a chemopreventive agent (flavopiridol), which reduces the prevalence of esophageal cancer in our experimental mouse mode, our current studies are designed to identify chemotherapeutic agent or agents. In these experiments, p27 KO mice will undergo esophagojejunostomy and carcinogen administration and after 18 to 20 weeks will be treated by one or more CDK inhibitors for one month before terminating the experiment. Initial results employing a combination of flavopiridol and gemcitabine will be done. VII. Bibliography Original Articles (in press) 1. Lechpammer M, Xu, X, Ellis FH Jr., et al.

Narrative Report The primary focus of the laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms and subcellular localization of biochemical and molecular events contributing to myocardial cell death. In particular, we are interested in the discriminant and/or coordinate contribution of necrosis and apoptosis to myocardial cell death. Study designs utilize models of stunning and ischemia/reperfusion injury in the isolated Langendorff perfused rabbit and the in situ blood perfused pig heart to determine the relative contribution of these pathways in the aged as compared to the mature cardiac surgical patient. The laboratory is also involved in the isolation and identification of genes associated with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion amelioration using differential display, selective subtraction hybridization and microarray technology. For this, we use rabbit and pig heart cDNA libraries constructed in our laboratory and non-redundant cDNA's isolated, sequenced and putatively identified by our laboratory for microarray analysis. Current research areas involve identification of mitochondrial changes in morphology, function, respiration, volume and DNA integrity in association with intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic and necrotic myocardial cell death following ischemia and reperfusion. In addition studies are underway to identify mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel regulation of apoptosis and necrosis in the blood perfused pig heart model of acute myocardial infarction; and the role of STAT1/STAT2 signal transduction in myocardial preservation. These studies include comparison between mature and aged populations and differential gender response. Mitochondrion II. List of Current Employees 1.

Narrative Report The goal of our research efforts is threefold. 1) To examine changes in coronary and peripheral microvascular reactivity and permeability and identify the respective cellular and molecular mechanisms of change, which occur as a consequence of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegia in a porcine model and human atrial appendage and skeletal muscle. We use both in vivo and in vitro techniques in isolated microvessels and hearts. 2) To examine the use of therapeutic angiogenesis for the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). We identify causes for the lack of effect of exogenous growth factor therapy (implantation of sustained-release devices containing bFGF and/or VEGF) in a hypercholesterolemic porcine model with similarities to human CAD. 3) To characterize the gene expression profile of patients subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass and correlate differences in gene expression with clinical outcomes. We use cDNA microarray technology for this goal. II. List of Current Employees 1. Jun Feng, M.D., Ph.D. Instructor in Surgery 2. Munir Boodhwani, M.D. Research Fellow 3.

Narrative Report My research focuses on deciphering the mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of fiber on colon cancer. This work is of significant clinical and societal importance since colon cancer is the third most common cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.A. Although both environmental and genetic factors play a role in its genesis, environmental factors appear to predominate in importance. Butyrate, a product of fiber fermentation in the colon, is known to inhibit colon carcinogenesis and colon cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro . Cell growth occurs through cell cycle progression and cell cycle progression is controlled by a variety of protein cyclins and their associated kinases. These complexes are inhibited by small proteins, e.g. p21, which cause growth arrest. Our laboratory has shown that butyrate mediates this inhibition of colon cancer cell growth in vitro via transcriptional induction of the cell cycle inhibitor, p21. We have further defined the molecular mechanisms which are involved in the transcriptional induction of p21 by butyrate both in vitro and in vivo . In addition, we have expanded the scope of this work to include examination of other cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin B1. Cyclin B1 is a cell cycle promoter which is increased in colon cancer cells and we are now actively involved in studies which address the regulation and importance of this cell cycle gene product in colon cancer cell growth as well as its regulation by butyrate. Dr. Sonia Archer Our long-term goal is to continue to advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in butyrate's (and fiber's) protection against colon carcinogenesis. My expectation is that we will eventually be able to translate these findings into diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against colon cancer. II. List of Current Employees 1.

Narrative Report Basic Research The Nutrition Metabolism Laboratory studies the effects of plant components, such as soy phytochemicals, tea polyphenols and other dietary/herbal supplements, on the prevention and treatment of cancer and obesity, and to elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. We are particularly interested in the in vivo evaluation of preventive activities of bioactive components in soy, tea and other plant compounds by application of clinically relevant orthotopic tumor models. We are studying the molecular mechanisms by which dietary bioactive components modulate cell proliferation and apoptosis and tumor angiogenesis. We are investigating the effect of a novel daidzein-rich isoflavone-aglycone extract from soy germ fermentation with Koji fungus ( Aspergliius awamori ) on the prevention of obesity and inflammation. We are further isolating and identifying other bioactive components in soy and tea that may also be responsible for their cancer prevention activity. Collaborative research with the investigators inside and outside the BIDMC involves studies in the effect of nutritional treatment on early prevention of prostate cancer by using an established transgenic animal model (Dr. Steve Balk, Department of Medicine, BIDMC), in the modulation of gene expression by nutritional manipulations in prostate and breast cancer (Dr. Towia Libermann, Department of Medicine, BIDMC), in the effect of selenium on prostate cancer (Dr. Arthur Sytkowski, Department of Medicine, BIDMC), in the effect of plant components on prostate cancer prevention by inhibition of DNA topoisomerase (Dr. David Lee, McLean Hospital/HMS), and in the effect of cholesterol on prostate cancer (Dr. Michael Freeman, Children's Hospital).

We have a 30-year extensive experience conducting longitudinal studies particularly in multicenter settings. We are particularly well equipped with the infrastructure to develop clinical investigation and outcomes assessment. CSNM provides sophisticated, scientific nutrition interventions that are utilized to support research, training and patient care in many disease states. The CSNM mission is in line with the medical center's \"bench-to-bedside\" mission. In February 2004, Public Health Commissioner Christine Ferguson requested that the newly established Betsy Lehman Center for Patient Safety and Medical Error Reduction convene an Expert Panel to study weight loss surgical programs and procedures as they directly relate to patient safety. After consulting with stakeholders, the Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors (its advisory committee), and sites performing weight loss surgeries in the state, the Lehman Center convened a 24-member Expert Panel. This panel included leading authorities in the fields of obesity treatment, patient safety, nutrition, medical practice, managed care, pediatrics, nursing and ethics, as well as a consumer representative. Dr. Alan Harvey of Brigham and Women's Hospital served as Chair of the panel, and I was asked to serve as Vice-Chair. Each task group addressed five issues: (1) patient safety recommendations; (2) strategies for medical error reduction; (3) strategies for implementation of system improvements; (4) credentialing needs for systems and practitioners; and (5) research needed for the future. They met on a regular basis, presenting preliminary and then final recommendations to the expert panel, which met monthly from February through July. The full expert panel voted on the final recommendations at the last meeting in July. This process produced evidence-based recommendations aimed at ensuring that the procedures performed in Massachusetts are carried out under circumstances that make them as safe as possible for patients. CSNM undertook the task of coordinating the preparation of the executive report and ten taskforce reports and an editorial for publication in Obesity Research (Feb 2005). Already major insurance providers and sites performing weight loss surgeries in Massachusetts have adopted the recommendations. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has abstracted the report. CSNM in cooperation with the Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery will provide a Harvard Medical School, Division of Continuing Medical Education course entitled.\" Patient Safety in Obesity Surgery: Defining Best Practices.\" The CSNM in cooperation with Christina C. Wee, MD, MPH of the Division of General Medicine and Primary Care Medicine will submit on February 1, 2005 an NIH RO1 grant entitled \"Understanding How Patients Value Bariatric Surgery.\" 56 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 General Surgery This grant recognizes that while bariatric surgery is one of the few effective long-term treatments for obesity, it is neither risk-free nor universally effective, with recent evidence suggesting that long-term surgery-related weight loss and benefits may be less than previously thought. Publicity surrounding surgery-related deaths and complications reinforce the ambivalence some clinicians have about bariatric surgery and raise concerns about how patients make decisions about undergoing surgery. To appreciate whether the benefits outweigh the adverse effects of surgery for individual patients, we must first understand patients' expectations for surgery and how patients value different outcomes associated with surgery. Because of obesity's profound physical and psychosocial consequences, patients may value quality of life (QOL) benefits more than clinical benefits. Unrealistic expectations, however, may color the value patients place on surgery, causing patients to accept higher than reasonable surgical risks and to be less satisfied with even the best surgical outcomes. Health utility measurement is a valid and universal means of quantifying how patients value different health outcomes, which allows patients to consider all factors important to them. We propose to interview and clinically follow a diverse group of 500 patients undergoing bariatric surgery at two medical centers, and measure their health utility and QOL over time. By assessing patients' health utility before and after surgery and estimating gains in utility, we can determine the actual value patients place on bariatric surgery. In addition, we shall examine patients' motivations for surgery, their value for modest weight loss, and their understanding of surgical risks in order to examine whether these and other baseline factors predict the value patients will derive from surgery. Finally, we shall examine the association between different health outcomes and changes in health utility as an innovative means of determining the relative importance of different QOL and clinical outcomes on the value patients derive from surgery. In accomplishing these goals, findings from this study will help patients and clinicians make more informed decisions about bariatric surgery. In addition, our findings may identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to derive value from surgery. Finally, results from this study will facilitate more accurate valuation of surgery in cost-effective analyses that incorporate patients' perspectives, and shed light on whether the benefits experienced by many undergoing surgery outweigh the adverse effects experienced by others. Malnutrition Our current NIH sponsored research is concerned with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of malnutrition. The aim of our program is on new technologies in food and nutrition science, food delivery systems, and changes in social, political and ecological systems. The perception that people rarely succeed at weight reduction is, in fact, a misperception. Between 1999-2000 and 2001-2002, there were no significant changes among adults in the prevalence of overweight, obesity, or extreme obesity, or among children aged 6 through 19 years in the prevalence of at risk for overweight. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) defines 57 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 General Surgery successful long-term weight loss as an intentional reduction of 10% from baseline maintained for one year. Modest weight loss is not only beneficial but also achievable for overweight and obese patients. Of the Americans who have tried to lose weight, almost fifty percent of them have maintained their weight loss successfully for at least one year. The remaining half, those who seem unable to prevent or reverse their obesity, challenge us to mobilize our resources, confront issues at the heart of the obesity epidemic, and develop new solutions. Our work to date has paid off for millions of people. We've stopped the epidemic of obesity. Now it's time to do more by joining health care practitioners with all other stakeholders in this effort to prevent and reverse it. 3215 - 1994 1999-2000 2001-2002 66%66% Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity U.S. Adults, Age 20-74* Years U.S. Obesity Rates Begin to Level Off *Age-adjusted by the direct method to the year 2000 U.S. Bureau of the Census. Hormone Replacement Therapy In collaboration with OB/GYN, we continue to study alternatives to hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal women. We are investigating the effect of the novel daidzein-rich isoflavone-aglycone extract from soy germ fermentation on the severity and frequency of hot flashes in postmenopausal women. We are responsible for analyses of biomarkers in the blood and urine samples. The laboratory is equipped with two state-of-art HPLC systems to determine soy isoflavones and catecholamines for the proposed clinical study. The pilot and feasibility study as been accepted for publication and the recruitment for the full trial will complete recruitment by next year. Breast Cancer and Dietary Fat Despite preclinical and observational studies suggesting benefit, dietary fat influence on breast cancer outcomes has been controversial. We conducted a 58 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 General Surgery randomized trial to test whether an intensive dietary intervention to reduce dietary fat intake was more effective than a control condition in postmenopausal women with primary resected breast cancer receiving conventional cancer management. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival. A total of 2,437 women were randomized 40:60 to either a dietary intervention or control group. Dietary fat intake reduction was greater in the dietary intervention group compared to the control group (fat grams/day at 12 months, 33.3 + 16.7, mean + standard deviation (SD) versus 51.3 + 24.2, respectively, p<0.001). Women in the dietary group also had a weight loss of about seven pounds. After a median of 60.0 months, 277 events (local, regional, distant, or ipsilateral recurrence or new contralateral breast cancer) were reported: 96 of 975 in the dietary group and 181 of 1462 in the control group. A relapse-free survival difference favored dietary intervention over control (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.76, 95 percent confidence interval (95% CI) 0.60 - 0.98, P=0.034) for adjusted Cox model analysis reflecting a 3.2 percent absolute difference in relapse-free survival after 8 years. A lifestyle intervention resulting in dietary fat intake reduction improves the relapse-free survival of postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving conventional cancer management. TABLE 1.

Callery, M.D. I. Narrative Report Pancreatic cancer is an extraordinarily lethal disease. It is profoundly resistant to any therapy currently available. Our research focuses on the identification of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon. We have undertaken three different approaches to reveal these mechanisms. 1. We have examined the expression and potency of three major death receptors TNF-R, TRAIL-R and Fas in mediating cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cell lines. We have analyzed the expression of major anti-apoptotic factors, cell cycle regulators and death receptor decoys (DcRs) in comparison with normal pancreas tissues and five other human malignant tumor cell lines. By using RNA interference (RNAi) we demonstrate that predominant Bcl-x L over- expression plays a critical role in pancreatic cancer chemoresistance. The knockdown of predominant Bcl-x L overexpression significantly reduces the viability of pancreatic cancer cells to TNF-/g302 and TRAIL mediated apoptosis by sublethal-dose single and combined antitumor drugs. Tumor xenograft athymic mouse model is used to assess the role of Bcl-x L overexpression in tumorigenicity, in vivo . 2. investigating the role histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1) overexpression in tumor survival. Histone acety-ltansferases (HATs) and HDACs affect gene expression by altering the acetylation status of histones and some transcription factors on target gene promoters. We have found that pancreatic cancer cell lines co-overexpress HDAC-1/3 and ERK1/2. In particular, trichostatin A-induced depletion of HDAC-1 is associated with significant apoptosis in the cultures of pancreatic cancer cell lines. Trichostatin A-triggered HDAC-1 degradation coincides with ERK1/2 depletion. These studies support the notion that HDAC-1 overexpression is associated with chemoresistance, and the stability of ERK1/2 may be regulated by acetylation. We are constructing HDAC-1 RNAi knockdown vectors to investigate these issues. Bcl-XL TATARNA Pol II HxAPHATxHDACxTSA Transcription Figure 11, Model of HDAC regulation of Bcl-XL transcription. RNA Pol II transcription machinery is recruited to Bcl-XL promoter. A putative HDAC protein (HxAP). This complex recruited to Bcl-XL promoter region.

We are interested in the identification of HDAC-1 target genes that may regulate chemoresistance. HDAC-1 is a transcription regulator. Exogenous HDAC-1 and VEGF productions, suggesting that HDAC-1 overexpression may be very critical to tumor angiogenesis and survival. However, it is unknown which other genes are specifically regulated by 71 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 General Surgery HDAC-1. We will employ microarray hybridization to identify HDAC-1 specific target genes. The understanding of HDAC-1 target genes and their specific roles in chemoresistance is very important for gene-orientated chemotherapy. II. List of Current Employees 1.

Divisional Accomplishments in the Past Year During the past year, we have made the following important discoveries. 1. We have demonstrated that different pancreatic cancer cell lines coexpress high-level TRAIL-R, Fas, and TNF-R1, but are strongly resistant to apoptosis triggered by the death receptors. Death receptor decoys DcR2 and DcR3 overexpression may partly contribute to the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL-R and Fas-mediated cytotoxicity. However, predominant Bcl-x L overexpression plays a vital role in the chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer. 2. We have developed Bcl-x L RNAi knockdown retroviral vectors that cause L overexpression in transduced pancreatic cells. The knockdown of the predominant Bcl-x L overexpression significantly reduces the viability of pancreatic cancer cells to TNF-/g302, TRAIL mediated apoptosis by sublethal-dose single and combined antitumor drugs, including geldanamycin, PS-341, trichostatin A (TSA) and suppresses tumor growth by inactivating histone deacetylase activities and ERK pathways. 3. We have found that geldanamycin and PS-341 or trichostatin A synergistically block NF-kB signaling and induce apoptosis in most pancreatic cancer cell lines. PS-3241/geldanamycin and PS-341/TSA regimens reduce the viability of pancreatic cancer cells by an average of 61% and 79%, respectively. PS-341/TSA apoptosis by activating caspase cascades in pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore, PS-341 and TSA combination may be a novel therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer. V.

Narrative Report Our current NIH sponsored research is concerned with gastric barrier function during health and disease, and our projects include mechanisms that regulate tight junction organization and permeability in the stomach, gastric mucosal restitution after injury, and cell death and survival in gastric epithelial cells. Although we are particularly interested in the regulation of barrier function/malfunction during Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and how defects in the gastric mucosal barrier result in mucosal damage and gastric atrophy during infection, such studies are also pertinent to understanding gastric ulceration and stress-induced mucosal damage under surgical conditions and other critical illnesses including trauma and sepsis, where inflammation and hypoxia impact mucosal permeability, restitution, and epithelial cell death. Tight junction Permeability Although the structure of tight junctions is well defined (inset), whether this generic organization is the same and how it relates to barrier properties of the gastric mucosa is unknown. In recent studies, it was shown that when occludin, one of two proteins that seal the para-cellular space (inset), is knocked-out, mucosal damage occurs in the stomach that is identical to infection with HP. Lack of occludin affected only 2 tissues, the stomach and testis, suggesting that occludin regulates a novel pathway in these tissues. Because little is known about how occludin regulates development and/or maintenance of tight junctions at the surface of the gastric mucosa or in gastric glands, new culture models were recently developed by us to study the cell and molecular regulation of occludin in gastric surface and chief cells. How infection with HP alters occludin localization and mucosal permeability are studies currently underway in the laboratory. from Mitic, et al, Am J Physiol 279: G250, 2002 Gastric Mucosal Restitution after Injury This laboratory is most well known for studies concerning mechanisms that regulate restitution, or rapid epithelial repair after injury, in the stomach. Our current focus concerns mechanisms by which intracellular pH is regulated and how this regulation affects restitution and subsequent repair of barrier function after injury. We recently proposed a novel idea that H +/lactate export, via the monocarboxylate transporter, may be essential for pH regulation during restitution by exporting lactate that is generated by glycolysis, a process we recently showed to be the main energy source for restitution after injury in the stomach. Current studies are concerned with understanding the role of monocarboxylate transport in restitution. 75 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 General Surgery Cell Death A new area of investigation in the laboratory is concerned with understanding pathways that regulate cell death and survival of gastric epithelial cells. These new studies were initiated because Th1 cytokines, liberated during HP infection, kill gastric epithelial cells rather than affecting tight junction integrity as occurs in other GI cells. In all inflammatory diseases of the stomach, including HP, death of gastric chief and parietal cells within the gastric gland results in atrophy, which is the major initiating factor in the progression to gastric cancer. In work nearly ready for publication, a novel idea will be proposed that gastric chief and parietal cells have a single, non-overlapping, cell death pathway that is regulated by unique factors and physiology. Chief cells express Bcl-x, which is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms, whereas parietal cells express BAD, which is regulated by phosphorylation on three serine residues. The lab is currently working to understand the regulation of these pathways using isolated cell models. II. List of Current Employees Research Laboratory 1. Kimihito Tashima, Ph.D. Research Fellow 2.

Narrative Report The research efforts in our group are focused on the metabolic and inflammatory responses to injury and sepsis in skeletal muscle and intestinal mucosa. Sepsis and severe injury are associated with a catabolic response in skeletal muscle. Studies in our laboratory have provided evidence that muscle wasting during sepsis and after burn injury mainly reflects degradation of myofibrillar proteins. Our research supports a model in which myofilaments are released from the sarcomere through a calcium/calpain-dependent mechanism. The myofilaments (actin and myosin) are then ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome (Figure). The gene expression of calpains and several components in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is upregulated in atrophying muscle, supporting the concept that increased gene transcription is an integral part of muscle wasting mechanisms. Currently, the transcriptional regulation of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is studied. In particular, experiments are conducted to examine the role of the transcription factors C/EBP/g69 and /g71 and the nuclear coactivator p300 in the regulation of the newly described ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and atrogin-1. In addition, the role of calcium and calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMK II) in the regulation of muscle proteolysis is being investigated. In other studies, the regulation of IL-6 production in gut mucosa and enterocytes is examined. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that may have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. In previous studies we have found that mucosal IL-6 production is increased during sepsis and endotoxemia and in human enterocytes stimulated with IL-1/g69 . In other experiments we have defined transcription factors (NF-kB, AP-1, and C/EBP) involved in the activation of the IL-6 gene in stimulated enterocytes. We are currently testing means to influence the regulation of the IL-6 gene in mucosa and enterocytes. We have recently made the interesting observation that the heat shock response upregulates the expression of IL-6 in stimulated enterocytes and in intestinal mucosa. In ongoing experiments, we are defining signaling pathways that are involved in heat shock-induced potentiation of enterocyte IL-6 production and have found evidence that the PI3K/Akt pathway may be important for this response. Because IL-6 may exert protective effects in enterocytes/gut mucosa, treatments that augment IL-6 production and 83 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 General Surgery understanding the mechanisms of stimulated IL-6 production may have important clinical implications.

Section for Minimally Invasive Surgery Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery (CMIS) Teleconferencing, Simulation and Technical Skills Lab Bariatric Program I. Narrative Report Our group integrates clinical activity and teaching into innovation and education research. We have focused on minimally invasive surgery, bariatric surgery, and technical skill acquisition. Bench-top work last year has led to technical innovations in instrumentation for laparoscopic adjustable banding, robotic colonoscopy, and fibrin glue repair of inguinal hernia repair. CMIS has trained medical students, residents, research fellows, clinical fellows and surgeons worldwide in advanced laparoscopic techniques. Education research is focused on establishing a technical skills laboratory validating new teaching tools and instituting curriculums for medical students and residents. At Harvard Medical School we have established educational programs as part of the Teleconferencing, Simulation and Technical Skills Lab. First year students observe live surgery telebroadcasts to student groups learning anatomy. During clerkships, students also interact with surgeons from the teleconference center in small groups. These unique learning approaches are being studied and compared to traditional pathways. The web link is www.bidmc.harvard.edu/mis . In collaboration with Chemical Engineering at MIT, we are studying alginate and collagen as materials, which can be modified to synthesize an injectable mesh. The goal is to develop a biodegradable liquid that will solidify upon injection into the hernia defect. Availability of an injectable liquid mesh can only make the hernia operation less invasive but also potentially eliminate the need for incisions. The project is currently funded through the Center for the Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology (CIMIT), a research consortium of Harvard hospitals and the MIT. In collaboration with MGH Weight Loss Program, we have developed a rodent model to study the laparoscopic adjustable band compared to the gastric bypass. Studies evaluate central gut neuroendocrine changes after surgery, specifically ghrelin, POMC pathway, PYY 3-3. Bariatric efforts have also resulted in publication of evidence based best practices in Massachusetts, hospital clinical care pathways, and SAGES national consensus statement on the surgical treatment of morbid obesity.

Narrative Report Basic Research The basic research effort in my laboratory is concerned with 1) the effects of metabolic stress in the form of hypoxia and ischemia on epithelial Cl- secretory in native human intestinal mucosa, 2) involvement of purinergic signaling pathways in the secretory response, and 3) the modulatory role of basolateral K+ channel activity on the regulation of ischemia-induced secretion. Additional projects involve regulation of the gene expression of adiponectin (insulin sensitizing) receptor (AdipoR1 and R2) in muscle and liver in obesity and diabetes. Clinical Research For clinical research, my group investigates the changes of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity following physical reduction of visceral fat mass by laparoscopic omentectomy. Diabetic obese patients with body mass index of 30-40 undergo omentectomy and their insulin resistance is evaluated by various parameters including serum insulin, glucose tolerance, peripheral vascular reactivity, profiles of hormones and cytokines including adiponectin, leptin, PYY, GLP-1 and GIP.

Adiponectin receptor expression has been studied in mouse muscle tissue culture and shows a regulatory event by its own ligand, adiponectin hormone, and dexamethasone. No other metabolic hormones and cytokines appear to be affecting AdipoR1 or R2 gene expression significantly including IL-6, TNF- /g68. Adiponectin receptor (R1 and R2) expression in seems to correlate with the 101 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 General Surgery degree of obesity and insulin resistance in human liver and muscle tissue samples. 2. Omentectomy surgery part of the IRB-approved Laparoscopic omentectomy project is completed. A total of 6 diabetic patients successfully underwent preoperative glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity studies as well as omentectomy without complications. Longitudinal efficacy of this therapy on diabetes is being evaluated by follow-up glucose tolerance study. All serum pertinent metabolic markers including adiponectin, PYY, GLP-1, GIP along with insulin and glucose are being assayed for detailed hormonal data. Data analysis will be followed by a summary manuscript detailing the beneficial effects of the omentectomy procedure in diabetic patients. Individual Accomplishments 1.

Tawa Jr, M.D., Ph.D. I. Narrative Report Basic Research In continuation of our past work, which focuses on the mechanisms by which dietary protein deficiency reduces muscle proteolysis, we have performed experiments demonstrating that pre-conditioning with a low protein diet prevents the rise in protein breakdown and loss of muscle size induced by catabolic stimuli, including denervation, fasting, or free radical exposure. In studies performed in conjunction with D. Cai and S. Sholeson of the Joslin Clinic, we demonstrated that in the muscles of transgenic mice, in which the NF-kB inflammatory cascade is constitutively activated, rates of protein turnover are almost twice as great as in normal muscle. This observation explains the atrophy which occurs in the transgenic muscles and it suggests an important role for the NF-kB signaling pathway in the regulation of muscle size. In unrelated experiments, we have shown that the amino acid leucine inhibits protein degradation in cultured muscle cells by activating the protein kinase mTor, thus suppressing the ATP-ubiquitin- proteasome dependent pathway for Leucine also blocks the induction of proteolysis by glucocorticoids in these cells, and we are presently defining the molecular mechanisms for this interaction.

Plans for the Coming Academic Year Basic Research 1. Determining the basis for the suppression of muscle proteolysis which occurs in conditions of dietary protein deficiency and prolonged fasting. The role.of endocrine mechanisms, specifically the interaction between insulin signaling and thyroid and adrenal status, will be a specific focus for the coming period. Exploring the potential contribution of novel gut or adipocyte- derived hormones to the reduced muscle proteolysis is another goal. 2. Studying the mechanisms by which antecedent dietary protein deficiency prevents muscle atrophy caused by fasting, denervation, and oxygen free radicals. 3. Recent discoveries suggest that the signaling mechanisms for the activation of intracellular protein breakdown in skeletal muscle by oxygen free radicals might 110 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 General Surgery involve pathways suggested to have a role in cellular responses to caloric restriction and aging. These signaling mechanisms (Sirt, HIF, FOXO) have attracted great interest. We will explore whether the suppression of protein breakdown by antecedent protein deficiency in these conditions involves intersection with such pathways. Clinical Research 1. Role of sentinel lymph node mapping for predicting the natural history of invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the trunk and extremities. 2. Prognostic indicators for thin invasive melanomas. 3.

Narrative Report Our group is interested in the application of quantitative and molecular tools to elucidate the role of hemodynamic forces in cerebrovascular pathophysiological states, such as cerebral aneurysms and carotid and intracranial atherosclerosis. The laboratory's efforts are focused in integrating both basic and clinical research. Basic Research Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) Modeling of Aneurysms and Atherosclerosis Using (CFD) techniques, we are estimating the hemodynamic conditions in and around cerebral aneurysms in an effort to predict their propensity to expand and rupture or stabilize. An additional application of this technique is the study of the effect of endovascular embolic devices such as endovascular coils on the alteration of intra-aneurysmal flow to predict long-term recanalization. The technique is also being used to evaluate the change in hemodynamics following cervical carotid stenting to help predict the risk of carotid restenosis. A C B Figure 1. Analysis of hemodynamics at the inflow of an intracranial left middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm using the technique developed in our laboratory. The 3D angiography dataset is segmented into a 3D spatial model (A). The space model is then processed to obtain a high-quality hexahedral mesh (B). The mesh is then used to perform the CFD simulation using boundary conditions to obtain the hemodynamic parameters such as the instantaneous blood flow velocity profile (C); note the high velocity gradient at the inflow zone of the aneurysm. 115 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Neurosurgery Mechanotransduction of Hemodynamic and Osmotic Forces in Endothelial Cells We are studying the changes in structure and function of endothelial cells in response to fluid shear stress and osmotic forces. These are important in the understanding of the vessel wall response to hemodynamics in and around aneurysms and atherosclerotic lesions. We are also evaluating the structural and functional changes in response to osmotic mannitol therapy. A B Figure 2. Morphological and functional response of endothelium to fluid flow. Bovine brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) were exposed to no flow (A, top) or to hemodynamic fluid shear stress of venous (4 dyn/cm2; A, middle) or arterial magnitude (20 dyn/cm2; A, bottom) for 18 hours. Note the shear magnitude-dependent alignment and orientation with the direction of flow. Northern blot analysis demonstrates a time- dependent induction of vascular Data Fusion/Information Extraction in Cerebral Angiography In collaboration with engineers at Draper Laboratory, we are developing new techniques for data extraction from 2D digital subtraction angiograms and 3D datasets obtained during intracranial interventional procedures in order to help develop an enhanced-reality system for assisting the operator in detecting real-time changes in the cerebral vasculature during the treatment of cerebrovascular lesions. B A 116 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Neurosurgery Figure 3: Quantitative analysis of the digital subtraction images obtained during cerebral angiography. Edge detection algorithm provides clear delineation of the blood vessels on a lateral projection angiogram of the intracranial internal carotid artery (A). Proprietary analysis tools enable the delineation of each branch of the internal carotid artery (blue tracing, B). Clinical Research Parent Vessel Response to Intracranial Aneurysm Stent-Coil Therapy We are using high-resolution imaging techniques to evaluate the response of the parent vessel to the intracranial placement of flexible stents and adjunct endovascular coils in patients. We have demonstrated that stent-coil therapy is associated with a small degree of intimal hyperplasia even in the absence of any balloon angioplasty that may be injurious to the vascular wall. C A B Figure 4. Stent-coil treatment of a intracranial ophthalmic carotid artery aneurysm shows the post-treatment (A) (B) spatial model (coils appear in white; stent ends as small dots proximal and distal to lesion). Quantitative morphometric analysis of the size caliber before and after treatment at five separate points encompassing the parent vessel proximal and distal to stent (C). Points B-E show a statistically significant decrease in the cross-sectional area illustrating the remodeling process and intimal hyperplasia. II. List of Current Employees 1. Edward Kim, M.S.

We have developed the workflow necessary for the study of hemodynamics in and around cervical and intracranial vascular lesions. This system extracts a high-quality hexahedral mesh from a rotational angiography volume dataset, and then uses CFD techniques to enable analysis of real patient data. Early findings point to the presence of a high shear stress gradients near the inflow zone of cerebral aneurysms. 2. In conjunction with the Alper lab in Molecular Medicine, we have uncovered a role for Rho in the endothelial cytoskeletal response to osmotic stress. 3. We have developed a partnership with Gridpro Inc. through the Technology Ventures Office (TVO) to develop an automatic mesh generation algorithm for high-throughput analysis of 3D aniography datasets. 4. In collaboration with scientists at Draper Lab, we have developed a new technique for detecting changes in the operative field using spatiotempotal analysis techniques. 5. Using high-resolution 3D-RA techniques, we uncovered a slight but significant degree of intimal hyperplasia in intracranial stent-coil therapy. V.

Slavin, M.D. Plastic Surgery Research Center I. Narrative Report Basic Research One of our research projects is to restore lymphatic flow by promoting lymphangiogenesis through the use of specific growth factors incorporated into an alginate biodegradable hydrogel. The delivery rate in alginate gels can be predetermined and its local, rather than systemic administration, can be of great advantage. We have completed in vitro proliferation and migration studies using specific lymphatic endothelial cell growth factors, VEGF-C and angiopoietin-2. These two growth factors were previously incorporated into alginate gels. We are now conducting in vivo experiments using these biodegradable gels in a mouse tail lymphedema model. Another research project in our group involves the use of laser capture microdissection to isolate lymphatic endothelial cells from human lymphedematous and normal adipose tissue samples, and to isolate mRNA and evaluate differential gene expression through Affymetrix gene-chip arrays. Genes over or under expressed will be analyzed and studied for their potential role in lymphoangiogenesis. Clinical Research Over the past year, Drs. Sumner Slavin and Loren Borud continue to develop a Lymphedema Treatment Center. The Lymphedema Program is starting to gain national recognition. Over 100 patients have already been seen and treated, and the program is attracting patients from throughout the United States and abroad. A second clinic day each month as been added to the schedule for consultations and follow-up, and a Patient Handbook has been developed for patients. The Clinic also serves as a focal point for much needed residency education in the area of the diagnosis, treatment, and management of lymphedema. No other medical institution in Boston (and few in the United States) provides residency education in this medical area. A patient database has been established at the clinic. This clinical data is leading to research projects/papers by attending physicians and residents. Drs. Slavin and Borud are currently managing the preparation of manuscripts involving treatment of scrotal lymphedema, lipedema, lymphocele following thigh lift procedures, and treatment of lower extremity lymphedema using suction-assisted lipectomy. Several of these have already been submitted for publication and in abstract form to a number of regional, national, and international meetings. 125 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Plastic Surgery II.

Narrative Report Basic Research My main research interest is the vascular reactivity of micro- and macro- circulation. During the last few years, I developed the Microcirculation Lab, which tests the micro-vasculature in a non-invasive way. The Microcirculation Lab is also equipped with an ultrasound apparatus that enables evaluation of endothelial function in the brachial artery. Our research is mainly funded by grants from the NIH, American Diabetes Association, and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. In addition, we conduct investigator-initiated studies that are funded by the pharmaceutical industry. I am interested in the relationship between functional changes in the vascular reactivity and structural changes of the skin. In collaboration with investigators from other labs, such as Jon A. Buras, M.D, Ph.D and Christiane Ferran, M.D., Ph.D., we are currently involved in the study of mechanisms, such as eNOS and RAGE and PARP activation, which are involved in endothelial dysfunction that is present in diabetic patients. My laboratory is also collaborating with small biotech companies. This collaboration has resulted in funding from the NIH, either in the form of SBIR or SBTT grants. The main aim of these collaborations is to develop new techniques that can improve our diagnostic abilities or develop new therapeutic interventions that will treat long-term diabetic complications. Dr. Veves in his office. My group is also interested in the etiology of diabetic foot problems and the pathophysiology of wound healing in diabetes. We are currently conducting a larger prospective study that will evaluate the role of microvascular dysfunction in foot ulceration and wound healing failure. 135 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Podiatry In collaboration with the department of Radiology, we employ a 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance scanner that can access metabolic activity through measurements of the concentrations and reaction rates of the high-energy phosphorus cellular compounds in humans by employing magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy methods. The main advantage of this technique is that it can give a direct non-invasive assessment of muscle metabolism. As a first step, we evaluate the effect of diabetes and its complications on the leg blood flow and metabolic function. Finally, research in my lab, in collaboration with Roy Freeman, M.D., examines the natural history of the progression of peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients. II. List of Current Employees 1.

Bach, M.D. Takashi Maki, M.D., Ph.D. Scott R. Johnson, M.D. Anthony P. Monaco, M.D. Seth J. Karp, M.D. Leo E. Otterbein, Ph.D. Khalid Khwaja, M.D. The Division of Transplantation has active clinical, translational, and basic research programs that continue to expand. The research laboratory of Fritz H. Bach, M.D. continues investigations into the ability of anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory protective genes to promote organ and tissue graft survival. His laboratory has shown, among other things, that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression or administration of either carbon monoxide (CO) or biliverdin/bilirubin leads to improved survival of heart and islet cell allografts in mice and suppressed T cell responses. Dr. Bach recently received an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Vienna. The laboratories of Anthony P. Monaco, M.D. and Takashi Maki, M.D., Ph.D. are focused on inducing tolerance to organ allografts utilizing donor bone marrow cell 141 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Transplantation infusion combined with immunosuppression by polyclonal anti-T cell antibody and rapamycin. This work has been extended into non-human primates with the awarding of a new five-year grant from the National Institutes of Health to examine tolerance induction. Their laboratories are also studying the effectiveness of polyclonal anti-T cell antibodies and exendin-4, an agent that stimulates beta cell neogenesis, in inducing disease remission in autoimmune diabetic NOD mice and have demonstrated a synergistic effect between these agents in achieving permanent remission. The clinical research activities of Douglas W. Hanto, M.D., Ph.D., Scott R. Johnson, M.D., and Khalid Khwaja, M.D., focus on the development of malignancies after organ transplantation, new immunosuppressive protocols to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity, ABO incompatible transplantation, and kidney and liver transplantation in HIV+ patients. We have shown that the risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD) is lowest in kidney transplant recipients receiving anti-IL2 R monoclonal antibody induction and is associated with improved patient and graft survival. Monoclonal antibody induction is associated with a higher risk of developing PTLD. We have shown that quadruple immunosuppression, plasmapheresis, and splenectomy can prevent antibody mediated rejection in ABO incompatible liver transplantation and may be evidence of accommodation caused by upregulation of protective genes. The Division of Transplantation is participating in an NIH sponsored 5-year trial examining the role of transplantation in HIV+ patients and is one of the most active centers. A number of other clinical studies are ongoing. The laboratory of Seth J. Karp, M.D. is examining the genes responsible for liver development and regeneration. So far his studies have identified approximately 20 genes, of which half are novel with no known function. A second project seeks to determine lineage commitments in the developing and regenerating liver that may suggest a strategy for recapitulating liver organogenesis in vitro. Finally, his laboratory is also examining similarities in the transcriptional profiles of the developing liver and liver tumors that may allow the development of genetic markers for tumor aggressiveness and molecular targets for therapy. Dr. Karp is the recipient of an NIH K08 award and an American College of Surgeons Faculty Development Award for his research studies. The laboratory of Leo E. Otterbein, Ph.D. focuses on the gas molecule carbon monoxide and the potent therapeutic effects when used at low concentrations in models of shock, transplantation and vascular injury. This work stems from the study of the heme oxygenase-1, also a focus of the laboratory as this inducible enzyme, which has been labeled a protective gene generates CO as a product during the catalysis of heme. His research support is for the study of the mechanisms of action of CO including identifying novel targets of its action. He is particularly interested in cell signal transduction and has focused on the mitogen activated PPAR/g534 and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF1 /g68) in this year. These genes, while not containing heme moieties, the otherwise presumed cellular target of CO, are critically involved in allowing CO to exert protective effects. 142 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Transplantation As one can see from this brief overview, and the details provided in this report from each of the individual investigators, the research programs in the Division of Transplantation are vibrant, innovative, and growing. We also will be focusing significant efforts in developing translational research projects in nonhuman primate models with the ultimate goal of clinical trials. These include studies of tolerance induction using innovative therapies and studies of transcriptional profiling in a nonhuman primate model of liver transplantation in collaboration with Dr. Terry Strom and studies of protective gene upregulation in nonhuman primate models. Our goal is to translate laboratory advances that are made into clinical applications in man. 143 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Transplantation 144 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Transplantation Fritz H. Bach, M.D., Ph.D. I. Narrative Report My group focuses on the effects of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and two of the products of HO-1 degradation of heme in models of shock, transplantation and vascular injury. We are particularly interested in cell signal transduction and have focused on the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and other signaling molecules in particular this year. We studied the effects of biliverdin/bilirubin in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in models of the small intestinal and liver transplantation as well as in intimal hyperplasia following balloon injury. Most have begun a study of the signaling events consequent to biliverdin administration in LPS stimulated macrophages. Biliverdin acted to ameliorate the undesirable consequences of decreased function and tissue injury in IRI likely based on its potent anti-inflammatory properties. Interestingly, biliverdin did not achieve these results in the same manner as carbon monoxide (CO), another agent we tested in the small bowel transplantation model even though both agents prevented bowel dysfunction and cell damage. Biliverdin suppressed the expression of the adhesion molecules and markedly reduced the infiltration of host leukocytes into the bowel, something that CO did not do. This is in concert with our findings that bilirubin suppressed adhesion molecules on cultured endothelial cells stimulated with TNF- /g68 while CO did not. The studies on the suppression of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation following balloon injury provided further evidence that the beneficial effects of biliverdin/bilirubin are mediated by pathways different from the effects of CO. Both biliverdin/bilirubin and CO suppressed SMC proliferation in vitro and intimal hyperplasia in vivo, however, the signaling molecules that effected these changes were different for CO and biliverdin. Even though both molecules involved modulation of p38 MAPK, biliverdin suppressed p38 while CO stimulated p38. We hypothesize that this is due to the differential modulation of p38 /g68 and p38/g533 by CO and biliverdin. As a part of the study with biliverdin and intimal hyperplasia, we studied the downstream signaling molecules involved in those effects. Interestingly, biliverdin modulated the phosphorylation of Rb leading to hyperphosphorylation of that molecule and consequent suppression of action of transcription factors such as YY1 that are needed for SMC proliferation. This again was different from the effects of CO. We extensively studied the effects of expressing HO-1 in a model of tolerance induced by DST. The conclusions from that study showed that not only did induction of HO-1 increase the efficacy of DST stimulated tolerance, but blocking of HO-1 eliminated the tolerance-inducing effects of DST. This finding suggests that HO-1 may be a critical molecule that is needed for T regulatory mediated tolerance, something we are testing further. Also in that study, we confirmed the earlier findings of the previous years that HO-1 expression leads to antigen induced cell death (AICD). However, in this case we showed additionally that HO-1 145 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Transplantation expression did not lead to the death of T regulatory cells, although exact quantitation of those effects must still be accomplished.

Narrative Report Basic Research My current laboratory research is focused on understanding the mechanisms of antibody-mediated rejection in ABO incompatible allografts and the development of accommodation post-transplant. We are examining the ability of endothelial cells, the target of antibody-mediated rejection, to upregulate protective genes (genes that are anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-proliferative in some cases), oxygenase-1 (HO-1), A20, Bcl-2, and Bcl-x L. Expression of protective genes in the endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells protects these cells from undergoing activation that leads to inflammation and graft rejection. We hypothesize that treatment of the donor and recipient by inducing HO-1 or administering a product such as CO or biliverdin will protect the endothelial cells from antibodies and complement. We are testing our approach in a rodent model and will follow this with large animal models (pig and cynomolgus monkeys) in which ABO incompatible animals are tested. This work is being done in collaboration with Fritz Bach, M.D., and Leo Otterbein, Ph.D. in our division. A second area of focus is the development of a non-human primate model of liver transplantation and the testing of novel tolerogenic immunosuppressive regimens. We are developing method for the successful transplantation of the liver in cynomolgus monkeys. We are planning to examine the ability of interleukin-2 and interleukin-15 fusion proteins and rapamycin (with or without donor specific transfusions) to induce a permanent state of tolerance as has been shown in a monkey islet cell transplant model. The mechanism is limitation of the early expansion of activated T cells, accentuation of their subsequent apoptotic clearance, amplifying their depletion by antibody dependent mechanisms, while preserving CD4+CD25+ T cell dependent immunoregulatory networks. The balance between cytopathic and regulatory T cells is thereby tipped toward regulatory cells. We believe this may be a potent and effective means of inducing tolerance in the non-human primate model of liver transplantation and will have clinical applicability. This work is being done in collaboration with Terry Strom, M.D., Maria Koulmanda, Ph.D., and Scott Johnson, M.D. Clinical Research We are engaged in a number of prospective and retrospective clinical studies involving transplantation (kidney, liver, pancreas, and islet), dialysis access, and nontransplant hepatobiliary surgery. We have had a longstanding interest in the development of malignancies after transplantation, particularly post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD), and also in the risk of transmission of malignancy to recipients from donors with cancer. We have also been interested in antibody mediated rejection in kidney and liver allograft recipients and the development of therapeutic strategies to permit ABO incompatible transplants and transplants in highly sensitized patients. With the introduction of several new immunosuppressive drugs over the past several years, we are examining changes in immunosuppressive protocols to minimize the side-effects of chronic cortico- 149 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Transplantation steroid and calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. The ability to safely transplant HIV+ patients is another significant focus of our clinical research activities as part of a multi-center NIH sponsored trial. We are co-investigators in an NIH/NIAID Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation study of novel immunosuppressive protocols. We are beginning a clinical study in liver transplant recipients using transcriptional profiling to analyze the allograft response in patients that are likely to have predictive value for post-transplant liver function and risk of rejection, with the ultimate goal of being able to individualize the degree of immunosuppression. There are many other ongoing clinical studies examining several issues, including: risk of infectious complications with thymoglobulin induction in kidney transplant recipients; use of donors after cardiac death for kidney, liver, and pancreas transplantation; safety and efficacy of older live kidney donors; role of surgical procedures for bleeding varices in the transplant era; results of total hepatectomy and backtable resection for hepatic malignancies; incidence and outcome of colon cancer after kidney and liver transplantation; antiviral prophylaxis in kidney trans-plantation; delayed steroid withdrawal of FTY720, a novel new immunosuppressive drug, in kidney transplantation.

Narrative Report Basic Research Basic research in the laboratory is concerned with the molecular basis for liver development and regeneration. Ultimately we would like to apply this knowledge to produce liver tissue substitutes, enhance liver regeneration, and understand liver cancer. Multiple projects are ongoing in the laboratory. The first involves a screen for genes that are important for liver development and regeneration. Identification of genes upregulated during liver regeneration is possible using a variety of technologies. Similarly, identification of genes expressed during liver development is fairly straightforward. The large number of genes involved in both processes makes it difficult to discover which genes are important and potentially clinically useful. We are employing a strategy based on the hypothesis that genes common to both processes will be particularly important for control of liver growth. By looking at these processes together we have identified approximately 20 genes we consider to be high yield. Approximately half of the genes are novel, with no known function. These are currently being analyzed using real time PCR, in situ hybridization, gene-trap knockouts, RNA inhibition, and transgenic overexpression. The second project seeks to determine lineage commitments in the developing and regenerating liver. We believe understanding which cells give rise to which cells in vivo will suggest a strategy for recapitulating liver organogenesis in vitro . Using transgenic mice that express an inducible recombinase in the liver and a target construct that fluoresces when the recombinase is activated, we are able to heritably mark liver cells in a temporally-restricted manner. Following the cells and their progeny is then possible after various experimental manipulations. The final project searches for similarities in the transcriptional profiles of the developing liver and liver tumors. We hypothesize that the genetic programs involved in determining tumor aggressiveness are similar to different develop-mental stages of the liver. Using microarray technology we hope to develop genetic markers for tumor aggressiveness and molecular targets for therapy Clinical Research Clinical research examines which donor factors portend poor survival for the renal allograft. We determined that donor kidneys that suffer acute tubular necrosis around the time of harvest can be safely transplanted if there are no other significant co-morbidities. We also characterized the outcomes when these kidneys have moderate pathological changes on biopsy. II. List of Current Employees 1.

Narrative Report My group focuses on the gas molecule carbon monoxide (CO) and the potent therapeutic effects of CO when it is used at low concentrations in models of shock, transplantation and vascular injury. This work stems from the study of heme oxygenase-1, als.o a focus of the laboratory as this inducible enzyme, which has been labeled a protective gene generates CO as a product during the catalysis of heme. My research focus is to study of the mechanisms of action of CO including identifying novel targets of its action. We are particularly interested in cell signal transduction and have focused this year on mitogen activated (MAPK), PPAR/g534, and hypoxia while not containing heme moieties, the otherwise presumed cellular target of CO, are critically involved in allowing CO to exert protective effects. In studies this year, we employed genomics and microarray analyses to identify novel targets of CO in macrophages. As observed in Figure 1, we performed kinetic experiments ( Fig. 1 A) to evaluate the early events of gene expression in response to CO in the presence and absence of endotoxin. The genes are categorized as shown (Fig. 1 B,C). Detailed bioinformatics revealed the transcription factor early growth response gene-1 (egr-1) as being inhibited by CO in response to LPS. In other studies, we showed inhibition of egr-1 by CO in the lung (Figure 2). Further dissection of this gene revealed that PPAR /g534 is induced during the pretreatment period and if this inhibited by either genetic (siRNA) or via selective chemical inhibition, the protective effects of CO in the lung are lost. Exposure of mice to LPS ( Fig. 2 B) results in an increase in inflammation and tissue damage as evidenced by the increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (a marker of neutrophil presence) as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) (a marker of lipid peroxidation). The increases are ameliorated by CO and moreover the CO effect is lost in the presence of the selective inhibitor of PPARg (GW9662). Data not shown goes on to demonstrate that it the induction of PPAR /g534 in macrophages involves the mitochondria. has no heme molecule, the cytochrome oxidases Figure 1 161 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Transplantation are particularly sensitive to CO binding. The working hypothesis now is that CO, via binding to the heme molecules in the oxidases, results in a mild and transient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This elicitation in an ROS burst occurs by 5 minutes and disappears by 1 hr. Our preliminary data rapid stabilization of HIF1 /g68 expression. Our focus this upcoming year will be to confirm these observations and delve more into the mechanisms by which this occurs. We are currently investi-gating these events and gene expression patterns and applying them to other cell types of interest, particularly those related to vascular injury and organ rejection following transplantat-ion, where CO has shown potent salutary effects.

Olumi, M.D. Gary Kearney, M.D. Brian Saltzman, M.D. Martin Sanda, M.D. The Division of Urology has a wide-ranging research interest that incorporates both clinical and basic topics. The program touches on many aspects of this specialty including reproduction, stem cell biology, tumor markers, stomal-epithial interaction, virology (AIDS), neurology and clinical outcomes analysis. The urology laboratory community involves at least four Ph.D's and in addition we have at least 4-8 students from Harvard and MIT assigned to rotations thru our laboratories. Funding is continually growing and currently involves several NIH and DOD grants as well as private funding. Much of the Clinical Research is based on work from the new Continence Center 167 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Urology focusing on aspects of neurology as well as our busy oncology practice. We have established a database incorporating a single surgeon series of radical prostatectomies from the decade of the 1990's involving about 500 cases. This has been used to complete a series of manuscripts that now number five with more submitted. Our Division is heavily involved in NIH outcomes research directed towards various quality of life issues and hopefully will expand to both malignant and non malignant diseases. The research work in Urology is presented at a wide range of meetings including the AUA, AACR, and FASAB meetings. In addition as noted, in the following descriptions, the research work is published in a broad range of journals. 168 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Urology William C. DeWolf, M.D. I. Narrative Report Basic Research The basic research component of my own research deals with biochemical characterization of a stem cell antigen that we originally described in 1992. We were the first to sequence the molecule and it has been found to be identical to a protein called podocalyxin (also Gp200, TRA1-60, and GCTM-2). Human embryonal carcinoma tumor antigen Gp200/GCTM2, is podocalyxin. This molecule is a 528 amino acid membrane protein that is heavily glycosylated and contains a single putative transmembrane domain. Podocalyxin has a large extracellular region containing a mucin and globular domain and a small cytoplasmic domain with a PDZ-binding motif. Podocalyxin was originally identified and cloned from podocytes, the blood-filtering cells of the kidney, where it has been shown to have putative function as a protein anchoring membrane protein that forms complexes with other proteins through its cytoplasmic PDZ-binding motif. This podocalyxin complex is critical for proper podocyte function. We are studying what podocalyxin is interacting with in embryonal carcinoma cells. Protein sequencing data reveal that glucose-3 transporter, the testis and brain-specific glucose transporter, copurifies with podocalyxin in purified protein fractions from embryonal carcinoma stem cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments with antiglucose-3 transporter and podocalyxin antibody confirm a stable complex exists in detergent extracted protein lysates. Podocalyxin may be functioning as an anchoring protein for this plasma membrane glucose transporter in stem cells. Current studies are underway to determine if podocalyxin and the transporter are interacting directly or if other proteins interacting through the PDZ-binding motif are tethering podocalyxin to the transporter and to explore if there is any critical function for this complex in pleuripotent stem cells. Mike Schopperle in the research laboratory. Clinical Research Clinical research within the Division of Urology is very active. Included is an analysis of a ten year experience of patients who have undergone radical 169 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Urology prostatectomy. Their case histories with data have been put into a computerized retrieval system for data analysis. Thus far, six manu-scripts have been generated. II. List of Current Employees 1. W. Michael Schopperle, Ph.D. Research Fellow III. List of Current Funding 1. Intramural IV. Divisional Accomplishments over the Past Year Research Accomplishments We completed another phase of work on Gp200, which is a sialomucin expressed on embryonal carcinoma cells (see narrative). This next installment of work has identified and sequenced the Gp200 protein which has been identified as podocalyxin. To our surprise and delight, we have discovered that glut-3 (which is a glucose transporter isoform found in human testis and brain) copurifies with podocalyxin; thus, podocalyxin and glut-3 transporter form a stable complex in EC cells. The basis for this interaction is not known, however podocalyxin has a PDZ-binding site in its intracellular domain that may play a role in forming protein-protein complexes. Further work is now planned looking at the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of a podocalyxin and glut-3 complex and provide some insight into why a glucose transporter is interacting with a sialomucin in cancer cells. This work is also being developed to understand the effect of differentiation on the expression on embryonal stem cell marker TRA-1-60 as it is expressed on podocalyxin. Basically upon differentiation of EC stem cells the TRA-1-60 marker is lost. Results now show that antibodies to TRA-1-60 and podocalyxin recognize the 200 kilodalton TRA-1-60 stem cell antigen in protein preps of undifferentiated EC cells. However protein blots of undifferentiated EC cells exposed to retinoic acid reveal that the TRA-1-60 epitope is no longer detectable with TRA-1-60 antibodies. This model is being developed as a previously used EC based differentiation model adapted to stem cell research. Individual Accomplishments 1.

Faculty Sponsor to Dr. Price Kerfoot AUA Scholar Award. 170 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Urology V. Report of Teaching Undergraduate and Medical School Courses Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program . This is an MIT-based teaching program in which 3-5 undergraduates rotate through our laboratory on 6-12 month basis science projects and gain experience in biological research. This is particularly important because it is the only undergraduate course with opportunity to view surgical operations as part of the curriculum. Additional medical school teaching includes SU518M.1 which is a general course in urologic science for medical students. The course includes a 1 month rotation on the urology service and involves clinical and didactic experience relating to urologic disease. Faculty Sponsored - AUA Scholar Award Dr. Price Kerfoot, a recent graduate from the Harvard Program in Urology, has been awarded a two year AUA Scholar Award, which is a funded fellowship to study programs in medical student education with specific reference to implementation of new programs in urologic teaching. These awards are provided to the new graduate and a faculty sponsor/mentor who is responsible for research accomplishments and programs. VII. Plans for the Coming Academic Year Staff Changes/Recruitments There will be no change in the research staff for my research work. Plans for Research This information can be obtained from the narrative as well as research accomplishments. However, the basic thrust will be completion of our analysis of the glut-3/podocalyxin interaction and its biochemical characterization. Most of this work is completed and final completion will be in the form of a Journal of Biological Chemistry-type paper which will form the platform and basis for a grant proposal. VIII.

Narrative Report Basic Research My laboratory is interested in the individual biological differences that can influence the behavior of human cancers, with a major emphasis on prostate cancer. We are fortunate to have access to well-documented human clinical samples, and we have developed a number of innovative technologies that allow us to perform detailed molecular analyses of these valuable specimens without compromising patient care. These include a set of tissue print and print-phoresis technologies that allow us to generate spatial-molecular maps of tumor markers in biopsies and surgical specimens while preserving the tissue for diagnostic histopathology. Currently, we are utilizing our newly-developed tissue print technologies to investigate the molecular events that differentiate locally invasive prostate cancer from indolent tumors. This effort has produced a number of new biomarkers that may be useful in the management of patients with an early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Dr. Sandra Gaston We have also developed a set of micro- bioassays that allow us to evaluate bioavailable androgens in complex biological fluids. In an animal model, our bioassays can measure changes in bioavailable serum androgen in response to soy based dietary supplements (in this model, bioavailable serum androgen, as measured by bioassay, is distinct from total and free serum testosterone). In collaboration with the Zhou laboratory in Surgery, we found that our bioassay detected decreases in bioavailable serum androgen that were associated with inhibition of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer by soy dietary supplements; serum total and free testosterone showed no such association. Currently we are investigating the relationship between bioavailable serum androgen (as measured by bioassay) and androgen-dependent gene expression in cell culture models of prostate cancer. We anticipate that that this strategy may be useful for designing pharmacological and dietary interventions for prostate cancer patients who want to incorporate complementary therapies into their cancer care program. Clinical research For the last four years, in addition to my research laboratory, I have been the director of the BIDMC Andrology Laboratory. Andrology is the study of male fertility, and the primary clinical service of the BIDMC Andrology laboratory is semen analysis with a total volume of about 30 patients/month. Although the 175 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Urology clinical service will no longer be available at BIDMC, the clinical research component of the Andrology laboratory remains active under my direction. Our major current research focus is on genetic polymorphisms that result in either increased or decreased susceptibility to mitochondrial toxins, as measured by the effects of these toxins on sperm mitochondrial respiration and motility.

Gaston, Ph.D. V. Divisional Accomplishments in the Past Year Research accomplishments With NIH and intramural research support, my laboratory has continued to advance the development of a set of novel \"tissue printing\" technologies that allow us to transfer a microscopic layer of cells and extracellular matrix from the surface of fresh tissue specimens onto nitrocellulose membranes. We have combined tissue print techniques with specific protein and RNA/DNA detection methods to generate two-dimensional maps of molecular markers in radical prostatectomy specimens. Using these maps, we have identified clusters of molecular markers that co-localize with sites of microscopic invasion of cancer into the prostate capsule. This year, we published some of our major findings on markers of tumor invasion of the prostate capsule and an overview of our tissue printing techniques in Nature Medicine. Because tissue print techniques do not damage tissue specimens, we have been able to utilize this platform technology to obtain molecular marker profiles from human prostate needle biopsies obtained from radical prostatectomy specimens. Specifically, we have demonstrated that we can generate both mRNA and protein molecular marker profiles from needle biopsy cores while preserving the tissue for standard H&E pathology and for immunohistochemical studies. This finding is an important part of our pre-clinical preparation for a proof-of-principle clinical trial in which molecular profiling will be evaluated in the assessment of prostate needle biopsies obtained for patient diagnosis. In clinical practice, it is widely recognized that immunoassay levels of total testosterone and free testosterone are relatively poor predictors of physiological androgen status in adult males, especially in the \"borderline range.\" With NIH and CaPCURE support, we are continuing to advance the development of micro-scale bioassays that can be used to monitor bioavailable androgen receptor (AR) ligand in complex biological fluids. In our most recent NIH progress report, we show that the response of our yeast AR bioassay to serum androgen reflects the endogenous androgen response of prostate cancer cells (LAPC4) across the range of physiological serum testosterone concentrations. Our results support the hypothesis that our yeast based AR bioassay can provide a useful biomarker of the net level of bioactive androgen in the serum of prostate cancer patients before and after hormonally based interventions. 177 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Urology With support from General Electric Industry Sponsored Research, we have used tissue prints to produce \"molecular whole mounts\" of radical prostatectomy specimens that can be mapped point-to-point with structures visualized in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectra (MRS). Currently, we are collaborating with Dr. Robert Lenkinski and other investigators in the BIDMC 3T MRI/MRS Program to profile the patterns of mRNA expression that underlie the MRI/MRS choline peak that is characteristic of prostate cancer. Mitochondrial toxicity can present a significant limitation to the clinical application of new therapeutic agents, and current pre-clinical models are inadequate to efficiently screen for this adverse activity. Because the motility of mammalian spermatozoa is exquisitely sensitive to the status of the mitochondria in the sperm midpiece, we have developed a novel in vitro bioassay that utilizes motile spermatozoa to detect individual differences in susceptibility to drugs and toxins that inhibit mitochondrial respiration. Utilizing both clinical samples and samples from an animal model (domestic boars), we have identified individuals whose pattern of sensitivity or resistance to specific classes of mitochondrial toxins could have important clinical consequences. Currently, we are characterizing genetic polymorphisms that we have found to be associated with increased sensitivity to the drug oligomycin. We anticipate that this study will provide proof-of-principle for a new pharmacogenomic screening strategy that can be used to identify the human chromosomal and/or mitochondrial alleles that give rise to individual differences in sensitivity/resistance to specific inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration. With a pilot grant from the Susan Love Breast Cancer Research Foundation, we have obtained preliminary data that support the hypothesis that normal secretory cells of the breast ductal epithelium, like normal secretory cells in the prostate, vary widely in their constitutive MMP9 expression. In addition, we have identified patterns of collagen fragments in the nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) of breast cancer patients that are currently being evaluated as potential biomarkers for non-invasive screening/early diagnosis. One of my students, Jonathan Rogg, received a Howard Hughes summer research fellowship for his work in my laboratory. Individual Accomplishments For a second year, I was named to the NIH National Cancer Institute Special Emphasis Panel to review grant applications submitted to the \"Innovative Technologies for the Molecular Analysis of Cancer\" (IMAT) program. I was awarded an NIH grant to advance the development of a set of tissue print technologies that can be utilized to profile mRNA tumor markers from human prostate and breast tissue specimens. This grant application was given a priority score in the top 1 percentile of NIH grants, and represents the first phase of an R21/R33 project under the NCI \"Innovative Technologies for the Molecular Analysis of Cancer\" (IMAT) program. 178 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Urology VI.

Plans for the Coming Academic Year New Research Initiatives 1. This year we are beginning our new NIH grant \"Tissue Print Micropeels for Molecular Profiling of Cancer\". This will allow us to accelerate the development of tissue print protocols to profile molecular markers in human tissue specimens without compromising histological pathology diagnosis. Our focus this next year is the identification of the most appropriate set of markers for a proof-of-principle clinical trial in which molecular profiling will be evaluated in the assessment of prostate needle biopsies. 2. We have shown that tissue print technology can be used to generate molecular profiles of mastectomy surgical specimens. Our priority effort for this project continues to be the characterization of molecular markers that can be used to identify invasive cancer at the surgical margins of partial mastectomy specimens. In addition, this next year we will be working with Ambion Inc to develop a simplified protocol for extracting mRNA from breast tissue-prints (currently this is a more laborious process than preparing prostate tissue-print mRNA). Our objective is to design a breast tissue-print mRNA extraction protocol that can be readily translated into a kit or automated platform. 3. We look forward this year to several important new research collaborations. These include: Gary Latham, PhD, Senior Scientist, Ambion, Inc. has agreed to collaborate with us in the evaluation of one of Ambion's newly developed technologies for RNA preparation. Our goal is to determine if (as we expect) we can use their new reagents to significantly improve the efficiency of our tissue-print RNA profiling protocols. Douglas C. Wallace, Ph.D., Professor of Molecular Medicine and Director of the Center for Molecular and Mitochondrial Medicine and Genetics, has graciously offered to collaborate with us in a comparison of the mitochondrial polymorphisms we identify in our toxin sensitivity screen (the sperm motility bioassay) with the mitochondrial polymorphisms that he and his colleagues have identified in different human populations. The resulting information on the prevalence of these genetic variants will be used to design follow-on studies of the most common human alleles associated with mitochondrial toxin sensitivity. New Recruitment Activities As both a member of the Harvard Medical School (HMS) faculty and a Visiting Scientist in the MIT Center for Biomedical Engineering, I have been able to develop a network of research students through the MIT undergraduate research program (UROP). This next year, I will continue to recruit from this highly talented pool of students. In addition, with the encouragement of Mr. Paul Levy, I will be working with the BIDMC development office to begin to build 180 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Urology a private donor base to provide stipend support for students who make significant contributions to biomedical research at BIDMC. Educational Activities For the last four years, I have been a member of the Teaching Faculty of Harvard Medical School. This year I will continue to teach first year Harvard Medical Students in the Principles of Pharmacology and in the Human Body courses. In addition, my laboratory will again host middle school students from the Harvard Medical School \"Explorations\" program VIII. Bibliography (1/1/04-12/31/04) Original articles (in press) 1.

Kiessling, Ph.D. Robert C. Eyre, M.D. Paul Church, M.D. I. Narrative Report The long-term goals of our research are to understand tissue specificity and controls on retrovirus gene expression in genitourinary tract tissues and embryos. Studies of HIV infection of male GU tract tissues began over 20 years ago with the first measurements of viral burden in seminal plasma from men with AIDS. The immune privilege of male GU tract tissues led to the hypothesis that semen- producing organs could be an isolated sanctuary of HIV disease. Originally controversial, this concept is now broadly accepted. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of HIV genes Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of HIV genes cloned from paired specimens of blood and semen contributed by study subjects in a longitudinal study design. Prior studies utilizing Maximum-Likelihood algorithms have illustrated unique clustering patterns of HIV quasi-species isolated from paired blood and semen specimens from long term study subjects. Importantly, several study subjects have demonstrated the appearance of therapy resistance-conferring mutations in semen before they appear in blood. More recent analyses of HIV envelope genes have revealed compartmentalization of syncytium-inducing virus species (utilize chemokine receptor CXCR4) and non-syncytium-inducing virus species (utilize chemokine receptor CCR5). This confirms and extends some reports that HIV variants which utilize CCR5 receptors to gain access to host cells are the sexually transmitted virus species. During the subsequent course of infection, blood HIV variants mutate to express envelopes that preferentially bind to CXCR4 rather than CCR5. This switch in virus tropism is due to point mutations at one or two amino acid residues (S306R or E320K,R) in the V3 loop of HIV env, and is accompanied by more rapid disease progression due to loss of CD4+ lymphocytes incorporated into lymph node syncytia. The switch in virus tropism has traditionally been attributed to the high error rate inherent in the virus reverse transcriptase, but more recent studies have revealed another possibility. A family of deaminases, CEM15 (APOBEC3G) function as an innate cellular defense mechanism against retroviral infection. This is in keeping with the remarkably high (45%) percentage of the human genome comprised by retroviral elements, thought to arise through ancient retroviral infection. 183 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Urology CEM15 deaminates cytosine in the nascent DNA strand synthesized by viral reverse transcriptase during the process of infection. The resulting uracil residue triggers destruction of the nascent DNA strand by intracellular DNAses. If, however, the nascent DNA is not destroyed, the positive strand has an adenosine substitution for the guanosine residue that formerly paired with the cytosine. To determine if such mutations influence disease progression, we are in the process of analyzing two subsets of our HIV sequence data: 53 unique sequences of the V3 loop of Gp120 from a long-term non-progressor and 82 unique sequences of protease from a man who developed therapy resistance at 32 months of treatment. The logistics of archiving and analyzing a growing data set of gene sequences have necessitated the development of a custom database, which has been recently completed in MySQL. We have begun to use the database as the starting point for sequence analyses. Immunology of male GU tract tissues with emphasis on the prostate, seminal vesicles and epididymis. Understanding immune controls in these tissues will provide important insights into not only sexually transmitted diseases, but also specific gland pathologies, such as prostatitis and prostate cancer. Previous studies used mouse model systems to characterize the tissue distribution of leukocyte subsets in testis, epididymis and seminal vesicles. More recent studies have attempted parallel experiments in human tissues. The figure to the right illustrates immunostaining (red-brown color) of human epididymis and seminal vesicles for pan-leukocyte marker, CD45, and the tissue-specific macrophage marker, CD97. These are possible host cells for HIV infection. Supported by NIDDK, NIH Several lines of evidence, including work from this laboratory, indicate the prostate is immunosuppressed. This characteristic could play an important role in prostate diseases, such as prostatitis and prostate cancer. We have previously reported that prostatitis may drive HIV disease by promoting the development of therapy resistance mutations. For these reasons, we hope to explore the bacterial species present in prostatic tissues. We will use PCR amplification of bacterial ribosomal gene sequences, followed by sequencing the PCR products and identification through GenBank searches. This work is just beginning. II.

V. Divisional Accomplishments over the Past Year Research Accomplishments 1. The longitudinal genetic and phylogenetic analyses of HIV genes is now proceeding rapidly. The results to date indicate that male GU tract organs are a clinically important reservoir of HIV disease in men, including those on therapy. To establish tissue specific reservoirs of disease, we are initiating a collaboration with Southwest Biomedical Research Foundation to analyze tissue biopsies from HIV-infected chimpanzees. 2. The novel class of macrophages in male mouse and human tissues appear to play a fundamental role in organ function. This could have broad application to understanding the physiology of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis, as well as their role as reservoirs of HIV infection. The work in the mouse has now been published and the human work is on-going. 3. We have completed a pilot survey of male mouse genital tract RNAs and DNAs for presence and expression of the endogenous retrovirus, MERV-L. This work formed the basis for the R21 application submitted in Jan., 2005. 4.

Olumi, M.D. I. Narrative Report Basic Research PROJECT 1: STROMAL-EPITHELIAL INTERACTIONS REGULATE DEVELOPMENT OF BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA. Development, growth and tumorigenesis in the prostate is closely regulated by the stromal-epithelial crosstalk, therefore, identifying the signal transduction pathways between prostate epithelial cells and the surrounding stromal cells will enable us to better understand the normal and abnormal biology in prostatic diseases. We hypothesize that expression of particular stromal genes is one of the components that regulates the proliferation, cell death and differentiation of prostatic epithelial cells leading to BPH in adulthood. The Jun-family proteins that are early transcription factor molecules have been shown to regulate stromal-epithelial interactions via paracrine modulation. Moreover, the Jun family member proteins have been shown to play an important role in proper development of the genitourinary organs. The balance between the different Jun-family expression in the stroma may be one of the determinants of the ultimate survival or death signals that the stroma may exert on prostatic epithelial cells. This project focuses on paracrine signals form stromal cells with genetically modified Jun-family proteins that may regulate epithelial proliferation, cell death and differentiation. These studies can improve our understanding of normal and abnormal stromal-epithelial interactions that may lead to BPH in adulthood. PROJECT 2: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DEVELOPING RESISTANCE TO TRAIL-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN PROSTATE CANCER. TNF-related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of tumorigenic and transformed cell lines but not in normal cells, hence making TRAIL an ideal cancer therapeutic agent with minimal cytotoxicity. FLICE Inhibitory Protein (c-FLIP) is an important regulator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We have demonstrated that persistent expression of c-FLIP(L) is inversely correlated with the ability of TRAIL to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. In a series of correlative and functional studies we have shown that persistent expression of c-FLIP(L) is necessary and sufficient to regulate sensitivity to TRAIL mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms of resistance to TRAIL can improve the efficacy of pro-apoptotic agents in treatment of malignancies. 189 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Urology Clinical Research PROJECT 1: SYSTEMATIC PROSTATE NEEDLE BIOPSY FOR IMPROVED DIAGNOSIS OF PROSTATE CANCER . Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed by ultrasound guided needle biopsy. The standard of care is to perform six core biopsies from different regions of the prostate. However, recent studies suggest that six core biopsies may not be adequate enough for proper cancer detection. In fact, larger prostates may require more biopsies in order to achieve similar cancer detection rates as smaller prostate. This discrepancy between large and small prostates is most likely secondary to a higher sampling error associated with larger prostate. There is no consensus on the appropriate number of prostate biopsies required for varying prostatic sizes. In order to standardize the number of prostate biopsies required for varying prostatic sizes we are reviewing the prostate biopsies of over 1000 patients at BIDMC who have had extended (more than 10 core) biopsies. PROJECT 2: HYPOGONADISM AND ASSOCIATION WITH DIAGNOSIS AND OUTCOME OF PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER. Androgens regulate normal prostate development and prostate cancer progression. We have previously shown a paradoxical link of serum total and Free-T levels with prostate cancer. The purpose of this project is to validate whether hypogonadism is associated with high grade prostate cancer, to examine the relationship between Free-Testosterone, PSA and age of diagnosis, and to determine whether Free-T levels can be used as predictors for prostate cancer recurrence after surgical therapy for prostate cancer. 1.

This laboratory provides a unique environment for learning how translational research, utilizing transgenic mice, can concurrently address issues important for developing new therapy while also characterizing fundamental issues of basic tumor immunology. Clinical Research The Sanda group also conducts prostate cancer clinical outcomes research. These studies include the PROST-QA consortium, a national consortium of prostate cancer referral centers (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Cleveland Clinic, MD Anderson Cancer Center, UCLA, University of Michigan, and Washington University) wherein combined evaluation of cancer control, satisfaction with care, and quality of life provides comprehensive characterization of prostate cancer care quality. Patients and their spouse/partners are interviewed by a third-party phone survey facility to evaluate their satisfaction with the cancer care they received as well as their outcomes in a broad range of quality of life domains, including sexual, urinary, bowel, and hormonal functioning. These patients' cancer control status is followed by clinical coordinators at the treatment sites and annotated in a web-based, password-protected database. This study, led by Dr. Sanda, has enrolled over 1000 participants, treated by over 40 physicians nationwide, and is the largest ongoing, NCI-funded prospective study of prostate cancer quality of life.

Narrative Report Basic Research The Vascular Surgery Research Laboratory, directed by Dr. Logerfo, has been extensively involved in two main areas of vascular biology research: 1) evaluating mechanisms responsible for prosthetic graft failure and 2) developing novel biomaterial surfaces. Anastomotic intimal hyperplasia (AIH) remains the most common cause of delayed prosthetic arterial graft failure, a consequence of focal, unregulated gene expression. As graft healing occurs, genes are either up- or down-regulated as compared to a quiescent arterial wall. We study altered gene expression that results in cellular proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix production by smooth muscle cells, leading to AIH. Differential gene expression is assessed using various techniques such as, microarray analysis, qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Laser-Capture Microdissection (LCM), a relatively new technology developed by the National Institutes of Health, which is available at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, permits selection of cells within a chosen area of tissue. This technology is currently being employed by our laboratory to further localize alterations in gene expression. The significance and unique aspect of this work is that our group is the first to identify specific genes that are altered following prosthetic arterial grafting in vivo and to examine their role in the cellular environment using various in vitro cell culture assays. This information is now being used to identify targets for RNA silencing. We have established our ability to silence RNA in cell culture and in the vein graft wall. For biomaterials research, the Vascular Surgery Research Laboratory designed and patented several novel biomaterial surfaces. An infection-resistant ionic polyurethane was developed in Phase I and II STTR grants in which quinolone antibiotics were incorporated into the polymer using textile dyeing techniques, with this surface demonstrating antimicrobial activity both in vitro and in vitro . This biomaterial can be used to comprise a wide range of implantable devices such as catheters, wound dressings and vascular grafts, avenues which are currently being explored. A similar ionic polyurethane was then employed to seal FDA-approved knitted Dacron vascular grafts using a patented perfusion technology. As part of a Phase II STTR grant, these sealed vascular grafts were evaluated at various acute and chronic time periods using a canine carotid arterial grafting model. A porcine cardiac surgical model to evaluate a novel infection-resistant Dacron prosthetic valve sewing cuff with optimum antimicrobial properties is currently in the development stages in order to complete the objectives of a Phase II SBIR grant. We have also developed in vitro , as described in our Phase I STTR proposal, a 201 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Vascular and Endovascular Surgery novel small-diameter nanofibrous polyurethane vascular graft via electrospinning technology. Lastly for metallic implants comprised of titanium such as bone joints and dental posts, we have completed early development of a novel titanium surface with mitogenic properties via covalent linkage Immunobiology Laboratory, directed by Dr. Ferran, has a major research interest in the field of vascular biology, mainly intimal hyperplasia, as well as the micro- and macro-vascular complications of diabetes, transplantation, including xenotransplantation and islet transplantation, as well as autoimmune diabetes, acute liver failure, and liver regeneration. More specifically, work in the Vascular Immunobiology Laboratory is focused on the understanding of the function (s) of the anti-apoptotic genes A20, Bcl-2, Bcl-x L and A1 in different cell types, their relationship to the pathophysiology of diseases and their potential therapeutic use in organ transplantation, diabetes, atherosclerosis, diabetic vasculopathy and liver regeneration. This interest is based on the original finding that these genes, mainly A20, serve a broad cytoprotective function in endothelial cells (EC), islets, and hepatocytes, and an atheroprotective function in smooth muscle cells (SMC). Expression of A20 in endothelial cells, islets and hepatocytes not only protects the cells from apoptosis by interrupting the activation of the caspase cascade but also serve a broad anti-inflammatory purpose by blocking activation of the transcription factor NF- /g78B. Uniquely, A20 also promotes hepatocyte proliferation hence liver regeneration by down-regulating the cell cycle brake p21 waf1 (Figure 1). This novel finding implicates that A20 based therapies may be highly beneficial for patients presenting with severe liver damage but who still have a fraction of viable hepatocytes. Protecting this reduced functional liver mass in the face of ongoing inflammation would meet metabolic demands and allow enough time for regeneration. Expression of A20 is particularly promising for reducing the donor graft size necessary for living donor liver transplantation as well as extensive liver resection for the cure of neoplasia. Expression of A20 in SMC, on the other hand inhibit their proliferation and sensitizes neointimal (i.e. the major component of atherosclerotic lesions), but not medial SMC, to apoptosis through a novel NO dependent mechanism. A20 fulfills most of the criteria required for an ideal atheroprotective therapy that confers an athero-resistant phenotype to both EC and SMC. A20 is anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative in SMC, is pro-apoptotic in neointimal SMC and is anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic functions. We propose that A20 based therapies hold strong promise for the prevention and cure of vascular neointimal disease including atherosclerosis, transplant arteriosclerosis, and in-stent Figure 1 Figure 2 202 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Vascular and Endovascular Surgery restenosis by protecting from apoptosis hence significantly protects from atherosclerosis, diabetic vasculopathy and transplant associated vasculopathy (Figure 2). This hypothesis is strengthened by our recent demonstration of impaired expression of A20 in diabetic patients that could account for their increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Preliminary evidence suggest that decreased A20 expression in is in part due to the untoward effects of hyperglycemia but also depends on still undefined factors that are likely genetically determined. Clinical Research Clinical Research in Vascular Surgery, directed by Dr. Hamdan, continues to be very active in both retrospective database review as well as participation in major clinical trials. In addition to adding to the vascular literature, we are very interested in insuring the quality of our outcomes in all surgical procedures. Recently we finished enrollment and follow-up in an important Phase III multicenter randomized trial looking at the use of a transcription factor decoy (E2F) in an attempt to decrease intimal hyperplasia and restenosis in vein grafts. We were the number one center as far as enrollment. The preliminary review of the data, unfortunately, showed no benefit in the use of E2F. This is, in itself, an important finding. In addition, due to our prominence in the study, we will have access to the database which will essentially be an evaluation of the current state of the art in peripheral bypass surgery in the United States. We hope to be able to undertake several projects related to the database in the near future. The second trial is the CREST trial, which is evaluating carotid stent vs. endarterectomy. We have a unique situation where our surgeons are both involved in the surgical arm as well as the endovascular/stenting arm. Four of the five surgeons in the Division are registered in the surgical arm and one of the surgeons is registered in both the surgical and endovascular arm. Two additional surgeons also have privileges to perform the stents with the supervision of Dr. Marc Schermerhorn, in our group. We look forward to being an active participant in this, the most important trial of carotid artery disease since the NASCET trial. The third trial is a collaborative trial with the Brigham and Women's Hospital through the NIH. Its goal is to prospectively follow approximately 300 patients who are undergoing lower extremity bypass grafts using vein. The main interest of the study is evaluation of inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein, VCAM and ICAM, and to see how their baseline expression in patients differs and how that may or may not determine the results of the bypass. Another exciting feature of the study is that all patients will agree to allow us to keep blood and if new genetic markers related specifically to vascular disease and atherosclerosis are identified we will be able to evaluate those samples. We have enrolled approximately 15 patients at this point. This will become a very fruitful area for further research. 203 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Vascular and Endovascular Surgery II.

Principal Investigator: Christiane Ferran, M.D., Ph.D. V. Narrative of Divisional Accomplishments in the Past Year Research Accomplishments-Basic Vascular Surgery Research Laboratory 1. Failure\" Anastomotic intimal hyperplasia (AIH) remains as the most common cause of delayed prosthetic arterial graft failure, a consequence of focal, unregulated gene expression. As graft healing occurs, genes are either up- or downregulated compared to a quiescent arterial wall. Our hypothesis is that this altered gene expression results in cellular proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix production by smooth muscle cells, leading to AIH. The significance and unique aspect of this work is that our group is the first to identify specific genes that are altered following prosthetic arterial grafting in vivo . Altered gene expression between normal and grafted artery is determined via several methodologies: 1) Microarray analysis to generate lists of up- and down-regulated genes, 2) qPCR to validate mRNA expression levels for the genes of interest, and 3) immunohistochemistry to qualitatively localize protein expression for the genes of interest. Laser-Capture Microdissection (LCM), a new technology developed by the National Institutes of Health and available at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center that permits selection of cells within a chosen area of tissue, is being employed to further localize alterations in gene expression. The results obtained from this study will greatly expand our knowledge related to the specific problem of AIH and will also provide new insights for either novel graft designs or potential therapeutic intervention such as RNA interference (RNAi), with the derived mechanisms having pertinence to the larger field of vascular biology. We are presently using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to decrease the expression of various genes such as MARCKs implicated in the pathogenesis of AIH. This technique, RNA interference (RNAi), has potential therapeutic applications with pertinence to the larger field of vascular biology. 2. \"Infection-Resistant Polyurethane Biomaterials\" Infection is a major complication associated with the use of indwelling catheters. Catheter-related infections are caused by bacteria that originate either from the skin of the patient that migrate along the external surface of the catheter or from a contaminated hub that migrate along the internal surface of the catheter. Major risk factors include duration of implant, degree of manipulation, location of implant, and the use of occlusive dressings. In Phase I, the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro) was applied to an ionic polyurethane (cPU) using textile dyeing technology, and the application parameters were optimized. No exogenous binding agents 206 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Vascular and Endovascular Surgery were involved. This \"dyed\"-cPU demonstrated slow release of Cipro with sustained antimicrobial activity. In Phase II, the Cipro was dyed onto cPU coated Chronoflex catheter segments (ChronoCide). In vitro evaluation of the ChronoCide catheters showed slow, sustained Cipro release as well as antimicrobial activity under washing conditions for 15 days (length of study). The ChronoCide catheter segments were then assessed in vivo . Segments (0.5cm) of control, a silver sulfadiazine/chlorhexidine catheter (SSC) and ChronoCide catheters were cut and implanted into subcutaneous pockets on the dorsum of rats (n=18). After sonication, both control and SSC catheters had gram-positive bacterial growth on backplating whereas ChronoCide catheter segments had no bacterial growth (7, 14 or 28 days). In the zone of inhibition studies, control segments had no antimicrobial properties after explant and the SSC had minimal to no activity. In contrast, ChronoCide catheter segments maintained significant antimicrobial activity at all time periods. A successful indwelling polyurethane catheter with long-term infection resistance would generate a U.S. market greater than $300 million annually. This technology could be applied to other biomedical materials (vascular grafts, wound dressings) and commercial products (shower curtains, clothing). We are in process of obtaining a strategic partner for this technology with our collaborators at the University of Rhode Island. 3. \"Development of a Biologically-Active Prosthetic Graft\" Medium (6-8mm) and small (<5mm) internal diameter prosthetic grafts continue to have clinically unacceptable high failure rates. In phase I, an ionic polyurethane-sealed Dacron vascular graft (PEU-D) with reduced water properties and covalently antithrombin (recombinant hirudin rHir) and mitogenic (vascular endothelial growth factor or VEGF) agents was developed. These surface bound agents were determined to be biologically active. Our objective in this proposal was to assess blood permeation and graft patency/healing of the PEU-D graft using a canine arterial grafting model. Our hypothesis is that implantation of this novel graft will prevent blood permeation thereby obviating the need for pre-clotting and improve graft patency and healing by emulating some of the natural properties of native vessels. Patency of Hemashield control grafts and PEU-D grafts was comparable at all time intervals, with all grafts except one remaining patent at each time period. The only failed graft, a PEU-D graft, was occluded when explanted at 30 days. This failure, which occurred early, was due to a technical error at the time of implantation as indicated by independent histopathological analysis. At 3 and 7 days, there was a similar foreign body immune response to the prosthetic grafts. At 14 and 30 days there were comparable amounts of thrombus on the luminal surface of both grafts. Proliferation and migration of endothelial and smooth muscle cells (neointima) was limited to 1 or 2 cm at the CCA and prosthetic graft anastomosis, with no difference in either the Hemashield control or PEU-D graft. However, there was an increase in new blood vessels formed on the PEU-D grafts, which could be the result of VEGF immobilization. For the 30 day explants, the collagen coating on the Hemashield graft was showing signs of being resorbed as indicated by the presence of \"bare\" fibers within the capsule. In contrast, the PEU sealant was still intact, with no visible degradation/resorption. There is a sign of non-uniform sealing on the capsular surface as indicated by the circular defects evident on the 207 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Vascular and Endovascular Surgery surface. This type of pore formation would explain the higher water permeation values of the PEU-D segments as compared to the Hemashield grafts. As far as physical properties, there was no difference in tensile strength between unimplanted and grafts that were implanted for either 3 or 30 days. Additionally, the 30 day Hemashield control grafts had comparable tensile strength, indicating that the strength of the graft comes from the Dacron and not the collagen sealant that is being resorbed. Thus, development of a polyurethane sealant with protein binding properties may have a significant role for medical devices such as vascular grafts, catheters and artificial organs. 4. \"Infection-Resistant Prosthetic Heart Valve Sewing Cuffs\" Cardiac valve replacement using prosthetic valves is indicated when progression of degenerative disease, annular dilatation or bacterial infection of the native valve results in valvular dysfunction, thereby impacting cardiac output. An estimated 50,000 valves are implanted annually in the United States, with this number increasing due to an aging population and, to a lesser extent, a more aggressive approach to mitral valve insufficiency. Bacterial infection is a major complication associated with implantation of these prosthetic valves (prosthetic valve endocarditis or PVE). Our Phase I studies demonstrated that quinolone antibiotics can \"dye\" Dacron, that this uptake can be optimized and the material possessed controlled sustained antibiotic release. Additionally, Cipro was dyed onto a tubular Dacron construct and maintained antimicrobial activity under flow conditions. In this Phase II proposal, Cipro will be dyed into clinically-available Dacron sewing cuffs via thermofixation using the parameters established in Phase I. Antimicrobial activity Cipro-dyed Dacron sewing cuff segments will be determined over time via a zone of inhibition assay. Physical characteristics such as tensile strength and ultimate elongation of the untreated (control) and Cipro- dyed Dacron sewing cuffs will be examined to confirm no changes in Dacron properties due to dyeing. Unmodified (clinical standard) and Cipro-dyed sewing cuffs will then be implanted in a porcine heart valve infection model to determine infection-resistance. Explanted control and Cipro-dyed sewing cuffs will then be assessed via histological/microbiological techniques. Lastly, the physical properties of the Cipro-dyed sewing cuffs post-explantation will be determined. Successful development of a Dacron material with long-term infection resistance through Phase III would have application in a wide range of implanted medical devices such sewing cuffs, vascular grafts, left ventricular assist devices, wound dressings and suture. The cost of this biomaterial to the patient (\"off-the-shelf\" cost) will be far less than the projected $50,000/patient cost for re-operation of an infected valve. This value does not take into account the significant morbidity and mortality rates associated with re-operation. Even conservative estimates indicate that the market for such infection-resistant valves is greater than $25 million. 5. \"Nanofiber Technology Small-Diameter Vascular Grafts\" There is no small-diameter vascular prosthesis that is capable of emulating the biologic and physical properties of the normal arterial wall. The goal of this Phase I proposal was to develop a small-diameter prosthetic vascular graft using nanofiber technology. Our hypothesis is creating a nanofibrous vascular graft by electrospinning an ionic polyurethane will result in a graft that possesses properties 208 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Vascular and Endovascular Surgery similar to that of native artery. A novel small-diameter (4mm internal diameter) vascular graft comprised of ionic polyurethane (PEU) was synthesized. The physical and chemical properties of the novel graft were then characterized. The potent antithrombin agent recombinant hirudin (rHir) was then covalently bound to functional groups within the polymer, resulting in an antithrombotic surface. In vitro surface antithrombin properties were characterized, completing the Phase I objectives. Phase II of this project, which will be submitted in April 2005, will evaluate these PEU grafts in a canine carotid arterial grafting model. Development of a bioactive small-diameter vascular graft would have a significant impact on small vessel repair and replacement. 6. \"Development of a Titanium Surface with Mitogenic Properties\" Titanium (Ti), which has advantageous bulk and surface properties, does not encourage osseointegration when utilized in devices such as hip joints, pins and dental implants. The potent osteoblast mitogen bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2, obtained from Wyeth Laboratories) was covalently bound to Ti surfaces (Ti-Ep-PEI-S-SMCC-BMP-2) using proprietary technology and maintained in vitro biologic activity determined via tissue culture studies. A Phase I SBIR will be submitted in August 2004 to further continue this research. The next objective for this technology is to assess surface mitogenic properties of Ti-Ep-PEI-S-SMCC-BMP-2 segments in a rat model in a dorsal subcutaneous implant (as suggested by Wyeth Laboratories). This technology could have an annual market in excess of $100 million and could be applied to other Ti implants such as left ventricular assist devices and mechanical heart valves to which biologic agents such as antithrombin agents/growth factors could be covalently bound. Vascular Immunobiology Research Laboratory 1. Over the past year, we have mainly extended our program to studying the impact of A20 upon diabetic vasculopathy. Our preliminary results resulted in the discovery that diabetes mellitus impairs the expression of atheroprotective genes such as A20. A20 is blunted in diabetic patients due to metabolic disturbances aggravated by genetically determined factors specific to patients with type I DM. This work has set the basis for an NIH grant proposal whose review is currently pending. This work was also the subject of a proposal to the NIH loan repayment program (LRP) that was successfully awarded to Gautam Shrikhande, M.D. 2. We have also been successful in expanding our work demonstrating the beneficial effect of A20 already established disease. Our data demonstrate that expression of A20 in neointimal smooth muscle cells induces the regression of established lesions via its unique capacity to sensitize neontimal SMC to apoptosis via a NO dependent mechanism. These provocative and exciting results have been expression in medial smooth muscle in preventing intimal hyperplasia to studying its impact on finalized in two manuscripts submitted for publication to the Journal of Experimental Medicine. This work was also the subject of a proposal to the NIH LRP that was successfully awarded to Virendra Patel, M.D. 209 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2004 Vascular and Endovascular Surgery 3. We have also expanded our work on the effect of A20 upon liver regeneration and demonstrated that this gene has the unique capacity to promote liver regeneration via decreasing the expression of the cell cycle brake p21waf1. Data was presented at the annual BIDMC competition for surgical residents by Christopher Longo, M.D. and received an award. Results were also finalized on a manuscript submitted for publication in Hepatology. Research Accomplishments-Clinical 1.

He works with Drs. Michael Conte and Richard Mulligan and focuses on the science of tissue engineering, which is rapidly expanding. One of the fundamental problems that remain is that of vascularizing implanted tissue constructs. Obviously, this is closely related to the angiogenesis that occurs in a variety of pathological and physiological settings. While this is a very complicated process controlled by a number of soluble and insoluble mediators as well as by mechanical forces, better understanding of how the body performs these processes will help answer the question for tissue engineers. An important first step in developing mechanisms for vascularizing tissue engineered constructs is to be able to assess them in vivo. Currently, they are developing a system by which we are able to genetically modify a tissue engineered construct, and assess its viability using an imaging modality based on the interaction of luciferin with the transgene luciferase. Harvard-Longwood Research Training Program in Vascular Surgery (T32) This training program is designed to provide two years of intense basic research training in vascular surgery for academic clinicians. The training program addresses the absence of adequate research training for vascular surgeons as it applies to specific areas of clinical disease. Trainees will pursue a program of research activity supplemented with course work in research design, ethics, statistics and evaluation of published research in the areas of molecular and cell biology, biomechanics, coagulation and thrombosis and angiogenesis. Clinically relevant atherogenesis, intimal hyperplasia, prosthetic/host interactions and thrombosis will be the main focus of these research projects. Trainees carry out their research projects under the guidance of a faculty advisor selected from 20 renowned vascular researchers based at four Harvard Medical School hospitals (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's, Children's Hospital (Boston) and Joslin Diabetes Institute) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Upon completion of the program, trainees are capable of independent research and possess the scientific and research background needed to obtain peer-reviewed grants. Selection of trainees is based on candidate's demonstrated ability and career choice of academic practice. Applicants are resident physicians who have completed either 2/3 years of clinical post-doctoral experience (surgical residency) or 5 years of clinical training (i.e. are board eligible). Only those applicants with career goals in academic surgery, with a keen interest in basic research in vascular surgery are compatible. Trainees in the program are not involved in any clinical activities unless research related. Trainee General Surgery Training Program Thomas S.
