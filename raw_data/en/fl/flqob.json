The flu vaccine helps your immune system fight infection by producing antibodies. If you come into contact with the virus, having the vaccine can stop you from getting sick. As the protection from these antibodies fade over time and flu strains change each year, you need to get your flu vaccine every year to be protected for the flu season. The vaccine can also help prevent you from spreading the virus to others. [For healthcare workers it is important to get vaccinated](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/flu-vaccination/healthcare-workers/) as some older and at-risk patients may not get sufficient protection from the flu vaccine themselves so they rely on you to keep them safe. It is important we do everything we can to stop the spread of flu and reduce the burden on our health services from flu. Getting your flu vaccine is the best way you can protect yourself and others from flu this winter.\" You should get your free flu vaccine as early as you can - the sooner you are vaccinated, the sooner you are protected.
