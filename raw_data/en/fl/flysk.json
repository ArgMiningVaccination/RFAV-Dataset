A Chakra is a spinning wheel of energy that is found within each one of us. It is a spinning vortex of energy created within us by the interpenetration of consciousness and the physical body. The Chakra system is a map of consciousness. It is a complete system of seven spinning vortexes of energy. They enable us to manifest and act in the material world, to bring abstracts into solidity. It is through the chakras that our expressions are directed. Our Chakra system is comprised of 3 upper Chakras, which liberate and expand us. They govern our inner pursuits and our inner worlds. They are a demonstration of our Spiritual Human. The 4th Chakra is the connecting bridge between the lower and the upper bodies. It is the place where the animal human and the divine/spiritual human meet. It is the pivoting point of our physical and spiritual world. The lower three Chakras represent our interaction with the material world. They demonstrate our Animal Human. There are 7 major Chakras and 122 minor Chakras. Our Chakras are linked to sounds, light, colors, planets, crystals, the elements, and many other key essentials of the universe. During our lives our Chakras may become blocked or too open or too closed, creating a 'stuckness' within that particular area. This results in our presenting behaviors and patterns, as well as our physical ailments. Our Chakras control the patterns from which we live, how we live, and what we present to the world. To heal these patterns is to bring our Chakras into total balance and alignment. That is, to connect to our higher selves and to realize the oneness that is. Our blockages may come from past mental traumas, physical traumas, and they may also have been inherited from our ancestors. (Miasmatic) Root Chakra The first Chakra is the base or Root Chakra. The original Sanskrit name for this Chakra is Muladhara. It is located at the base of the spine The Root Chakra contains our attitudes about life that have been handed down from generation to generation. It is said to contain the primary 8 cells that have all the knowledge of our creation. It carries our \"DNA\" of who and what we are. Here you will find the only cells in your body that do not change within your lifetime. It is the Root Chakra that grounds or Roots us in the physical world. It encompasses our stability, our foundation, shelter, and our survival. When we see someone reacting and living from this Chakra, with an excess of energy in this area, we may see someone who is very dictatorial and impatient. Their concerns are very deeply rooted in the material world. Their worries cover areas such as money, possessions, control, and perfectionism. We may also see the opposite due to an energy block. We will see the individual exhibit a lack of energy, a lack of drive, lack of support, a general under functioning (Psoric Miasm). The Root Chakra is associated to the planet Earth (Grounding) and it corresponds to our sense of smell, physical energy and vitality. Here also, say the yogis, sleeps the magic serpent known as the kundalini. It lies coiled at the base of the spine and symbolizes the basic evolutionary life force. Once awakened it will rise through the spine to the crown of the head and may trigger enlightenment in the practitioner of these methods. The Root Chakra is also connected to our fight or flight response. The basic physical components energetically connected to the base Chakra aside from the Adrenal glands would include the colon, the rectum, our legs, which physically ground us to this earth, the Lymph system, skeletal system (teeth and bones), the bladder and eliminatory system, and our lower back, which gives us support. For those who are familiar with Louise Hay, you will note that she associates the back with our stability, whether it is financial, or emotional. It is due to the connection of the skeletal system that this Chakra may also be linked to the Syphilitic miasm. The Primary color associated with this Chakra is red. With each primary color we also find a secondary color. The secondary color for the Root Chakra is green. When we are treating an illness by using the energy of the colors, any imbalance can be treated, or corrected with its opposite or secondary color. So if we see that there is an overabundance of red energy coming from the Root Chakra we may use the color green to bring balance to the Chakra, and vice versa. You may want to incorporate the use of the Color remedies into your practice. I have seen many great results with these remedies. ROOT CHAKRA FLOWER AND GEM ESSENCES Australian Bush Essences Red Lily-For disconnection, split, lack of focus, day dreamy, grounds, focuses and brings one into the present and connected to their source Sundew (drosera)-Good for indecisive people, for those who tend to be unfocused especially in work related areas, for being in the present.

Aspen - Vague Fears of the unknown Bailey Essences Sea Campion - For separation in early childhood and its consequent insecurity and fears. Stimulates loving, protective energies HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES FOR THE ROOT CHAKRA You will notice here that the remedies that govern the Root or Base Chakra may be comprised of our Minerals, the Kali's, and the earth remedies. We may also look to the use of the glandulars such as Adrenaline, Adrenal cortex, and the Adrenal Whole gland, as it is the exhaustion of the Adrenal gland that is very commonly seen in the individual who is ungrounded. This is mainly due to the energy that is consumed by their many fears. Steroids are also known to weaken the Base Chakra. Therefore our body builders, and many of our athletes in today's world may show signs of a lack of energy in the Root Chakra. (Perhaps we can add corticosteroid to the list of Root Chakra remedies) Following are some of the remedies that are commonly found in those who have a lack of energy within the Base. Arsenicum Lac Humanum Hydrogen Coffea Chocolate Granite Red Take note that remedies such as Stramonium, Aconite, Opium, and Hydrogen, deal with those that have been shaken from their foundation. They have been up rooted by a trauma or some type of fright. Remedies such as the Berlin Wall and Proteus cover those that may feel that they have constantly been living in a war zone. The constant strain on the adrenals may leave one in a constant state of high alert. Splenic chakra - second chakra The Second Chakra is known as the Sacral Chakra. (Splenic Chakra) The Sanskrit name is Svadhisthana. The 2nd Chakra is found approximately 1 inch below the navel. This Chakra controls our motion (movement) and our e-motions (movement of the emotions). It is associated with the ovaries and testes. The Sacral Chakra represents a duality, a polarity, such as the pain pleasure principle. (So again we see the strong ties between our emotions and our physical ailments.) It represents magnetism, controlling patterns, and emotional feelings (joy, anger, fear). The second Chakra is about friendliness, creativity, emotions and intuition on the gut level. It's influenced by how emotions were expressed or repressed during childhood. It is the sexual center for women. It motivates all our behavior. The areas of the body that it relates to are the sexual organs, stomach, upper intestines, liver, gallbladder, kidney, pancreas, spleen, and the middle spine. It is ruled by the water element. When we deny our emotions, water is also retained within the physical body, along with other toxins both emotionally and physically. Finding a healthy balance between control and letting go is essential for the healthy functioning of this Chakra. We constantly move (movement) our energy towards pleasurable things and away from things that are disturbing to us. I believe we are taught this response at a very young age. We run from our emotions. We run from unpleasant things. This is a much easier way of survival. We may see some individuals go into states of complete emotional shut down, void and numb of many emotions. The Sacral Chakra governs our sexual relationships, our feelings, and how we react to feeling someone else's feelings and energies (clairsentient). In practice we may encounter many individuals who present with a low or non-existent sex drive due to being completely closed off emotionally. If you cannot feel emotionally you may not be capable of making the physical connection. Fear also originates from this Chakra, quite similar to that of the Base/Root Chakra. I believe we see more fear geared toward our emotions within the Sacral Chakra, where the fear is more centered on our survival with the Base/Root Chakra. Determining where our fear comes from helps us to have greater insight as to where the imbalance can be found, but also helps to give us greater insight into choosing the correct homeopathic remedy. The Water element is associated with our emotions and the Sacral Chakra. Remember the fluidity, the movement, the flow found within this Chakra. The moon and Venus are the planets associated with this energy center. It not only controls our emotions but also our fertility, our cycles, and the urinary track. Think of the many cycles that are connected to the moon such as the tides, and the seasons. In addition the moon is also found to have a connection to the Crown chakra as well. The Sycotic miasm is emphasized here as we see the correlation with the bodily fluids, our sexual function, and reproduction. The color of this Chakra is orange, with its complementary color being blue. FLOWER AND GEM ESSENCES FOR THE SACRAL CHAKRA Australian Bush Essences Turkey Bush-Creativity Billy Goat Plum-Releases shame & humiliation, sexuality Spinifex-Cleansing and releasing, used for physical problems related to sex & body. The victim archetype She Oak - Hormonal imbalance. Removes those personal blocks that prevent conception. Flannel Flower \u2014 Lack of sensitivity, especially in males. Averse to being touched.

Hematite-For boundary strength while witnessing emotionally charged situations Malachite-1st to 4th Chakras, aligns physical, emotional, mental and spiritual supports unity of being on all levels. Orange Calcite-For lack of energy, creativity, unable to see the positive side of life. Dispels, sadness, grief, darkness Rhodolite Garnet-Healing oneself from trauma or upset.

Tiger's Eye-For reacting rather than responding, often angry or jealous, strengthens emotions and emotional body Bailey Flower Essences Tuftet Vetch - Confusion of sexual image. For sexual difficulties caused by an incorrect sexual self-image - usually due to childhood conditioning HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES (fluids) Other Venoms Orange The Sacral Chakra has an affinity with the Sycotic miasm in regards to the bodily fluids, sexuality, and the emotions. It reigns over the kidneys, Urinary tract and our circulation (fluids); therefore the use of the glandulars that relate to the specific organs may be used. Solar Plexus The third Chakra is called the Solar Plexus. It is located below the sternum and just above the stomach. The Sanskrit name for the Solar Plexus is Manipura. It is also known as the seat of the soul, for it is our power center. The parts of the body associated with this Chakra include the muscular system, the skin, the Solar Plexus, the large intestine, stomach, liver (color yellow), and other organs and glands in the region of the Solar Plexus. Also the face, representing figuratively the face one shows the world. Parts of our consciousness associated with this Chakra include our perceptions concerning power, control, freedom, and the ease with which one is able to be themselves. The mental activity and mental body are also associated with this Chakra. The Solar Plexus Chakra corresponds to the level of being that we call the personality, or ego. It is the seat of our self-esteem and our will. It is our action in the world, going out and getting what we want. When there is an over abundance of energy in this center we will encounter someone who is a workaholic, a perfectionist, domineering, dictatorial and arrogant. When there is a lack of energy in the Solar Plexus we appear depressed, we lack confidence, and we worry about what others say (fear of who we are). We may exhibit insecurity, jealousy, distrust, and a constant need for reassurance. When this Chakra is balanced we show self-respect, respect for others, and a sense of personal power. We are outgoing, cheerful, relaxed, spontaneous and very expressive. Yellow is the color associated to this Chakra. It is the Chakra of the element of fire. Fire walking is excellent for this Chakra; it gives you the feeling that if you can do that then you can do anything. Sun bathing holds other benefits for this center, but Ian Watson had commented that we do not sunbathe properly. We sit in our offices for most of our life and spend two weeks out of the year in the sun. The best remedy is a regular sunbathing program. Allow the energy of the sun to soak into the Solar Plexus from the front, and a nice warm fire on your back. Think how good it feels to stand in front of a fire with your back to it! Australian Bush Essences Dynamis Essence- A combination of essences for energy Old Man Banksia- Counteracts weariness. This gives us the strength to handle whatever life may bring. Macrocarpa- Energy Crowea- Releases worry Wild Potato Bush- releases feeling physically encumbered, weighted down Banksia Robur- For Lethary, apathy, loss of drive Bottlebrush - Bonding between mother and child, serenity, letting go.

Helps to clear blockages within the Solar Plexus Tiger's Eye- 2nd and 3rd Chakras, Taking things too personally, anger, jealousy. Clears energy blocks, taps into personal energy from the highest level. Bach Flower Essences Cerato - Strength to trust one's own judgement Larch - Lack of self-confidence Schleranthus - Inability to come to a decision, indecisiveness HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES FOR THE SOLAR PLEXUS The Solar Plexus is our furnace of fire. It is our will, our being, and our inner strength. Remedies found to be appropriate for this Chakra are the fire remedies, including fire itself. We also see the power of the seasons having an intense effect on this energy center. Spring is a time of death, birth, and being reborn. It is a time of the renewal of our Spirit. Our souls seek new journeys. Autumn or Fall is a time of the coming months of rest, a time of detoxification. Summer brings the emotion of joy, and we learn how to balance it. Our feet are most often exposed in the summer. The feet are our connection with the earth and are what essentially roots us on many levels. Summer is a very important time to come in touch with our Root Chakra. Winter brings the much needed rest, but some may also encounter sadness due to the lack of sunshine and warmth to feed the furnace of the Solar Plexus. In regards to the homeopathic remedies that may be used, we may see the remedies that relate to the digestive tract, the liver, and the gall bladder. Phosphorous Carduus China Yellow HEART CHAKRA Our fourth Chakra is the Heart Chakra. Its name in Sanskrit is Anahata. The Heart Chakra is the middle Chakra in the system of seven and it is related to our ability to love freely and to feel love, to be compassionate and feel compassion, and to have an inner sense of peace deep within us. It is the integrator of opposites in the psyche, the mind and body, male and female, persona and shadow, and the ego and unity. It is our connection to the oneness around us. The associated organs to this Chakra are the heart, breasts, lungs, as well as our immune system. It encompasses the blood circulatory system, and the cardiac plexus. The major gland is the thymus gland. It is also said that the Heart Chakra can have a great effect on our sight. I have noticed in my own healing with this energy center that when I have come to a crisis that my eyesight becomes weak. So what are we afraid to see? The Heart Chakra is related to our sense of touch, in its aspect of relating to the person \"inside\" the body, and distinct from the sensation of the Orange Chakra, which is more about the sensation one feels \"from\" their own body. It encompasses our ability to love and offer unconditional love. To love freely for the true being that one is. Hugging, therefore, is a Heart Chakra activity. When one hugs, one is aware of what the person inside the other body feels, and they are aware of what you feel inside your body, and there is a sense of relating to the person inside the body. A sense of emotional connection is experienced. Sensitivity about being touched indicates Heart Chakra sensitivity When we find a deficiency of the amount of energy in the Heart Chakra we may feel sorry for ourselves, indecisive, and unworthy of being loved. We cannot seem to make the connection or feel connected to those around us for fear of rejection. We carry a fear of letting go and just being. When there is an excess of energy within this area we may become demanding and overly critical. We may also become manic-depressive. We do not posses unconditional love in this state. The color that relates to this Chakra is green with the secondary or complementary color being red. That is why when there is an excess of energy within this Chakra we may see traits of the Root Chakra come forward. We may try to control through our sexuality or through money. We put limitations on our love. We do not give our love unconditionally. Another color that relates to the Heart Chakra is the color pink. This is a symbol of motherly love. FLOWER AND GEM ESSENCES FOR THE HEART CHAKRA Australian Bush Essences Bush Fuchsia-speaking your true essence Crowea-Worry Flower-Intimacy Illawara Flame Tree-Fear of rejection Sturt Desert Pea - Emotional pain Alaskan Gem Remedies Chrysocolla-Unresolved issues of grief, heart closed down, guard against attack from others, increases love of self, flexibility.

Emerald-Fear of not being good enough, love blocked because of fear.

Soapberry-For fear of own power, inability to keep heart open in challenging situations, support & helps from nature, grounds, releases trauma. Watermelon Tourmaline-For imbalances in the male and female aspects, difficulty expressing love or receiving love. Bach Flower Remedies Holly - Blocked Love Gorse - Despair Bailey Essence Milk Thistle - Self Love A closed Heart Chakra is one of the main effects found in the Western World due to the way of life. We are taught not to cry, not to get angry, to just take it all in and move on with our lives. Yet in today's society we see the effects of this type of upbringing in our young. We see their want and their desire for the intensity of their emotions. We see this desire in their actions, and acting out, and unfortunately through their choice of drugs in their lives today. A lot of our children are drawn to empathogens such as ecstasy and LSD. These types of drugs arouse the feelings of emotions; they awaken the intensity of the emotion, and blow the Heart Chakra wide open. So deep down in their subconscious they realize the need for emotion. They realize that they are lacking this essential part of what allows us to feel and love unconditionally. Homeopathic remedies are very helpful in balancing and unblocking this Chakra. At first it may be very painful for the individual, due to those buried emotions and their traumas. When we encounter someone who is in a deep state of despair, perhaps within the dark night of the soul, it is very beneficial to accompany homeopathic treatment with one or more of the flower or gem essences available today. But we need to assure the individual that at the end of this road of healing will lie a connection to the divine that is without words. This type of healing is a true gift from the power above. HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES FOR THE HEART CHAKRA Anacardium Phos Ac Nit Ac Lachesis Scorpion Caladium Ant Tart Green THROAT CHAKRA The fifth Chakra is the Throat Chakra, also known as the Visuddha in Sanskrit. This Chakra is located at the base of the throat. It controls the throat, neck, arms, teeth, mouth and hands and is associated with the brachial or cervical plexus. The Throat Chakra is associated with the thyroid, parathyroid glands. The sense that corresponds to this Chakra is our sense of hearing. This energy center holds the key for speech, sounds, vibrations, communication, and our creativity. It also brings in our abilities for telepathy and gives us our inspiration. When one is balanced in this area the individual is content, centered, and can live in the present. They have a very keen sense of timing. They meditate well and through this meditation they experience a Divine energy. When the Throat Chakra is open you will find a strong willingness to express yourself. Your creativities will flow through this Chakra. Those that may express themselves and live strongly through this energy center tend to be singers, artists, speakers, teachers, etc. When there is an excessive amount of energy within this center one may present as being arrogant, self-righteous, dogmatic, addictive, and they talk too much. Those that are seen as deficient within this center appear scared, timid, quiet, inconsistent, and unreliable. They hold back. They cannot express their thoughts and they cannot relax. This individual may be manipulative and devious. You may also find a fear of sex due to their religious upbringing. The color for this Chakra is blue with the secondary color being orange. FLOWER AND GEM ESSENCES FOR THE THROAT CHAKRA Australian Bush Essences Cognis essence-Gives clarity and courage to speak one's truth-great for study and new information Paw Paw-assimilating new information Turkey Bush - for creative blocks, renews artistic confidence and creative expression Alaskan Gem Remedies Aquamarine-5th and 6th Chakras, mind chatter, hotheaded, not present because of mental chatter Aventurine-Fear of the unknown and unexpected, it also helps with new experiences and risk taking Azurite-For depletion of vitality when speaking, communicating from head only.

When we loose our power to communicate, to voice who we are and what are needs are, we become suppressed on a deeper level. We become stifled in our words and our expressions. This is commonly seen in singers, teachers, and speakers, those who use their voice to express themselves. It is when this power becomes stifled that disease sets in. We then see diseases such as tonsillitis, strep throat, swollen glands, and problems with the thymus and spleen. This center also greatly affects our immune system due to its effect on our thymus gland. HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES Third Eye Christ Conscious Center The sixth Chakra goes by many names. It is known as the Third Eye, the Christ conscious center, the Brow Chakra, the Conscious awareness center, and of course, the Sanskrit name of Anja. It is located at the center of our forehead. The Third Eye controls our psychic powers and higher intuition. It is from this center that one may reach their higher self. This is the center that enables you to experience telepathy, astral travel, and our past lives. The Brow Chakra is associated with the deep inner level of being we call Spirit, or our subconscious being. It is the place where our true motivations are found, and it is the level of consciousness that directs our actions and our lives. It is this center that is related to the sense of ESP. This would encompass our inner vision, our inner sensitivity, and our inner hearing. The Third Eye Chakra relates to our forehead, temples and the carotid plexus. It corresponds with our pituitary gland. If an individual is deficient in energy within this center they become non-assertive, undisciplined, afraid of success, oversensitive to the feelings of others, and they may exhibit difficulty distinguishing between the ego self and the higher self. It the energy is overabundant in the Brow Chakra then you may see someone who is an egomaniac, proud, manipulative, and somewhat an authoritarian. The well-balanced individual will be charismatic, and carry a sensation of being whole, finally complete. They will be able to be open to receiving guidance with no attachment to material possessions. They will not fear death, as they will carry a deeper insight and understanding of this next phase of life. The color of the Third Eye is Ind. or midnight blue with the secondary color being Orange. FLOWER AND GEM ESSENCES FOR THE THIRD EYE Australian Bush Essences Bush Iris-Clears blocks in the Chakras relating to the grounding and trust centers. Awakens spirituality by releasing deep fears.

This center is the control center for our dream world. It is the bridge of the insight between the human world and our higher selves. It is from the Third Eye that we receive our intuition, our knowing of what we know. There are many drugs, such as the smoking of marijuana, the intake of LSD that may blow this center wide open. Blows to the head may also wreak havoc to this energy center. Those who live too much in this Chakra may loose their sense of reality. They may begin to hear voices. They may become seasonally depressed. The Third Eye is our eye into the spirit world. It is in our dreams that we travel with the view of the Third Eye Chakra. HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES FOR THE THIRD EYE Cannabis Indica Sulph Sol Melatonin Ind. The Crown Chakra The seventh Chakra is known as the Crown Chakra, the connection to the divine, the cosmic consciousness center, or the \"I am\" center. Its Sanskrit name is Sahasrara. This Chakra corresponds with the top of the head, the brain, and the entire nervous system. The Crown Chakra represents that part of our consciousness concerned with our perceptions of unity or separation. Just as the Root Chakra shows the connection to Mother Earth, this Chakra shows our relationship with our creator. The Crown Chakra connects us to a world beyond the physical world. It takes us to a world that is timeless and all knowing. It is this energy center that feeds us the knowledge, wisdom, understanding and true bliss, thus the connection with the pineal gland. When the individual is balanced in this energy center they can transcend the laws of nature. They have total access to the unconscious and the subconscious. They understand the \"oneness\" of the universe. Those balanced and enlightened within this Chakra are our mystics, shamans, and our healers. When someone contains an excess of energy within this center they may seem frustrated, depressed and become destructive. They may also suffer from migraine headaches. They cannot realize the power they posses, and they may seem distant. Individuals in this situation may require a remedy to ground them, to rebalance them. When the individual is found deficient in this Chakra they are catatonic. They appear lifeless and joyless. They are incapable of making decisions. They may express that they have no interest in what life has to offer. FLOWER AND GEM ESSENCES FOR THE CROWN CHAKRA Australian Bush Essences Red Lily-For disconnection, split, lack of focus, day dreamy, grounds, focuses and brings one into the present and connected to their source Sundew-Good for indecisive people, for those who tend to be unfocused especially in work related areas, for being in the present Alaskan Gem Remedies Aventurine-Facing obstacles, limits in one's own belief system and pioneering new paths Fluorite-For difficulty manifesting thoughts into action, any type of energy blocks, will allow increase of energy and breaking through energies .

Bach Flower Essences Wild Oat< - Reconnecting HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES FOR THE Pituitary Gland Baryta Carb Medorrhinum Alabaster Sequoia Spectrum Violet Those that function from this center are found to be Spacey, and extremely disconnected from their surroundings. They have a desperate need to be grounded. Some may not appear to live in the world of reality. There complain of being light headed, dizzy, and feeling faint. Their heads and ideas are to much in the clouds. THE COLOR REMEDIES RED Red is the color of energy, vitality and power. It is used in correlation to the Root Chakra. Red is supposedly the first color perceived by a child when they are born. Brain-injured persons suffering from temporary color-blindness start to perceive red before they are able to discern any other colors. Red is used for burning out cancers, drying up weeping sores or wounds. It will warm cold areas to reduce pain. Red is a powerful healing agent in regards to diseases of the blood and circulation. (Think of the remedies that correspond with the color red in regards to the Doctrine of Signatures.) It will help lift the spirits to deal with depression. Red will warm a cold heart. Although, red is not to be used on people with high blood pressure or who have high levels of anxiety. The energy appears to be too intense and can possibly create further anxiety and even raise the blood pressure. It should not be used at night as it may keep one awake. If you stay under the red ray too long or are exposed to red for a considerable time it will make you very agitated or even aggressive. It is associated with the male polarity, the Yang. It is believed that a red carpet or wall, in a place of business, will draw money. Red is a warm color, which invigorates, and is excellent when used for treatment of persons having heart diseases, blood disorders, and problems with anger, just to name a few. ORANGE Orange is connected to our Sacral Chakra. It is the color used to increase immunity, to increase sexual potency, to help in all digestive ailments, chest and kidney diseases. It is the color of joy and the center of ease, movement, and pleasure. Orange will have a gentle warming effect if used lightly. Orange, like red should not be used for too long. It is not a good color for nervous people or people easily agitated. YELLOW Yellow is the color of intellect and it is used for mental stimulation, it will help you think quicker. It is good for clearing a foggy head. To help cure dermatitis and other skin problems and again it must be used carefully because it is very stimulating and it could cause exhaustion and depression. GREEN Green is the color of healing and traveling back in time. It will balance the emotions and brings about a feeling of calmness. Green is a good general healing color because it stimulates growth, therefore it is good for helping heal broken bones, regrowth of tissue of all kinds.
