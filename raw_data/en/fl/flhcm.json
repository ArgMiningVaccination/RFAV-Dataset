My hope is that we can create a braver and more beautiful world for our children. We must make changes for the better for our children so they don't have to! We can choose to do so in love for each other and our communities and our planet. We fully support people who choose vaccination for any disease process. We give informed consent to all people who chose to vaccinate, we support that with love. For those who don't want to vaccinate, we support them too. There are risks in everything we choose to do each and every day and it is up to you what risks you take. Medicines are mostly generic now for common illnesses. The great frontier is that of \"biologics\", Gene therapies, and vaccines - that is where the money is. As of a few years ago, there were already over 200 vaccines being studied so who knows how many of those will be eventually required to get your driver's license or go to college. This is why we need to take this seriously now. For those of you who don't know, the vaccine schedule has changed dramatically between generations. The generation prior to the 70's only had about 10 doses of vaccines their entire lives and only about half the population (the wealthier ones) got all those doses. By the 80's, we had about 24 doses of vaccines our entire lives (minus the military and missionaries). Now children have 24 doses by 6 months of age, 46 doses by 6 years of age and over 70 doses by 18 years of age. Now add the adult ones being mandated in addition to that. Prior to this pandemic, there was no heath care crisis to cause this but the 1986 law giving full immunity to vaccine makers allowed for this dramatic rise in required vaccines. So unless you are in the military, most adults over 40 are less vaccinated than a 9 month old baby and they keep adding more vaccines and more restrictions if you don't follow suit. Meanwhile we have an epidemic among our children and young adults now of autoimmune diseases, cancers, neurologic disorders and more. We rank poorly among developed nations for longevity by age 5 and some developing countries are doing better than us even though we are the most vaccinated country in the world, except maybe Israel. We must demand a balance in \"public health\" and individual health as the health of the masses is only as good as the individuals that make up the greater good. This is for our children and their ability to get an education, get a job, get married and feed their families. Our future is in our hands and it is We, The People that can do this together. We cannot wait for others to do it for us. How You Can Help - Please contact your legislators/politicians regularly A good way to do this is to set your calendars once monthly at least. Time is of the essence to make an impact on our system. If you look throughout history, the dark times were followed by better times, not because of government leaders but because of We, The People. We, The People, make our lives better through grassroots efforts. When contacting them you can include some of the info here in your communications including the facts listed below. Most importantly drive home the point that we need to protect doctors that want to try safe, innovative treatments for patients. This should be celebrated, not suppressed. We know why it is suppressed but that is from the powers that do not want us to be free to make our lives better. - Talk to your pastors, your teachers, your principles, your neighbors and your family and friends. Pick the ones on our side to give us encouragement and hope. Then pick the ones who are ambivalent to share with them our hopes in order to inspire them. Avoid the ones on the other side as the truth will come to them eventually when they are ready. - Please stand strong in these times as we lose our rights and freedoms. Do not endorse fake vaccine cards. First of all it is federal offense because it has a seal on it and if that seal if forged you will be prosecuted. Furthermore, by getting a fake card, you are hurting our cause. I understand if you do considering these circumstances but if you give into that mindset now, you have already given up your future. Some states are already using electronic cards displayed on a phone which will be much harder to fake so stand strong now so we never get to that point. If you are getting it so you can travel and go to concerts, then be prepared to add every single new pharmaceutical treatment so you can go to that concert or take that exotic vacation. Stats & Info for Communication Contact your legislators with information that supports your concerns. The following stats and info can help you with contacting state leaders. - Risk of death in children under age 18 from the COVID 19 virus is 0.002% per the CDC and they are not super-spreaders like they thought initially. We also know from the science that people with a BMI over 35, pre-existing conditions and over age 65 are the most vulnerable for adverse effects from COVID-19. The risk for young healthy people is minimal. Let's protect and target people over 65 and those with pre-existing conditions. But let's not mandate. - As of Sept 2021 the CDC US has confirmed that 94% of covid related deaths had on average 4.0 comorbidities. From March 2020 to July 2021 the CDC confirms that of the adult hospitalizations 58% were hypertensive, 49.9% were obese, 42.6% had metabolic syndrome, and 35.3% had a cardiovascular disease. - VAERS has almost 16000 reported deaths since December which is more than the last 15 years combined with all vaccines! There are approx. 70,000 total COVID vaccine reported hospitalizations and 750,000 adverse events from the COVID vaccine. - The FDA, CDC and Harvard studies show that only 1-10% of adverse events are reported to VAERS. - The vaccine does not decrease transmission and reports of \"breakthrough\" infections are piling up, not to mention hospitalizations and death from COVID in fully vaccinated patients. - The Vaccine makers are liability free (you can't sue them) and Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson has paid 10's of billions in fines for fraud. - We have thousands of doctors across the country having great success using various protocols for treatment, so the vaccine is not the only choice: [https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-protocols/i-mask-plus-protocol/](https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-protocols/i-mask-plus-protocol/). These doctors need to be protected as the main goal is to keep people out of the hospital and dying. Using successful innovative treatments and supplements to treat COVID should be valid and pushed as a solution besides just the vaccine. - The science has proven that people who have had COVID have as much if not better immunity than the vaccine to contract it again. As we've seen that those vaccinated have continued to get COVID. Many people compare a mandate of the COVID vaccine to the mandate of Measles and Smallpox vaccines. However, those vaccines are recognized by the CDC that they should only be administered to ages over 13 who have NOT had the disease (meaning they have natural immunity). - This is not a disease of the unvaccinated. This is a disease of the people who were already in a poor state of health and we are not doing enough to educate them and protect them.

Once freedom is lost, it is almost impossible to regain. ! DISCLAIMER: Per the FDA, nothing can cure, mitigate, prevent, or treat the coronavirus so we have to just focus on supporting the immune system. The FDA says only a future vaccine and anti-virals can be considered legitimate but nothing natural. I have seen a lot of great articles with various herbals and vitamins to take that can support the immune system but here are my favorites but not an exhaustive list. Consult with your doctor related to Coronavirus treatments as this is not intended to treat anyone. "}
