HRSA is charged with ensuring access to quality health care through a network of community-based health centers, maternal and child health programs, and community HIV/AIDS programs throughout the States and Territories. In addition, HRSA's mission includes supporting individuals pursuing careers in medicine, nursing, and many other health disciplines. HRSA fulfills these responsi\u00adbilities by collecting and analyzing timely, topical information that identifies health priorities and trends that can be addressed through program interventions and capacity building. HRSA is pleased to present Women's Health USA 2008 , the seventh edition of the Women's Health USA data book. To reflect the ever-changing, increasingly diverse population and its characteristics, Women's Health USA selectively highlights emerging issues and trends in women's health. Data and information on occupational injury, maternal mortality, digestive disorders, oral health, eye health, and urologic disorders are only a few of the new topics included in this edition. Every effort has been made to highlight racial and ethnic, sex/gender, and socioeconomic WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 5 disparities where possible. Where race and ethnicity data are reported, every effort was made to ensure that groups are mutually exclusive; when groups of Blacks and Whites exclude Hispanics they are described as non-Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islanders and American Indian/Alaska Natives are also generally non-Hispanic. In some instances, it was not possible to provide data for all races due to the design of the original data source or the size of the sample population; therefore, data with a relative standard error of 30 percent or greater were considered unreliable and were not reported. The data book was developed by HRSA to provide readers with an easy-to-use collection of current and historical data on some of the most pressing health challenges facing women, their families, and their communities. Women's Health USA 2008 is intended to be a concise reference for policymakers and program managers at the Federal, State, and local levels to identify and clarify issues affecting the health of women. In these pages, readers will find a profile of women's health from a variety of data sources. The data book brings together the latest available informa\u00adtion from various agencies within the Federal government, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Labor, and U.S. Department of Justice. Non-Federal data sources were used when no Federal source was av ailable. Every attempt has been made to use data collected in the past 5 years. It is important to note that the incidence data included are generally not age-adjusted to the 2000 popula\u00adtion standard of the United States. This affects the comparability of data from year to year, and the interpretation of differences across various groups, especially those of different races and ethnicities. Without age adjustment, it is difficult to know how much of the difference in incidence rates between groups can be attributed to differ\u00adences in the groups' age distributions. Women's Health USA 2008 is available online thr ough either the HRSA Office of Women's Health Web site at www.hrsa.gov/womenshealth or the Office of Data and Program Develop\u00adment's Web site at www.mchb.hrsa.gov/data.

In most age groups, women accounted for approximately half of the population, with the exception of people aged 65 years and older; within this age group, women represented 58 percent of the population. The growing diversity of the U.S. population is reflected in the racial and ethnic distribution of women across age groups. Black and Hispanic women accounted for 8.9 and 6.3 percent of the female population aged 65 years and older, respectively, but they represented 14.7 and 21.0 percent of females under 15 years of age. Non-Hispanic Whites accounted for 80.6 percent of women aged 65 years and older, but only 56.4 percent of those under 15 years of age. America's growing diversity underscores the impor tance of examining and addressing racial and ethnic disparities in health status and the use of health care services. In 2006, 62.3 percent of non-Hispanic White women reported themselves to be in excellent or very good health, compared to only 53.4 percent of Hispanic women and 50.2 percent of non-Hispanic Black women. Minority women are disproportionately affected b y a number of diseases and health conditions, including HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, diabetes, and asthma. For WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 INTRODUCTION 7 instance, in 2006, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women accounted for more than three-fourths of women living with HIV/AIDS (63.9 and 15.2 percent, respectively). One-third of non-Hispanic White women had ever been tested for HIV, compared to 53.7 percent of non-Hispanic Black women and 46.1 percent of Hispanic women. Diabetes is a chronic condition and a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, and is especially prevalent among minority populations. Among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women, diabetes occurred at a rate of 117.6 and 111.8 per 1,000 women, respectively, compar ed to 69.4 per 1,000 non-Hispanic White women. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, was also more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black women than women of other races. In 2005-2006, this condition occurred at a rate of 179.2 per 1,000 non-Hispanic Black women, compar ed to 157.0 per 1,000 non-Hispanic White women and 113.1 per 1,000 Hispanic women. Some conditions, such as arthritis and heart disease, dispr oportionately affect non-Hispanic White women. For instance, in 2006, more than 27 percent of non-Hispanic White women had arthritis, compared to 23.5 percent of non-Hispanic Black women and 14.3 percent of Hispanic women. In addition to race and ethnicity, income and education ar e important factors that contribute to women's health and access to health care. Regard\u00adless of family structure, women are more likely than men to live in poverty. Poverty rates were highest among women who were heads of their households (25.1 percent). Poverty rates were also highest among American Indian/Alaska Native women (27.6 percent), followed by non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women (23.4 and 20.2 percent, respectively). Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women were also more likely to be heads of households than their non-Hispanic White and Asian counterparts. Some conditions and health risks are more closely linked to family income than to race and ethnicity , such as asthma. Rates of asthma decline as income increases and women with higher incomes are more likely to effectively manage their asthma. Among women with asthma whose incomes were below 100 percent of poverty, nearly 36 percent had an asthma-related emergency room visit in the past year, compared to 24.8 percent of women with family incomes of 300 percent or more of poverty. Mental health is another important aspect of women 's overall health. A range of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder, disproportion\u00adately affect women. Unlike many other health concerns, younger women are more likely than older women to suffer fr om serious psychological stress and major depressive episodes. Physical disabilities are more prevalent among women as w ell. Disability can be defined as impairment of the ability to perform common activities like walking up stairs, sitting or standing for 2 hours or more, grasping small objects, or carrying items like groceries. Therefore, the terms \"activity limitations\" and \"disabilities\" are used interchangeably throughout this book. Overall, 15.0 percent of women and 12.6 percent of men r eported having activity limitations in 2006. Men, however, bear a disproportionate burden of some health conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, hyper tension and heart disease. In 2006, for instance, adolescent and adult males accounted for 72.9 percent of new AIDS cases, though a smaller proportion of men had ever been tested for HIV than women (33.7 versus 37.8 percent, respectively). Certain health risks, such as cigarette use and injur y, occur more commonly among men than women. In 2006, 27.8 percent of males smoked cigarettes, compared to 22.4 percent of females. Among men, 30.2 percent of emergency depart\u00adment visits were injury related, while only 21.3 percent of women's visits were due to injury. In addition, men were more likely than women to lack health insurance. INTRODUCTION WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 8 Many diseases and health conditions, such as those mentioned above, can be avoided or minimized through good nutrition, regular physical activity, and preventive health care. In 2005, 19.7 percent of women's visits to physicians were for preventive care, including prenatal care, preventive screenings, and immunizations. Overall, 64.6 percent of older women reported receiving a flu shot in 2006; however, this percentage ranged from 46.6 percent among Hispanic women to 67.3 percent of non-Hispanic White women. In addition to preventive health care, preventive dental care is also important to prevent dental caries and gum disease. In 2003-2004, 74.6 percent of women with incomes of 300 percent or more of poverty saw a dentist in the past year, compared to 51.4 percent of women with incomes below 100 percent of poverty, and 44.9 percent of women with incomes of 200-299 percent of poverty. There are many ways women (and men) can pr omote health and help prevent disease and disability. Regular physical activity is one of these. In 2006, 10.3 percent of women participated in adequate physical activity-30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most days of the week or 20 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity on 3 or more days per week. Non-Hispanic White women and women with higher incomes were most likely to meet the r ecommended levels of physical activity. Healthy eating habits can also be a major contributor to long-term health and pr evention of chronic disease. In 2003-2004, however, more than half of all adult women had diets that included more than the recommended amount of saturated fat and sodium and less than the recommended amount of folate and calcium. Overall, 63.5 percent of women exceeded the maximum daily intake of saturated fat, and 70 percent exceeded the maximum amount of sodium. While some behaviors have a positive effect on health, a number of others, such as smoking, illicit dr ug use, and excessive alcohol use can have a negative effect. In 2006, 22.4 percent of women smoked. However, nearly 46 percent of female smokers tried to quit at some point in the past year. During the same year, 44.9 percent of women reported any alcohol use in the past month, but relatively few women (15.6 percent) reported binge drinking (five or more drinks on the same occasion) and even fewer (3.5 percent) reported heavy alcohol use (binge drinking on 5 days or more in the past month). Cigarette, alcohol, and illicit drug use is partic\u00ad ularly harmful during pr egnancy. The use of tobacco during pregnancy has declined steadily since 1989. Based on data from 36 states, 10.5 percent of pregnant women reported smoking during pr egnancy in 2005. This rate was highest among American Indian/Alaska Native women (18.1 percent) and lowest among Asian/Pacific I slander women (2.1 percent). Women's Health USA 2008 can be an important tool for emphasizing the impor tance of preven\u00ad tive care, counseling, and education, and for illustrating disparities in the health status of women from all age groups and racial and ethnic backgrounds. Health problems can only be remedied if they are recognized. This data book provides information on a range of indicators that can help us track the health behaviors, risk factors, and health care utilization practices of women throughout the United States. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 INTRODUCTION 9 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS Population characteristics describe the diverse social, demographic, and economic features of the Nation's population. There were over 151 million females in the United States in 2006, representing slightly more than half of the population. Examining data by demographic factors such as sex, age, and race/ethnicity can ser ve a number of purposes for policymakers and program planners. For instance, these comparisons can be used to tailor the development and evaluation of policies and programs serving women. The following section presents data on popula\u00ad tion characteristics that affect women 's physical, social, and emotional health. Some of these characteristics include the age and racial and ethnic distribution of the population, household composition, education, income, occupation, and participation in Federal programs. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 U.S. POPULATION In 2006, the total U.S. population was over 299 million, with females comprising 50.8 per cent of that total. Females younger than 35 years of age accounted for 46.1 percent of the female popula\u00adtion, those aged 35-64 years accounted for 39.7 percent, and females aged 65 years and older accounted for 14.2 percent. The distribution by sex was fairly even across y ounger age groups; however, women accounted for a greater percentage of the older population than men. Of those aged 65 and older, 58.0 percent were women.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS 11 U.S. FEMALE POPULATION The growing diversity of the U.S. population is r eflected in the racial and ethnic distribution of women across age groups. The younger female population (under 15 years) is significantly more diverse than the older female population. In 2006, 56.4 percent of females under 15 years were non-Hispanic White, while 21.0 percent of that group were Hispanic. In contrast, among women aged 65 years and older, 80.6 percent were non-Hispanic White and only 6.3 percent were Hispanic. The distribution of the Black population was more consistent across age groups, ranging from 14.7 percent of females under 15 years of age to 8.9 percent of women aged 65 years and older. Evidence indicates that race and ethnicity r epresent important factors related to health disparities. Coupled with the increasing diversity of the U.S. population, these health disparities make culturally-appropriate, community-driven programs critical to improving the health of the entire U.S. population. 1 *Includes only non-institutionalized population not living in group housing.

Just over 12 percent of women over age 18 were the heads of their households, meaning that they have children or other family members, but no spouse, living with them in a house that they own or rent. Women who are heads of households include single mothers, single women with a parent or other close r elative in their house, and women with other household compositions. The remaining women lived alone (15.3 percent), with parents or other relatives (12.7 percent), or with non-relatives (7.2 percent). Women in households with no spouse present ar e more likely than women in married couple families to have incomes below poverty (see \"Women and Poverty\" on the next page). In 2006, Black women were most likely to be single heads of households (28.9 per cent) while Asian women were least likely (7.5 percent). Hispanic women and women of other races were also more likely than non-Hispanic White and Asian women to be heads of households (16.2 and 17.7 percent, respectively).

With regard to race and ethnicity, non-Hispanic White women were the least likely to experience poverty (9.0 percent), while American Indian/Alaska N ative women were the most likely (27.6 percent), followed closely by non-Hispanic Black Women Aged 18 and Older Living Below the Poverty Level, * by Race/Ethnicity and Age, 2006 women (23.4 percent) and Hispanic women (20.2 percent; data not shown). Poverty status varies with age. Among women of each race and ethnicity , those aged 45-64 years were less likely to experience poverty than those aged 18-44 and 65 years and older. For instance, 17.2 percent of non-Hispanic Black women aged 45-64 w ere in poverty in 2006, compared to more than 26 percent of non-Hispanic Black women aged 18-44 and 65 years and older. Women in families\u2014a group of at least two people r elated by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together\u2014experience higher rates of poverty than men in families (9.4 versus 6.2 percent). Men in families with no spouse present were considerably less likely to have family incomes below the poverty level than women in families with no spouse present (12.0 versus 25.1 percent).

In 2006, an estimated 35.5 million people lived in households that w ere classified as not fully food secure. Households or persons experiencing food insecurity may be categorized as experiencing low food security or very low food security (formerly r eferred to as \"food insecurity with hunger\"). Low food security generally indicates multiple food access issues, while very low food security indicates reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns due to inadequate resources for food. Periods of low or very low food security may be occasional or episodic, placing the members of a household at greater nutritional risk due to insufficient access to nutritionally adequate and safe foods. In 2005-2006, nearly 17 percent of women w ere not fully food secure, and this percentage varied by race and ethnicity. Among women, non-Hispanic Whites were most likely to be fully food secure (89.4 percent), while Hispanics were least likely (62.2 percent). Non-Hispanic Black women had the highest rate of v ery low food security (5.6 percent), and Hispanic women had the highest rates of being marginally food secure and having low food security (20.2 and 14.6 percent, respectively). Food security status also varies by household composition. While adult men and women living alone had similar rates of food insecurity in 2006, female-headed households with no spouse present were more likely than male heads of households with no spouse present to experience food insecu\u00adrity (30.4 versus 17.0 percent, respectively).

The Federal Food Stamp Program (FSP) helps low-income individuals purchase food. In 2006, nearly 13.0 million adults participated in the FSP; of these, more than 8.8 million (68 percent) were women. Of these women, more than 4 million (almost half) were in the 18- to 35-year-old age group. Female-headed households with children make up nearly one-thir d of households that rely on food stamps, and represent nearly 60 percent of food stamp households with children (data not shown). The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) also plays an important role in serving women and families by providing supplementary nutrition during pregnancy, the postpartum period, and while breastfeeding. Most WIC participants are infants and children (75.0 percent); however, the pr ogram also serves more than 2 million pregnant women and mothers, representing 25.0 percent of WIC participants. During the years 1992-2006, the number of women participating in WIC increased by 65 percent, and it continues to rise.

Some professions, such as medicine and dentistry, have historically been dominated by males, while others, such as Percent of Students nursing, have been predominantly female. Over the past several decades, these disparities have narrowed, and in some cases reversed. In 1980-1981, 47.4 percent of pharmacy students were women, while in the fall of 2006, women represented more than 63 percent of pharmacy Women in Schools for Selected Health Professions, 1980-1981 and 2006-2007 Source I.8: Professional Associations 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 1980-1981 2006-2007 26.5 48.8 19.7 Osteopathic Nursing Dentistry* Pharmacy Public Health Social Work Medicine students. Even in fields where men are still in the majority, the representation of female students has grown. In 1980-1981, only 26.5 percent of medical students were women, compared to nearly one-half (48.8 percent) of students in the fall of 2006. Similar gains have been made in the fields of osteopathic medicine and dentistry, where the most recent data indicate that 49.9 and 44.3 percent of students, respectively, were women, compared to 19.7 and 17.0 percent in 1980-1981. During the 2006-2007 academic year, female students represented a large majority in graduate public health (70.0 percent) and social work programs (85.6 percent). Nursing, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, also contin\u00adues to be dominated by women, although the proportion of students who are female is slowly declining. In the 1980-1981 academic year, 94.3 percent of graduate students in nursing pr ograms were female, while in the fall of 2006, females represented 91.2 percent of graduate students in nursing programs. Women also represent a majority of students studying optometry (64.2 percent) and dietetics (91 percent; data not shown). Comparative data for these programs were not available for the 1980-1981 academic year. *Most recent data for dentistry are from the 2005-2006 school year. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS 17 EDUCATIONAL DEGREES AND INSTRUCTIONAL STAFF The number of post-secondary educational degrees awarded to women rose from just over half a million in the 1969-1970 academic year to nearly 1.7 million in 2004-2005. Although the number of degrees earned by men has also increased, the rate of growth among women has been much faster; therefore, the proportion of degrees earned by women has risen dramatically. In 1969-1970, men earned a majority of every type of post-secondary degree, while in 2004-2005, women earned more than half of all associate's, bachelor's, and master's degrees and nearly half of all first professional and doctoral degr ees. The most significant increase has been in the proportion of first professional degree earners who are women, which jumped from 5.3 percent in 1969-1970 to 49.8 percent in 2004-2005. In 2004-2005, the total number of women earning their first professional degree (43,440) was 23 times greater than in 1969-1970 (1,841). Although sex disparities in education have almost disappear ed, there is still a disparity among instructional staff in degree-granting institutions. In fall 2005, only 40.6 percent of full-time instructional faculty were women. While women accounted for more than half of all full-time instructors and lecturers, they made up only 25.1 per cent of professors and less than 39 percent of associate professors. Among female instructors, a significant racial and ethnic disparity exists as w ell: 78.1 percent of all female instructional staff were non-Hispanic White. This disparity is even more pronounced among higher-level staff, such as professors, where non-Hispanic White women composed 86.8 percent of full-time female staff, compared to 4.7 percent for non-Hispanic Black women and 2.6 percent for Hispanic women (data not shown).

This represents a 37 percent increase from the 43.3 percent of women who were in the labor for ce in 1970.4 In 2006, females accounted for 46.5 percent of workers, while males accounted for 53.5 per cent. The representation of females in the labor force v aries greatly by occupational sector. In 2006, women accounted for 63.1 percent of sales and office workers, but only 3.5 percent of construc\u00adtion, extraction, maintenance, and repair workers. O ther positions which were more commonly held by women than men included service jobs (56.5 percent) and management, professional, and r elated jobs (51.1 percent). Women were the minority in production, transportation, and material moving (23.2 percent); farming, fishing, and forestry (20.3 percent); and in the military (14.6 percent). In 2006, a total of 165,231 women w ere on active duty in the armed services. Women are disproportionately represented among lo wer-income workers. Among workers aged 16 and older, more than 55 percent of those earning less than $25,000 per year were women, while 69 percent of those earning more than $50,000 per y ear were men (data not shown). Annual earnings by women aged 16 and older v ary greatly by race and ethnicity. In 2006, 24.4 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander women earned more than $50,000, compared to 8.4 and 8.5 percent of Hispanic and American Indian/ Alaska Native women, respectively. The proportion of female workers earning less than $25,000 ranged from 68.2 percent of Hispanic women to 47.7 percent of Asian/Pacific Islanders. More than half of Black, non-Hispanic White, and American Indian/Alaska Native women earned less than $25,000.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 19 HEALTH STATUS Analysis of women's health status enables health professionals and policymakers to determine the impact of past and current health interventions and the need for new programs. T rends in health status help to identify new issues as they emerge. In this section, health status indicators related to morbidity , mortality, health behaviors, and maternal health are presented. New topics include chronic fatigue syndrome, eye health, digestive disorders, endocrine and metabolic disorders, occupational injury, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, intimate partner violence, urologic disorders, and maternal mortality, as well as a discussion of genetics and women's health. The data are displayed by sex, age, race and ethnicity, and income, where feasible. HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH BEHAVIORS WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 20 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Regular physical activity promotes health, psychological well-being, and a healthy body weight; enhances independent living; and improves one's quality of life. To reduce the risk of chronic disease, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2005, recommended that adults engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, above usual activity at work or home on most, or preferably all, days of the week. 1 For most people, greater health benefits can be obtained by engaging in more vigorous or longer periods of physical activity. The Healthy People 2010 objectives include increasing the percentage of adults participating in regular moderate or vigorous physical activity. 2 In 2006, only 10.3 percent of women reported participating in adequate physical activity (defined as engaging in moderate-intensity physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day on a minimum of 5 days per week or vigorous-intensity activity for at least 20 minutes per day for a minimum of 3 days per week). While there was little variation between women and men engaging in adequate physical activity, the percentage of women reporting regular physical activity varied by race/ethnicity, age, and income. In 2006, non-Hispanic White women were more likely than women of other races/ethnicities to report adequate physical activity (12.0 percent). Hispanic women were least likely to r eport adequate physical activity (5.7 percent). Among women in all income groups, rates of adequate physical activity peak during the ages of 25-44 y ears and decline as women grow older. In addition, among women in most age groups, those with higher income levels are more likely to engage in adequate physical activity. The women most likely to do so are those aged 25-44 years with incomes of 200 percent or more of poverty (19.2 percent), compared to 13.4 percent of women in the same age gr oup with incomes of 100-199 percent of poverty and 12.7 percent of women in the same age group with incomes less than 100 percent of poverty.

For most people, this means eating a daily assortment of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and beans, and low-fat or fat-free milk products while limiting added sugar, sodium, saturated and trans fats, and cholesterol. 1 Some fats, mostly those that come from sources of polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fatty acids, such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oils, are an important part of a healthy diet. However, high intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol may increase the risk of coronary heart disease.

Salt, or sodium chloride, also plays an impor tant role in heart health, as high salt intake can contribute to high blood pressure. In 2003-2004, nearly 70 percent of women exceeded the recommended maximum intake of less than 2,300 mg/day of sodium, or about 1 teaspoon of salt (data not shown). Calcium is important for strengthening bones and teeth, and inadequate calcium consumption can lead to lo wer bone density, bone loss, and increased risk of osteoporosis. The recommended intake of calcium is 1,000 mg/day for women aged 19-50 and 1,200 mg/day for women aged 51 y ears and older. In 2003-2004, 20.2 percent of women met or exceeded the recommended daily intake. Folate is also an important part of a healthy diet, especially among women of childbearing age, since it can help reduce the risk of neural tube defects early in pregnancy. In 2003-2004, fewer than 30 percent of women consumed the recommended daily intake of folate (400 g/day). Fewer than 20 percent of non-Hispanic Black women consumed the recommended amount of folate, compared to more than 30 percent each of non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), alcohol is a central nervous system depressant that, in small amounts, can have a relaxing effect. Although there is some debate over the health benefits of small amounts of alcohol consumed regularly, the negative health effects of excessive alcohol use and abuse are well established. 3 Short-term effects can include increased risk of motor vehicle injuries, falls, domestic violence, and child abuse.

Cigarette smoke contains toxic ingredients that prevent red blood cells from carrying a full load of oxygen, impairs genes that control the growth of cells, and binds to the airways of smokers. This contributes to numerous chronic illnesses, including several types of cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, reduced bone density and fertility, and premature death. 4 In 2006, more than 61.5 million people in the United States aged 12 and older smoked cigarettes within the past month. Smoking was less common among females aged 12 and older (22.4 percent) than among males of the same age gr oup (27.8 percent). Cigarette use has declined over the past several decades among both sexes, though it has leveled off in recent years. In 1985, the rate among males was 43.4 percent while the rate among females was 34.5 percent. Among women, the rate of smoking varied by race and ethnicity in 2006. American I ndian/ Alaska Native women were most likely to have smoked cigarettes in the past month (39.1 percent), followed by non-Hispanic White women (24.9 percent). Asian/Pacific Islander women were least likely to have smoked cigarettes (9.7 percent). Quitting smoking has major and immediate health benefits, including r educing the risk of diseases caused by smoking and improving overall health. 3 In 2006, nearly 46 percent of female smokers aged 18 and older reported trying to quit at least once in the past year; however, this varied by age. Women aged 18-44 were most likely to have attempted quitting (49.3 percent), followed by women aged 45-64 years (44.3 percent). Fewer than 30 percent of female smokers aged 65 years and older attempted to quit smoking in 2006 (data not shown). 5 Research indicates that smoking cessation programs, including be\u00adhavioral therapy, telephone support, and pharmacotherapy, may increase the likelihood of quitting smoking, 6 although participation rates in such programs are unknown.

In 2006, nearly 12.6 million women aged 18 years and older reported using an illicit drug within the past year; this represents 11.0 percent of women. In compari\u00adson, 18.2 million men, representing 17.1 percent of the adult male population, used at least one illicit drug in the past year. Past-year illicit drug use was significantly higher among women aged 18-25 y ears than among women 26 years and older (30.3 versus 7.8 percent). Among adoles\u00adcent females aged 12-17 years, 19.7 percent used at least one illicit drug in the past year. In 2006, marijuana was the most commonly used illicit dr ug among females in each age group, followed by the non-medical use of prescription-type psychotherapeutic drugs. Short-term effects of marijuana use can include difficulty thinking and solving problems, memory and learning problems, and distorted perception. Prescription drugs commonly used or abused for non-medical purposes include opioids, central nervous system depr essants, and stimulants. Long-term use of these drugs can lead to physical dependence and addiction. In addition, when taken in large doses, stimulant use can lead to compulsivity, paranoia, dangerously high body temperature, and an irregular heartbeat. 7 Use of all drug types, except inhalants, was highest among females aged 18-25 years, with 24.2 percent reporting past-year marijuana use and 13.9 per cent reporting non-medical use of prescription-type psychotherapeutic drugs. Use of inhalants in the past-year was highest among females aged 12-17 (4.7 percent), compared to 1.2 percent of those aged 18-25 and 0.1 percent of those aged 26 years and older.

Of these deaths, nearly half were attributable to heart disease and malignant neoplasms (cancer), responsible for 26.5 and 21.7 percent of deaths, respectively. The next two leading causes of death were cerebrovascular diseases (stroke), which accounted for 7.0 percent of deaths, followed by chronic lower respiratory disease, which accounted for 5.5 percent. Among both males and females under 44 years of age, unintentional injury was the leading cause of death (data not shown). Heart disease was the leading cause of death for women in almost ev ery racial and ethnic group; the exception was Asian/Pacific Islander females, for whom the leading cause of death was cancer. One of the most noticeable differences in leading causes of death by race and ethnicity is that diabetes mellitus was the eighth leading cause of death among non-Hispanic White females, while it was the fourth among all other racial and ethnic groups. Similarly, chronic lower respiratory disease was the fourth leading cause of death among non-Hispanic White females while it ranked sixth or seventh among other racial and ethnic groups. Death in the perinatal period was the ninth leading cause of death among Hispanic females, and hypertension was the tenth leading cause among Asian/Pacific Islander females (data not shown). Also noteworthy is that American injur y (8.0 percent) and liver disease (4.0 percent; Indian/Alaska Native females experienced a seventh leading cause of death) than females of higher proportion of deaths due to unintentional other racial and ethnic groups.

In 2006, nearly 14 percent of adults reported having at least one condition that limited their ability to perform one or more of these common activities. Women were more likely to report being limited in their activities than men (15.0 versus 12.6 percent). The percentage of adults reporting at least one activity limitation v aried with age among both men and women. Only 6.0 percent of women aged 18-44 years reported any activity limitation, compared to nearly 27 percent of women aged 65-74 years and 45.0 percent of women aged 75 years or older. The percentage of women reporting that a vision or hearing pr oblem causes activity limita\u00ad tions also increased with age. Overall, 7.6 percent of women with a limitation reported a vision problem, and 3.7 percent reported that a hearing problem caused their activity limitation.

Arthritis was more common among women than men (24.4 versus 17.7 percent), and rates of arthritis increased dramatically with age for both sex es. Fewer than 10 percent of women aged 18-44 years had been diagnosed with arthritis, compared to 53.6 percent of women aged 65-74 years, and almost 55.2 percent of women aged 75 years and older. In 2006, the rate of arthritis among women v aried by race and ethnicity.

This disorder may be aggravated by allergens, tobacco smoke and other irritants, exercise, and infections of the respiratory tract. However, by taking certain precautions, persons with asthma may be able to effectively manage this disorder and participate in daily activities. In 2006, women had higher rates of asthma than men (89.3 per 1,000 women v ersus 55.7 per 1,000 men); this was true in every racial and ethnic gr oup. Among women, non-Hispanic Black women had the highest asthma rate (94.7 per 1,000 women), followed by non-Hispanic White women (92.0 per 1,000); Hispanic women had the lowest asthma rate (73.8 per 1,000). A visit to the emergency room due to asthma may be an indication that the asthma is not effectiv ely controlled or treated. In 2006, asthmatic women with family incomes below poverty were more likely than women with higher family incomes to have an emergency room visit due to asthma. Among women with family incomes less than 100 per cent of poverty, 35.9 percent of those with asthma had visited the emergency room in the past year, compared to 24.8 percent of asthmatic women with family incomes of 300 per cent or more of poverty. Consistent use of medication can reduce the use of hospital and emergency room care for people with asthma. 12 Adults Aged 18 and Older with Asthma, * by Race/Ethnicity and Sex, 2006 Source II.1: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health Interview Survey Women Aged 18 and Older with an Emergency Room Visit Due to Asthma in the Past Year, by Poverty Status, * 2006 Source II.1: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health Interview Survey Rate per 1,000 Adluts Percent of Women with Asthma 54.0 94.7 89.3 55.7 28.6 60.6 Male Female 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 73.8 76.9 65.9 92.0 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 25.7 35.9 19.0 22.1 24.8 30 20 Total Non-Hispanic Non-Hispanic Hispanic Non-Hispanic White Black Other Races** 10 Total Less Than 100% 100-199% 200-299% 300% or More of Poverty of Poverty of Poverty of Poverty *Reported that (1) a health professional has ever told them that they have asthma, and (2) they still have asthma.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 31 CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME While research indicates that any person may develop chronic fatigue syndrome, women are four times more likely to experience the disorder than men. Chronic fatigue syndrome is charac\u00adterized by extreme, sometimes disabling, fatigue that does not improve with bed rest and may be worsened by physical or mental activity. Since there are no known causes of chronic fatigue syndrome and no diagnostic laboratory tests to identify the disorder, researchers have set strict guidelines for diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome. Patients must have experienced severe chronic fatigue lasting 6 months or longer (with other known medical conditions excluded), and at least four of the following symptoms: impair\u00adment in short-term memory or concentration; sore throat; tender redness); headaches; unrefreshing sleep; and post\u00adexertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours. In addition, these symptoms must have occurred prior to the onset of the fatigue and have persisted during at least 6 months of illness. 13 While national population-based studies of chronic fatigue syndrome prevalence have not been conducted, research on the disorder has been underway for over 20 years. The CDC estimates that more than one million people in the United States are affected by chronic fatigue syndr ome, while millions more experience symptoms but do not meet the strict criteria described above. A recent study conducted in the State of Georgia estimated that approximately 2.5 percent of adults aged 18-59 years may have chronic fatigue syndrome. 14 Chronic fatigue syndrome is more common among people in their 40s and 50s than among other age gr oups.13 In addition, it appears that fewer than 20 percent of persons with chronic fatigue syndrome have ever received a diagnosis and treatment for the illness. 15 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 32 CANCER It is estimated that 692,000 new cancer cases will be diagnosed among females, and more than 271,000 females will die of cancer in 2008. Lung and bronchus cancer is expected to be the leading cause of cancer death among females with 71,030 deaths, accounting for 26 percent of all cancer deaths, followed by breast cancer, which will be responsible for 40,480, or 15 percent of deaths. Colon and rectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer will also be significant causes of cancer deaths among females. Due to the varying survival rates for different types of cancer , the most common causes of cancer death are not always the most common types of cancer. For instance, although lung and bronchus cancers cause the greatest number of deaths, breast cancer is more commonly diagnosed among women; there will be an estimated 182,460 new breast cancer cases in 2008 versus 100,330 lung and bronchus cancer cases. Other types of cancer that are commonly diagnosed among females but are not among the top 10 causes of cancer deaths include melanoma, thyroid cancer, cancer of the kidney and renal pelvis, and basal and sqamous cell skin cancer . Cervical cancer screenings are recommended at least ev ery 3 years beginning within 3 years of sexual activity or by age 21. In addition, a vaccination for genital human papillomavirus (the leading cause of cervical cancer) was approved for use by the FDA in 2006 and is recommended for adolescents and young women aged 9-26 years. 16 Cervical cancer rates increase with age and vary by race and ethnicity.

Black and H ispanic women aged 65 years and older were also more likely to be diagnosed with this type of cancer (25.8 and 24.9 per 100,000, respectively). Asian/Pacific Islander women aged 20-44 years were least likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer (5.9 per 100,000). Survival rates for ovarian cancer vary depending on ho w early it is discovered. For women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1996-2003, 45.0 percent could expect to live 5 years or more; ho wever, this varied by race and the stage of the cancer. More than 92 percent of women of all races with cancer localized in the ovaries could expect to live at least 5 years. Comparatively, 71.1 percent of White women and 49.8 percent of Black women could expect the same when cancer is in the regional stage (spread beyond the primar y site). Among women at the distant stage (spread to distant organs or lymph nodes), only 30.0 percent of White women and 22.5 percent of Black women could expect to liv e 5 more years.

Complications of diabetes are serious and may include blindness, kidney damage, heart disease, stroke, and nervous system disease. Diabetes is becoming increasingly common among children and young adults. The two main types of diabetes are Type 1 (insulin dependent) and Type 2 (non-insulin dependent). Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, and is commonly referred to as \"juvenile diabetes.\" Type 2 diabetes is more common; it is often diagnosed among adults but is becoming incr easingly common among children. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include obesity, physical inactivity, and a family history of the disease. In 2005-2006, 76.0 per 1,000 adults reported that they had been told b y a health professional that they have diabetes. Women were more likely than men to have diabetes overall (81.2 versus 70.4 per 1,000 adults) and in most racial and ethnic gr oups. Among women, non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics had higher rates of diabetes (117.6 and 111.8 per 1,000, respectively) than non-H ispanic Whites (69.4 per 1,000). Diabetes prevalence generally increases with age. I n 2005-2006, among women aged 45 and older, the highest rate of diabetes occurred among women aged 65-74 years (197.5 per 1,000 women). In other words, nearly one in five women in this age group have diabetes. Women aged 55-64 and 75 years and older also had relatively high rates of diabetes (155.5 and 153.4 per 1,000, respectively).

Measurements of overweight and obesity are based on Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a ratio of w eight to height. Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25.0-29.9, and obese is defined as a BMI of 30.0 or more; a BMI of 18.5-24.9 is considered normal, while a BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight. In the past decade, obesity among women has incr eased nearly 50 percent: in 1996, only 16.7 percent of women were obese, and obesity rates among women ranged from 10.7 percent in Colorado to 21.4 per cent in Louisiana.

HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 36 HEART DISEASE AND STROKE In 2005, heart disease was the leading cause of death among women. Heart disease describes any disorder that prevents the heart from functioning normally. The most common type of heart disease is coronary heart disease, in which the arteries of the heart slowly narrow, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. Risk factors include obesity, lack of physical activity, smoking, high cholesterol, hypertension, and old age. While the most common symptom of a heart attack is chest pain or discomfort, women are more likely than men to have symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, and back or jaw pain. 18 Stroke is a type of heart disease that affects blood flow. Warning signs are sudden and can include facial, arm, or leg numbness, especially on one side of the body; sev ere headache; trouble walking; dizziness; a loss of balance or coordina\u00adtion; or trouble seeing in one or both eyes. 18 In 2006, adult women were slightly less likely than men to have ever been told by a health professional that they have a heart condition or heart disease (10.5 versus 11.4 percent). This varied by race and ethnicity. Among non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic other races, men were more likely than women to have heart disease. Among non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults, however, women were more likely than men to have heart disease. Among women, non-Hispanic Whites were most likely to have heart disease (11.9 percent), compared to 9.6 percent of non-Hispanic Blacks, 6.0 percent of Hispanics, and 4.7 percent of Asians. While hear t disease rates are highest among non- Hispanic White women, the death rate from heart disease is highest among non-Hispanic Black women. Hospital discharges due to heart disease varied b y sex and age. Overall, men experienced a higher rate of hospital discharges compared to women (206.0 versus 174.8 hospital discharges per 10,000 adults). Rates of hospital discharge also incr eased with age; for instance, the hospital discharge rate for women aged 75 years and older was 905.5 per 10,000 women, compared to 119.8 hospital discharges per 10,000 women aged 45-64 y ears.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 37 HYPERTENSION Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a risk factor for a number of conditions, including heart disease and stroke. It is defined as a systolic pressure (during heartbeats) of 140 or higher, and/or a diastolic pressure (between heartbeats) of 90 or higher. A study in 2005-2006 tested adults' blood pressure and found that men had higher overall rates of hypertension than women (165.8 versus 152.7 per 1,000 population). Rates of hypertension among women varied significantly b y race and ethnicity. For instance, rates of hypertension were highest among non-Hispanic Black women (179.2 per 1,000 women) and non-H ispanic White women (157.0 per 1,000). The rates of hypertension among Hispanic women and non-Hispanic women of other races were fewer than 120 per 1,000 women. Rates of hypertension increase substantially with age and ar e highest among those aged 75 years and older, which demonstrates the chronic nature of the disease. Nearly 25 per 1,000 women aged 18-44 years had hypertension in 2005- 2006, compared to 374.7 per 1,000 women aged 65-74 years and 462.7 per 1,000 women aged 75 years and older. Nearly 200 per 1,000 women aged 45-64 years had hypertension (data not sho wn). Among adults aged 45 years and older, 16.3 per cent of women and 15.2 percent of men who were found to have hypertension had never been told by a health professional that they have hypertension, or were undiagnosed at the time of the examination.

Regular dental care is particularly important for women because there is some evidence of an association between periodontal disease and certain birth outcomes, such as increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. 19 To prevent caries (tooth decay) and periodontal (gum) disease, the American Dental Association recommends maintaining a healthy diet with plenty of water, and limiting eating and drinking between meals. 20 Other important preventive measures include daily brushing and flossing, regular dental cleanings to remove plaque, and checkups to examine for caries or other potential pr oblems.21 In 2003-2004, women were less likely than men to have untreated dental caries (23.9 versus 30.5 percent). Among women, non-Hispanic Black and H ispanic women were most likely to have untreated caries. Sealants\u2014a hard, clear substance applied to the surfaces of teeth\u2014 may help to prevent caries, but only 21.2 percent of women had sealants. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women were the least likely to have sealants (7.7 and 11.4 percent, respectively). The presence of untreated caries also varied by po verty status. Women with household incomes below 200 percent of the poverty level were more than twice as likely as women with higher incomes to hav e untreated dental caries (36.8 versus 15.6 percent, respectively; data not shown). Poverty status may also influence how often women see a dentist. I n 2003-2004, women with incomes of 100-199 percent of the poverty level were least likely to have seen a dentist in the past year (44.9 percent), followed by women with incomes of less than 100 percent of the poverty level (51.4 percent). In comparison, nearly 75 percent of women with incomes of 300 percent or more of poverty had seen a dentist in the past year.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 39 EYE HEALTH Vision is important to maintaining independ\u00ad ence and quality of life throughout a woman's life. A number of eye conditions and diseases dispro\u00adportionately affect older women, including glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration. Glaucoma can damage the optic nerve and result in vision loss or blindness. 22 It is estimated to affect 5.6 percent of adults over 40 years of age, but this varies by sex, age, and race and ethnicity. Among adults aged 65-74 years, men were slightly more likely than females to have glaucoma (11.6 versus 9.2 percent), while among adults aged 75 and older, glaucoma was more common in women than men (16.7 versus 13.4 percent). Among women, non-Hispanic Black Glaucoma Among Adults * Aged 40 and Older, by Age and Sex, 2005-2006 Source I.4: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey women were most likely to have had glaucoma (9.4 percent), compared to non-Hispanic White and H ispanic women (5.7 and 2.0 percent, respectively; data not shown). A cataract occurs when protein builds up in the lens and causes clouding. S urgery to replace the lens has proven to be an effective treatment for cataracts when blurring becomes severe enough to limit vision. 22 In 2005-2006, among adults aged 65 years and older, 35.8 percent of women and 25.7 percent of men reported ever having had cataract surgery. Older adults were more likely to have had the surgery; 57.3 percent of women aged 75 years and older had the surgery compared to 17.4 percent of women aged 65-74 years. Macular degeneration is a disease that affects the macula (which allo ws one to see in fine detail) usually resulting in partial vision loss. While there is no known cure for macular degeneration, early detection and treatment can slow its effects. 22 In 2005-2006, 4.3 percent of women aged 40 years and older reported having been told by a health professional that they have macular degeneration. This disease was more common among older women. Fewer than 2 percent of women aged 40-64 years had macular degeneration compared to 3.8 and 16.9 percent of women aged 65-74 and 75 years and older, respectively (data not shown).

An estimated 10 million Americans now have osteoporosis, while another 34 million have low bone mass and are at risk for developing osteoporosis; 80 percent of them are women. Each year more than 1.5 million people suffer a bone fracture related to osteoporosis, with the most common breaks in the wrist, spine, and hip. Fractures can have devastating consequences. For example, hip fractures are associated with an increased risk of mortality, and nearly 1 in 5 hip fracture patients ends up in a nursing home within a y ear. Direct care for osteoporotic fractures costs $18 billion yearly.23 In 2003-2004, women aged 18 years and older were more likely than men to report having been told by a health professional that they have osteoporosis (10.0 versus 1.7 percent, respec\u00adtively.) The rate of osteoporosis among women varied significantly with race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic White women were most likely to have osteoporosis (12.6 percent), compared to 3.2 percent of non-Hispanic Black women and 3.5 percent of Hispanic women. In 2005 there were 215,000 hospital discharges due to hip fractur es among women aged 18 and older, a rate of 18.8 per 10,000 women. Rates of hospital discharges due to hip fractur es varied by age. Women aged 75 and older had 149.4 discharges per 10,000 women, compared to 29.6 discharges per 10,000 women aged 65-74 years. Osteoporosis may be prevented and treated by getting the r ecommended amounts of calcium, vitamin D, and regular weight-bearing physical activity (i.e. walking), and by taking prescription medication when appropriate. Bone density tests are recommended for women over 65 years and for any man or woman who suffers a fracture after age 50. T reatment for osteoporosis has been shown to reduce the risk of subsequent fractures by 30-65 percent. 23 Women Aged 18 and Older with Osteoporosis, by Race/Ethnicity, * 2003-2004 Source II.2: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Hospital Discharges Due to Hip Fractures * Among Adults Aged 18 and Older, by Age and Sex, 2005 Source II.10: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Hospital Discharge Survey 160 12.6 3.2 10.1 3.5 Total Non-Hispanic White Non-Hispanic Black Hispanic 8.0 1.8 18.8 1.9 29.6 16.8 149.4 77.9 Female Male 140 120 100Rate per 10,000 Adults 80 60Percent of Women 40 20 Total 18-64 Y ears 65-74 Years 75 Years and Older *The sample of Asian/Pacific Islanders, Native American/Alaska Natives, persons of more than one race, and persons of other races not specified was too small to produce reliable results. *First-listed diagnosis of hip fracture (ICD-9CM code: 820). 5 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 41 DIGESTIVE DISORDERS Digestive disorders, or gastrointestinal diseases, include a number of conditions that affect the digestive system, hemorrhoids; irritable bowel syndrome; ulcers; gallstones; celiac disease (a genetic disorder in which consumption of gluten damages the intestines); and inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease (which causes ulcers to form in the gastrointestinal tract). Digestive disorders are estimated to affect 60-70 million people in the United States. 24 While recent data are not readily available on the prevalence of many of these diseases by race and ethnicity or sex, it is estimated that 8.5 million people in the United States are affected by hemorrhoids each year; 2.1 million people are affected by irritable bowel syndrome; and gallstones affect 20.5 million people. 24 Peptic ulcers are most commonly caused by a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). H. pylori weakens the mucous coating of the stomach and duodenum, allo wing acids to irritate the sensitive lining beneath. In 2006, 7.0 percent of adults reported that they had ever been told by a health professional that they have an ulcer. This did not vary by sex, but did vary by age. Among women, those aged 65 years and older were most likely to have reported ever having had an ulcer (9.8 percent), followed by women aged 45-64 years (8.7 percent). Fewer than 4 percent of women aged 18-24 and 25-34 y ears had ever had an ulcer. Among adults who have ever had an ulcer, 19.5 percent of men and 27.9 percent of women reported that they had an ulcer in the past year (data not shown). There was little variation among women r eporting having ever had an ulcer by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic White women were most likely to report having had an ulcer (7.7 percent), followed by non-Hispanic Black women (6.2 percent), and Hispanic women (5.8 percent). Women of other races, including Asian/P acific Islanders, American Indian/Alaska Natives, and women of multiple races, were least likely to report ever having had an ulcer (3.3 percent; data not shown). According to the CDC, digestive system symptoms accounted for 33.3 million visits to doctor 's offices and 3.6 million visits to hospital outpatient departments in 2005. In addition, 15.7 million visits to emergency departments w ere attributed to a digestive system diagnosis that year (data not shown).25 Women Aged 18 and Older Who Have Ever Had an Ulcer, * by Age, 2006 Source II.1: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health Interview Survey Percent of Women *Reported a health professional has ever told them they have an ulcer. 3.9 7.1 3.3 8.7 6.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 65 Years and Older 45-64 Years 35-44 Years 25-34 Years 18-24 Years Total 9.8 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 42 ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC DISORDERS Endocrine disorders involve the body's over- or under-production of certain hormones, while metabolic disorders affect the body's ability to process certain nutrients and vitamins. Endocrine disorders include hyperthyroidism and hypothy\u00adroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, diseases the parathyroid of the adrenal glands (including Cushing's syndrome and Addison's disease), and ovarian dysfunction (including polycystic ovarian syndrome), among others. Some examples of metabolic disorders include cystic fibrosis, Polycystic one of the most common endocrine disor ders among women of reproductive age. PCOS is the most common cause of endocrine-related female infertility in the United States. An estimated 1 in 10 women of childbearing age has PCOS, and it can occur in females as young as 11 years of age. In addition, PCOS may put women at risk for other health conditions, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. 26 Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are also common endocrine disorders. In 2005-2006, women were more likely than men to report having ever been told by a health professional that they have a thyroid problem (16.4 versus 3.4 percent). Among women, rates varied by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Whites were most likely to r eport a thyroid problem (18.5 percent), compared to non-Hispanic Blacks (10.7 percent), and Hispanics (9.2 percent). In 2005, the rate of physician visits due to endocrine and metabolic disor ders varied by sex. Nearly 4 per 100 physician visits made by men were for a disorder of an endocrine gland other than the thyroid gland, compared to 3.1 per 100 visits made by women. Similarly, 2.9 per 100 visits made by men were due to a metabolic disorder, versus 2.0 per 100 visits among women. Women, however, had twice the rate of visits due to disorders of the thyroid gland than men (1.5 versus 0.7 per 100 visits).

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 43 GENETICS AND WOMEN'S HEALTH Genes may play a role in the risk of many of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among women, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The most reliable way to identify those at risk for an inherited susceptibil\u00adity to chronic disease is through their family health histories. Breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women over their lifetime, and colon cancer affects 1 in 15 women. A pproximately 10 percent of breast, ovarian, and colon cancer cases are due to inherited mutations in specific genes that can be passed down from either parent (mother or father) and greatly who had a heart attack before age 55 is a risk susceptibility to cancer .

HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 44 HIV/AIDS Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the final stage of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which destroys or disables the cells that are responsible for fighting infection. AIDS is diagnosed when HIV has weakened the immune system enough that the body has a difficult time fighting infections. 27 In 2006, there were an estimated 10,537 new AIDS cases reported among adolescent and adult females aged 13 and older, compared to 28,378 new cases among males of the same age group. In 2006, high-risk heterosexual contact (includ\u00ad ing sex with an injection dr ug user, sex with men who have sex with men, and sex with an HIV-infected person) accounted for 45.9 percent of new AIDS cases among adolescent and adult females, follo wed by injection drug use (17.3 percent). In 36.0 percent of cases, the transmis\u00adsion category was not reported or identified, and an additional 0.6 percent of cases were due to blood transfusions or receipt of blood com\u00adponents or tissue. High-risk heterosexual contact was the most often cited transmission category for AIDS cases, particularly among Hispanic females (49.0 percent) and Asian/Pacific Islander females (47.1 percent). Injection drug use accounted for 31.7 percent of new AIDS cases among American I ndian/Alaska Native females, and 27.9 percent of cases among non-Hispanic White females. In 2006, an estimated 131,195 adolescent and adult females w ere living with HIV/AIDS.28 Nearly 84,000 non-Hispanic Black females were living with HIV/AIDS in 2006, accounting for 63.9 percent of cases. Non-Hispanic White and H ispanic females accounted for 25,050 and 20,004 cases, respectively. HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects minori\u00ad ties. While being of a particular race or ethnicity does not increase the likelihood of contracting HIV, certain challenges exist for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic females putting them at greater risk for infection: socioeconomic factors such as limited access to quality health care; language and cultural barriers, particularly for Hispanics, which can affect the quality of health care; high rates of STIs, which increase the risk of HIV infection; and substance abuse. 29 Reported New AIDS Cases Among Adolescent and Adult Adolescent and Adult Females Living with HIV/AIDS, * Females, by Race/Ethnicity and Transmission Category, 2006 * by Race/Ethnicity, 2006 Source II.13: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report Source II.13: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report Total Non-Hispanic White Non-Hispanic Black 17.3 7.7 31.7 27.9 14.6 17.7 Injection Drug Use 45.9 47.1 36.6 42.0 46.0 49.0 High-Risk Heterosexual Contact Other** 36.7 thousands)140 131,195 120 100 25,050 Total** 83,809 80 30 5 578 25 20,004Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander 20 15 10American Indian/ Alaska Native 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Non-Hispanic Non-Hispanic Hispanic Asian/ American Indian/ White Black Pacific Islander Alaska NativePercent of New AIDS Cases Reported *Includes persons with a diagnosis of HIV infection (not AIDS), a diagnosis of HIV infection and a later diag\u00ad *Percentages may not add to 100 percent due to rounding. **\"Other\" includes risk factors not reported or nosis of AIDS, or concurrent diagnoses of HIV infection and AIDS, in 33 States.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 45 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS Reported rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among females vary by a number of factors, including age and race/ethnic\u00adity. Rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are highest among adolescents and young adults. In 2006, there were 2,862.7 reported cases of chlamydia and 647.9 cases of gonorrhea per 100,000 females aged 15-19 years, compared to 25.6 and 12.9 reported cases, respectively, per 100,000 females aged 45-54 y ears. Syphilis was also most common among young women, occurring at a rate of 2.9 per 100,000 females aged 20-24 years; 2.5 per 100,000 females aged 25-29 y ears, and 2.3 per 100,000 females aged 15-19 years (data not shown). Although these STIs are treatable with antibi\u00ad otics, they can hav e serious health consequences. Active infections can increase the likelihood of contracting another STI, such as HIV, and untreated STIs can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Another STI, genital human papillomavirus (HPV ), has been estimated to affect at least 50 percent of the sexually active population at some point in their lives. 16 In 2003-2004, 27.5 percent of females aged 18-59 years were found to have HPV . This varied by race and ethnicity. Non- Hispanic Black women were most likely to have HPV (39.6 percent), compared to non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women (25.0 and 28.3 percent, respectively). There are many different types of HPV, and some, which are referred to as \"high-risk,\" can cause cancer. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine that protects women from four strains of HPV that can be the source of cervical cancer, precancerous lesions, and genital warts. 16 Since 2006, 10 percent of women aged 18-26 years have received this vaccine. 30 Rates of Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Among Females Aged 15-54, by Age, 2006 Source II.14: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Sexually T ransmitted Disease Surveillance Genital Human Pappillomavirus (HPV) Infection Among Women Aged 18-59, by Race/Ethnicity, * 2003-2004 Source II.2: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 39.6 28.3 27.5 25.0Percent of Women Rate per 100,000 Females 2,797.0 605.7 2,862.7 647.9 Gonorrhea1,141.2 Chlamydia 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 294.9 415.7 125.5 174.2 65.7 60.0 Years 35-39 Years 40-44 Years 45-54 Years Total Non-Hispanic White Non-Hispanic Black Hispanic *The sample of Asian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/Alaska Natives, persons of multiple races, and persons of other races unspecified was too small to produce reliable results.

This can occur through education, engineering and design of safety products, enactment and enforcement of policies and laws, economic incentives, and improvements in emergency care. Some examples include the design, oversight, and use of child safety seats and seatbelts, workplace regulations regarding safety practices, and tax incentives for fitting home pools with fences. In 2006, unintentional falls were the leading cause of nonfatal injur y among women of every age group, and rates generally increased with age. Women aged 65 years and older had the highest rate of injur y due to unintentional falls (59.7 per 1,000 women), while slightly more than 19 per 1,000 women aged 18-34 and 35-44 years experienced fall-related injuries. Unintentional injuries sustained as motor vehicle occupants were the second leading cause of injury among 18- to 34-year-olds (18.7 per 1,000), while unintentional overexertion was the second leading cause of injury among women aged 35-44 and 45-64 years (13.7 and 9.3 per 1,000, respectively).

More than 36 percent of males with occupational injuries were aged 20-34 years, compared to 29.7 percent of females in the same age group. In comparison, nearly 16 percent of injuries among females occurred among women aged 55 y ears and older, while males of this age group accounted for 12.2 percent of injuries. The distribution of nonfatal occupational injuries b y sex varies by occupational sector. In 2006, females accounted for 66.7 percent of injuries occurring in management, professional, and related occupations, despite making up only 51.1 percent of the workforce in that sector. S imilarly, females represented 56.5 percent of the service workforce, but accounted for 61.9 percent of injuries in that sector. Conversely, males were somewhat overrepresented in injuries to sales and office wor kers; males made up 36.9 percent of that workforce, but accounted for 40.9 percent of injuries in that sector. Injuries occurring among males and females in the farming, fishing, and forestry sector, as well as the construction, extrac\u00adtion, and maintenance sector were approximately proportionate to their workforce representation.

HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 48 ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral, or psychiatric, disorder that commonly appears in childhood and often persists into adulthood. ADHD is characterized by chronic inattention and/or impulsive hyperactivity severe enough to interfere with daily functioning. While professionals began to use the term \"attention deficit disorder\" to describe these characteristics in the 1970s, the causes of the disorder are still unknown. It is estimated that as many as half of those with ADHD have other mental disorders, making it more difficult to diagnose and presenting more challenges for those affected. 31,32 The best estimate of ADHD prevalence among adults is from a 2001-2003 study which found that 3.2 percent of women and 5.4 percent of men had ADHD. 33 Symptoms of ADHD in adulthood can include distractibility, disorganiza\u00adtion, forgetfulness, procrastination, chronic boredom, chronic lateness, and employment problems. 34 Anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, mood swings, and restlessness are other symptoms that may easily mask ADHD, making it more likely that affected individuals will be diagnosed with depression. Many women with ADHD may also feel disorganized, overwhelmed, ashamed, inadequate, and out of control. 32 Adults with ADHD may face particular problems in the workplace, finding time manage\u00adment, problem solving, and environmental distractions extremely challenging. An estimated 35 days of work are lost annually among adults with ADHD due to their condition. 33 While there is no cure for ADHD, diagnosing the disorder in adults has many benefits. Interventions and treatment can improve work performance and skills and educational achieve\u00adment, as well as self-esteem. T reatments may include patient and family education, educational or employment accommodations, medication, and counseling. While medications are often used to help individuals manage their symptoms, those with resulting social problems may choose to work with a therapist or coach to set goals to learn and apply new social skills. In addition, some adults with ADHD may choose to work with a career counselor to address workplace issues that arise as a result of their condition. Common Adulthood Symptoms of ADHD Source II.18: Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, National Resource Center on ADHD Poor attention; excessive distractibility Physical restlessness or hyperactivity Excessive forgetfulness Excessive impulsivity; saying or doing things without thinking Excessive and chronic procrastination Difficulty getting started on tasks Difficulty completing tasks Frequently losing things Poor organization, planning, and time management skills WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 49 MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUICIDE Mental illness affects both sexes, although many types of mental disorders are more prevalent among women. 35 For instance, in 2006, 13.5 percent of women and 8.7 percent of men had experienced serious psychological distress in the past year. Similarly, 8.7 percent of women experi\u00adenced a major depressive episode, compared to 5.2 percent of men.

American Indian/Alaska Native and non-Hispanic White women had the highest suicide rates (7.0 and 6.9 per 100,000, respectively).

Intimate partners include current or former spouses, boyfriends, or girlfriends. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, which estimates victimization rates based on household and individual surveys, 4.2 per 1,000 females aged 12 and older were victims of nonfatal IPV between 2001 and 2005; this rate represents 21.5 percent of all nonfatal violent victimizations committed against females, which include rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault. Additionally, between 1976 and 2005, intimate partners committed 30.1 percent of homicides against females. IPV varies with a number of factors including age, race/ ethnicity , income, and marital status. In 2001-2005, women aged 20-24 years had the highest rate of IPV (11.3 per 1,000), follo wed by women aged 25-34 years (8.1 per 1,000). Women aged 50-64 years and 12-15 years were least likely to have reported IPV (1.3 and 1.6 per 1,000, respectively). American Indian/Alaska Native females experi\u00ad enced the highest rate of intimate par tner victimization (11.1 per 1,000 females). The second highest rate occurred among Black females (5.0 per 1,000), while Asian females were least likely to be victims of IPV (1.4 per 1,000). During this same time period, females in households with annual incomes below $7,500 had the highest rate of intimate partner victim\u00adization (12.7 per 1,000), while those in households with annual incomes of $50,000 or mor e were least likely to have reported IPV (2.0 per 1,000; data not shown). IPV may have negative effects on the health and w ell-being of children whose mothers experience violence. Children whose mothers experience IPV are significantly more likely than other children to visit the emergency department 37 and three times more likely to receive mental health services after cessation of the violence. 38 In 2001-2005, children were present in 216,490 (35.2 percent) households experiencing IPV (data not sho wn).

Some examples include urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, sexually transmitted diseases, urolithiasis (kidney stones), and kidney and bladder cancer. Many of these disorders affect a large number of adult women; annual Medicaid expenditures for urinary incontinence and urinary tract infections among adult women total more than $234 million and $956 million, respectively. These same illnesses accounted for $39 million and $480 million in expenditures, respectively, for adult men. 39 Urinary incontinence is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States and is generally more common among women than men. 39 In 2005-2006, 38.4 percent of women and 11.7 percent of men aged 20 years and older reported that they had ever had urinary leakage. Among women, urinary leakage was most common among women aged 45-64 and 65 years and older (49.1 and 46.4 percent, respec\u00adtively), compared to 27.8 percent of women aged 20-44 years. In addition, 21.6 percent of women with urinary leakage reported that it affects their daily activities at least a little, compared to 14.5 percent of men (data not shown). Among women with urinary leakage, 38.7 per cent reported that it occurred less than once a month, while 28.3 percent reported occurrence a few times a month. Nearly 16 percent of those with urinary leakage reported that it occurred a fe w times a week and 17.2 percent experienced leakage every day and/or night. Urinary incontinence also varied by race and ethnicity . More than 40 percent of non-Hispanic White women reported urinary leakage, followed by 36.6 percent of Hispanic women. Non-Hispanic Black women were least likely to report any leakage (29.4 percent; data not shown). Among women with urinary leakage, the frequency of occurrence and effects on daily activities did not vary by race and ethnicity, indicating that the impact of the condition is universal.

HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 52 GYNECOLOGICAL AND REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS Gynecological disorders affect the internal and external organs in a woman's pelvic and abdomi\u00adnal areas and may affect a woman's fertility. These disorders include vulvodynia\u2014unexplained chronic discomfort or pain of the vulva\u2014and chronic pelvic pain\u2014a consistent and severe pain occurring mostly in the lower abdomen for at least 6 months. While the causes of vulvodynia are unknown, recent evidence suggests that it may occur in up to 16 percent of women, usually beginning before age 25, and that Hispanic women are at greater risk for this disorder. 40 Chronic pelvic pain may be symptomatic of an infection or indicate a problem with one of the organs in the pelvic area. 41 Reproductive disorders may affect a woman's ability to get pregnant. Examples of these disorders include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and uterine fibroids. PCOS occurs when immature follicles in the ovaries form together to create a large cyst, preventing mature eggs from being released. In most cases, the failure of the follicles to release the eggs results in a woman's inability to become pregnant. An estimated 1 in 10 women in the United States are affected by PCOS. 41 Endometriosis occurs when tissue resembling that of the uterine lining grows outside of the uterus. Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous tumors that gr ow underneath the lining, between the muscles, or on the outside of the uterus. In 2005-2006, 9.3 percent of women aged 20-54 y ears had endometriosis and 12.6 percent had uterine fibroids, but the prevalence of both disorders varied with age. Of women aged 20-54 years, endometriosis was most common among 35- to 44-year-olds (13.4 percent), while uterine fibroids were most common among 45- to 54\u00adyear-olds (25.6 percent). Women aged 20-34 years were least likely to have either disorder (4.2 and 3.4 percent, respectively). A hysterectomy\u2014abdominal surgery to remove the uter us\u2014is one option to treat certain conditions including chronic pelvic pain, uterine fibroids, and endometriosis when symptoms are severe. 41 In 2005-2006, nearly 40 percent of women aged 45-54 reported having had a hysterectomy, though it is not clear how many of these hysterectomies were to treat gynecological or reproductive disorders (data not shown).

The birth rate among Asian/Pacific Islanders was highest among 30- to 34-year-olds (116.5 per 1,000). The percentage of births with a cesarean deliv ery has been increasing steadily since 1996, while vaginal births after a previous cesarean (VBAC) have been decreasing. Among all births in 2005, more than 30 percent were delivered by cesarean, representing a 46 percent increase since 1996. Only 7.9 percent of women with a pr evious cesarean delivery had a vaginal birth in 2005, compared to a high of 28.3 percent in 1996, a decrease of 72 percent. This trend is maintained even when considering only low-risk women. 42 Additionally, induction of labor has increased substantially since 1990. Nearly 23 percent of singleton births were induced in 2005, which is nearly 2.5 times the percentage in 1990 (9.6 percent).

Diabetes, both chronic and gestational (developing only during pregnancy), may pose health risks to the mother and infant. Women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for developing diabetes later in life. 50 In 2005, diabetes during pregnancy occurred at a rate of 38.5 per 1,000 live births and was similar across all racial and ethnic groups (data not shown). Hypertension during pregnancy can also be either chr onic in nature or limited to the duration of pregnancy. Severe hypertension during pregnancy can result in preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, premature birth, placental abruption, and stillbirth. 51 Chronic hypertension was present in 10.4 per 1,000 live births in 2005. The rate of pregnancy-associated hypertension was even higher, occurring in 39.9 of every 1,000 live births. Other illnesses or risk factors during pregnancy can include eclampsia, which inv olves seizures (usually preceded by a diagnosis of preeclampsia), and cervical insufficiency, which occurs when the cervix opens or dilates before the fetus is full term. All of these conditions are more common among non-H ispanic Black than non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women, and among older mothers. Excessive or insufficient weight gain during pr egnancy can also influence birth outcomes. In 2005, 10.7 percent of infants born to mothers who gained less than 16 pounds were low birth weight, compared to 5.9 percent of infants born to women gaining 36 to 40 pounds.

The maternal mortality rate has declined dramat\u00adically since 1950 when the rate was 83.3 deaths per 100,000 live births; however, the maternal mortality rate in 2005 (15.1 per 100,000 live births) was 84 percent higher than the rate reported in 1990 (8.2 per 100,000). According to the National Center for Health Statistics, this increase may largely be due to changes in how pregnancy status is recorded on death certificates; beginning in 1999, the cause of death was coded accor ding to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Other methodological changes in reporting and data processing have been responsible for apparent increases in more recent years. 52 In 2005, there were a total of 623 maternal deaths. This does not include the 137 deaths of women due to complications during pregnancy or childbirth after 42 days postpartum or the deaths of pregnant women due to external causes such as unintentional injury, homicide, or suicide. In 2005, the maternal mortality rate among non-Hispanic Black women (39.2 per 100,000 live births) was more than 3 times the rate among non-H ispanic White women (11.7 per 100,000) and more than 4 times the rate among Hispanic women (9.6 per 100,000). The risk of maternal death increases with age for women of all races and ethnicities. I n 2005, the maternal mortality rate was highest among women aged 35 years and older (38.0 per 100,000 live births), compared to 7.4 per 100,000 live births to women under 20 years of age and 10.7 per 100,000 live births among women aged 20-24 years.

HEALTH STATUS - SPECIAL POPULATIONS WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 58 OLDER WOMEN In 2006, there were 37.2 million adults aged 65 and older in the United States, representing 12.4 percent of the total population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the older population is expected to gr ow to 72 million by 2030, representing approximately 20 percent of the population, due to the aging of the baby boom generation. In 2006, older women composed 7.2 percent of the total population while men accounted for 5.2 percent. Women represented a larger proportion of the elderly population than men within ev ery age group. More than 40 percent of women aged 65 or older w ere married and living with a spouse in 2006, while another 38.4 percent lived alone. Research has suggested that older adults who live alone are more likely to live in poverty, which has numerous health implications. Another 8.8 percent of older women were heads of their household (with no spouse present), while 8.6 percent were living with relatives. Employment plays a significant role in the lives of many older Americans. I n 2006, more than 2.2 million women aged 65 years and older were working, accounting for 10.3 percent of women in this age group. Nearly 18 percent of women aged 65-74 years were employed during 2006, while only 3.5 percent of women aged 75 and older were employed. Less than 0.5 percent of women aged 65 and older were unemployed and looking for work (data not shown).

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 HEALTH STATUS - SPECIAL POPULATIONS 59 RURAL AND URBAN WOMEN In 2005, more than 48 million people, or 16.6 percent of the population, lived in areas consid\u00ad ered to be non-metropolitan. The number of areas defined as metropolitan changes frequently as the population grows and people move. Residents of non-metropolitan areas tend to be older, complete fewer years of education, have public insurance or no health insurance, and live farther from health care resources than their metropolitan counterparts. In 2005, 22.5 percent of women in non- metr opolitan areas were aged 65 years and older, while only 17.2 percent of women in metropoli\u00adtan areas were in the same age group. Fewer than 26 percent of women in non-metropolitan areas were aged 18-34 years, compared to 30.6 percent in metropolitan areas. Women aged 35-54 years and 55-64 years accounted for approximately the same percentage of the female population in non-metropolitan and metropolitan areas. In 2004-2006, the percentage of women experiencing activity limitations due to a chr onic condition was higher in non-metropolitan areas (17.0 percent) than in metropolitan areas (13.4 per cent), regardless of age. For instance, 30.2 percent of women aged 65-74 years living in non-metropolitan areas had an activity limitation due to a chronic condition, compared to 25.0 percent of women of the same age group in metropolitan areas. As age increases, however, the discrepancy narrows; among women aged 85 years and older, 63.3 percent in non-metropolitan areas experienced an activity limitation, as did 61.9 percent in metropolitan areas.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 60 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION Availability of and access to quality health care services directly affects all aspects of women's health. For women who have poor health status, disabilities, poverty, lack of insurance, and limited access to a range of health services, preventive treatment and rehabilitation can be critical in preventing disease and improving quality of life. This section presents data on women's health services utilization, including data on women's insurance coverage, usual source of care, satisfac\u00adtion with care, use of medication, and use of various services, such as preventive care, HIV testing, hospitalization, and mental health services. The contribution of HRSA to women's health across the country is highlighted as well. 60 70 80 90 100 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 61 USUAL SOURCE OF CARE Women who have a usual source of care (a place they usually go when they are sick) are more likely to receive preventive care,1 to have access to care (as indicated by use of a physician or emergency department, or not delaying seeking care when needed), 2 to receive continuous care, and to have lower rates of hospitalization and lower health care costs. 3 In 2006, 89.1 percent of women reported having a usual source of care. Women of all racial and ethnic groups were more likely than men to have a usual source of care. Non-Hispanic Adults Aged 18 and Older with a Usual Source of Care, by Race/Ethnicity and Sex, 2006 * Source II.1: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health Interview Survey Female Male women of other races and non-Hispanic White women were most likely to report a usual source of care (92.1 and 91.6 percent, respectively). Among women, Hispanics were least likely to report a usual source of care (74.8 percent). In 2006, the percentage of women with a usual source of care varied by geographic region and poverty level. Among women with household incomes of 200 percent or more of poverty, there was little variation in having a usual source of care by geographic region. Among women with lower incomes, however, having a usual source of care varied significantly by geographic region. Women with incomes of less than 200 per cent of poverty in the South and West were least likely to have a usual source of care (77.3 and 80.0 percent, respectively), while low-income women in the Northeast were most likely to have a usual source of care (91.3 percent).

Medicare has four components: Part A covers hospital, skilled nursing, home health, and hospice care; Part B covers physician services, outpatient services, and durable medical equipment; Part C (Medicare Advantage Plans) allows beneficiaries to purchase additional insurance coverage through private insurers, and Part D allows coverage for prescription drugs through private insurers. In 2006, 55.8 percent of Medicare's 43.3 million enr ollees were female. As age increases the proportion of female enrollees increases while the proportion of male enrollees decreases. For instance, among Medicare enrollees under 45 years of age, 45.2 percent were female while 54.8 percent were male. Among adults aged 85 years and older, however, females accounted for 69.0 percent of enrollees, and males accounted for 31.0 percent. Of the 16.7 million enrollees in the Medicare P art D stand-alone prescription drug program in 2007, 61.5 percent were female. Females accounted for a larger proportion of Part D enrollees in every age group, excluding those under 55 y ears, in which 46.5 percent were female and 53.5 percent were male. Among enrollees aged 75-89 years, 68.8 percent, or 4.0 million, were women.

Among those who had at least one health care expense in 2005, the average per person expenditure, including expenses covered by insurance and those paid out-of-pocket, was higher for women ($5,211) than for men ($4,514). However, men's average expenditures exceeded women's for hospital inpatient services ($17,401 versus $12,556, respectively) and hospital outpatient ser vices ($2,440 versus $1,909). Women's expenditures exceeded men's in the categories of home health services, office-based medical services, and prescription drugs. Overall per capita health care expenditures have increased substantially and at about the same rate for both men and women since the 1990's.

Women represented two-thirds of users of mental health services, including inpatient and outpatient care and prescription medications. More than 16 million women reported using prescription medication for treatment of a mental or emotional condition, representing 14.2 percent of women aged 18 and older, compared to 7.2 percent of men. Outpatient treatment was reported by 8.4 percent of women, and inpatient treatment was reported by 0.7 percent of women. Mental health services were needed, but not r eceived, by an estimated 10 million adults in the United States. In 2006, 5.9 percent of women and 3.2 percent of men reported an unmet need for mental health treatment or counseling. Cost or lack of adequate insurance coverage was the most commonly reported reason for not receiv\u00ading needed services, reported by 50.1 percent of women and 43.7 percent of men with unmet mental health treatment needs. Others mentioned feeling that they could handle their problems without treatment (reported by 28.5 percent of women and 33.3 percent of men with unmet needs). In addition, stigma, including concern about confidentiality or the opinions of others, or the potential effect on employment, pr evented 20.4 percent of women and 29.6 percent of men with unmet needs from receiving treatment. Among women, unmet need for treatment v aried by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women were most likely to report an unmet need for treatment (8.2 percent), followed by non-Hispanic White women (6.4 per cent). Additionally, 4.7 percent of non-Hispanic Black women, and 4.1 percent of Hispanic women had an unmet need for treatment. Asian/Pacific Islander women were least likely to report an unmet need for mental health treatment (3.6 percent; data not shown).

HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2008 70 HIV TESTING Today, people aware of and receiving appropri\u00ad ate care for their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status may be able to live longer and healthier lives because of newly available, effective treatments. Testing for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is essential so that infected individuals can seek care and prevent the spread of HIV. HIV testing requires only a simple blood or saliva test, and it is often offered confidentially or anonymously. It is recommended that people who meet any of the following criteria be tested periodically for HIV: those who have injected drugs or steroids, or shared drug use equipment (such as needles); have had unprotected sex with men who hav e sex with men, anonymous partners, or multiple partners; have exchanged sex for drugs or money; have been diagnosed with hepatitis, tuberculosis, or a sexually transmitted infection; received a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985; or have had unprotected sex with anyone who meets any of these criteria. 13 In addition, the CDC recommends that all pregnant women be tested for HIV during their pregnancy. In 2006, new CDC guidelines were released that recommend all health care providers include HIV testing as part of their patients' routine health care. Counseling patients on ways to prevent HIV infection or spreading the virus is part of good primar y care practice. In 2006, nearly 36 percent of adults in the U nited States had ever been tested for HIV. Overall, women were more likely than men to have been tested (37.8 versus 33.7 percent). Women were more likely to have been tested at younger ages, while men were more likely to have been tested at older ages. Among women, in 2006, non-Hispanic Blacks w ere most likely to have ever been tested (53.7 percent), followed by Hispanics (46.1 percent), while non-Hispanic White women were least likely (33.5 percent).

In 2007, the sex distribution of organ donors was nearly even (6,939 males and 6,284 females), though 57.8 percent of organs donated by living people were from women, and 60.5 percent of organs from deceased donors were from men. Since 1988, there have been 419,520 transplants. The need for donated organs greatly exceeds their av ailability, so waiting lists for organs are growing. As of February 1, 2008, there were 97,686 people awaiting a life-saving organ transplant. Females accounted for 41.9 percent of those patients but made up only 36.8 percent of those who received a transplant in 2007. 14 Among women waiting for an organ transplant, 45.2 percent were White, 30.4 percent were Black, and 16.2 per cent were Hispanic. The kidney was in highest demand, with 31,323 females awaiting this organ as of February 1, 2008. The number of organs donated has increased significantly since 1988, fr om 5,909 to 14,756 at year's end 2006. In 2003, the donation community began to work together through the Organ Donation Breakthrough Collaborative and other grassroots efforts to increase donation. From 2003 to 2006, organ donation among deceased donors increased by an unprecedented 24.3 percent. One of the challenges of organ donation is obtaining consent from the donor's family or legal surr ogate. Consent rates may vary due to religious beliefs, poor communication between health care providers and grieving families, perceived inequities in the allocation system, and lack of knowledge of the wishes of the deceased. 15 The Organ Procurement and T ransplantation Network and the Scientific Registry of T ransplant Recipients are managed by HRSA's Healthcare Systems Bureau (HSB).

Indicators used to monitor women's health care in managed care plans include screening for chlamydia, screening for cervical cancer, and receipt of mammograms. In 2006, chlamydia screenings increased for women aged 21-25 y ears enrolled in commercial (private) health care plans or Medicaid. As in previous years, females with Medicaid coverage w ere more likely to have received a chlamydia screening in the previous year than those with private coverage (55.0 versus 38.0 percent, respec\u00adtively). Since 2000, the percentage of sexually active females screened for chlamydia has increased by nearly 84 percent among those in commercial plans and 45 percent among Medicaid enrollees. In 2006, receipt of mammograms for women aged 40-69 was appr oximately the same for women with private coverage and those covered through Medicaid (68.9 and 69.5 percent, respec\u00adtively). However, Medicare-enrolled women were considerably less likely to hav e received a mammogram at least once during the previous 2 years (49.1 percent). Cervical cancer screenings appear to be more accessible to women with commer cial coverage than to those covered by Medicaid. Cervical cancer screenings were received at least once every 3 years by nearly 81.0 percent of commercially-insured women and 65.7 percent of women covered by Medicaid.

In 2006, 40.7 percent of women were not satisfied with their experiences r elated to their health plans, which could include health plan customer service, understanding or finding information related to their plan, and completing or submitting paper work for the plan. This varied by race and ethnicity. Asian women were most likely to be dissatisfied (46.5 percent), followed by non-Hispanic White women (42.9 percent). Fewer than 35 percent of non-Hispanic Black women and 36.3 percent of Hispanic women were unsatisfied with their experiences related to their health plans. Satisfaction with how well doctors communi\u00ad cate also v aries by women's race and ethnicity. In 2006, Hispanic women (25.9 percent) and Asian women (24.0 percent) were more likely to be dissatisfied with how well their doctors communicate than women of other races. Fewer than 20 percent of non-Hispanic Black women and 15.7 percent of non-Hispanic White women w ere not satisfied with aspects of communication with their doctors. More than 36 percent of women were not satisfied with their experiences in getting the car e they need when they needed it, including seeing specialists; getting necessary care, tests or treatment; and delays in receiving care caused by waiting for health plan approval. The percentage of women reporting dissatisfaction was greatest among Asian women (47.1 percent). Nearly 40 percent of Hispanic women and 34 percent each of non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White women were also not satisfied with getting the care they needed (data not shown).

HRSA's Office of Women's Health (OWH) coordinates efforts that address women's health across their lifespan. The Bright Futures for Women's Health and Wellness Initiative provides materials on topics such as physical activity and healthy eating, emotional wellness, and maternal wellness. These tools, data books, and research reports can be found on the OWH Web site at www.hrsa.gov/womenshealth. The HRSA Web site, at www.hrsa.gov, provides information about HRSA 's bureaus and offices. HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), online at www.mchb.hrsa.gov, administers the MCH Block Grant, a Federal-State partnership to improve the health of mothers and children. Depression During and After Pregnancy: A Resource for Women, Their Partners, Family and Friends (2007) and The Business Case for Breastfeeding: Steps for Creating a Breastfeeding-Friendly Worksite are two new HRSA publications available for consumers. The Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr) pr ovides national leadership in the development, distribution, and retention of a culturally competent health workforce. In 2006, women r epresented 62 percent of those who received assistance from the Centers of Excellence and 71 percent of those involved with the Health Careers Opportunity Programs. The HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) addresses the needs of women living with HIV/AIDS thr ough the Ryan White Program including Part D, which targets services to women, infants, children, youth, and their families. HAB aims to improve access and retention in care through training and technical assistance programs, culturally competent border health initiatives, oral health care programs, and Special Projects of National Significance. The new Bureau of Clinician Recruitment and S ervices' (BCRS) mission is to improve the health of the Nation's underserved communities by coordinating recruitment and retention of health professionals to build integrated and sustainable systems of care. Clinicians participating in the National Health Service Corps program provide staffing support to Federally Qualified Health Centers. The Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) manages the H ealth Center Program, which funds a national network of 1,002 grantees at over 3,800 comprehensive, primary health care service delivery sites. Through community health centers, school-based centers, and other centers focused on migrant health, health care for the homeless, and public housing, the P rogram delivers preventive and primary care services to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Almost 40 percent of patients have no insurance coverage. Overall, the number of patients served has risen from 10.3 million in 2001 to an estimated 15 million in 2006.
