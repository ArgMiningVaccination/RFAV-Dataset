They want to work with doctors and take short-term steps, like medication, to improve annoying symptoms but never deal with unhealthy routines and lifestyle choices that created the illness in the first place. Alliance Integrative Medicine not only helps patients improve their overall wellness and health, but also give them the tools and coaching to successfully continue their journey for the rest of their lives.
