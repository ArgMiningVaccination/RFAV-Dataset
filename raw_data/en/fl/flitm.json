Please bring a mask when having indoor services - Zandrea AThe experience I had with kindred spirit Herbal Garden was beyond my expectation. I went there with the intention of receiving one specific product, sage. I felt low, depressed and my mind wasn't in the right place. From our initial interaction I felt like we were family. I was given so much insight, positivity, words of love and encouragement. I appreciate most about them is their honesty. I asked for an additional service that I heard about but wasn't to familiar with, she broke down the possible effects of it and told me to pray on it. That's when I knew she wanted the best for me and truly cared about my life's journey. thank you kindred spirit for your blessings, your prayers and love. Also for allowing me to feel heard and understood and for really taking care of me. I been in such a great space since our meeting. Looking forward to what's next.
