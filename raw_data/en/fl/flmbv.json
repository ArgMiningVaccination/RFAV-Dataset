ACTION : Final rule. SUMMARY : NASA has adopted as final, with changes, an interim rule to implement regulations for Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards. DATES : Effective: October 13, 2015. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Barbara Orlando, NASA, Office of Procurement, Contract and Grants Policy Division (Suite 5L34); (202) 358- 3911; email: barbara.j.orlando@nasa.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : I. Background An interim rule was published on 19 December, 2014 (79 FR 75872) implementing the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards. This part establishes policies and procedures for grants and cooperative agreements awarded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to non-Federal entities, commercial firms (when cost sharing is not required), and foreign organizations as allowed by 2 CFR 200.101 Applicability. The policies and procedures that recipients must follow are those appearing in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by 2 CFR part 1800. For the supplemental guidance, NASA has adopted section numbers that correspond to those in the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200. II. Discussion No public comments were received. However, upon internal review NASA identified some areas that needed changing and/or clarifying. The first group of changes were editorial changes to provide clarification. NASA added definitions to provide clarity to the various sections of this regulation. Notable definition changes occurred as follows: Referencing the term ''award'' when referring to both grant and cooperative agreement awards. Clarifying the roles of the Administrative Grant Officer, Grant Officer and NASA Technical Officer. And Including definitions of ''original signature'' and ''prescription.'' Language was added to 2 CFR 1800.306 clarifying that NASA may require matching funds on some research opportunities. A second group of changes was made to Appendix B, Terms and Conditions. The most substantive changes were 2 1800.900 was changed by adding clarification that State laws supersede the terms and conditions of a grant award; as required in the Presidential Memorandum on Preemption. 2 CFR 1800.906 was changed to assure compliance with laws regarding the use of appropriated funds. 2 CFR 1800.907 was changed to expand the exemption for prior approval to include any research grant not just those awarded through the Federal Demonstration Partnership. 2 CFR 1800.909 and 1800.923 were changed to remove references to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and remove those segments that apply to contracts, such as withholding payments, that are not applicable to assistance awards. 2 CFR 1800.918 was changed to clarify flow down requirements. 2 CFR 1800.924 was changed to reflect a new structure for reporting to the New Technology Officers. and 2 CFR 1800.925 Invention Reporting and Rights was eliminated since it duplicated parts 2 CFR 1800.902. All subsequent sections were renumbered to reflect the elimination of this section. NASA determined that the changes implemented with this revision will benefit the NASA financial assistance community by reducing administrative costs through clarifying ambiguous terms, reducing the reporting burden, and eliminating duplicative regulations. III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). E.O. 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of E.O. 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under 5 U.S.C. 804. V. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 104-13) does not apply because this final rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subjects in 2 CFR Part 1800 Federal financial assistance. Manuel Quinones, Federal Register Liaison. Accordingly, NASA adopts the interim rule published December 19, 2014, at 79 FR 75871, as final with the following revision of part 1800: PART 1800\u2014UNIFORM ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS, COST PRINCIPLES, AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL AWARDS Sec. 1800.1 Authority. 1800.2 Purpose. 1800.3 on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54702 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations Subpart A\u2014Acronyms and Definitions 1800.10 Acronyms. 1800.11 Definitions.

Appendix A to Part 1800\u2014 Certifications, Assurances, and Representations Appendix B to Part 1800\u2014Terms and Conditions Authority: 51 U.S.C. 20113 (e), Pub. L. 258, 96 1003 (31 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), and 2 CFR part 200. \u00a7 1800.1 Authority. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) awards grants and cooperative agreements under the authority of 51 U.S.C. 20113 (e), the National Aeronautics and Space Act. This part 1800 is issued under the authority of 51 U.S.C. 20113 (e), Pub. L. 97-258, 96 Stat. 1003 (31 et seq.), and 2 CFR part 200. \u00a7 1800.2 Purpose. This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by this part, as the NASA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards. It thereby gives regulatory effect for NASA to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part. \u00a7 1800.3 Applicability. (a) This part establishes policies and procedures for grants and cooperative agreements awarded by NASA to non- Federal entities, commercial firms (when cost sharing is not required), and foreign organizations as allowed by 2 CFR 200.101 Applicability. The policies and procedures that you must follow are those appearing in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by 2 CFR part 1800. For supplemental guidance, NASA has adopted section numbers that correspond to those in the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200. (b) Throughout this part, the term ''award'' refers to both ''grant'' and ''cooperative agreement'' unless otherwise indicated. (c) When commercial firms are required to provide cost sharing pursuant to 2 CFR 200.306, Cost Sharing, the regulations at 14 CFR part 1274 apply. (d)(1) In general, research with foreign organizations will not be conducted through grants or cooperative agreements, but instead will be accomplished on a no-exchange-of- funds basis. In these cases, NASA enters into agreements undertaking projects of international scientific collaboration. NASA policy on performing research with foreign organizations on a no- exchange-of-funds basis is set forth at NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) 1835.016-70. In rare instances, NASA may enter into an international agreement under which funds will be transferred to a foreign recipient. (2) Grants or cooperative agreements awarded to foreign organizations are made on an exceptional basis only. Awards require the prior approval of the Headquarters Office of International and Interagency Relations and the Headquarters Office of the General Counsel. Requests to issue awards to foreign organizations are to be coordinated through the Office of Procurement, Program Operations Division. \u00a7 1800.4 Amendment. This part will be amended by publication of changes in the Federal Register. Changes will be issued as final rules. \u00a7 1800.5 Publication.

ACTION : Final rule; delay of effective date. SUMMARY : On April 29, 2015, the Rural Housing Service (RHS) published a final rule to create a certified loan application packaging process for the direct single family housing loan program. On June 5, 2015, the final rule's effective date was deferred to October 1, 2015. The final rule's effective date is further delayed until October 1, 2016. DATES : Effective Date: The effective date of the final rule published April 29, 2015 (80 FR 23673), effective July 28, 2015, and delayed on June 5, 2015 (80 FR 31971), is further delayed until October 1, 2016. RHS will publish in the Federal Register another document changing the effective date if and when appropriations mandates impacting Fiscal Year 2016 do not reference the packaging pilot program.

Email: brooke.baumann@wdc.usda.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Section 729 of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Act) (Pub. L. 113-235) provides that the Agency will continue agreements with the current intermediaries in the pilot program and enter into additional agreements that increase the number of pilot intermediaries to at least 10. This appropriations mandate, which applies to the packaging pilot program in Fiscal Year 2015, prompted the Agency to defer the effective date of the final rule from July 28, 2015, to October 1, 2015, to allow the existing intermediaries under the pilot sufficient time to process loan application packages in their queue and to prepare for the implementation of the final rule. Since Section 729 will remain in effect during any continuing resolution passed to continue program operations in Fiscal Year 2016 and given that similar mandatory language regarding the packaging pilot program is currently found in the Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate, the final rule to create a certified loan application packaging process will be deferred again. In an abundance of caution, the Agency takes this action to avoid the possibility of duplicative and inconsistent policies for this important certified loan application packaging process. In the interim, existing pilot intermediaries will be contacted directly concerning extensions of their agreements. In addition, applications received from potential intermediaries under the final rule, which were due by July 9, 2015, will now be considered for inclusion in any Fiscal Year 2016 packaging pilot program.

Background On December 21, 2009, Korea Aerospace Industries, Ltd., applied for a type certificate for their new Model KC- 100 airplane. The KC-100 is a normal category single engine four passenger composite low wing airplane with a maximum takeoff weight of 3600 pounds. It has fixed tricycle landing gear and is designed for both Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations. The KC-100 will use an electronic engine control system (FADEC) instead of a traditional mechanical control system. The engine control system will be certificated as part of the engine; however, the installation of an engine with an electronic control system requires evaluation due to critical environmental effects and possible effects on or by other airplane electronic systems, shared engine and airplane data and power sources. The regulatory requirements in 14 CFR part 23 for evaluating the installation of complex systems, including electronic systems and critical environmental effects, are contained in \u00a7 23.1309. When \u00a7 23.1309 was developed, the use of electronic control systems for engines was not envisioned. Therefore, \u00a7 23.1309 requirements were not applicable to systems certificated as part of the engine (reference \u00a7 23.1309(f)(1)). Parts of the system that are not certificated with the engine could be evaluated using the criteria of \u00a7 23.1309. However, the integral nature of these systems makes it unfeasible to evaluate the airplane portion of the system without including the engine portion of the system. In some cases, the airplane that the engine is used in will require a higher classification than the engine controls are certificated for; requiring the FADEC system to be analyzed at a higher classification. As of November 2005, FADEC special conditions mandated the classification for \u00a7 23.1309 analyses for loss of FADEC control as catastrophic for any airplane using a FADEC. This is not to imply an engine failure is classified as catastrophic, but that the digital engine control must provide an equivalent reliability to mechanical engine controls. Type Certification Basis Under the provisions of 14 CFR 21.17, Korea Aerospace Industries, Ltd., must show that the KC-100 meets the applicable provisions of part 23, as amended by amendment 23-1 through 23-59, thereto. If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., 14 CFR part 23) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the KC-100 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of \u00a7 21.16. In addition to the applicable airworthiness regulations and special conditions, the KC-100 must comply with the fuel vent and exhaust emission requirements of 14 CFR part 34 and the noise certification requirements of 14 CFR part 36. The FAA must issue a finding of regulatory adequacy under \u00a7 611 of Public Law 92-574, the Noise Control Act of 1972. The FAA issues special conditions, as defined in \u00a7 11.19, under \u00a7 11.38 and they become part of the type certification basis under \u00a7 21.17(a)(2). Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of \u00a7 21.101(a)(1). Novel or Unusual Design Features The KC-100 will incorporate the following novel or unusual design features: an electronic engine control. Discussion The Model KC-100 makes use of an electronic engine control system instead of a traditional mechanical control system, which is considered a novel design for this type of airplane. The applicable airworthiness regulations do VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:06 Sep 10, on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54715 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. Maintaining a structured assessment to determine potential installation issues mitigates the concern that the addition of a full authority engine controller does not produce a failure condition not previously considered. Applicability The special conditions are applicable to the KC-100. Should Korea Aerospace Industries, Ltd., apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate to include another model incorporating the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to that model as well. Conclusion This action affects only certain novel or unusual design features on the KC- 100. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the applicant who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane. The substance of these special conditions has been subjected to the notice and comment period in several prior instances and has been derived without substantive change from those previously issued. It is unlikely that prior public comment would result in a significant change from the substance contained herein. Therefore, notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are unnecessary and the FAA finds good cause, in accordance with 5 U.S. Code \u00a7\u00a7 553(b)(3)(B) and 553(d)(3), making these special conditions effective upon issuance. The FAA is requesting comments to allow interested persons to submit views that may not have been submitted in response to the prior opportunities for comment described above. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 23 Aircraft, Aviation safety, Signs and symbols. Citation The authority citation for these special conditions is as follows: Authority: 49 14 CFR 11.38 and 11.19. The Special Conditions Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the following special conditions are issued as part of the type certification basis for Korea Aerospace Industries, Ltd., Model KC-100 airplanes. 1. Electronic Engine Control a. For electronic engine control system installations, it must be established that no single failure or malfunction or probable combinations of failures of Electronic Engine Control (EEC) system components will have an effect on the system, as installed in the airplane, that causes the Loss of Thrust Control (LOTC)/Loss of Power Control (LOPC) probability of the system to exceed those allowed in part 33 certification. b. EEC system installations must be evaluated for environmental and atmospheric conditions, including lightning. The EEC system lightning and high intensity radiated frequency effects that result during an LOTC/LOPC should be considered catastrophic. c. The components of the installation must be constructed, arranged, and installed so as to ensure their continued safe operation between normal inspections or overhauls. d. Functions incorporated into any EEC that make it part of any equipment, system or installation having functions beyond that of basic engine control, and may also introduce system failures and malfunctions, are not exempt from \u00a7 23.1309 and must be shown to meet part 23 levels of safety as derived from \u00a7 23.1309. Part 33 certification data, if applicable, may be used to show compliance with any part 23 requirements. If part 33 data is to be used to substantiate compliance with part 23 requirements, then the part 23 applicant must be able to provide this data for their showing of compliance. Note: The term ''probable'' in the context of ''probable combination of failures'' does not have the same meaning as in AC 23.13091D. The term ''probable'' in ''probable combination of failures'' means improbable,'' as referenced in AC 23.1309- 1D. Issued in Kansas City, Missouri on August 28, 2015.

ACTION : Final rule. SUMMARY : With the issuance of this final rule, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration removes [ 123I]ioflupane from the schedules of the Controlled Substances Act. This action is pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act which requires that such actions be made on the record after an opportunity for a hearing through formal rulemaking. Prior to the effective date of this rule, [ 123I]ioflupane was, by definition, a schedule II controlled substance because it is derived from cocaine via ecgonine, both of which are schedule II controlled substances. This action removes the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to controlled substances, including those specific to schedule II controlled substances, on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, dispense, conduct research, import, export, or conduct chemical analysis) or propose to handle [ 123I]ioflupane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Legal Authority The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) implements and enforces titles II and III of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, as amended. 21 U.S.C. 801-971. Titles II and III are referred to as the ''Controlled Substances Act'' and the ''Controlled Substances Import and Export Act,'' respectively, and are collectively referred to as the ''Controlled Substances Act'' or the ''CSA'' for the purpose of this action. The DEA publishes the implementing regulations for these statutes in title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), chapter II. VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:06 on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54716 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 1As discussed in a memorandum of understanding entered into by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the FDA acts as the lead agency within the HHS in carrying out the Secretary's scheduling responsibilities under the CSA, with the concurrence of NIDA. 50 FR 9518, Mar. 8, 1985. The Secretary of the HHS has delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Health of the HHS the authority to make domestic drug scheduling recommendations. 58 FR 35460, July 1, 1993. 2Letter from Karen B. DeSalvo, Acting Assistant Secretary for Health, HHS to John J. Riley, Acting Deputy Administrator, DEA (Aug. 19, 2015). The CSA and its implementing regulations are designed to prevent, detect, and eliminate the diversion of controlled substances and listed chemicals into the illicit market while ensuring an adequate supply is available for the legitimate medical, scientific, research, and industrial needs of the United States. Controlled substances have the potential for abuse and dependence and are controlled to protect the public health and safety. Under the CSA, each controlled substance is classified into one of five schedules based upon its potential for abuse, its currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and the degree of dependence the substance may cause. 21 U.S.C. 812. The initial schedules of controlled substances established by Congress are found at 21 U.S.C. 812(c), and the current list of scheduled substances is published at 21 CFR part 1308. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(2), the Attorney General may, by rule, ''remove any drug or other substance from the schedules if he finds that the drug or other substance does not meet the requirements for inclusion in any schedule.'' The Attorney General has delegated scheduling authority under 21 U.S.C. 811 to the Administrator of the DEA, 28 CFR 0.100. The CSA provides that proceedings for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of the scheduling of any drug or other substance may be initiated by the Attorney General (1) on her own motion, (2) at the request of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 1or (3) on the petition of any interested party. 21 U.S.C. 811(a). This action was initiated at the request of the Assistant Secretary for Health of the HHS, and is supported by, inter alia, a recommendation from the Assistant Secretary of the HHS and an evaluation of all relevant data by the DEA. This action removes the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to controlled substances, including those specific to schedule II controlled substances, on persons who handle or propose to handle [ 123I]ioflupane. Background [123I]Ioflupane is, by definition, a schedule II controlled substance because it is derived from cocaine, a schedule II substance, via ecgonine (a schedule II substance). See 21 U.S.C. 812(c), Schedule II, (a)(4). [ 123I]Ioflupane is the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in the drug product DaTscan and it is a new molecular entity. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the New Drug Application (NDA) for DaTscan on January 14, 2011, for the indication of visualizing striatal DATs in the brains of adult patients with suspected Parkinsonian syndromes (PS). DEA and HHS Eight Factor Analyses Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(b), (c), and (f), the HHS recommended to the DEA on November 2, 2010, that FDA- approved products containing [ 123I]ioflupane be removed from schedule II of the CSA. The HHS provided to DEA a scientific and medical evaluation document entitled ''Basis for the Recommendation to Remove FDA Approved Products Containing [ 123I]Ioflupane from Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).'' Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(b), this document contained an eight-factor analysis of FDA-approved products containing [ 123I]ioflupane, along with the HHS's recommendation to remove FDA-approved products containing [ 123I]ioflupane from the schedules of the CSA. The HHS later clarified to DEA that its November 2, 2010, recommendation also supports the decontrol of the substance [ 123I]ioflupane.2 In response, the DEA reviewed the scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation provided by the HHS, and all other relevant data. The DEA and HHS collaborated further regarding the available information. In a letter dated February 2, 2015, the HHS provided detailed responses to specific inquiries from the DEA (submitted by letter dated September 16, 2014). Upon further review of all of the available information, the DEA completed its own eight-factor review document on FDA- approved diagnostic products containing [ 123I]ioflupane (currently, only DaTscan) pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(c). The FDA-approved diagnostic product, DaTscan, was used as the basis for the scientific and medical evaluation of FDA-approved products containing [ 123I]ioflupane for both the HHS and DEA eight-factor analysis. Both the DEA and HHS analyses and other relevant documents are available in their entirety in the public docket of this rule (Docket Number DEA-415F) at http://www.regulations.gov under ''Supporting and Related Material.'' Determination To Decontrol [ 123I]ioflupane After a review of the available data, including the scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation, the Administrator of the DEA published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled ''Schedules of Controlled Substances: Removal of [ 123I]Ioflupane from Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act'' which proposed removal of [ 123I]ioflupane from the schedules of the CSA. 80 FR 31521, June 3, 2015. The proposed rule provided an opportunity for interested persons to file a request for a hearing in accordance with DEA regulations by July 6, 2015. No requests for such a hearing were received by the DEA. The NPRM also provided an opportunity for interested persons to submit written comments on the proposal on or before July 6, 2015. Comments Received The DEA received nine comments on the proposed rule to decontrol [ 123I]ioflupane. All commenters supported the decontrol of [ 123I]ioflupane. Commenters in support of decontrolling [123I]ioflupane included an international medical society for neurology; an association of industry members that manufacture radiopharmaceuticals; a professional organization representing radiologists, radiation oncologists, interventional radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and medical physicists; an advocacy group for the Parkinson's community; a trade association representing medical imaging, radiotherapy and radiopharmaceutical manufacturers; the sponsor of the drug product containing [ 123I]ioflupane; a physician; a health services company; and a private citizen, all of whom expressed support for the DEA's proposal to decontrol [ 123I]ioflupane. Some commenters also stated that the proposal would improve patient access to an important diagnostic pharmaceutical and reduce the burden on providers and nuclear pharmacies. The DEA appreciates the comments in support of this rulemaking. Effective Date of the Rule Generally, DEA scheduling actions are effective 30 days from the date of VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:06 Sep 10, on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54717 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. 21 CFR 1308.45; see also 5 U.S.C. 553(d). In this instance, and in accordance with 21 CFR 1308.45, the DEA finds that the conditions of public health or safety necessitate an earlier effective date, i.e., the date of publication in the Federal Register. An earlier effective date would allow specialized members of the healthcare community to readily utilize this substance as a component of an important diagnostic tool, DaTscan. DaTscan, which contains [ 123I]ioflupane, is used in differentiating essential tremors from tremors due to PS, (idiopathic Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy), and can help healthcare professionals provide more accurate diagnoses. This earlier effective date will allow patients to receive, without delay, important diagnostic testing that is critical to their health and treatment. These findings, coupled with the fact that this is an action for decontrol, indicate that conditions of public health necessitate an immediate effective date upon publication in the Federal Register. The DEA also notes that its decision to make this rule effective upon publication aligns with the exceptions to the 30-day effective date requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). One of the APA's exceptions to the 30-day effective date is for a substantive rule granting or recognizing an exemption or which relieves a restriction. 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). Scheduling Conclusion Based on consideration of all comments, the scientific and medical evaluation and accompanying recommendation and clarification from the HHS, and based on the DEA's consideration of its own eight-factor analysis, the Administrator finds that these facts and all relevant data demonstrate that [ 123I]ioflupane does not meet the requirements for inclusion in any schedule, and will be removed from control under the CSA. Regulatory Analyses Executive Orders 12866 and 15363 In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(a), this scheduling action is subject to formal rulemaking procedures done ''on the record after opportunity for a hearing,'' which are conducted pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557. The CSA sets forth the criteria for scheduling a drug or other substance. Such actions are exempt from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to section 3(d)(1) of Executive Order 12866 and the principles reaffirmed in Executive Order 13563. Executive Order 12988 This regulation meets the applicable standards set forth in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 Civil Justice Reform to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity, minimize litigation, provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct, and promote simplification and burden reduction. Executive Order 13132 This rulemaking does not have federalism implications warranting the application of Executive Order 13132. The rule does not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Executive Order 13175 This rule does not have tribal implications warranting the application of Executive Order 13175. This rule does not have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Administrator, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) (RFA), has reviewed this rule and by approving it certifies that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The purpose of this rule is to remove [ 123I]ioflupane from the list of schedules of the CSA. This action removes regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to controlled substances for handlers and proposed handlers of [ 123I]ioflupane. Accordingly, it has the potential for some economic impact in the form of cost savings. This rule will affect all persons who handle, or propose to handle, [ 123I]ioflupane. Due to the wide variety of unidentifiable and unquantifiable variables that potentially could influence the distribution and administration rates of radiopharmaceutical substances, the DEA is unable to determine the number of entities and small entities which might handle [ 123I]ioflupane. In other instances where a controlled pharmaceutical drug is removed from the schedules of the CSA, the DEA is able to quantify the estimated number of affected entities and small entities because the handling of the drug is expected to be limited to DEA registrants even after removal from the schedules. In such instances, the DEA's knowledge of its registrant population forms the basis for estimating the number of affected entities and small entities. However, [ 123I]ioflupane is expected to be handled by persons who hold DEA registrations regardless of whether this rule is promulgated (e.g., hospital radiopharmacies) and by persons who are not currently registered with the DEA to handle controlled substances (e.g., diagnostic clinics and imaging centers that do not routinely handle controlled substances). The DEA does not have a reliable basis to estimate the number of non-registrants who plan to handle [ 123I]ioflupane. Although the DEA does not have a reliable basis to estimate the number of affected entities and quantify the economic impact of this final rule, a qualitative analysis indicates that this rule is likely to result in some cost savings for the healthcare industry. The affected entities will continue to meet existing Federal and/or state requirements applicable to those who handle radiopharmaceutical substances, including licensure, security, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, which in many cases are more stringent than the DEA's requirements. However, the DEA believes cost savings will be realized from the removal of the administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions for those entities handling or proposing to handle [ 123I]ioflupane, in the form of saved DEA registration fees, and the elimination of additional physical security, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. Because of these facts, this rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 The DEA has determined and certifies pursuant to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), 2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq., that this action would not result in any federal mandate that may result ''in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more (adjusted for inflation) in any one year . . . .'' Therefore, neither a Small Government Agency Plan nor any other action is required under provisions of UMRA. VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:06 on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54718 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations Paperwork Reduction Act This action does not impose a new collection of information requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521. This action would not impose recordkeeping or reporting requirements on State or local governments, individuals, businesses, or organizations. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Congressional Review Act This rule is not a major rule as defined by section 804 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Congressional Review Act (CRA)). This rule will not result in: An annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based companies to compete with foreign- based companies in domestic and export markets. However, pursuant to the CRA, the DEA has submitted a copy of this final rule to both Houses of Congress and to the Comptroller General.

Regulatory History and Information The Coast Guard published in the Federal Register of July 29, 2005, a final rule establishing a safety zone around the Mad Dog Truss Spar facility located on the OCS, under 33 CFR 147.839 (see 70 FR 43768). However, that final rule published with the wrong latitude and longitude for the facility location. The July 29, 2005 final rule incorrectly published the location as 27\u00b01118 N., 91\u00b00512 W. Through this interim rule and request for comments, the Coast Guard is correcting the location as published in the Code of Federal Regulations. This interim rule establishes the safety zone around the corrected location and provides the opportunity for public comment but does so without prior notice pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are ''impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not providing prior notice with respect to this rule. Delaying this correction to the location of the Mad Dog OCS safety zone would also delay necessary chart corrections. Additionally, it is impracticable and unnecessary to delay establishing and publishing the correct location to provide prior notice because the safety zone around the Mad Dog facility is known to those operating in the area and omitting the notice requirement will not result in a negative impact. Providing the opportunity to comment will allow for input on addressing such a correction while the correction is established but before it is made final. For the same reasons, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. C. Basis and Purpose Under the authority provided in 14 U.S.C. 85; 43 U.S.C. 1333; and Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170.1. Title 33, CFR part 147 permits the establishment of safety zones for facilities located on the OCS for the purpose of protecting life, property and the marine environment. The purpose of this interim rule is to correct the coordinates, reflecting the actual location of the Mad Dog Truss Spar facility at 27\u00b01118.124 N., 90\u00b0167.363 W. By correcting the location, this interim rule also reflects the correct area covered by the safety zone in place around the Mad Dog Truss Spar. The purpose of the safety zone around the Mad Dog Truss Spar is to protect the facility from all vessels operating outside the normal shipping channels and fairways that are not providing services to or working with the facility. Safety zones established around such facilities significantly reduce the threat of allisions, collisions, security breaches, oil spills, releases of natural gas, and thereby protect the safety of life, property, and the environment. For the purpose of safety zones established under 33 CFR part 147, the deepwater area is considered to be waters of 304.8 meters (1,000 feet) or greater depth extending to the limits of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) contiguous to the territorial sea of the United States and extending to a distance up to 200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the sea is measured. Navigation in the vicinity of the safety zone consists of large commercial shipping vessels, fishing vessels, cruise ships, tugs with tows and the occasional recreational vessel. The deepwater area also includes an extensive system of fairways. D. Discussion of Interim Rule On July 29, 2005, the Coast Guard established a safety zone under 33 CFR 147.839, around the Mad Dog Truss Spar facility through a final rule publishing an incorrect location for the facility as 27\u00b01118 N., 91\u00b00512 W. This interim rule corrects the coordinates in the CFR to reflect the actual location of 27\u00b01118.124 N., 90\u00b0167.363 W., while also requesting comments before being made final. The original OCS safety zone and this interim rule correcting the location are established to address safety concerns for both the personnel aboard the facility and the environment. It is highly likely that any allision with the facility would result in a catastrophic event. In evaluating the need for a safety zone, the Coast Guard explored relevant safety factors and considered several criteria, including but not limited to, (1) the level of shipping activity around the facility, (2) safety concerns for personnel aboard the facility, (3) concerns for the environment, (4) the likeliness that an allision would result in a catastrophic event based on proximity to shipping fairways, offloading operations, production levels, and size of the crew, (5) the volume of traffic in the vicinity of the area, (6) the types of vessels navigating in the vicinity of the area, and (7) the structural configuration of the facility. Results from a thorough and comprehensive examination of the criteria, International Maritime Organization (IMO) guidelines, and existing regulations warranted establishment of the original safety zone and support this correction establishing VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:06 Sep 10, on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54720 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations the corrected location for the safety zone extending 500 meters (1640.4 feet) around the facility. This safety zone will reduce significantly the threat of allisions, oil spills, and releases of natural gas and increase the safety of life, property, and the environment in the Gulf of Mexico by prohibiting entry into the zone unless specifically authorized by the Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District or a designated representative. E. Regulatory Analyses We developed this interim rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on a number of these statutes or executive orders. 1. Regulatory Planning and Review This interim rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, as supplemented by Executive Order 13563, Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of Executive Order 12866 or under section 1 of Executive Order 13563. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under those Orders. This rule is not a significant regulatory action due to the location of the Mad Dog Truss Spar\u2014on the Outer Continental Shelf\u2014and its distance from both land and safety fairways. Vessels traversing waters near the interim safety zone will be able to safely travel around the zone using alternate routes. Exceptions to this interim rule include vessels measuring less than 100 feet in length overall and not engaged in towing. Deviation to transit through the interim safety zone may be requested. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis and may be authorized by the Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District or a designated representative. 2. Impact on Small Entities The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as amended, requires federal agencies to consider the potential impact of regulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term ''small entities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this interim rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This interim rule would affect the following entities, some of which might be small entities: The owners or operators of vessels intending to transit or anchor within the area extending 500 meters (1640.4 feet) from the outermost edges of the Mad Dog Truss Spar located in Green Canyon 782 on the OCS. This safety zone will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the following reasons: Vessel traffic can pass safely around the safety zone using alternate routes. Based on the limited scope of the safety zone, any delay resulting from using an alternate route is expected to be minimal depending on vessel traffic and speed in the area. Deviation to transit through the interim safety zone may be requested. Such requests will be considered on a case- by-case basis and may be authorized by the Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District or a designated representative. If you think that your business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity and that this rule would have a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment (see ADDRESSES ) explaining why you think it qualifies and how and to what degree this rule would economically affect it. 3. Assistance for Small Entities Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small entities in understanding this interim rule. If the rule would affect your small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please submit a comment (see ADDRESSES ) explaining why you think it qualifies and how and to what degree this rule would economically affect it. The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this interim rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard. 4. Collection of Information This interim rule would call for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520.). 5. Federalism A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. We have analyzed this interim rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism. 6. Protest Activities The Coast Guard respects the First Amendment rights of protesters. Protesters are asked to contact the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section to coordinate protest activities so that your message can be received without jeopardizing the safety or security of people, places or vessels. 7. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this interim rule would not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble. 8. Taking of Private Property This interim rule would not cause a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights. 9. Civil Justice Reform This interim rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden. 10. Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks We have analyzed this interim rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and would not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that might disproportionately affect children. 11. Indian Tribal Governments This interim rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it would not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:06 Sep 10, on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54721 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. 12. Energy Effects We have analyzed this interim rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. 13. Technical Standards This interim rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards. 14. Environment We have analyzed this interim rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 023-01 and Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) 42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have made a preliminary determination that this action is one of a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This interim rule involves the establishment of a safety zone around an OCS facility to protect life, property and the marine environment. This interim rule is categorical excluded from further review, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(g), of the Commandant Instruction. A preliminary environmental analysis checklist supporting this determination and the Categorical Exclusion Determination are available in the docket where indicated under ADDRESSES . We seek any comments or information that may lead to the discovery of a significant environmental impact from this interim rule.

ACTION : Direct final rule. SUMMARY : The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a request submitted by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) on June 1, 2015, to revise the Indiana state implementation plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide (SO 2). The revision updates information regarding Walsh and Kelly, Incorporated, a hot mix asphalt plant located in Griffith, Lake County, Indiana. Walsh and Kelly, Incorporated, is replacing its aggregate drum dryer. The revision does not change any of the SO 2control requirements and will not result in an increase in SO 2emissions. DATES : This rule is effective on November 10, 2015, unless EPA receives adverse written comments by October 13, 2015. If EPA receives adverse comments, EPA will publish a timely withdrawal of the rule in the Federal Register and inform the public that the rule will not take effect.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Throughout this document whenever ''we,'' ''us,'' or ''our'' is used, we mean EPA. This supplementary information section is arranged as follows: I. General Information II. What is EPA approving? III. What are the changes from the current Rule? IV. What action is EPA taking? V. Incorporation by Reference IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews I. General Information A. Does this action apply to me? This action only applies to Walsh and Kelly, Incorporated, located in Griffith, Lake County, Indiana. B. Has public notice been provided? IDEM published a public notice of the revisions to the SIP on February 4, 2015, to update its SO 2rules that apply specifically to Walsh and Kelly, Incorporated. A public hearing on the revisions was held on March 11, 2015. There were no comments received. II. What is EPA approving? EPA is approving a revision to Indiana's SO 2SIP for Walsh and Kelly, Incorporated, a hot mix asphalt plant located in Griffith, Lake County, Indiana. Indiana's SO 2emission limits for Lake County are contained in Title 326 of the Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) in rule 7-4.1 (326 IAC 7-4.1). The SO 2 emission limits pertaining to the Walsh and Kelly, Incorporated, facility are found at 326 IAC 7-4.1-21. III. What are the changes from the current Rule? In 2013, Walsh and Kelly, Incorporated replaced its aggregate drum dryer. The older aggregate drum dryer burner design capacity was rated at 120 million British thermal units per hour (MMBtu/hr). The new aggregate drum dryer burner has a smaller design capacity, rated at 115 MMBtu/hr. IDEM made an administrative change to update rule 326 IAC 7-4.1-21(b) to reference the new 115 MMBtu/hr aggregate drum dryer. Rule 326 IAC 7- 4.1-21 provides SO 2emission limits for the Walsh and Kelly, Incorporated aggregate drum dryer, and allows the unit limited use of waste oil as a back- up fuel. IDEM did not revise any of the requirements that apply to using waste oil as a fuel. The SO 2emission limits of 42 pounds per hour and 25 tons per year remain unchanged. EPA finds the change to rule 326 IAC 7-4.1-21 approvable. IV. What action is EPA taking? EPA is approving revisions to Indiana's SO 2SIP which revise 326 IAC 7-4.1-21 for Walsh and Kelly, Incorporated, located in Griffith, Lake County, Indiana. The SIP revision will not result in an increase in SO 2 emissions at the facility because the emission limits remain the same. We are publishing this action without prior proposal because we view this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipate no adverse comments. However, in the proposed rules section of this Federal Register publication, we are publishing a separate document that will serve as the proposal to approve the state plan if relevant adverse written comments are filed. This rule will be effective November 10, 2015 without further notice unless we receive relevant adverse written comments by October 13, 2015. If we receive such comments, we will withdraw this action before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed action. The EPA will not institute a second comment period. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If we do not receive any comments, this action will be effective November 10, 2015. V. Incorporation by Reference In this rule, EPA is finalizing regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, EPA is finalizing the incorporation by reference of the Indiana regulations described in the amendments to 40 CFR part 52 set forth below. The EPA has made, and will continue to make, these documents generally available electronically through www.regulations.gov and/or in hard copy at the appropriate EPA office (see the ADDRESSES section of this preamble for more information). VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the CAA and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this action: Is not a ''significant regulatory action'' subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 2011); Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.); Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.); Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4); Does not have Federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999); Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997); Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA; and Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994). In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:06 Sep 10, on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54725 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register. This action is not a ''major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 10, 2015. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. Parties with objections to this direct final rule are encouraged to file a comment in response to the parallel notice of proposed rulemaking for this action published in the proposed rules section of today's Federal Register, rather than file an immediate petition for judicial review of this direct final rule, so that EPA can withdraw this direct final rule and address the comment in the proposed rulemaking. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

What is the scope of this rulemaking? EPA is acting upon the SIP submissions from Wisconsin that address the infrastructure requirements of CAA section 110(a)(1) and (2) for the 2008 ozone, 2010 NO 2, and 2010 SO 2 NAAQS. The requirement for states to make SIP submissions of this type arises out of CAA section 110(a)(1), which states that states must make SIP submissions ''within 3 years (or such shorter period as the Administrator may prescribe) after the promulgation of a national primary ambient air quality standard (or any revision thereof),'' and these SIP submissions are to provide for the ''implementation, maintenance, and enforcement'' of such NAAQS. The statute directly imposes on states the duty to make these SIP submissions, and the requirement to make the submissions is not conditioned upon EPA's taking any action other than promulgating a new or revised NAAQS. Section 110(a)(2) includes a list of specific elements that ''[e]ach such plan'' submission must address. EPA has historically referred to these SIP submissions made for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of CAA section 110(a)(1) and (2) as ''infrastructure SIP'' submissions. Although the term ''infrastructure SIP'' does not appear in the CAA, EPA uses the term to distinguish this particular type of SIP submission from submissions that are intended to satisfy other SIP requirements under the CAA, such as SIP submissions that address the nonattainment planning requirements of part D and the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirements of part C of title I of the CAA, and ''regional haze SIP'' submissions required to address the visibility protection requirements of CAA section 169A. This rulemaking will not cover three substantive areas because they are not integral to acting on a state's infrastructure SIP submissions: (i) Existing provisions related to excess emissions during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction (''SSM'') at sources, that may be contrary to the CAA and EPA's policies addressing such excess emissions; (ii) existing provisions related to ''director's variance'' or ''director's discretion'' that purport to permit revisions to SIP approved emissions limits with limited public notice or without requiring further approval by EPA, that may be contrary to the CAA; and, (iii) existing provisions for PSD programs that may be inconsistent with current requirements of EPA's ''Final NSR Improvement Rule,'' 67 FR 80186 (December 31, 2002), as amended by 72 FR 32526 (June 13, 2007) (''NSR Reform''). Instead, EPA has the authority to address each one of these substantive areas in separate rulemakings. A detailed history, interpretation, and rationale as they relate to infrastructure SIP requirements can be found in EPA's May 13, 2014, proposed rule entitled, ''Infrastructure SIP Requirements for the 2008 Lead NAAQS'' in the section, ''What is the scope of this rulemaking?'' (see 79 FR 27241 at 27242-27245). II. What action is EPA taking? EPA is taking final action to approve most elements of submissions from Wisconsin certifying that its current SIP is sufficient to meet the required infrastructure elements under section 110(a)(1) and (2) for the 2008 ozone, 2010 NO 2, and 2010 SO 2NAAQS. The proposed rulemaking associated with this final action was published on April 20, 2015 (75 FR 21685), and EPA received no comments during the comment period, which ended on May 20, 2015. EPA is therefore taking final action to approve, as proposed, most elements of Wisconsin's submissions. EPA's actions for the state's satisfaction of infrastructure SIP requirements, by element of section 110(a)(2) and NAAQS, are contained in the table below.

Statutory and Executive Order Reviews Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the CAA and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this action: Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 2011); Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.); Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.); Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4); Does not have Federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999); Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997); Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA; and Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994). In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register. This action is not a ''major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 10, 2015. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

ACTION : Final rule; correcting amendments. SUMMARY : The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule in the Federal Register on July 27, 2015, titled National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry and Standards of Performance for Portland Cement Plants. This final rule makes technical corrections and clarifications to the regulations published in that final rule. The rule also includes a provision describing performance testing requirements when a source demonstrates compliance with the hydrochloric acid (HCl) emissions standard using a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) for sulfur dioxide measurement and reporting.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Summary of Technical Corrections The EPA received communications from representatives of the Portland cement industry on five occasions in August 2015 (see memo to the docket (EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0817) titled, ''Communications on Errors PCA August 2015''). These communications outlined several errors in the regulatory text of the final rule (80 FR 44772). These all pertain to monitoring requirements. The EPA agrees that these are errors (typographical and unintended phrasing or omissions), and is correcting these errors in this document. We are also removing two passages (which consisted of four sentences) that were inadvertently left in the final amendments, but were discussed by the EPA as being removed in the Response to Comment (RTC) document for the final amendments (see docket item EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0817- 0870, page 8). In the RTC, we discussed that data substitution is not an allowed practice when determining compliance, but these four sentences discuss procedures for data substitution. Leaving these sentences in the rule, thus, does not reflect the EPA's stated intention, and would lead to confusion given the direct conflict between the RTC document and the rule text. We are making one further technical correction involving timing of performance tests. The correction keeps in place the specified time by which performance tests must be conducted, but will no longer set out a window of time in which the test must be conducted. The net effect is that performance tests can be conducted earlier than the window of time in the current rule text if a source desires to conduct its performance test earlier. The EPA had already indicated in the RTC document that it was making this change (see docket item EPA-HQ-OAR- 2011-0817-0870, page 5). The EPA regards this amendment as a clarification (the current rule could be interpreted to allow earlier testing) so that the rule reads precisely as intended, as stated by the EPA in the RTC document. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 63 Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Air pollution control, Hazardous substances, Intergovernmental relations, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

(iii) Quality assure any data above the span value established in paragraph (k)(1) of this section using the following procedure. Any time two consecutive one-hour average measured concentrations of Hg exceeds the span value you must, within 24 hours before or after, introduce a higher, ''above span'' Hg reference gas standard to the Hg CEMS. The ''above span'' reference gas must meet the requirements of PS 12A, Section 7.1, must target a concentration level between 50 and 150 percent of the highest expected hourly concentration measured during the period of measurements above span, and must be introduced at the probe. While this target represents a desired concentration range that is not always achievable in practice, it is expected that the intent to meet this range is demonstrated by the value of the reference gas. Expected values may include ''above span'' calibrations done before or after the above span measurement period. Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The ''above span'' calibration is successful if the value measured by the Hg CEMS is within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas. If the value measured by the Hg CEMS exceeds 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas, then you must normalize the one-hour average stack gas values measured above the span during the 24- hour period preceding or following the ''above span'' calibration for reporting based on the Hg CEMS response to the reference gas as shown in equation 22 below. Only one ''above span'' calibration is needed per 24 hour period. * * * * * (l) * * * (1) * * * The span value and calibration requirements in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to HCl CEMS other than those installed and certified under PS 15. * * * * * (ii) * * * (B) * * * Any HCl CEMS above span linearity challenge response exceeding +/\u00a520 percent of the certified value of the reference gas requires that all above span hourly averages during the week following the above span linearity challenge must be normalized using Equation 23. * * * * * Dated: September 2, 2015.

Petition for Exemption In the Federal Register of May 20, 2015 (80 FR 28925) (FRL-9927-39), EPA issued a document pursuant to FFDCA section 408, 21 U.S.C. 346a, announcing the filing of a pesticide petition (PP IN-10753) by Exponent, Inc. (1150 Connecticut Ave. Suite 1100 NW., Washington, DC 20036) on behalf of Drexel Chemical Company, P.O. Box 13327 Memphis, TN 38113-0327. The petition requested that 40 CFR 180.920 be amended by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of tetraethylene glycol (CAS Reg. No. 112-60-7) when used as an inert ingredient (solvent) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops. That document referenced a summary of the petition prepared by Exponent on behalf of Drexel Chemical Company, the petitioner, which is available in the docket, http://www.regulations.gov. There were no substantive comments received in response to the notice of filing. III. Inert Ingredient Definition Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125 and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): Solvents such as alcohols surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers clay thickeners such as carrageenan and and ''inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. Generally, EPA has exempted inert ingredients from the requirement of a tolerance based on the low toxicity of the individual inert ingredients. IV. Aggregate Risk Assessment and Determination of Safety Section 408(c)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish an exemption from the requirement for a tolerance (the legal limit for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food) only if EPA determines that the tolerance is ''safe.'' Section 408(b)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines ''safe'' to mean that ''there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.'' This includes exposure through drinking water and in residential settings, but does not include occupational exposure. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA requires EPA to give special consideration to exposure of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to ''ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue . . . .'' EPA establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance only in those cases where it can be clearly demonstrated that the risks from aggregate exposure to pesticide chemical residues under reasonably foreseeable circumstances will pose no appreciable risks to human health. In order to determine the risks from aggregate exposure to pesticide inert ingredients, the Agency considers the toxicity of the inert in conjunction with possible exposure to residues of the inert ingredient through food, drinking water, and through other exposures that occur as a result of pesticide use in residential settings. If EPA is able to determine that a finite tolerance is not necessary to ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the inert ingredient, an exemption from the VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:06 Sep 10, on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54731 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations requirement of a tolerance may be established. Consistent with FFDCA section 408(c)(2)(A), and the factors specified in FFDCA section 408(c)(2)(B), EPA has reviewed the available scientific data and other relevant information in support of this action. EPA has sufficient data to assess the hazards of and to make a determination on aggregate exposure for tetraethylene glycol including exposure resulting from the exemption established by this action. EPA's assessment of exposures and risks associated with tetraethylene glycol follows. A. Toxicological Profile EPA has evaluated the available toxicity data and considered their validity, completeness, and reliability as well as the relationship of the results of the studies to human risk. EPA has also considered available information concerning the variability of the sensitivities of major identifiable subgroups of consumers, including infants and children. Specific information on the studies received and the nature of the adverse effects caused by tetraethylene glycol as well as the no- observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect- level (LOAEL) from the toxicity studies are discussed in this unit. Acute, subchronic and mutagenicity studies were available but chronic, developmental, reproduction and metabolism studies were not available on tetraethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol and the higher glycols (di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentaethylene glygol) are closely related in structure. Their physicochemical properties differ in a regular and expected way due to the increasing molecular weight and consistent functionality of a relatively less stable hydroxy moiety on each end of the molecule. Therefore, the hazard profile and dose response are also expected to change consistently with decreasing potential for adverse effect with increasing molecular weight (OECD SIDS SIAM 18, 2004). Based on this, toxicity data on triethylene glycol (which has a lower molecular weight than tetraethylene glycol and is likely to provide a conservative estimate of potential for adverse effect) was used as surrogate data to bridge chronic, developmental, reproduction toxicity and metabolism data for tetraethylene glycol. The acute oral and dermal toxicity of tetraethylene glycol is low. The oral and dermal LD 50s are >20,000 mg/kg (milligram/kilogram) in the rat and rabbit. Acute inhalation toxicity in rats is also low; the LC 50is >2.5 liter (L)/ min. Tetraethylene glycol is mildly irritating to the eyes and to the skin in rabbits. It is not a dermal sensitizer. Tetraethylene glycol did not cause toxicity at doses up to 2,000 milligrams/ kilograms/day (mg/kg/day) in a subchronic oral toxicity study in rats. Based on developmental and reproduction toxicity studies with triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol is not expected to be a developmental/ reproduction toxicant. Neither maternal, developmental nor reproduction toxicity was observed up to 3,300 mg/ kg/day (greater than three times the limit dose). Available mutagenicity studies included the Ames test, mammalian gene mutation, sister chromatid exchange, chromosome aberrations, the chromatid dominant lethal test, and mouse micronucleus assays. Tetraethylene glycol was negative for inducing mutations and aberrations in all of the studies except the sister chromatid exchange assay which was positive. However, based on the weight of evidence tetraethylene glycol is not expected to be mutagenic. Carcinogenicity studies were not available. However, based on the lack of systemic toxicity and the lack of mutagenicity tetraethylene glycol is not expected to be carcinogenic. Neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity studies were not available for review. However, evidence of neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity was not observed in the available studies. Metabolism studies are not available on tetraethylene glycol. However, it is postulated that the metabolic pathway for tetraethylene glycol is similar to that of triethylene glycol in that it undergoes oxidation via alcohol dehydrogenases and aldehyde dehydrogenases to generate dicarboxylic acid metabolites. Specific information on the studies received and the nature of the adverse effects caused by tetraethylene glycol as well as the NOAEL and the LOAEL from the toxicity studies can be found at http://www.regulations.gov in the document, ''Tetraethylene Glycol; Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Effects Assessment to Support Proposed Exemption from the Requirement of a Tolerance When Used as Inert Ingredients in Pesticide Formulations'' in docket ID number EPA-HQ-OPP-2015-0214. B. Toxicological Points of Departure/ Levels of Concern The available toxicity studies indicate that tetraethylene glycol has low toxicity. No effects were observed up to 2,000 mg/kg/day following subchronic exposure. In the developmental and reproduction toxicity studies, effects were observed only at very high doses (3,300 mg/kg/day). Further, the only effect observed at 3,300 mg/kg/day was a minor decrement in bodyweight. Although, doses between 590-3300 mg/ kg/day were not tested in the developmental and reproduction studies in mice, the Agency is reasonably certain that no harm will occur to the general population or infants and children following the use of tetraethylene glycol at any dose below the limit dose given the lack of effects being found and the fact that the only effect seen was a minor bodyweight decrease seen at 3,300 mg/kg/day. Since, no other effects were observed, the Agency concluded that there are no endpoints of concern for tetraethylene glycol and a qualitative risk assessment is appropriate. C. Exposure Assessment 1. Dietary exposure from food and feed uses. In evaluating dietary exposure to tetraethylene glycol, EPA considered exposure under the proposed exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. EPA assessed dietary exposures from tetraethylene glycol in food as follows: Tetraethylene glycol will be used as a solvent in pesticide formulations used on agricultural crops. Additionally, it is used as an indirect food additive. For the general population, the majority of exposure to tetraethylene glycol occurs from the extensive use as a FDA-approved indirect food additive. Under this exemption from the requirement of a tolerance, residues of this chemical also may be found on treated crops. Because no hazard endpoint of concern was identified for the acute and chronic dietary assessment (food and drinking water), a quantitative dietary exposure risk assessment was not conducted. 2. From non-dietary exposure. The term ''residential exposure'' is used in this document to refer to non- occupational, non-dietary exposure (e.g., textiles (clothing and diapers), carpets, swimming pools, and hard surface disinfection on walls, floors, tables). Tetraethylene glycol is used as an inert ingredient in non-food use pesticide formulations and is also used as a humectant in cosmetics. However, based on the lack of toxicity, a quantitative exposure assessment from residential exposures was not performed. 3. Cumulative effects from substances with a common mechanism of toxicity. Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of FFDCA requires that, when considering whether VerDate Sep<11>2014 on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54732 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations to establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance, the Agency consider ''available information'' concerning the cumulative effects of a particular pesticide's residues and ''other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity.'' EPA has not found tetraethylene glycol to share a common mechanism of toxicity with any other substances, and tetraethylene glycol does not appear to produce a toxic metabolite produced by other substances. For the purposes of this tolerance action, therefore, EPA has assumed that tetraethylene glycol does not have a common mechanism of toxicity with other substances. For information regarding EPA's efforts to determine which chemicals have a common mechanism of toxicity and to evaluate the cumulative effects of such chemicals, see EPA's Web site at http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/ cumulative. D. Safety Factor for Infants and Children 1. In general. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA provides that EPA shall apply an additional tenfold (10X) margin of safety for infants and children in the case of threshold effects to account for prenatal and postnatal toxicity and the completeness of the database on toxicity and exposure unless EPA determines based on reliable data that a different margin of safety will be safe for infants and children. This additional margin of safety is commonly referred to as the Food Quality Protection Act Safety Factor (FQPA SF). In applying this provision, EPA either retains the default value of 10X, or uses a different additional safety factor when reliable data available to EPA support the choice of a different factor. As part of its qualitative assessment, the Agency did not use safety factors for assessing risk, and no additional safety factor is needed for assessing risk to infants and children. Based on an assessment of tetraethylene glycol and its chemical properties, EPA has concluded that there are no toxicological endpoints of concern for the U.S. population, including infants and children. E. Aggregate Risks and Determination of Safety Because no toxicological endpoints of concern were identified, EPA concludes that aggregate exposure to residues of tetraethylene glycol will not pose a risk to the U.S. population, including infants and children, and that no harm will result to the general population, or to infants and children from aggregate exposure to tetraethylene glycol residues. V. Other Considerations A. Analytical Enforcement Methodology An analytical method is not required for enforcement purposes since the Agency is not establishing a numerical tolerance for residues of tetraethylene glycol in or on any food commodities. EPA is establishing a limitation on the amount of tetraethylene glycol that may be used in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops. That limitation will be enforced through the pesticide registration process under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq. EPA will not register any pesticide formulation for use on growing crops for sale or distribution that contains of tetraethylene glycol. VI. Conclusions Therefore, an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is established under 40 CFR 180.920 for tetraethylene glycol (CAS Reg. No. 112-60-7) when used as an inert ingredient (solvent) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops. VII. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews This action establishes an exemption from the requirement of tolerance under FFDCA section 408(d) in response to a petition submitted to the Agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from review under Executive Order 12866, entitled ''Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Because this action has been exempted from review under Executive Order 12866, this action is not subject to Executive Order 13211, entitled ''Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use'' (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) or Executive Order 13045, entitled ''Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks'' (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997). This action does not contain any information collections subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), nor does it require any special considerations under Executive Order 12898, entitled ''Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations'' (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994). Since exemptions that are established on the basis of a petition under FFDCA section 408(d), such as the exemption in this final rule, do not require the issuance of a proposed rule, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), do not apply. This action directly regulates growers, food processors, food handlers, and food retailers, not States or tribes, nor does this action alter the relationships or distribution of power and responsibilities established by Congress in the preemption provisions of FFDCA section 408(n)(4). As such, the Agency has determined that this action will not have a substantial direct effect on States or tribal governments, on the relationship between the national government and the States or tribal governments, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government or between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Thus, the Agency has determined that Executive Order 13132, entitled ''Federalism'' (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999) and Executive Order 13175, entitled ''Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments'' (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000) do not apply to this action. In addition, this action does not impose any enforceable duty or contain any unfunded mandate as described under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.). This action does not involve any technical standards that would require Agency consideration of voluntary consensus standards pursuant to section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note). VIII. Congressional Review Act Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. This action is not a ''major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

ACTION : Notice of interpretation. SUMMARY : This document provides the NTSB's interpretation of the applicability of the agency's regulations concerning aircraft accident notification requirements to unmanned aircraft. The regulations define ''unmanned aircraft accident'' and require notifications of accidents that fulfill the criteria included in the definition. By this Notice, the NTSB clarifies it does not consider model aircraft to fall within the regulatory definition of unmanned aircraft accident, for purposes of required notification. DATES : Effective September 11, 2015. ADDRESSES : A copy of this Notice of interpretation is available for inspection and copying at NTSB Headquarters, 490 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20594-2003. Alternatively, a copy of the Notice is available on the NTSB's Web site at www.ntsb.gov and at the government-wide Web site on regulations at www.regulations.gov, Docket No. NTSB-AS-2015-0001. A paper copy is available. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : William English, NTSB Office of Aviation Safety, (202) 314-6686. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : NTSB Investigations of Unmanned Aircraft On August 24, 2010, the NTSB published a Final Rule defining ''unmanned aircraft accident'' as: [A]n occurrence associated with the operation of any public or civil unmanned aircraft system that takes place between the time that the system is activated with the purpose of flight and the time that the system is deactivated at the conclusion of its mission, in which: (1) Any person suffers death or serious injury; or (2) The aircraft has a maximum gross takeoff weight of 300 pounds or greater and sustains substantial damage. 75 FR 51953, 51955.1 In the preamble to the Final Rule, the NTSB stated it sought to exclude model aircraft from the notification requirements of 49 CFR part 830. 75 FR at 51954. The NTSB's promulgation of the notification requirements with well- recognized definitions in part 830 was prompted by enactment of the Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987, Public Law 100- 223, 101 Stat. 1486 (Dec. 30, 1987). The statute specifically required the NTSB to promulgate notification requirements, stating the NTSB must ''establish by regulation requirements binding on persons reporting . . . accidents and aviation incidence subject to the Board's investigatory jurisdiction under this subsection.'' Id. sec. 311, 101 Stat. 1528. The NTSB has consistently excluded unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) flown for hobby and recreational use from the definition of ''accident'' under 49 CFR part 830, and has historically not investigated the rare occasions in which a model aircraft has caused serious injury or fatality. For purposes of defining the term ''model aircraft'' in this publication, the NTSB has adopted the definition of the term that appears in section 336(c) of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Public Law 112-95; 126 Stat. 77-78 (Feb. 14, 2012). Section 336(c) defines ''model aircraft'' to mean an unmanned aircraft that is: (1) capable of sustained flight in the atmosphere; (2) flown within visual line of sight of the person operating the aircraft; and (3) flown for hobby or recreational purposes. The NTSB's exclusion of model aircraft from the applicability of 49 CFR part 830 is consistent with international practices and interpretations concerning accident notifications and investigations. For example, Circular 328 from the International Civil Aviation Organization states model aircraft are outside the scope of applicability of the Chicago Convention. International Civil Aviation Organization, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Circular 328 (2011). The Circular states: ''In the broadest sense, the introduction of UAS does not change any existing distinctions between model aircraft and aircraft. Model aircraft, generally recognized as intended for recreational purposes only, fall outside the provisions of the Chicago Convention, being exclusively the subject of relevant national regulations, if any.'' Id. at 3, \u00b6 2.4. Furthermore, the International Society of Air Safety Investigators (ISASI) has set forth a similar policy statement. The organization recognizes ''[f]ormal air safety investigations are not constituted to investigate model aircraft accidents, and Annex 13 is not applicable to them.'' ISASI Unmanned Aircraft System Handbook and Accident/Incident Investigation Guidelines at 24 (Jan. 2015). Related Legislative and Regulatory Developments On February 14, 2012, the President signed into law the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. Public Law 112-95. Among other provisions, the statute defines unmanned aircraft and small unmanned aircraft. The statute describes UAS as ''an unmanned aircraft and associated elements (including communication links and the components that control the unmanned aircraft) that are required for the pilot in command to operate safely and efficiently in the national airspace system.'' Id. at sec. 331(9). The statute defines ''small unmanned aircraft'' as a UAS weighing less than 55 pounds. Id. at sec. 331(6). In addition, the statute provides a definition of ''model aircraft.'' As quoted above, section 336(c) of the Act states the definition of a model aircraft is dependent upon the aircraft's use; an aircraft capable of sustained flight in the atmosphere that is flown within the operator's visual line of sight and only for hobby or recreational purposes is considered a ''model aircraft.'' Section 336(a) of the Act precludes the FAA from promulgating any rule concerning a model aircraft if the aircraft: (1) Is flown ''strictly for hobby or recreational use''; (2) is ''operated in accordance with a community-based set of safety guidelines and within the programming of a nationwide community-based organization''; (3) is limited to not more than 55 pounds unless otherwise certified; (4) is ''operated in a manner that does not interfere with and gives way to any manned aircraft''; and (5) when flown within 5 miles of an airport, the model aircraft's operator provides the airport operator and air traffic control tower with prior notice of its operation. Id. at sec. 336(a). On June 25, 2014, the FAA published a Notice of interpretation with request for comment in the Federal Register. 79 FR 36172. The Notice stated the FAA had received inquiries concerning its enforcement authority over model aircraft, and states based on the language of the statute, aircraft that meet the statutory definition of ''model aircraft'' and operational requirements, as described above, are ''exempt from future FAA rulemaking action VerDate Sep<11>2014 on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54737 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 2We recognize the aviation community is mindful of the Board's decision in Administrator v. Pirker, NTSB Order No. EA-5730 (Nov. 18, 2014). In Pirker, the Board held the FAA could apply to UAS 14 CFR 91.13(a), which prohibits careless or reckless operation of aircraft. The respondent's flight that gave rise to the FAA's action in Pirker occurred prior to Congress's enactment of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which addresses UAS, small UAS, and model aircraft. The NTSB considers these statutory definitions instructive in interpreting its regulations. specifically regarding model aircraft.'' Id. The FAA went on to clarify, however, ''model aircraft that do not meet these statutory requirements are nonetheless unmanned aircraft, and as such, are subject to all existing FAA regulations, as well as future rulemaking action, and the FAA intends to apply its regulations to such unmanned aircraft.'' Id. at 36173. Following the Notice of interpretation, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in which it proposed a new regulatory part to regulate small UAS (14 CFR part 107). 80 FR 9544 (Feb. 23, 2015). Conclusion In light of recent regulatory and legislative actions and industry developments in the area of unmanned aircraft, the agency believes it is prudent to clarify our interpretation of the definitions codified at 49 CFR 830.2 and the notification requirements contained in to ''aircraft accidents'' and ''serious incidents''). 2In this regard, we remain consistent with our long-held practice of refraining from conducting investigations of any model aircraft accident or incident. We maintain this declination in our interpretation of our regulations within 49 CFR part 830, and we do not feel compelled to alter this practice in light of recently proposed regulatory changes from the FAA or Congress's recent inclusion of a statutory definition of ''model aircraft.'' The NTSB does not now propose a definition of model aircraft, but will consider as instructive the description of ''model aircraft'' within section 336 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, as described above in the section of this Notice entitled ''Related Legislative and Regulatory Developments.'' The NTSB trusts operators will find this statement of interpretation helpful in understanding the NTSB's definition of ''unmanned aircraft accident.'' Christopher A. Hart, Chairman.

ACTION : Temporary rule; quota transfer. SUMMARY : NMFS announces that the Commonwealth of Virginia is transferring a portion of its 2015 commercial Atlantic bluefish quota to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This quota adjustment is necessary to comply with the Bluefish Fishery Management Plan quota transfer provisions. This announcement informs the public of the revised commercial quota for each state involved. DATES : Effective September 8, 2015, through December 31, 2015. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Reid Lichwell, Fishery Management Specialist, (978) 281-9112. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Regulations governing the bluefish fishery are found at 50 CFR part 648. The regulations require annual specification of a commercial quota that is apportioned among the coastal states from Florida through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated to each state are described in \u00a7 648.162. The final rule implementing Amendment 1 to the Bluefish Fishery Management Plan, published in the Federal Register on July 26, 2000 (65 FR 45844), provided a mechanism for transferring commercial bluefish quota from one state to another. Two or more states, under mutual agreement and with the concurrence of the Administrator, Greater Atlantic Region, NMFS (Regional Administrator), can transfer or combine bluefish commercial quota under \u00a7 648.162(e). The Regional Administrator is required to consider the criteria in \u00a7 648.162(e)(1) in the evaluation of requests for quota transfers or combinations. Virginia has agreed to transfer 50,000 lb (22,680 kg) of its 2015 commercial quota to Massachusetts. This transfer was prompted by state officials in Massachusetts to ensure their commercial bluefish quota is not exceeded. The Regional Administrator has determined that the criteria set forth in \u00a7 648.162(e)(1) are met. The revised bluefish quotas for calendar year 2015 are: kg); and Massachusetts, 602,036 kg), based on the final 2015 Atlantic Bluefish Specifications published August 6, 2015 (80 FR 46848).

ACTION : Temporary rule; reapportionment. SUMMARY : NMFS is reapportioning the seasonal apportionments of the 2015 Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits for the trawl deep-water and shallow-water species fishery categories in the Gulf of Alaska. This action is necessary to account for the actual halibut PSC use by the trawl deep-water and shallow-water species fishery categories from May 15, 2015 through June 30, 2015. This action is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska. DATES : Effective 1200 hours, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), September 9, 2015 through 2400 hours, A.l.t., December 31, 2015. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Josh Keaton, 907-586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : NMFS manages the groundfish fishery the VerDate Sep<11>2014 on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with RULES54738 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations Gulf of Alaska (GOA) exclusive economic zone according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679. The final 2015 and 2016 harvest specifications for groundfish in the GOA (80 FR 10250, February 25, 2015) apportions the 2015 Pacific halibut PSC limit for trawl gear in the GOA to two trawl fishery categories: A deep-water species fishery and a shallow-water species fishery. The halibut PSC limit for these two trawl fishery categories is further apportioned by season, including four seasonal apportionments to the shallow-water species fishery and three seasonal apportionments to the deep-water species fishery. The two fishery categories also are apportioned a combined, fifth seasonal halibut PSC limit. Unused seasonal apportionments are added to the next season apportionment during a fishing year. Regulations at \u00a7 679.21(d)(4)(iii)(D) require NMFS to combine management of the available trawl halibut PSC limits in the second season (April 1 through July 1) deep-water and shallow-water species fishery categories for use in either fishery from May 15 through June 30 of each year. Furthermore, NMFS is required to reapportion the halibut PSC limit between the deep-water and shallow-water species fisheries after June 30 to account for actual halibut PSC use by each fishery category during May 15 through June 30. As of September 1, 2015, NMFS has determined that the trawl deep-water and shallow-water fisheries used 75 metric tons (mt) and 1 mt of halibut PSC, respectively, from May 15 through June 30. Accordingly, pursuant to \u00a7 679.21(d)(4)(iii)(D), the Regional Administrator is reapportioning the combined first and second seasonal apportionments (836 mt) of halibut PSC limit between the trawl deep-water and shallow-water fishery categories to account for the actual PSC use in each fishery. Therefore, Table 16 of the final 2015 and 2016 harvest specifications for groundfish in the GOA (80 FR 10250, February 25, 2015) is revised consistent with this adjustment. TABLE 16\u2014F INAL 2015 A PPORTIONMENT OF PACIFIC HALIBUT PSC T RAWL LIMITS BETWEEN THE TRAWL GEARDEEP- WATER SPECIES FISHERY AND THE SHALLOW -WATER SPECIES FISHERY CATEGORIES [Values are in metric tons] Season Shallow-water Deep-water1 Total January 1 ......................................................................................................... 291 375 . ..................................... 666 Subtotal of combined first and second season limit (January 20-July 1) ............ 426 410 ...................................... 836 July ....... cooperatives in the Central GOA Rockfish Program will receive 191 mt of the third season (July 1 through September 1) deep-water species fishery halibut PSC trawl shallow-water and deep-water species fishery categories during the fifth season (October 1 through December 31). Classification This action responds to the best available information recently obtained from the fishery. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to the authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) as such requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. This requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest as it would prevent NMFS from responding to the most recent fisheries data in a timely fashion and would allow for harvests that exceed the originally specified apportionment of the halibut PSC limits to the deep-water and shallow-water fishery categories. NMFS was unable to publish a notice providing time for public comment because the most recent, relevant data only became available as of September 3, 2015. The AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the effective date of this action under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). This finding is based upon the reasons provided above for waiver of prior notice and opportunity for public comment. This action is required by \u00a7 679.20 and is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: September 8, 2015. Emily H.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Throughout this document wherever ''we,'' ''us,'' or ''our'' is used, we mean the EPA. I. Background On October 5, 1978, we published the first NAAQS for lead (Pb) (43 FR 46246). Both the primary and secondary standards were set at 1.5 micrograms per cubic meter (mg/m3). In 2008, following a periodic review of the NAAQS for lead, we published a revised, more stringent NAAQS of 0.15 mg/m3 for both the primary and secondary standards (73 FR 66964, November 13, 2008). For more information on these standards, please see the Technical Support Document (TSD) and EPA Web site http://epa.gov/ airquality/lead. Each state must submit an i-SIP within three years after the promulgation of a new or revised NAAQS. Section 110(a)(2) of the CAA includes a list of specific elements the i-SIP must meet. EPA issued guidance addressing the i-SIP elements for NAAQS. 1The Governor of New Mexico on behalf of Albuquerque-Bernalillo County submitted an i-SIP revision on May 2, 2012 to address this revised NAAQS, including a demonstration that the SIP met the four statutory requirements for interstate transport of Pb emissions. EPA is proposing to approve the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County, New Mexico i-SIP submittal for the 2008 Pb NAAQS 2as meeting VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules EPA's approach for reviewing i-SIPs; the details of the SIP submittal and EPA's evaluation; the effect of recent court decisions on i-SIPs; the statute and regulatory citations in the New Mexico SIP specific to this review; the specific i-SIP applicable CAA and EPA regulatory citations; Federal Register Notice citations for New Mexico SIP approvals; New Mexico's minor New Source Review program and EPA approval activities; and New Mexico's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program can be found in the Technical Support Document (TSD). 3The specific nonattainment area plan requirements of section 110(a)(2)(I) are subject to the timing requirements of section 172, not the timing requirement of section 110(a)(1). Thus, section 110(a)(2)(A) does not require that states submit regulations or emissions limits specifically for attaining the 2008 Pb NAAQS. Those SIP provisions are due as part of each state's attainment plan, and will be addressed separately from the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A). In the context of an infrastructure SIP, EPA is not evaluating the existing SIP provisions for this purpose. Instead, EPA is only evaluating whether the state's SIP has basic structural provisions for the implementation of the NAAQS. 4As discussed in further detail in the TSD. 5EPA is not proposing to approve or disapprove Albuquerque-Bernalillo County's existing minor NSR program to the extent that it may be inconsistent with EPA's regulations governing this program. EPA has maintained that the CAA does not require that new infrastructure SIP submissions correct any defects in existing EPA-approved provisions of minor NSR programs in order for EPA to approve the infrastructure SIP for element C (e.g., 76 FR 41076-41079). EPA believes that a number of states may have minor NSR provisions that are contrary to the existing EPA regulations for this program. The statutory requirements of section 110(a)(2)(C) provide for considerable flexibility in designing minor NSR programs. 6As discussed further in the TSD. for an i-SIP, including the requirements for interstate transport of Pb emissions II. EPA's Evaluation of New Mexico's i- SIP and Interstate Transport Submittal Below is a summary of EPA's evaluation of the Albuquerque- Bernalillo County, New Mexico i-SIP for each applicable element of 110(a)(2) A- M. The Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board (Air Board) provided a demonstration of how the existing Albuquerque-Bernalillo County, New Mexico SIP met all the requirements of the 2008 Pb NAAQS on May 2, 2012. This SIP submission became complete by operation of law on November 2, 2013. See CAA section 110(k)(1)(B). (A) Emission limits and other control measures: The SIP must include enforceable emission limits and other control measures, means or techniques, schedules for compliance and other related matters as needed to implement, maintain and enforce each of the NAAQS. 3 Legislative authority for Albuquerque- Bernalillo County's air quality program, codified in Chapter 74 Environmental Improvement, Article 2, Air Pollution, of the New Mexico statutes, gives the Air Board and the Albuquerque Environmental Health Department's Air Quality Program (AQP) the authority to implement the CAA in Albuquerque- Bernalillo County, New Mexico. Enforceable emission limitations and other control measures are authorized by the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act (AQCA) which established the Air Board and those provisions of New Mexico Administrative Code (NMAC) Title 20, Environmental Protection, Chapter 11, Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board. They can adopt emission standards and compliance schedules applicable to regulated entities; emission standards and limitations and any other measures necessary for attainment and maintenance of national standards; and, enforce applicable laws, regulations, standards and compliance schedules, and seek injunctive relief within the boundaries of Bernalillo County. This authority has been employed to adopt and submit multiple revisions to the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County, New Mexico State Implementation Plan. The approved SIP for Albuquerque- Bernalillo County, New Mexico is documented at 40 CFR 52.1620, Subpart GG. (B) Ambient air quality monitoring/ data system: The SIP must provide for establishment and implementation of ambient air quality monitors, collection and analysis of monitoring data, and providing the data to EPA upon request. The AQCA provides AQP with the authority to monitor ambient air quality in the county (NMSA 1978, section 74- 2-5). AQP maintains a monitoring network for the NAAQS and submits an annual Network Assessment to EPA. The network includes one monitor for Pb. AQP's 2014 Air Monitoring Network Plan is the most recently EPA-approved network monitoring plan and was approved by EPA on February 3, 2015. All monitoring data is measured using EPA approved methods and subject to the EPA quality assurance requirements. AQP submits all required data to EPA, in accordance with EPA rules. The monitoring network was approved into the SIP (46 FR 4005, August 6, 1981). AQP conducts an assessment of the monitoring network every 5 years. Data is available upon request and in the EPA Air Quality System (AQS) database. (C) Program for enforcement. The SIP must include the following three elements: (1) A program providing for enforcement of the measure in paragraph A above; (2) a program for the regulation of the modification and construction of stationary sources as necessary to protect the applicable NAAQS (i.e., state-wide permitting of minor sources); and (3) a permit program to meet the major source permitting requirements of the CAA (for areas designated as attainment or unclassifiable for the NAAQS in question). 4 (1) Enforcement of SIP Measures. As noted in (A), the state statutes provide authority for the AQP to enforce the requirements of the AQCA within Albuquerque-Bernalillo County, and any regulations, permits, or final compliance orders. Its statutes also provide the AQP with general enforcement powers. Among other things, they can file lawsuits to compel compliance with the statutes and regulations; commence civil actions; issue field citations; conduct investigations of regulated entities; collect criminal and civil penalties; develop and enforce rules and standards related to protection of air quality; issue compliance orders; pursue criminal prosecutions; investigate, enter into remediation agreements; and issue emergency cease and desist orders. The AQAC also provides additional enforcement authorities and funding mechanisms. (2) Minor New Source Review (NSR). The SIP is required to include measures to regulate construction and modification of stationary sources to protect the NAAQS. Albuquerque- Bernalillo County's minor NSR permitting requirements are approved as part of the SIP. 5 (3) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permit program. Albuquerque-Bernalillo County's PSD portion of the SIP covers all NSR regulated pollutants as well as the requirements for the 2008 Pb NAAQS and has been approved by EPA. 6In a recent action, EPA approved revisions that address the requirements of the EPA's May 2008, July 2010, and October 2012 PM 2.5PSD Implementation Rules and to incorporate revisions consistent with the EPA's March 2011 Fugitives Interim Rule, July 2011 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Biomass Deferral Rule, and July 2012 GHG Tailoring Rule Step 3 and GHG PALs Rule (see docket EPA-R06- OAR-2013-0616 in www.regulations.gov). (D) Interstate and international transport: The requirements for interstate transport of Pb emissions are that the SIP contain adequate provisions prohibiting Pb emissions to other states which will (1) contribute significantly to nonattainment of the NAAQS, (2) interfere with maintenance of the NAAQS, (3) interfere with measures required to prevent significant VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:10 Sep Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules 7http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/2011/report/ fullreport.pdf. 8Analysis by Mark Schmidt, OAQPS, ''Ambient Pb's Contribution to Class I Area Visibility Impairment,'' June 17, 2011. deterioration or (4) interfere with measures to protect visibility (CAA 110(a)(2)(D)(i)). With respect to significant contribution to nonattainment or interference with maintenance of the Pb NAAQS, the physical properties of Pb, which is a metal and very dense, prevent Pb emissions from experiencing a significant degree of travel in the ambient air. No complex chemistry is needed to form Pb or Pb compounds in the ambient air; therefore, ambient concentrations of Pb are typically highest near Pb sources. More specifically, there is a sharp decrease in ambient Pb concentrations as the distance from the source increases. According to EPA's report entitled Our Nation's Air: Status and Trends Through 2010, Pb concentrations that are not near a source of Pb are approximately 8 times less than the typical concentrations near the source. 7 For these reasons, EPA believes that the interstate transport requirements pertaining to significant contribution to nonattainment or interference with maintenance of the Pb NAAQS can be satisfied through a state's assessment as to whether a lead source located within its state in close proximity to a state border has emissions that contribute significantly to the nonattainment in or interfere with maintenance of the NAAQS in the neighboring state. Albuquerque-Bernalillo County has stated as such in its submission. There are no areas within Albuquerque-Bernalillo County that are designated as nonattainment with respect to the 2008 Pb NAAQS, and there are no significant sources of Pb emissions within the County that emit Pb in amounts equal to or exceeding 0.5 tons per year, nor sources of Pb emissions within two miles of a neighboring state line. Total Pb emissions within Albuquerque- Bernalillo County in 2011 were less than two tons, and most of the Pb- emitting sources within the State are general aviation airports where aviation gasoline containing tetra-ethyl lead is still in use. Therefore, we deem that Albuquerque-Bernalillo County has presumptively satisfied the interstate transport requirements pertaining to significant contribution to nonattainment or interference with maintenance of the Pb NAAQS. With respect to the interstate transport and PSD requirement, we note that Albuquerque-Bernalillo County's satisfaction of the applicable infrastructure SIP PSD requirements for attainment/unclassifiable areas with regards to the 2008 Pb NAAQS have been detailed in the section addressing section 110(a)(2)(C). Therefore, we deem that the SIP has presumptively satisfied the interstate transport and PSD requirement. With regard to the applicable requirement for interstate transport and visibility protection, significant impacts from Pb emissions from stationary sources are expected to be limited to short distances from the source and most, if not all, stationary sources of Pb emissions are located at sufficient distances from Class I areas such that visibility impacts would be negligible. Although Pb can be a component of coarse and fine particles, Pb generally comprises only a small fraction of coarse and fine particles. A recent EPA study conducted to evaluate the extent that Pb could impact visibility concluded that Pb-related visibility impacts at Class I areas were found to be insignificant (e.g., less than 0.10%). 8 Given this information, that there are no significant point sources of Pb emissions and that the County is not near an interstate border we deem the SIP meets the interstate transport and visibility protection. Section 110(a)(2)(D)(ii) also requires that the SIP ensure compliance with the applicable requirements of sections 126 and 115 of the CAA, relating to interstate and international pollution abatement, respectively. Section 126(a) of the CAA requires new or modified sources to notify neighboring states of potential impacts from sources within the State. Albuquerque-Bernalillo County regulations require that affected states, tribes and federal land managers receive notice prior to the commencement of any construction or significant modification of a major source. In addition, no source or sources located in Albuquerque-Bernalillo County have been identified by EPA as having any interstate impacts under section 126 in any pending actions relating to any air pollutant. Section 115 of the CAA authorizes EPA to require a state to revise its SIP under certain conditions to alleviate international transport into another country. There are no final findings under section 115 of the CAA against New Mexico with respect to any air pollutant. Thus, the State's SIP does not need to include any provisions to meet the requirements of section 115. Based upon review of the State's infrastructure SIP submission for the 2008 Pb NAAQS, and relevant statutory and regulatory authorities and provisions referenced in the submission or referenced in New Mexico's SIP, EPA believes that Albuquerque-Bernalillo County has the adequate infrastructure needed to address sections 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) and (II) (all 4 interstate transport requirements), and 110(a)(2)(D)(ii) for the 2008 Pb NAAQS and is proposing to approve this element of the May 2, 2012, submission. (E) Adequate authority, resources, implementation, and oversight: The SIP must provide for the following: (1) Necessary assurances that the state (and other entities within the state responsible for implementing the SIP) will have adequate personnel, funding, and authority under state or local law to implement the SIP, and that there are no legal impediments to such implementation; (2) requirements relating to state boards; and (3) necessary assurances that the state has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation of any plan provision for which it relies on local governments or other entities to carry out that portion of the plan. Both elements A and E address the requirement that there is adequate authority to implement and enforce the SIP and that there are no legal impediments. This i-SIP submission for the 2008 Pb NAAQS describes the SIP regulations governing the various functions of personnel within the AQP and the Air Board, including the administrative, technical support, planning, enforcement, and permitting functions of the program. With respect to funding, the resources to carry out the plan are provided through General Funds, Permit Fees and the CAA grant process. Permit Fees are collected under the authority of section 74-2-7. As required by the CAA and the Environmental Improvement Act (EIA), the SIP stipulates that any members of the board or body, or the head of an agency with similar powers, adequately disclose any potential conflicts of interest. NMSA 1978 section 74-1-4 provides the Air Board contain at least a majority of members who represent the public interest and do not derive any significant portion of their income from persons subject to or who appear before the board on issues related to the CAA or the Air Act. Board members are required to recuse themselves from rule- makings in which their impartiality may reasonably be questioned. With respect to assurances that the Air Board has responsibility to implement the SIP adequately when it VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:10 Sep Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules 9Albuquerque/Bernalillo County SIP http:// yosemite.epa.gov/r6/Sip0304.nsf/ home!OpenView&Start=1&Count=30&Collapse=4.4#4.4 orhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/ 52.1620. authorizes local or other agencies to carry out portions of the plan, the EIA and the AQCA designate the Air Board as the primary air pollution control agency within Albuquerque-Bernalillo County. The statutes allow for local agencies to carry out some or all of the Act's responsibilities. The Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board assumes jurisdiction for local administration and enforcement of the AQCA in Bernalillo County. There are Albuquerque/Bernalillo County SIP provisions which are part of the New Mexico SIP. 9 (F) Stationary source monitoring system: The SIP requires the establishment of a system to monitor emissions from stationary sources and to submit periodic emission reports. It must require the installation, maintenance, and replacement of equipment, and the implementation of other necessary steps, by owners or operators of stationary sources, to monitor emissions from sources. The SIP shall also require periodic reports on the nature and amounts of emissions and emissions-related data from sources, and require that the state correlate the source reports with emission limitations or standards established under the CAA. These reports must be made available for public inspection at reasonable times. Requirements in 20.11.47 NMAC, Emission Inventory Requirements provide for the reporting of emissions inventories in a format established by AQP on a schedule prescribed by the regulation. There also are SIP state regulations pertaining to sampling and testing and requirements for reporting of emissions inventories. In addition, SIP rules establish general requirements for maintaining records and reporting emissions. This information is used to track progress towards measuring the NAAQS, developing control and maintenance strategies, identifying sources and general emission levels, and determining compliance with SIP regulations and additional EPA requirements. (G) Emergency authority: The SIP must provide for authority to address activities causing imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment and to include contingency plans to implement such authorities as necessary. The AQCA provides the New Mexico Environment Department with authority to address environmental emergencies, inclusive of contingency plans to implement emergency episode provisions. Pursuant to 40 CFR 51, Subpart H, Prevention of Air Pollution Emergency Episodes, on January 26, 1989, the Air Board adopted the Air Pollution Contingency Plan for Bernalillo County [8/21/91, 56 FR 38074; 40 CFR 52.1639, Prevention of Air Emergency Episodes], which is part of the SIP, which covers air pollution episodes and the occurrence of an emergency due to the effects of the pollutants on the health of persons. (H) Future SIP revisions: States must have the authority to revise their SIPs in response to changes in the NAAQS, availability of improved methods for attaining the NAAQS, or in response to an EPA finding that the SIP is substantially inadequate to attain the NAAQS. Albuquerque-Bernalillo County's SIP is a compilation of regulations, plans and submittals that act to improve and maintain air quality in accordance with national standards. The authority to develop or revise the SIP is based on the authority to adopt new regulations and revise existing regulations to meet the NAAQS. NMSA 1978 section 74-7-5 gives the board the authority to perform these functions. Section 74-7-5 also gives the board the authority to adopt regulations to abate, control and prohibit air pollution throughout Albuquerque-Bernalillo County in accordance with the State Rules Act. Nothing in New Mexico's statutory or regulatory authority prohibits Albuquerque-Bernalillo County from revising the SIP in the event of a revision to the NAAQS. The AQCA specifically requires revisions to the SIP if the scenarios set forth in Section 110(a)(2)(H) occur. (I) Nonattainment areas: The CAA section 110(a)(2)(I) requires that in the case of a plan or plan revision for areas designated as nonattainment areas, states must meet applicable requirements of part D of the CAA, relating to SIP requirements for designated nonattainment areas. As noted earlier, EPA does not expect infrastructure SIP submissions to address subsection (I). The specific SIP submissions for designated nonattainment areas, as required under CAA title I, part D, are subject to different submission schedules than those for section 110 infrastructure elements. Instead, EPA will take action on part D attainment plan SIP submissions through a separate rulemaking process governed by the requirements for nonattainment areas, as described in part D. The Albuquerque-Bernalillo County nonattainment new source review (NNSR) provisions required for the 2008 Pb NAAQS and other NAAQS were approved as part of the SIP (72 FR 20728, April 26, 2007). Additionally, Albuquerque-Bernalillo County presently does not contain any non-attainment areas for Pb. (J) Consultation with government officials, public notification, PSD and visibility protection: The SIP must meet the following three requirements: (1) Relating to interagency consultation regarding certain CAA requirements; (2) relating to public notification of NAAQS exceedances and related issues; and, (3) prevention of significant deterioration of air quality and visibility protection. (1) Interagency consultation: As required by the AQCA, there must be a public hearing before the adoption of any regulations or emission control requirements and all interested persons must be given a reasonable opportunity to submit data, view documents, or argue orally or in writing and to examine testimony of witnesses from the hearing. In addition, the AQAC provides for the power and duty to ''advise, consult, contract with and cooperate with local authorities, other states, the federal government and other interested persons or groups in regard to matters of common interest in the field of air quality control... ''. Furthermore, New Mexico's PSD SIP rules mandate public participation and notification regarding permitting applications to any other state or local air pollution control agencies, local government officials of the city or county where the source will be located, tribal authorities, and Federal Land Managers (FLMs) whose lands may be affected by emissions from the source or modification. The State's Transportation Conformity SIP rules also provide procedures for interagency consultation, resolution of conflicts, and public notification. (2) Public Notification: The i-SIP provides the SIP regulatory citations requiring the Air Board to regularly notify the public of instances or areas in which any NAAQS are exceeded, advise the public of the health hazard associated with such exceedances, and enhance public awareness of measures that can prevent such exceedances and ways in which the public can participate in efforts to improve air quality. 20.11.82 NMAC, Rulemaking Procedures\u2014Air Quality Board, stipulates notice requirements for rulemaking and is used as a guide for notice requirements when adopting SIPs. VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:10 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules (3) PSD and Visibility Protection: The PSD requirements here are the same as those addressed under (C). The Albuquerque-Bernalillo County, New Mexico SIP requirements relating to visibility and regional haze are not affected when EPA establishes or revises a NAAQS. Therefore, EPA believes that there are no new visibility protection requirements due to the revision of the NAAQS, and consequently there are no newly applicable visibility protection obligations pursuant to infrastructure element J after the promulgation of a new or revised NAAQS. (K) Air quality and modeling/data: The SIP must provide for performing air quality modeling, as prescribed by EPA, to predict the effects on ambient air quality of any emissions of any NAAQS pollutant, and for submission of such data to EPA upon request. AQP has the duty, authority and technical capability to conduct air quality modeling, pursuant to the AQCA, in order to assess the effect on ambient air quality of relevant pollutant emissions; and can provide relevant data as part of the permitting and NAAQS implementation process. AQP follows EPA guidelines for air dispersion modeling. Upon request, AQP will submit current and future data relating to air quality modeling to EPA. (L) Permitting Fees: The SIP must require each major stationary source to pay permitting fees to the permitting authority, as a condition of any permit required under the CAA, to cover the cost of reviewing and acting upon any application for such a permit, and, if the permit is issued, the costs of implementing and enforcing the terms of the permit. The fee requirement applies until a fee program established by the state pursuant to title V of the CAA, relating to operating permits, is approved by EPA. The fee requirements of 20.11.2 NMAC have been approved by EPA as meeting the CAA requirements and were incorporated into the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County, New Mexico SIP [4/10/80, 45 FR 24468]. Albuquerque-Bernalillo County's title V operating permit program codified at 20.11.42 NMAC, Operating Permits, was approved by EPA on 9/8/04 [FR vol. 69, No. 173, pp. 54244-47]. In addition, see element (E) above for the description of the mandatory collection of permitting fees outlined in the SIP. (M) Consultation/participation by affected local entities: The SIP must provide for consultation and participation by local political subdivisions affected by the SIP. New Mexico State Statute Section 74- 2-5.2 State Air Pollution Control Agency; Specific Duties and Powers of the Department, states that, ''The department is the state air pollution control agency for all purposes under federal legislation relating to pollution. The department is required to ''advise, consult, contract and cooperate with local authorities, other states, the federal government and other interested persons or groups in regard to matters of common interest in the field of air quality control.'' Also see element (J) above for a discussion of the SIP's public participation process, the authority to advise and consult, and the PSD SIP's public participation requirements. III. Proposed Action EPA is proposing to approve the May 2, 2012, infrastructure SIP submission from Albuquerque-Bernalillo County, New Mexico, which addresses the requirements of CAA sections 110(a)(1) and (2) as applicable to the 2008 Pb NAAQS. Specifically, EPA is proposing to approve the following infrastructure elements: 110(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), (J), (K), (L), and (M). EPA is not proposing action pertaining to section 110(a)(2)(I)\u2014Nonattainment Area Plan or Plan Revisions as EPA believes this need not be addressed in the i-SIP. Based upon review of the state's infrastructure SIP submissions and relevant statutory and regulatory authorities and provisions referenced in these submissions or referenced in Albuquerque-Bernalillo County, New Mexico's SIP, EPA believes that Albuquerque-Bernalillo County, New Mexico has the infrastructure in place to address all applicable required elements of sections 110(a)(1) and (2) to ensure that the 2008 Pb NAAQS are implemented in the county. We also are proposing to approve the State's demonstration that it meets the four statutory requirements for interstate transport of Pb emissions. IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this action merely proposes to approve state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this action: Is not a ''significant regulatory action'' subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993); Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.); Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.); Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4); Does not have Federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999); Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997); Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA; and Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994). In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the proposed rule does not have tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).

Make sure to submit your comments by the comment period deadline identified. II. What is the background of these SIP submissions? This rulemaking addresses submissions from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) dated July 2, 2015. These submissions are intended to address CAA requirements relating to the state board requirements under section 128, as well as infrastructure requirements of section 110 relating to state boards for the 1997 ozone, 1997 PM 2.5, 2006 PM 2.5, 2008 Pb, 2008 ozone, 2010 NO 2, and 2010 SO 2NAAQS. The requirement for states to make infrastructure SIP submissions arises out of CAA section 110(a)(1). Pursuant to section 110(a)(1), states must make SIP submissions ''within 3 years (or such shorter period as the Administrator may prescribe) after the promulgation of a national primary ambient air quality standard (or any revision thereof),'' and these SIP submissions are to provide for the ''implementation, maintenance, and enforcement'' of such NAAQS. The statute directly imposes on states the duty to make these SIP submissions, and the requirement to make the submissions is not conditioned upon EPA's taking any action other than promulgating a new or revised NAAQS. Section 110(a)(2) includes a list of specific elements that ''[e]ach such plan'' submission must address. EPA has historically referred to these SIP submissions made for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of CAA section 110(a)(1) and (2) as ''infrastructure SIP'' submissions. Although the term ''infrastructure SIP'' does not appear in the CAA, EPA uses the term to distinguish this particular type of SIP submission from submissions that are intended to satisfy other SIP requirements under the CAA. This specific rulemaking is only taking action on the CAA 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) element of these infrastructure SIP requirements, which is the only infrastructure SIP element addressed in WDNR's submittal dated July 2, 2015. III. What guidance is EPA using to evaluate these SIP submissions? EPA's guidance for these submissions is highlighted in an October 2, 2007, guidance document entitled ''Guidance on SIP Elements Required Under Sections 110(a)(1) and (2) for the 1997 8-hour Ozone and PM 2.51National Ambient Air Quality Standards'' (2007 Guidance). Further guidance is provided in a September 13, 2013, document entitled ''Guidance on Infrastructure State Implementation Plan (SIP) Elements under CAA Sections 110(a)(1) and (2)'' (2013 Guidance). IV. What is the result of EPA's review of these SIP submissions? Pursuant to section 110(a), states must provide reasonable notice and opportunity for public hearing for all infrastructure SIP submissions. WDNR provided notice of a public comment period on May 9, 2015, held a public hearing at WDNR State Headquarters on June 9, 2015, and closed the public comment period on June 11, 2015. No comments were received. Wisconsin provided a detailed synopsis of how various components of its SIP meet each of the applicable requirements in section 128 and 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) for the 1997 ozone, 1997 PM 2.5, 2006 PM 2.5, 2008 Pb, 2008 ozone, 2010 NO 2, and 2010 SO 2NAAQS, as applicable. The following review evaluates the state's submissions. A. Section 128 Section 128 of the CAA includes just one subsection labeled ''(a)'', which contains two explicit requirements: (1) That any board or body which approves permits or enforcement orders under this chapter shall have at least a majority of members who represent the public interest and do not derive any significant portion of their income from persons subject to permits and enforcement orders under this chapter, and (2) that any potential conflicts of interest by members of such board or body or the head of an executive agency with similar powers be adequately disclosed. On July 2, 2015, WDNR submitted rules from Wisconsin Statutes (Wis. Stats.) for incorporation into the SIP, pursuant to section 128 of the CAA. Wisconsin maintains a state board, called the Wisconsin Natural Resources VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:10 Sep Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules Board (NRB). However, the NRB's functions are purely regulatory, advisory, and policy-making. Under Wis. Stats. 15.05, the administrative powers and duties of the WDNR, including issuance of permits and enforcement orders, are vested in the secretary. Under the statutes that govern its operations, the NRB does not and cannot approve permits or enforcement orders. Therefore, Wisconsin has no further obligations under section 128(a)(1) of the CAA. Under section 128(a)(2) of the CAA, the head of the executive agency with the power to approve permits or enforcement orders must adequately disclose any potential conflicts of interest. In Wisconsin, this power is vested in the Secretary of the WDNR. Wis. Stats. 19.45(2) prevents financial gain of any public official, which addresses the issue of deriving any significant portion of income from persons subject to permits and enforcement orders. Additionally, Wis. Stats. 19.46 prevents a public official from taking actions where there is a conflict of interest. As a public official under Wis. Stats. 19, the Secretary of the WDNR is subject to these ethical obligations. As requested in WDNR's submission, EPA is proposing to incorporate Wis. Stats. 15.05, 19.45(2), and 19.46 into Wisconsin's SIP. EPA proposes that these statutes satisfy all requirements under section 128 of the CAA. B. Section 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) Section 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the CAA also requires each SIP to contain provisions that comply with the state board requirements of section 128 of the CAA. In its submittal dated July 2, 2015, WDNR requested that Wis. Stats. 15.05, 19.45(2), and 19.46 be applied not only to obligations under section 128 of the CAA, but also to infrastructure SIP requirements for the 1997 ozone, 1997 PM 2.5,2006 PM 2.5, 2008 Pb, 2008 ozone, 2010 NO 2, and 2010 SO 2NAAQS. EPA therefore proposes that Wisconsin has met the infrastructure SIP requirements of this portion of section 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) with respect to the 1997 ozone, 1997 PM 2.5, 2006 PM 2.5, 2008 Pb, 2008 ozone, 2010 NO 2, and 2010 SO 2NAAQS. V. What Action is EPA Taking? EPA is proposing to incorporate Wis. Stats. 15.05, 19.45(2), and 19.46 into Wisconsin's SIP. EPA is further proposing to approve these submissions as meeting CAA obligations under section 128, as well as 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) for the 1997 ozone, 1997 PM 2.5,2006 PM 2.5, 2008 Pb, 2008 ozone, 2010 NO 2, and 2010 SO 2NAAQS. VI. Incorporation by Reference In this rule, EPA is proposing to include in a final EPA rule regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, EPA is proposing to incorporate by reference Wis. Stats. 15.05, effective July 2, 2013, Wis. Stats. 19.45(2), effective May 11, 1990, and Wis. Stats. 19.46, effective February 17, 2007. EPA has made, and will continue to make, these documents generally available electronically through www.regulations.gov and/or in hard copy at the appropriate EPA office (see the ADDRESSES section of this preamble for more information). VII. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the CAA and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this action: Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 2011); Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.); Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.); Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4); Does not have Federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999); Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997); Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA; and Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994). In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).

Purpose of Regulatory Action This rulemaking is being conducted in order to add new-onset COPD and acute traumatic injury to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions (List). Following requests by the directors of the WTC Health Program Clinical Centers of Excellence (CCE) and Data Centers to the WTC Health Program to consider adding the two conditions, 1 the Administrator conducted literature reviews regarding COPD and acute traumatic injury among 9/11 responders and survivors. Based on the findings of those reviews, he determined that the evidence for causal relationships between 9/11 exposures and COPD and acute traumatic injury, respectively, provides bases for the addition of both health conditions. The Administrator proposes adding new-onset COPD and acute traumatic injury to the List. B. Summary of Major Provisions This rule proposes the addition of new-onset COPD and acute traumatic injury to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions in 42 CFR 88.1. As a result, these conditions will be eligible for treatment and monitoring coverage by the WTC Health Program. C. Costs and Benefits The proposed addition of new-onset COPD and acute traumatic injury by this rulemaking is estimated to cost the WTC Health Program between $5,124,477 and $9,350,966 in 2015 and 2016. All of the costs to the WTC Health Program are transfers. Benefits to current and future WTC Health Program members may include improved access to care and better treatment outcomes than in the absence of Program coverage. II. Public Participation Interested persons or organizations are invited to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written views, opinions, recommendations, and/or data. Comments are invited on any topic related to this proposed rule. The Administrator invites comments specifically on the following questions related to this rulemaking: 1. Is September 11, 2003 an appropriate deadline by which an individual must have received initial medical treatment for an acute traumatic injury? 2. Is there evidence of acute traumatic injuries that occurred as a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that would not be covered by the proposed definition? What are the types of long-term consequences or medically associated health conditions that result from the treatment or progression of acute traumatic injuries like those sustained on or after September 11, 2001? 3. Are data available on the chronic care needs of individuals who suffered acute traumatic injuries during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and its aftermath that the Administrator can use to estimate the number of current and future WTC Health Program members who may seek certification of WTC-related acute traumatic injuries as well as treatment costs? 4. Are data available on the prevalence and cost estimates for new- onset COPD? Comments received, including attachments and other supporting materials, are part of the public record and subject to public disclosure. Do not include any information in your comment or supporting materials that you consider confidential or inappropriate for public disclosure.

Dori Reissman and John Halpin, WTC Health Program at 8. The Administrator has determined that good cause exists to extend the traditional 30-day comment period to 45 days. The comment period is extended to provide interested parties, including peer-reviewers, adequate time to review the proposed rule and supporting scientific literature and to submit written comments to the docket. III. Background A. WTC Health Program Statutory Authority Title I of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-347), amended the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) to add Title XXXIII, 2establishing the WTC Health Program within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The WTC Health Program provides medical monitoring and treatment benefits to eligible firefighters and related personnel, law enforcement officers, and rescue, recovery, and cleanup workers who responded to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City, at the Pentagon, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania (responders), and to eligible persons who were present in the dust or dust cloud on September 11, 2001 or who worked, resided, or attended school, childcare, or adult daycare in the New York City disaster area (survivors). All references to the Administrator of the WTC Health Program (Administrator) in this notice mean the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) or his or her designee. Section 3312(a)(6) of the PHS Act requires the Administrator to conduct rulemaking to propose the addition of a health condition to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions (List) codified in 42 CFR 88.1. B. Methods Used by the Administrator to Determine Whether to Add Non- Cancer Health Conditions to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions Consideration of an addition to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions (List) may be initiated at the Administrator's discretion 3or following receipt of a petition by an interested party. 4Under 42 CFR 88.17, the Administrator has established a process by which health conditions may be considered for addition to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions in \u00a7 88.1. Pursuant to sec. 3312(a)(6)(D) of Title XXXIII of the PHS Act, the Administrator is required to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking and allow interested parties to comment on the proposed rule. The Administrator has established a methodology for evaluating whether to add non-cancer health conditions to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions; this methodology is published online in the Policies and Procedures section of the WTC Health Program Web site. 5The Administrator will direct the WTC Health Program Associate Director for Science (ADS) to conduct a review of the scientific literature to determine if the available scientific information has the potential to provide a basis for a decision on whether to add the condition to the List. The literature review will include published, peer- reviewed direct observational and/or epidemiological studies about the health condition among 9/11-exposed populations. The studies will be reviewed for their relevance, quantity, and quality to provide a basis for deciding whether to propose adding the health condition to the List. Where the available evidence has the potential to provide a basis for a decision, the ADS will further assess the scientific and medical evidence to determine whether a causal relationship between 9/11 exposures and the health condition is supported. A health condition may be added to the List if published, peer- reviewed direct observational or epidemiologic studies provide substantial support 6for a causal relationship between 9/11 exposures and the health condition in 9/11- exposed populations. If only epidemiologic studies are available and they provide only modest support 7for a causal relationship between 9/11 exposures and the health condition, the Administrator may then evaluate additional published, peer-reviewed epidemiologic studies, conducted among non-9/11-exposed populations, evaluating associations between the health condition of interest and 9/11 agents. 8If that additional assessment establishes substantial support for a causal relationship between a 9/11 agent or agents and the health condition, the health condition may be added to the List. IV. COPD A. CCE and Data Center Request to Consider Adding New-Onset COPD On May 13, 2014, the Administrator received a letter from the directors of the WTC Health Program Clinical Centers of Excellence (CCEs) and Data Centers, asking that the Administrator consider all requests for certification of COPD. 9The Zadroga Act and WTC Health Program regulations identify ''WTC-exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)'' as a covered health condition. 10However, the CCE and Data Center directors requested that the Administrator determine that COPD is a certifiable WTC condition, regardless of the date of onset. 11In order to certify all cases of COPD, including cases diagnosed after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, new-onset COPD would need to be added to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions. The Administrator directed the ADS to initiate a review of research regarding COPD in 9/11- exposed populations in order to determine whether there was support for such an addition. B. Literature Review In accordance with the established methodology for the addition of non- cancers to the List, the Administrator charged the ADS with conducting a review of the relevant, peer-reviewed, published studies of 9/11-exposed populations. Because definitions of COPD vary among authorities, the ADS first had to identify the best definition for the purposes of the WTC Health Program.

Case series and review papers were not found to be relevant. 19Weiden MD, Ferrier N, Nolan A, Rom WN, Comfort A, Gustave J, Zeig-Owens R, Zheng S, Goldring RM, Berger KI, Cosenza K, Lee R, Webber MP, Kelly KJ, Aldrich TK, Prezant D [2010]. Obstructive airways disease with air trapping among firefighters exposed to World Trade Center dust. Chest. 137(3):566-574. The ADS looked to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a collaboration between the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization as a point of reference. GOLD defines COPD as persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases. 12COPD is an umbrella term that encompasses those pulmonary conditions exhibiting chronic inflammation of the airways, lung tissue, and pulmonary blood vessels and persistent airflow limitation: A combination of large and small airways disease (obstructive chronic bronchitis 13and obstructive bronchiolitis, respectively) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema). 14According to GOLD, the three principal symptoms of COPD are dyspnea (shortness of breath), chronic cough, and sputum production; the most common early symptom is dyspnea on exertion (DOE). COPD should always be considered when these lower respiratory symptoms and history of exposure to risk factors for the disease are present. Because many of the symptoms of COPD are similar to asthma symptoms, both conditions are classified as obstructive airways diseases (OAD). The airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible after bronchodilator therapy, whereas the obstruction in COPD is poorly-reversible or irreversible. 15While asthma is not included under the term COPD, people with asthma may develop COPD over time. 16 Diagnosis of COPD requires the use of a spirometry test, which measures how much and how quickly an individual inhales and exhales air from his or her lungs. The diagnosis of COPD is confirmed by a spirometry test demonstrating poorly-reversible or irreversible airways obstruction (i.e., the proportion of vital capacity that an individual is able to expire in the first second of expiration [FEV1/FVC or FEV1%] is below 70 percent) after use of a bronchodilator. Although spirometry is the standard diagnostic test for COPD, in some circumstances, impulse oscillometry (IOS) can be complementary to spirometry, especially in patients at advanced age and with physical or mental disorders who cannot be diagnosed through spirometry. IOS assesses airway resistance and frequency dependence of resistance (FDR). FDR provides a measure of nonuniformity of airflow distribution, which may reflect regional functional abnormalities in the distal airways not captured by the spirometry test. In accordance with the GOLD definition, described above, the ADS initiated a literature search for ''chronic obstructive yielded 108 study citations; the associated study abstracts were reviewed for relevance to 9/11-exposed populations. 18Of the 108 citations identified, 36 were determined to be relevant epidemiologic studies of 9/11- exposed populations. Relevant papers were then further reviewed for their quality and potential to provide a basis for deciding whether to propose adding the health condition to the List of WTC- Related Health Conditions. Only papers that reported post-9/11 lower respiratory symptomatology and objective measurements of airways obstruction, such as pre- and post-9/11 spirometry with bronchodilator administration or IOS, were found to exhibit potential support for an addition recommendation. Quality was assessed by the presence or absence of major limitations, such as small size or poor comparability of study groups; use of unreliable or invalid measurement instruments; and if little or no attention was given to key confounders which would call into question the validity of the study results. Based on these criteria, the ADS found six relevant papers which exhibited potential to provide a basis for a decision regarding whether to propose the addition of new- onset COPD to the List. The six papers are summarized below. Weiden et al. [2010] 19sought to determine the pathophysiologic basis for observed reductions in lung function among 1,720 Fire Department of New York (FDNY) rescue workers (firefighters and emergency medical service personnel) who presented for pulmonary evaluation between September 12, 2001 and March 10, 2008. Exposure intensity was categorized based on first arrival time at the WTC site as follows: High exposure if they arrived during the morning of September 11, 2001, intermediate exposure if they arrived after the morning of September 11, 2001, but within the first 2 days, and low exposure if they arrived between days 3 and 14. Pre-9/11 spirometry results were available for 92 percent of participants. Researchers obtained 919 full pulmonary function tests (bronchodilator response, lung volumes, diffusing capacity); 1,219 methacholine challenge 982 high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans, allowing them report correlations between physiologic and radiographic measures. All physiologic tests pointed to airway obstruction with air trapping (demonstrated by the increase in residual volume) which correlated with the decline in FEV1 post-9/11, bronchodilator responsiveness, and hyperreactivity. HRCT findings of bronchial wall thickening (which reflects proximal airway inflammation and/or remodeling) and emphysema were reported in 26 percent and 12 percent of the participants, respectively.

The authors concluded that airways injury and obstruction were the predominant pathophysiologic characteristics among study participants. Aldrich et al. [2010] 20evaluated the long-term effects of exposure to WTC dust on FDNY members who responded to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The authors analyzed the pulmonary function (FEV1) of both active and retired FDNY rescue workers on the basis of spirometry routinely performed at intervals of 12 to 18 months from March 12, 2000 to September 11, 2008. The authors observed a large decline in FEV1 values at 6 months and 12 months after September 11, 2001, especially among the firefighters with the heaviest dust exposure (those arriving at the WTC site on the morning of September 11, 2001). After the initial decline in the first year, the adjusted FEV1 continued to decline in smokers and non-smokers with little or no recovery in lung function during the subsequent 6 years. The authors concluded that the large decline in FEV1 after September 11, 2001, was indicative of airways injury due to 9/11 exposures. Webber et al. [2011] 21examined the prevalence of physician-diagnosed respiratory conditions in FDNY members up to 9 years after rescue/recovery efforts in the New York City disaster area. The authors reviewed self- reported physician diagnoses of asthma, chronic bronchitis, COPD/emphysema, and sinusitis from the most recent physical health survey conducted by the FDNY Bureau of Health Services and physician diagnoses obtained from FDNY electronic medical records. The study population consisted of 10,943 firefighters and EMS workers who first arrived at the site within 2 weeks of the terrorist attacks. All participants were free of COPD and emphysema before September 11, 2001, and less than 1 percent had asthma. The authors found the prevalence rates of both self- reported and physician diagnoses of OAD, i.e., asthma, chronic bronchitis, COPD/emphysema, and sinusitis were elevated, exceeding rates in the general population for individuals of a similar age. The highest proportion of FDNY responders with physician-diagnosed OAD had the lowest lung function (FEV1% predicted), indicating that 9/11 exposure had resulted in disease. The authors were unable to attribute these diagnoses to any other occupational exposures. Weakley et al. [2011] 22compared the prevalence of COPD/emphysema, and bronchitis) in 9/11- exposed FDNY firefighters to the prevalence in demographically similar National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) participants by year. The authors analyzed 45,988 questionnaires completed by 10,999 firefighters from October 2001 to September 2010. They reported higher rates of respiratory diagnoses in 9/11-exposed firefighters compared to the U.S. male general population, regardless of smoking status. Prevalence ratios, comparing FDNY to NHIS rates, were highest for COPD/emphysema and bronchitis. Because of the decrease in structural fires, improvement in personal protective equipment, and the decline in smoking rates among firefighters, the authors discounted normal firefighting activities as the cause of the increase in respiratory diagnoses. Friedman et al. [2011] 23also examined the relationship between 9/11 exposures, post-9/11 lower respiratory symptoms, and pulmonary function in a nested case-control study of exposed survivors 7-8 years after September 11, 2001. The cases examined in the study were 274 WTC Health Registry participants who reported post-9/11 onset of a lower respiratory symptom. One-third of the cases further reported post-9/11 physician diagnoses of asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or emphysema. Registry participants without lower respiratory symptoms or inhaler use and no current or past lung disease were used as control subjects. Only never-smokers participated in this study. Pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry and IOS. A higher proportion of abnormal spirometry results (obstructive and restrictive patterns) was found among cases than control subjects. IOS measurements of airway resistance and FDR (indicative of distal airways dysfunction) were significantly higher in cases than in control subjects, even when spirometry was normal. Lower respiratory symptoms were found significantly associated with IOS measurements but not with spirometry. Both exposure factors and IOS outcomes were associated with persistent symptoms, but exposure was not associated with IOS outcomes in the absence of symptoms. Certain exposure factors, including dust cloud density, smoke at home or work, and dust at home or work, were the strongest predictors of case status. The authors concluded that the association between post-9/11 onset of lower respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities detected by spirometry and IOS several years later were indicative of persistent airway disease with distal airways dysfunction as a contributing mechanism for these symptoms. In a follow-up to the Friedman study reviewed above, Maslow et al. [2012] 24 assessed associations between repeatedly reported lower respiratory symptoms and detailed measures of both acute and chronic 9/11-related exposures. Acute exposures involved contact with the dust cloud created by the towers' collapse. Chronic factors were based on conditions in the home or work site through December 31, 2001, such as the extent of dust coverage; the duration of detectable smoke, fumes, and other odors; and whether the participant engaged in or was exposed to cleaning. The authors concluded that both acute and chronic exposures to the events of 9/11 were independently associated, often in a dose-dependent manner, with lower respiratory symptoms reported 2 to 3 years and again 5 to 6 years after September 11, 2001 by individuals who lived and worked in the WTC area. C. Administrator's Determination Concerning New-Onset COPD The ADS assessed each of the six studies described above according to the methodology established by the Administrator. The studies were assessed for relevance, quality, bias, and confounding by applying criteria extrapolated from the Bradford Hill criteria. 25 VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:10 Sep Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules 9/11 exposure and a health condition (including the magnitude of the effect and statistical significance); (ii) Consistency of the findings across multiple studies; (iii) Biological gradient, or dose-response relationships between 9/11 exposures and the health condition; and (iv) Plausibility and coherence with known facts about the biology of the health condition.

Emerging exposures and respiratory health: World Trade Center dust. Proc Am Thorac Soc. 7(2):142-145. First, the studies were assessed for strength of the association between 9/11 exposures and a health condition (including the magnitude of the effect and statistical significance). Weiden et al. reported statistically significant longitudinal declines in FEV1, greater than expected by age or weight gain, among firefighters with documented high levels of exposure. Aldrich et al. reported significant substantial declines in FEV1 over the first year after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and little lung function recovery among the FDNY participants 6 years after the disaster. The firefighters with the heaviest dust exposure (those arriving at the WTC site on the morning of the disaster) had significantly larger declines than did those arriving at later times. Importantly, the findings of both studies were independent of smoking history. A major limitation of both studies was the lack of spirometry during the first days after September 11, 2001, preventing the authors from determining whether some workers had an even more severe immediate decline in FEV1 and subsequent incomplete recovery. The possibility of systematic bias occurring due to the change of spirometer equipment between measurements and a loss-to-follow-up effect due to drop out of severely affected participants from the study over time (survivor effect) were additional concerns [Aldrich et al.]; however, these appeared to have been minimized by further statistical analyses and strong cohort retention rate, respectively. In addition to the Weiden and Aldrich studies, strength of association was also demonstrated by Weakley et al., who found that annual estimates from 2007- 2009 indicated prevalence ratios of chronic bronchitis and COPD/emphysema that were significantly higher among exposed white male firefighters than unexposed white males (stratified by age and smoking status), with greater disparity in the younger age group (18-44 years). Similarly, Webber et al. reported significant associations of 9/11 exposures and reduced pulmonary function with physician-diagnosed asthma, chronic bronchitis, and COPD/ emphysema in a high proportion of FDNY rescue workers, indicating that persistent respiratory injury since exposure to the WTC had resulted in obstructive airways disease. A major limitation of both studies was the use of self-reported diagnoses, including diagnoses made by any physician (FDNY or otherwise) and self-diagnoses, which may have over-inflated the prevalence rates. This limitation is a concern, especially for COPD/emphysema, which can be defined in a variety of ways; the definition used can have a significant impact on the population estimates of the burden of disease. However, many cases of COPD/ emphysema in this cohort were also diagnosed by FDNY physicians [Webber et al.] who were trained to diagnose respiratory diseases using defined diagnostic criteria after integrating the history, physical examination, spirometry, pulmonary function testing and chest imaging findings. Finally, among WTC Health Registry (Registry) participants, exposure factors (dust cloud density, smoke at home or work, and dust at home or work) and IOS outcomes (indicative of distal airways obstruction) were statistically associated with persistent post-9/11 onset of lower respiratory symptoms [Friedman et al.]. Both acute and chronic exposures to the events of September 11, 2001 were independently associated with lower respiratory symptoms among individuals who lived and worked in the area of the WTC site [Maslow et al.]. Limitations of these studies include the use of spirometry and IOS measurements from a single visit and the possibility of selection bias from Registry surveys. However, the demographics were similar among Registry participants and those who were eligible but chose not to participate in the studies. The studies were next assessed for consistency of their findings. Objective findings of new onset, post-9/11 and persistent airflow limitation, as well as physician-diagnosed cases of COPD, including chronic bronchitis and COPD/ emphysema, were identified among symptomatic FDNY responders for whom pre-9/11 results were available [Weiden et Aldrich et al.; Webber et al.; Weakley et al.]. Elevated rates of lung function abnormalities, including distal airway dysfunction, new and persistent lower respiratory symptomatology, and a few post-9/11 self-reported physician diagnoses of chronic bronchitis, COPD, and emphysema were also described among non-FDNY residents and area workers up to 9 years after September 11, 2001 [Friedman et al.; Maslow et al.]. The studies were also reviewed to assess the biological gradient or dose- response relationships between 9/11 exposures and the health condition. Newly developed lower respiratory symptoms and persistent pulmonary function abnormalities suggestive of airways injury and obstruction were significantly associated with 9/11 exposure in the FDNY studies, even after accounting for cigarette smoking. [Weiden et al.; Aldrich et al.; Webber et al.; Weakley et al.] Maslow et al. observed strong, significant associations and dose-response relationships between lower respiratory symptoms and every measure of severity of dust cloud exposure among WTC Health Registry participants. Weiden et al. also found a dose-response gradient (upward trend) in FDNY responders presenting for pulmonary evaluation due to reports of functional impairment or abnormalities in screening spirometry or chest radiographs. However, in this group of patients, exposure intensity had a significant impact only when spirometry obtained within 1 year post- 9/11 was compared to spirometry from 1 year pre-9/11. This suggests that while initial exposure intensity is the critical determinant of acute inflammation and early reductions in lung function, the clinical course of non-resolving airway inflammation and airways obstruction appears to be dependent not only on the intensity of the initial insult, but also on the host's inflammatory response, reflecting the complexity of genetic- environmental interactions. Finally, the studies were reviewed for plausibility and coherence with known facts about the biology of the health condition. Exposure to the massive alkaline dust cloud produced by the collapse of the WTC buildings was reportedly associated with upper and lower airway irritation with penetration into the bronchial tree, distal airways, and alveoli leading to respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function changes, and chronic inflammation. These are known contributing risk factors for the development of COPD. 26 Persistent pulmonary function findings of reduced FEV1, FVC and the ratio of FEV1/FVC, bronchial hyperreactivity, variable response to bronchodilator, and abnormal oscillometry were indicative of airway injury. Airway disease was also identified as bronchial wall thickening and air trapping by HRCT [Weiden et al.]. Air trapping (demonstrated by increased residual volume) was correlated with VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:10 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules 27Balmes J, Becklake M, Blanc P, Henneberger P, Kreiss K, Mapp C, Milton D, Schwartz D, Toren K, Viegi G [2003].

Am J Prev Med 25:79-87. bronchodilator responsiveness; however, the lack of quantitative radiographic measurement of air trapping was a limitation of this study. Interestingly, the authors noted that bronchodilator response can be seen in COPD patients when air trapping is present. Epidemiologically, identification of occupationally-related COPD is based on observing excess occurrence of COPD among exposed workers. 27Among 9/11-exposed populations, this excess occurrence can be expressed not only by the increased prevalence ratios of new-onset post-9/11 self-reported and physician-diagnosed chronic [Webber et al.; Weakley et al.], but also by evidence of persistent and progressive airflow limitation among all other symptomatic exposed groups [Friedman et al.; Maslow et al.]. In summary, obstructive airways disease is a category that includes both asthma and the umbrella term COPD, which itself includes obstructive chronic bronchitis, obstructive bronchiolitis, and emphysema. Upon assessment of the literature discussed above, the Administrator has found evidence that exposure to WTC dust is associated with the development of new-onset lower respiratory symptoms, prolonged airway inflammation and persistent airflow limitation, which are the main indicators of chronic airways obstruction. While it is difficult to demonstrate that the airway obstruction found in WTC survivors and responders is due to COPD versus asthma, three studies reported cases of physician- diagnosed COPD/emphysema, one reported on IOS findings of air trapping and increased small airways resistance, and another study reported on HRCT findings of bronchial wall thickening, air trapping and emphysema, indicating that some proportion of OAD cases found in WTC survivors and responders could be interpreted as COPD. Further, because some cases of asthma are known to progress to COPD, it is likely that some of the diagnosed cases of asthma seen in these and other epidemiologic studies of the 9/11- exposed populations have already progressed to COPD. In order to propose the addition of a health condition to the List, the Administrator must determine with high confidence that the evidence supports the findings regarding a causal association between 9/11 exposure(s) and the health condition. In this instance, the Administrator finds there is substantial evidence that the 9/11 exposures produced chronic airway inflammation manifested by persistent lower respiratory symptomatology and decline in pulmonary function which may have progressed to new-onset COPD in a proportion of exposed subjects in the period since exposure, independently from any cigarette smoking among the cohort. This evidence provides substantial support for a causal relationship between 9/11 exposures and new-onset COPD. V. Acute Traumatic Injury A. CCE and Data Center Request To Consider Adding Acute Traumatic Injury On May 13, 2014, the Administrator received a letter from the directors of the WTC Health Program CCEs and Data Centers supporting ''coverage of not only heavy lifting or repetitive strain but significant traumatic injuries like head trauma, burns, fractures, tendon tears and serious complex sprains'' within the WTC Health Program. 28The directors suggested that such significant traumatic injuries should be included under the Program's existing coverage of musculoskeletal disorders. The directors offered data collected by the WTC Health Program Data Centers and the WTC Health Registry, demonstrating the numbers of individuals who might need chronic care for traumatic injuries. The Administrator was also aware that some individuals have experienced certain musculoskeletal injuries or other injuries caused by known hazards present at sites of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that may not meet the definition provided in the Act for musculoskeletal disorders. Based on these concerns, the Administrator requested that the ADS conduct a literature review regarding acute traumatic injuries among 9/11-exposed individuals. B. Literature Review In accordance with the methodology discussed above, the ADS initiated a search of published, peer-reviewed studies of traumatic injuries suffered by responders, recovery workers, and survivors as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and the subsequent response and recovery efforts. Search terms used in the literature review included, literature search yielded over 300 citations; the associated study abstracts were reviewed for relevance to 9/11- exposed populations. 30Of the 300 citations identified, nine were determined to be relevant direct observational studies of 9/11-exposed populations. Relevant papers were then further reviewed for their quality and potential to provide a basis for deciding whether to propose adding the health condition to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions. Only papers that reported on acute traumatic injuries that occurred in at least one of the three September 11, 2001, terrorist attack sites during the period from September 11, 2001 to July 31, 2002 were found to exhibit potential for a recommendation. Quality was assessed by the absence of major study limitations and the use of standardized data collection methods such as standard forms or checklists. Based on these criteria, one relevant study was not found to be of sufficient quality to be included in the analysis because it did not identify the authors' data collection methods. Of the remaining eight studies, the methods used to collect the information and the definitions of the types of injuries vary. The time frame studied and the populations covered sometimes overlap between the studies, but taken together the studies provide an overview of the types of traumatic injuries that were sustained at the sites of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Accordingly, the ADS found the eight relevant papers exhibited potential to provide a basis for a decision regarding whether to propose the addition of acute traumatic injury to the List. The studies are summarized below. Berrios-Torres et al. [2003] 31 reviewed the data collected by five Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs) deployed by the U.S. Public Health Service to the site of the terrorist attack in New York City and by four hospital emergency departments (EDs) located within a 3-mile radius of the site. The DMATs and EDs were tasked with conducting surveillance of injury and illness among construction workers, VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:10 Sep Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules 32Perritt KR, Boal WL, Helix Group [2005].

FDNY and other fire department members, New York Police Department (NYPD) and other police department members, emergency medical service technicians (EMS), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Urban Search and Rescue members, all of whom were considered rescue and recovery workers. Of the 5,222 rescue workers who received medical care from either the DMATs or EDs between September 14, 2001 and October 11, 2001, 89 percent visited DMAT facilities and 12 percent visited EDs. Injuries including, but not limited to, sprain/strain, laceration, abrasion, contusion, fracture, and crush were the leading cause of visits to DMATs and EDs (19 percent) and hospital admissions (40 percent). Other visits and admissions were caused by burns, concussions, and eye-related conditions, including corneal abrasion and eye irritation. Perritt et al. [2005] 32analyzed DMAT data collected between September 14, 2001 and November 20, 2001. Patients who presented to the DMAT stations included rescue and recovery workers, as well as some members of the general public. Of the 9,349 patient visits recorded by the DMATs, more than 25 percent were attributed to traumatic injuries, not including eye injuries. Among the 22 patients with the highest triage severity classification, five involved traumatic injuries such as carbon monoxide poisonings, abrasions, needlesticks, electrical injuries, and first or second degree burns. Of the 149 patients with a moderate level of severity, 58 had traumatic injuries. For the 6,237 patients classified into the lowest severity category, 1,984 had traumatic injuries. Of the 116 patients transferred to a hospital emergency department, 67 were treated for traumatic injuries. Banauch et al. [2002] 33reported on all injuries and illnesses during the 24 hours after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and all traumatic injuries (including those sustained within the first 24 hours) sustained in the first 3 months after the attacks. Researchers identified cases from the FDNY Bureau of Health Services computerized medical data base. During the first 24 hours after the terrorist attacks, 240 FDNY rescue workers sought emergency medical treatment, including 28 individuals who required hospitalization. Twenty-four of the hospitalized FDNY workers had traumatic injuries including fractures, back trauma, knee meniscus tears, and facial burns. Researchers compared monthly mean incidence rates for crush injuries, lacerations, and fractures for the 9 months preceding the attacks with rates during the month after the attacks and found a 200 percent increase in the incident rate for crush injuries, a 35 percent increase for lacerations, and a 29 percent increase for fractures. Incident rates for such traumatic injuries after the first month following the attack then returned to levels similar to those observed before the attacks. According to the authors, nearly a year after the terrorist attacks, a total of 90 FDNY rescue workers were on medical leave or light duty assignments because of orthopedic injuries reported during the first 3 months of activity at the New York City site. The New York City Department of Health (NYCDOH) [2002] 34issued a report summarizing findings of a field investigation to assess injuries and use of healthcare services by survivors of the terrorist attack. The researchers reviewed emergency department (ED) and inpatient medical records at the four hospitals closest to the WTC site and a fifth hospital that served as a burn referral center. Of 790 injured survivors treated within 48 hours of the terrorist attacks, 50 percent received care within the first 7 hours and 18 percent were hospitalized. Among those hospitalized survivors, many sustained burns. Survivors with fractures, burns, closed head injuries, and crush injuries were hospitalized for additional treatment. Perritt et al. [2011] 35reviewed data collected between July 2002 and April 2004 from the WTC Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program (which would later be known as the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, the precursor to the WTC Health Program) to monitor the health of qualified New York City responders who worked and/or volunteered south of Canal Street in Manhattan, on the barge loading piers in Manhattan, or at the Staten Island landfill for at least 24 hours during September 11-30, 2001 or for at least 80 hours between September 11 and December 31, 2001. The screening program did not include FDNY members. Records from 7,810 participants were analyzed, with most participants' activities associated with work in either the construction industry or law enforcement. Approximately a third of the participants reported at least one injury or illness requiring medical treatment that was sustained during response activities. A total of 4,768 injuries/illnesses were reported by these participants, with 961 individuals reporting traumatic injuries such as lacerations, punctures, sprain/strains, tears, abrasions, contusions, burns, fractures, dislocations and 709 individuals reporting eye injuries. Yurt et al. [2005] 36reported on the number of burn patients (the authors did not specify whether the patients were responders or survivors) that had been transported to any of five burn units near the WTC site shortly after the attack. A total of 42 patients were transported from the WTC site and treated at one of the five burn units. Rutland-Brown et al. [2007] 37 reviewed the medical records of hospitalized responders (the authors do not clarify whether FDNY members are included in the study) and survivors of the terrorist attacks in New York City with the goal of identifying diagnosed and undiagnosed traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). 38The authors identified 14 cases of diagnosed and 21 cases of undiagnosed TBIs, from records provided by 36 hospitals. The leading cause of TBI was being hit by falling debris (22 cases), with other cases caused by being trampled or falling. One-third of the TBIs (13 cases) occurred among rescue workers. More than 3 years after the event, four out of six persons with an undiagnosed TBI who were contacted reported they currently were experiencing symptoms consistent with a TBI. Wang et al. [2005] 39reported on the experience of hospitals in the area around the Pentagon after the terrorist attacks. According to the authors, few VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:10 Sep Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules 4028 CFR 104.21(b). severely injured patients were treated at these hospitals and the traumatic injuries treated at these hospitals included orthopedic injuries, head injuries, burns, and lacerations. No reports of traumatic injuries that may have been treated at the site were identified. C. Administrator's Determination Concerning Acute Traumatic Injury The ADS assessed each of the identified studies according to the methodology established by the Administrator. All of the studies discussed above were observational reports of visits by responders and survivors to area hospitals, burn units, and DMATs. Because these were direct observational studies rather than epidemiologic studies, they were assessed for relevance, quality, and quantity to determine whether, taken together, they provide substantial evidence supporting the addition of acute traumatic injury to the List. First, the ADS assessed the relevance of the eight studies described above. Because most of the individuals who were treated at the DMATs and in area hospitals sustained injuries from fires and falling debris in the conduct of rescue operations or fleeing from the site, all of the studies reference the period of time immediately following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and several refer to data collected for months after. The studies assessed by the ADS demonstrate the occurrence of the same types of acute traumatic injuries identified by the directors of the CCEs and Data Centers in their letter: Severe burns, head trauma, fractures, tendon tears, and complex sprains. Other similar injuries identified in the studies include eye injuries, lacerations, and orthopedic injuries. There were no severe types of injuries referenced in the surveillance literature that have not been documented by the CCEs. Furthermore, the ADS determined that all of the referenced types of injuries could be described as being caused by a brief exposure to energy. Accordingly, the ADS found these eight studies to be relevant. Next, the ADS assessed the quality of the studies and found that many shared common limitations, such as: incomplete data sets (e.g., potential inability to include individuals who sustained only minor injuries, or who were treated outside of Manhattan, by private doctors, or by themselves); missing or inconsistent information on hastily-completed medical forms, including lack of information about patients' work activity or residency; and recall bias. It is understandable that certain demographic data were not captured by healthcare providers in the chaotic days and weeks after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; the missing data are not essential to the Administrator's understanding of the types of acute traumatic injuries sustained. Although injury rates are used to develop the economic analysis found in this document, the consideration of whether to propose the addition of acute traumatic injury to the List is not contingent upon knowing the exact prevalence of types of injuries sustained by responders or survivors. Accordingly, the ADS finds that the studies reviewed above are of sufficient quality and quantity to allow the Administrator to develop an understanding of the type and scope of the traumatic injuries suffered on September 11, 2001, or in its aftermath. Finally, the ADS assessed the quantity of the studies and found it to be sufficient. The eight relevant studies analyzed and reviewed overlapping populations affected by the attacks and response activities. Taken together, the studies provide a broad coverage of the affected populations and consistent information on the types of acute traumatic injuries that occurred. Because data regarding responders to the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania sites is limited, the ADS found it appropriate to extrapolate the findings discussed above, which predominantly concern the New York City site, to all responder populations because of the similar hazards at all three sites. In summary, the 9/11 exposures for acute traumatic injuries were the conditions at the sites during the attacks, collapses, evacuations, recovery, and clean-up. Acute traumatic injuries documented in the published scientific literature were sustained by construction workers, police officers, firefighters, emergency medical service technicians, others engaged in response activities, and survivors. Hazards at the WTC site, at the Pentagon, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania may have included, but are not limited to, falling debris, fires, chemical reactions, explosions, and other dangers. These hazards caused a range of injuries, such as abrasions, burns, concussions, contusions, corneal abrasions, crushes, dislocations, eye irritation, fractures, head trauma, lacerations, orthopedic injuries, punctures, sprains/strains, and tears. Many of these types of injuries were likely minor, and did not require substantial or on-going attention. In their letter to the Administrator, the CCE and Data Center directors identified severe burns, head trauma, fractures, tendon tears, and complex sprains as those types of acute traumatic injuries that should be added to the List of WTC- Related Health Conditions for all WTC Health Program members. Accordingly, the Administrator has determined that the types of injuries most likely to have resulted in the need for medical treatment and monitoring by the WTC Health Program are those types identified by the CCE and Data Center directors and in the injury surveillance literature reviewed above. Upon review of the evidence provided by the relevant published, peer- reviewed direct observational studies discussed above, the Administrator finds substantial support for a causal association between 9/11 exposures and acute traumatic injuries. VI. Effects of Rulemaking on Federal Agencies Title II of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-347) reactivated the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF). Administered by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the VCF provides compensation to any individual or representative of a deceased individual who was physically injured or killed as a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks or during the debris removal. Eligibility criteria for compensation by the VCF include a list of presumptively covered health conditions, which are physical injuries determined to be WTC-related health conditions by the WTC Health Program. Pursuant to DOJ regulations, the VCF Special Master is required to update the list of presumptively covered conditions when the List of WTC- Related Health Conditions in 42 CFR 88.1 is updated. 40 VII. Summary of Proposed Rule For the reasons discussed above, the Administrator proposes to amend 42 CFR 88.1, List of WTC-Related Health Conditions, paragraph (1)(v), to add ''new-onset'' to the existing ''WTC- exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).'' This will permit the WTC Health Program to certify cases of COPD determined to have been caused or contributed to by 9/11 exposures (considered ''new- onset'' cases), in addition to those cases of COPD which were exacerbated by 9/11 exposures and which are already included on the List. For the reasons discussed above, the Administrator also proposes to add ''acute traumatic injury'' to the List of VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules 41WTC-exacerbated COPD is a statutorily covered condition pursuant to PHS Act sec. 3312(a)(3)(A)(v); this NPRM proposes to add new-onset COPD occurring after 9/11 exposures. 42Future cost and prevalence estimates described below are discounted at 3% and 7% in accordance with OMB Circular A-94, Guidelines and discount rates for benefit-cost analysis of Federal programs. The estimates are discounted in order to compute net present value. 43These grandfathered members were enrolled without having to complete a new member application when the WTC Health Program started on July 1, 2011 and are referred to in the WTC Health Program regulations in 42 CFR part 88 as ''currently identified responders'' and ''currently identified survivors.'' 44Cases of COPD diagnosed prior to September 11, 2001, are presumed to be eligible for coverage as WTC-exacerbated COPD and therefore would not need coverage for new-onset COPD. Members already certified for an obstructive airway disease are also removed from the analysis because any progression to COPD (i.e., airflow limitation not fully reversible with bronchodilator) from their current certified WTC-related OAD condition could be considered a health condition medically- associated with the certified WTC-related OAD condition. See: Howard J [2014]. Health conditions medically associated with World Trade Center- related health conditions. http://www.cdc.gov/wtc/ pdfs/WTCHPMedically%20AssociatedHealth Conditions7November2014.pdf. 45FEV1% predicted is a marker for severity of airway obstruction. In the setting of post- bronchodilator FEV1/FVC 0.7, FEV1% predicted health-professionals/definition-diagnosis-and- staging/definitions.php. WTC-Related Health Conditions. The Administrator proposes to define the term ''acute traumatic injury'' as a type of injury characterized by physical damage to a person's body, including, but not limited to, eye injuries, severe burns, head trauma, fractures, tendon tears, complex sprains, and similar injuries. The injury must have been caused by and occurred immediately after exposure to hazards or adverse conditions characterized by a one-time exposure to energy resulting from the terrorist attacks or their aftermath; this requirement is intended to distinguish these types of injuries from musculoskeletal disorders, which are already on the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions. Musculoskeletal disorders are generally caused by repetitive motion; acute traumatic injuries are caused by a specific event or incident. Examples of acute traumatic injuries include but are not limited to a blow from falling debris, a fall from a height or a trip suffered during evacuation, rescue, or recovery activities, and burns or other injuries caused by the ignition of combustible materials, chemical reactions, and explosions. Although these types of injury occur at the time of the blow, fall, explosion, or other exposure, symptoms of the injury may not immediately manifest. The Administrator proposes to limit the availability of certification of acute traumatic injuries to those WTC Health Program members who received initial medical treatment for the injury no later than September 11, 2003. The Administrator has determined that this date offers a reasonable amount of time in which to expect that an injured responder or survivor received treatment for an acute traumatic injury. The proposed end-date of September 11, 2003, is the date originally used to identify traumatic injuries determined to be eligible for treatment by the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program that pre-dated the WTC Health Program. In addition, the PHS Act uses this date as the treatment cut-off date to identify musculoskeletal disorders eligible for certification in responders. The Administrator seeks comment on whether September 11, 2003, is an appropriate deadline. VIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 and Executive Order 13563 Executive Orders (E.O.) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). E.O. 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This notice of proposed rulemaking has been determined not to be a ''significant regulatory action'' under sec. 3(f) of E.O. 12866. This rule proposes the addition of new-onset COPD 41and acute traumatic injury to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions established in 42 CFR 88.1. This rulemaking is estimated to cost the WTC Health Program between $5,124,477 and $9,350,966 for the years 2015 and 2016, the remaining years for which the WTC Health Program is currently funded under the Zadroga Act. 42All of the costs to the WTC Health Program will be transfers due to the implementation of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) (Pub. L. 111-148) on January 1, 2014. This notice of proposed rulemaking has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The rule would not interfere with State, local, and Tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. Population Estimates As of July 31, 2014, the WTC Health Program had enrolled 61,086 responders and 7,806 survivors (68,892 total). Of that total population, 56,334 responders and 4,754 survivors (61,088 total) were participants in previous WTC medical programs and were 'grandfathered' into the WTC Health Program established by Title XXXIII of the PHS Act. 43From July 1, 2011 to July 31, 2014, 4,752 new responders and 3,052 new survivors (7,804 total) enrolled in the WTC Health Program. For the purpose of calculating a baseline estimate of new-onset COPD and acute traumatic injury prevalence, the Administrator projected that new enrollment would be approximately 4,000 per year (2,800 new responders and 1,200 new survivors), based on the trend in enrollees through July 31, 2014. CCE or Nationwide Provider Network physicians will conduct a medical assessment for each patient and make a determination, which the Administrator will then use to certify or not certify the health condition (in this case, new-onset COPD or an acute traumatic injury) for treatment by the WTC Health Program. However, for the purpose of this analysis, the Administrator has assumed that all diagnosed cases of new-onset COPD and acute traumatic injury will be certified for treatment by the WTC Health Program. Finally, because there are no existing data on new-onset COPD rates related to 9/11 exposures at either the Pentagon or Shanksville, Pennsylvania sites, and only limited data on acute traumatic injuries at the Pentagon, the Administrator has used only data from studies of individuals who were responders or survivors in the New York City area. Prevalence of New-Onset COPD To estimate the number of potential cases of WTC-related new-onset COPD to be certified for treatment by the WTC Health Program, we first subtracted the number of current members certified for an obstructive airways disease, including WTC-exacerbated COPD, from the total number of members. 44We then reviewed the surveillance literature to determine a prevalence rate for new- onset COPD among the non-OAD certified members. In studies of FDNY members with known pre-9/11 health status and high WTC exposure, Aldrich et al. reported that 2 percent of FDNY firefighters had an FEV1% below 70 percent of predicted 45at year 1 after September 11, 2001 (a proportion that doubled 6.5 years later), and Webber et VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:10 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules 46The 4 percent prevalence of new-onset COPD that was observed among firefighters was used to estimate the number of expected cases of new-onset COPD in the entire exposed cohort and may result in an overestimation because of the differences in initial exposure intensity between responders and survivors. 47Howard J [2014]. Health conditions medically associated with World Trade Center-related health conditions. http://www.cdc.gov/wtc/pdfs/WTCHP Medically%20AssociatedHealthConditions7November2014.pdf. 48The responder estimate is subject to two main assumptions. First, Banauch et al. report on FDNY members from September 11 to December 10, 2001, and we assume no additional injuries from December 11, 2001 until the site was closed in July 2002. The time period reported on by Banauch et al. likely encompasses a large majority of the injuries suffered by FDNY members. Second, Perritt et al. does not report directly on closed head injuries; therefore the number of closed head injuries reported by Berrios-Torres et al. for responders is used. 49We estimate the survivor prevalence from the NYCDOH study reports on survivors during the period from September 11-13, 2001. Although we understand that this reporting period likely encompasses a majority of the survivors who were injured, because the number of cases is based on those survivors who were treated for injuries only within the first 48 hours after the terrorist attacks, the reported number of cases likely underestimates the total number of survivors who sustained acute traumatic injuries as a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 50In 2011, the National Safety Council replaced the term ''disabling injury'' with ''medically consulted injury.'' See National Safety Council [2014]. Injury facts. 51A non-fatal disabling injury is one which results in some degree of permanent impairment or renders the injured person unable to effectively perform his regular duties or activities for a full day beyond the day of the injury. National Safety Council [1986]. Injury facts. al. reported an approximate 4 percent prevalence of new-onset, self-reported, physician-diagnosed COPD/emphysema nearly ten years after rescue/recovery efforts at the WTC site. Because pre-9/ 11 health records were not available in studies of WTC survivors, the Administrator has determined that the 4 percent prevalence of new-onset COPD will be applied to survivor estimates as well. 46We applied the 4 percent prevalence to the number of remaining members and also to the projected annual enrollment of 4,000 new members to estimate the number of potential WTC-related new-onset COPD cases for 2015 and 2016. (See Table 1, below) TABLE 1\u2014E STIMATED PREVALENCE OF 2015 AND2016 N EW-ONSET COPD of Acute Traumatic Injury While this rulemaking would make acute traumatic injuries eligible for certification, the Administrator assumes that the conditions most likely to receive treatment within the WTC Health Program will be those medically associated conditions which are the long-term consequences of the certified WTC-related acute traumatic injuries. Health conditions medically associated with WTC-related health conditions are determined on a case-by-case basis in accordance with WTC Health Program policy. 47Examples of such health conditions medically associated with an acute traumatic injury may include chronic back pain caused by vertebrae fractures, chronic peripheral neuropathy due to severe burns, and problems with executive brain function due to closed head injuries. Although we were able to estimate from the surveillance literature the number of responders and survivors who received medical treatment for acute traumatic injuries on or in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, we do not know the number of individuals who still experience health problems because of those traumatic injuries and are in need of chronic care. First, we estimated the number of persons in the responder and survivor populations with 9/11-related acute traumatic injuries by reviewing the studies referenced above in the acute traumatic injury literature review; we derived estimates from Berrios-Torres et al. [2003], Banauch et al. [2002], Perritt et al. [2011], and NYCDOH [2002]. Using the estimated prevalence for injury types, we then calculated the prevalence for these injuries among the responder 48and survivor49 populations. We applied that prevalence to the number of current and expected WTC Health Program members to find the number of individuals who may have suffered a WTC-related acute traumatic injury. Next, in order to estimate the proportion of those in the responder and survivor populations who suffered WTC-related acute traumatic injuries that require chronic care, we assumed that all patients with permanent partial and permanent total impairment caused by acute traumatic injuries will require chronic medical care and will enroll in the WTC Health Program. The National Safety Council estimated that 3.8 percent of non-fatal disabling injuries 50are associated with permanent partial or permanent total impairment. 51We applied that estimate to the estimated number of current and expected WTC Health Program members who may have suffered a WTC-related acute traumatic injury to determine the number of individuals with WTC- related acute traumatic injuries who are in need of chronic care. (See Table 2, VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:10 Sep Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules 52Costs may be underestimated because pharmaceuticals are not included in the analysis. Although the WTC Health Program does treat patients with WTC-exacerbated COPD, the cost of pharmaceuticals for this health condition is not readily available. 53Leigh JP, Romano PS, Schenker MB, Kreiss K [2002]. Costs of occupational COPD and asthma. Chest. Jan;121(1):264-272. 54The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not recommended screening for COPD.

The Administrator welcomes input on the assumptions and estimates used to determine the number of current and future WTC Health Program members who may seek certification of WTC-related acute traumatic injuries.

The low estimate, $1,032 per case, was based on WTC Health Program costs associated with the treatment of WTC-exacerbated COPD for the period October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014. These medical costs included medical services only. 52Discounting future medical costs for the following year (2015) at 3 percent would result in $1,002 and at 7 percent in $965 per member. Discounting future medical costs for one more year (2016) at 3 percent would result in $973 and at 7 percent in $901 per member. The high estimate, $1,930 per case, was based on a study by Leigh et al. [2002]. 53The authors estimated the cost of occupational COPD by aggregating and analyzing national data sets collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, the Health Care Financing Administration, and other government agencies and private firms. They concluded that there were an estimated 2,395,650 occupational cases of COPD in 1996 that resulted in medical costs estimated at $2.425 billion. Medical costs included payments to hospitals, physicians, nursing homes, and vendors of medical supplies, including oxygen, and also included the cost of pharmaceuticals. The medical cost per case was about $1,012 in 1996 dollars or about $1,930 in 2014, after adjusting for inflation using the Medical Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers. Discounting future medical costs for the following year (2015) at 3 percent would result in $1,874 and at 7 percent in $1,804 per COPD case. Discounting future medical costs for one more year (2016) at 3 percent would result in $1,819 and at 7 percent in $1,686 per COPD case. 54 Table 3 below shows the net present value of the range of the medical treatment cost per COPD case for the period 2015-2016: TABLE 3\u2014P RESENT VALUE OF 2015 AND2016 M EDICAL TREATMENT COST PER COPD C ASE IN 2014 D OLLARS Source Year Undiscounted Discounted at 3% Discounted at 7% Health Program .............................................................. 2015 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules 55Colo\u00b4n D [2014].

(2002), discounted at 3 percent, from Table 5 and the acute traumatic injury treatment cost estimate, discounted at 3 percent, from Table 6. 59See: WTC Health Program. Policy and procedures for recoupment and coordination of benefits: workers' compensation payment. http://www.cdc.gov/wtc/pdfs/WTCHP-PP-Recoupment- WComp-16-Dec-13.pdf. 60Workers' compensation rates are derived from WTC Health Program data. Costs of Acute Traumatic Injury Treatment The Administrator estimated the medical treatment costs associated with acute traumatic injury in this rulemaking using the methods described below. Because it is not possible to identify all possible types of acute traumatic injury for which a WTC responder or survivor might seek certification, we have identified several types of acute traumatic injury that may represent those types of acute traumatic injury that might be certified by the WTC Health Program. Representative examples of acute traumatic injuries include closed head injuries, burns, fractures, strains and sprains, orthopedic injuries (e.g., meniscus tear), ocular injuries, and crush injuries. The WTC Health Program estimates the cost of providing medical treatment for acute traumatic injury to be around $11,216 per case in 2014. This cost figure was based on a study by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI). 55The data source used in this study was NCCI's Medical Data Call (MDC). The MDC captures transaction-level detail on workers' compensation medical bills processed on or after July 1, 2010, including dates of service, charges, payments, procedure codes, and diagnosis codes; pharmaceutical costs are also included. The data used in this study were evaluated as of March 2013 for: Long-term medical services provided in 2011 and 2012 (i.e., 20 to 30 years post injury) Injuries occurring between 1983 and 1990 Claimants with dates of birth between 1920 and 1970 States for which NCCI collects MDC 56 For individuals born during 1951- 1970, the medical cost per case was about $11,216 in 2014 dollars, after adjusting for inflation using the Medical Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers. 57Discounting future medical costs for the following year (2015) at 3 percent would result in $10,890 and at 7 percent in $10,482 per acute traumatic injury case. Discounting future medical costs for one more year (2016) at 3 percent would result in $10,572 and at 7 percent in $9,796 per traumatic injury case. Table 4 below shows the present value of the range of the medical treatment cost per traumatic injury case for the period 2015-2016: TABLE 4\u2014P RESENT VALUE OF 2015 AND2016 M EDICAL TREATMENT COST PER ACUTE TRAUMATIC INJURY CASE IN 2014 DOLLARS Source Year Undiscounted Discounted at 3% Discounted at Costs This rulemaking is estimated to cost the WTC Health Program between $5,124,477 and $9,350,966 for the years 2015 and 2016. 58The analysis above offers an assumption about the number of individuals who might enroll in the WTC Health Program and estimates the number of new-onset COPD and acute traumatic injury cases and the resulting estimated treatment costs to the WTC Health Program. For the purpose of computing the treatment costs for new- onset COPD and acute traumatic injury, the Administrator assumed that all of the individuals who are diagnosed with either condition will be certified by the WTC Health Program for treatment and monitoring services. In the calculations found in Tables 5 and 6, below, estimated treatment costs were applied to the estimated number of cases of new-onset COPD and acute traumatic injuries. We assumed that 9 percent of new-onset COPD costs and 12 percent of acute traumatic injury costs for responders may be covered by workers' compensation each year; 59accordingly, we adjusted only the responder estimates to clarify that 91 percent of COPD costs and 88 percent of acute traumatic injury costs will be paid by the WTC Health Program. 60This analysis does not include administrative costs associated with certifying additional diagnoses of new-onset COPD or acute traumatic injuries that are WTC-related health conditions that might result from this action. Those costs were addressed in the interim final rule that established regulations for the WTC Health Program (76 FR 38914, July 1, 2011). Since the implementation of provisions of the Affordable Care Act on January 1, 2014, all of the members and future members are assumed to have or have access to medical insurance coverage other than through the WTC Health Program. Therefore, all treatment costs to be paid by the WTC Health Program through 2016 are considered transfers. Tables 5 and 6 describe the estimated allocation of WTC Health Program transfer payments.

The Administrator does not have information on the health of the population that may have experienced 9/11 exposures and is not currently enrolled in the WTC Health Program. However, the Administrator assumes that all unenrolled responders and survivors are now covered by health insurance (due to the ACA) and may be receiving treatment outside the WTC Health Program. Although the Administrator cannot quantify the benefits associated with the WTC Health Program, members with new-onset COPD or acute traumatic injury would have improved access to care and thereby the Program should produce better treatment outcomes than in its absence. Under other insurance plans, patients may have deductibles and copays, which impact access to care and timeliness of care. WTC Health Program members who are certified for these conditions would have first-dollar coverage and, therefore, are likely to seek care sooner when indicated, resulting in improved treatment outcomes. Limitations The analysis presented here was limited by the dearth of verifiable data on the new-onset COPD and acute traumatic injury status of responders and survivors who have yet to apply for enrollment in the WTC Health Program. Because of the limited data, the Administrator was not able to estimate benefits in terms of averted healthcare costs. Nor was the Administrator able to estimate indirect costs such as averted absenteeism, short and long-term disability, and productivity losses averted due to premature mortality. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires each VerDate Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Proposed Rules agency to consider the potential impact of its regulations on small entities including small businesses, small governmental units, and small not-for- profit organizations. The Administrator believes that this rule has ''no significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities'' within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., requires an agency to invite public comment on, and to obtain OMB approval of, any regulation that requires 10 or more people to report information to the agency or to keep certain records. This rule does not contain any information collection requirements; thus, HHS has determined that the PRA does not apply to this rule. D. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act As required by Congress under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), HHS will report the promulgation of this rule to Congress prior to its effective date. E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) directs agencies to assess the effects of Federal regulatory actions on State, local, and Tribal governments, and the private sector ''other than to the extent that such regulations incorporate requirements specifically set forth in law.'' For purposes of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, this proposed rule does not include any Federal mandate that may result in increased annual expenditures in excess of $100 million in 1995 dollars by State, local or Tribal governments in the aggregate, or by the private sector. However, the rule may result in an increase in the contribution made by New York City for treatment and monitoring, as required by Title XXXIII, sec. 3331(d)(2). F. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice) This proposed rule has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12988, ''Civil Justice Reform,'' and will not unduly burden the Federal court system. This rule has been reviewed carefully to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguities. G. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) The Administrator has reviewed this proposed rule in accordance with Executive Order 13132 regarding federalism, and has determined that it does not have ''federalism implications.'' The rule does not ''have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.'' H. Executive Order 13045 (Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks) In accordance with Executive Order 13045, the Administrator has evaluated the environmental health and safety effects of this proposed rule on children. The Administrator has determined that the rule would have no environmental health and safety effect on children. I. Executive Order 13211 (Actions Concerning Regulations that Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use) In accordance with Executive Order 13211, the Administrator has evaluated the effects of this proposed rule on energy supply, distribution or use, and has determined that the rule will not have a significant adverse effect. J. Plain Writing Act of 2010 Under Public Law 111-274 (October 13, 2010), executive Departments and Agencies are required to use plain language in documents that explain to the public how to comply with a requirement the Federal Government administers or enforces. The Administrator has attempted to use plain language in promulgating the proposed rule consistent with the Federal Plain Writing Act guidelines.

Food and Nutrition Service Title: National Hunger Clearinghouse Database Forms (FNS 543 and FNS 543A). OMB Control Number: 0584-0474. Summary of Collection: The National Hunger Clearinghouse FNS-543 form collects develops and distributes information and resources to help build the capacity of emergency food providers to address the immediate needs of struggling families and individuals while promoting self- reliance and access to healthy food. The Clearinghouse includes the National Hunger Hotline, which refers people in need anywhere in the U.S. to food pantries, soup kitchen, government programs and model grassroots organizations. The FNS-543A is the instrument used to voluntarily collect information about summer meal sites from State agencies. It collects site name, location and operating details such as dates and times of the day that the sites are in operation that provide summer meals to children 18 years and younger in low- income communities during the summer. Section 26 of the National School Lunch Act, which was added to the Act by Section 123 of Public Law 103-448 on November 2, 1994, mandated that the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) enter into a contract with a nongovernmental organization to develop and maintain a national information clearinghouse of grassroots organizations working on hunger, food, nutrition, and other agricultural issues, including food recovery, food assistance and self-help activities to aid individuals to become self-reliant and other activities that empower low-income individuals. Need and Use of the Information: FNS will collect information to provide a resource for groups that assist low- income individuals or communities regarding nutrition assistance program or other assistance. The information aids FNS to fight hunger and improve nutrition by increasing participation in the FNS nutrition programs through the development, coordination, and evaluation of strategic initiatives, partnership, and outreach activities.

ACTION : Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY : The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest will prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) to the 2009 Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Revised Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) environmental analysis in response to an August 27, 2015 Order from the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : The 2009 Forest Plan provides management direction for activities on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest for the next 10 to 15 years, including direction on eight topics (vegetation, wildlife, aquatic resources, recreation and travel management, fire management, livestock grazing, timber and recommended wilderness). In 2010, WildEarth Guardians, Friends of the Bitterroot, Inc., and Montanans for Quiet Recreation, Inc., filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Montana (Case 9:10- cv-00104-DWM) alleging inadequate analysis of the ''site-specific impacts of snowmobile use on big game winter habitat and conflicting recreational uses'' when developing the Forest Plan, failure ''to apply certain criteria [referred to as the minimization criteria] when designating areas open to snowmobile use'' and that Subpart C of the 2005 Travel Management Rule concerning over-snow vehicles was invalid. In its June 22, 2015 Opinion (WildEarth Guardians et al. v. Montana Snowmobile Ass'n, 790 F.3d 920 (9th Cir. 2015)), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found the Forest Service provided sufficient information to establish that it took a ''hard look'' at the impacts of snowmobile use on non- motorized recreational uses and sufficiently analyzed these conflicts. Further, the U.S. Court of Appeals found that plaintiffs' challenge to the Subpart C exemption in the Travel Management Rule was not ripe for review. However, in the same opinion, the U.S. Court of Appeals held that the Forest Service did not provide the public adequate access to information about the impact of snowmobiles on big game wildlife and habitat and did not allow the public to play an appropriate role in the decision-making process. The U.S. Court of Appeals also found the Forest Service did not adequately apply the minimization criteria found in the Travel Management Rule. The matter was remanded to the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana. In an August 27, 2015 Order, the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana ordered the Forest Service to ''properly disclose the information underlying its analysis of snowmobile impacts on big game wildlife'' and ''adequately appl[y] the minimization criteria in the [2005 Travel Managment Rule].'' The SEIS will disclose information underlying its analysis of snowmobile impacts on big game wildlife and apply the minimization criteria to areas on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest open to over-snow vehicle use during the winter recreation season (December 2 through May 15). A Draft SEIS is expected to be available for public review and comment in November 2015.

Rural Utility Service Title: 7 CFR 1773, Policy on Audits of RUS Borrowers. OMB Control 0572-0095. VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Notices Summary of Collection: Under the authority of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (ACT), as amended 7 U.S.C. 901 et seq., the Administrator is authorized and empowered to make loans under certain specified circumstances for rural electrification and the furnishing of electric energy to persons in rural areas and for the purpose of furnishing and improving telephone service in rural areas. RUS, in representing the Federal Government as Mortgagee, relies on the information provided by the borrowers in their financial statements to make lending decisions as to borrowers' credit worthiness and to assure that loan funds are approved, advanced and disbursed for proper Act purposes. Borrowers are required to furnish a full and complete report of their financial condition, operations and cash flows, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS. Need and Use of the Information: RUS will collect information to evaluate borrowers' financial performance, determine whether current loans are at financial risk, and determine the credit worthiness of future losses. If information is not collected, it would delay RUS' analysis of the borrowers' financial strength, thereby adversely impacting current lending decisions.

OMB Control Number: 0572-0104. Summary of Collection: The Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act (RELRA, Pub. L. 103-129), November 1, 1993, amended the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, 7 U.S.C. 901 et seq. (the RE Act). RELRA required that a State Telecommunications Modernization Plan (Modernization Plan or Plan), meet all the statutory requirements of RELRA (Part 1751, Subpart B). The plan at a minimum must provide for: (1) The elimination of party line service; (2) the availability of telecommunications services for improved business, educational, and medical services; (3) must encourage computer networks and information highways for subscribers in rural areas; (4) must provide for subscribers in rural areas to be able to receive through telephone lines: (a) Conference calling; (b) video images; and (c) data at a rate of 1 million bits of information per second; and, the proper routing of information to subscribers.

Agency: U.S. Census Bureau. Title: Public Employment & Payroll Forms. OMB Control Number: 0607-0452. Form Number(s): E-1 through E-10. Type of Request: Extension of a currently approved collection. Number of Respondents: 44,088. Average Hours per Response: 1 hour and 5 minutes. Burden Hours: 47,903. Needs and Uses: This information collection request covers the questionnaires needed to conduct the public employment program for the 2015 Annual Survey of Public Employment & Payroll, the 2016 Annual Survey of Public Employment & Payroll, and the 2017 Census of Governments: Employment. The Census of Governments: Employment and its related program, the Annual Survey of Public Employment & Payroll, provide a rich source of data on state and local government employment and payroll in the United States. Data have been collected annually since 1957. A census is conducted every five years (years ending in '2' and '7'). A sample of state and local governments is used to collect data in the intervening years, with a new sample selected every five years (years ending in '4' and '9'). The survey provides state and local government data on full-time and part-time employment, part-time hours worked, full-time equivalent employment, and payroll statistics by governmental function (e.g., elementary and secondary education, higher education, police protection, fire protection, financial administration, central staff services, judicial and legal, highways, public welfare, etc.). The 10 questionnaires for collecting the data are each tailored to the unique characteristics of the type and size of government or government agency to be surveyed. The type of employment and payroll data to be collected No changes will be made to the form content as currently approved. However, formatting changes will be made to the forms to facilitate data capture using current technology, Integrated Computer Assisted Data Entry (iCADE), and to clarify wording and form flow with respondents such as integrating the instruction in bullet form into the questions. These changes were cognitively tested. The Census of Governments: Employment and its related program, the Annual Survey of Public Employment & Payroll, provide data on state and local government employment and payroll in the United States. Census Bureau staff apply a standard set of criteria while classifying government employment activity in order to provide what is perhaps the only complete and uniform set of data on the employment activities of governments in the United States. Statistics compiled from data gathered using these forms are used in several important Federal government programs. Economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) use the statistics for developing the National Income and Product Accounts. According to the Chief Statistician of BEA, ''The data obtained from these forms are critical to BEA for maintaining reliable estimates. Specifically, BEA uses national, state, local, and type-of- government aggregate data by function for full-time and part-time employees, payroll, and number of part-time hours worked to prepare estimates of functional payrolls for the public sector VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:14 Sep Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Notices of the gross domestic product (GDP). BEA also uses these data to prepare estimates of state and local government compensation of employees in both the annual and benchmark input-output accounts.'' BEA also uses the Census of Governments and the Annual Survey of Public Employment & Payroll to derive state-level estimates of the employment and wages and salaries of students and their spouses who are employed by public institutions of higher education in which the students are enrolled. There is no other national or state source for information on student workers at state institutions of higher education. The employment data are used for two other data collection efforts currently conducted by the Census Bureau. The Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) collects data for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on health plans offered to state and local government employees. The MEPS sample of public employees is drawn from the Census of Governments: Employment component universe and employment data from the survey are used in statistical methods for creating national estimates on health plans. The Criminal Justice Employment and Expenditure program (CJEE), sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), uses employment data to provide employee and payroll statistics on police protection and correctional activities. State and local government officials use these employment data to analyze and assess individual government labor force and wage levels. Both management and labor consult these data during wage and salary negotiations. Public interest groups of many types produce analyses of public sector activities using these data. User organizations representing state and local government include the Council of State Governments, the National Conference of State Legislatures, Government Research Association, U.S. Conference of Mayors, National Association of Counties, National League of Cities, and the National Association of Towns and Townships. Another category of users, having a more specific focus on government activities, includes organizations such as the National School Boards Association and the National Sheriffs Association. A variety of private sector organizations and individuals make use of these employment and payroll data. Notable research organizations include the Brookings Institution and the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. Both public and private universities utilize these data. Instructors, researchers, and students in schools of public administration, political science, management, and industrial relations as well as other members of the public also use employment data.

Agency: U.S. Census Bureau. Title: Quarterly Financial OMB Control 0607-0432. Form Number(s): QFR-200(MT), QFR-201(MG), QFR-300(S). Type of a currently approved collection. Number of Respondents: 11,890. Average Hours per Response: 2 hours and 8 minutes. Burden Hours: 101,258. Needs and Uses: The Quarterly Financial Report (QFR) program has published up-to-date aggregate statistics on the financial results and position of U.S. corporations since 1947. The program currently collects and publishes financial data for the manufacturing, mining, wholesale trade, retail trade, information, and professional, scientific, and technical services (except legal) sectors. The survey is a principal economic indicator that provides financial data essential to calculation of key U.S. government measures of national economic performance. The importance of this data collection is reflected by the granting of specific authority to conduct the program in Title 13 of the United States Code, Section 91, which requires that financial statistics of business operations be collected and published quarterly. Public Law 109-79, Section 91 extended the authority of the Secretary of Commerce to conduct the QFR program through September 30, 2015. Currently, QFR is in the process of reauthorizing this public law. The Census Bureau is requesting approval to continue collection of the QFR program. QFR's last submission for forms approval included an announcement of an expansion of its coverage to include four new service sectors. The new sectors included subsectors in Sector 53 (Real Estate and Rental and Leasing), excluding subsector 533 (Lessors of Nonfinancial Intangible Assets); Sector 56 (Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services); Sector 62 (Health Care and Social Assistance); and Sector 72 (Accommodation and Food Services) based on the 2007 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). However, on June 9, 2014, the QFR ceased collection of these additional sectors due to sample restrictions and budget constraints. Notification of this change was announced on the QFR Business Help Site (BHS) Web site and the QFR Publication. Furthermore, we are pursing funding to get the expansion reinstated. The survey forms used to conduct the QFR are: QFR-200 (MT) Long Form (manufacturing, mining, wholesale trade, and retail trade); QFR-201 (MG) Short Form (manufacturing); and the QFR-300 (S) Long Form (services). The primary purpose of the QFR is to provide timely, accurate data on business financial conditions for use by Government and private-sector organizations and individuals. The primary public users include the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Trade Commission, Small Business Administration, U.S. Treasury-Office of Tax Analysis, and the Joint Committee on Taxation. These same organizations play a major role in providing guidance, advice, and support to the QFR program. The primary private-sector data users are a diverse group including universities, financial analysts, unions, trade associations, public libraries, banking institutions, and U.S. and foreign corporations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : The text of the Agreement and Order appears below. Dated: September 8, 2015. Todd A. Stevenson, Secretary. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION In the Matter of: phil&teds USA, Inc. CPSC Docket No.: 15-C0007 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT 1. In accordance with the Consumer Product Safety Act (''CPSA''), 15 U.S.C. 2051-2089 and (''phil&teds USA'' or ''Firm''), and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (''Commission''), through its staff (''Staff''), hereby enter into this Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement and Affidavit of Corporate Officer, attached at Exhibit A (collectively the ''Agreement'') and the incorporated attached Order (''Order'') resolve Staff's charges set forth below. THE PARTIES 2. The Commission is an independent federal regulatory agency established pursuant to, and responsible for, the enforcement of the CPSA. By executing this Agreement, Staff is acting on behalf of the Commission, pursuant to 16 CFR \u00a7 1118.20(b). The Commission issues the Order under the provisions of the CPSA. VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:14 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Notices 3. phil&teds USA is a corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the state of Colorado, with its principal corporate office located in Fort Collins, CO. phil&teds USA is an importer, distributor and retailer of children's strollers, child carriers and other baby products and accessories. STAFF'S CHARGES 4. From May 2009 through January 2011, phil&teds USA imported and sold in the United States, approximately 13,500 clip-on high chairs under the brand name, MeToo Chairs (''Chairs''). The Firm sold the Chairs online and through independent retailers nationwide. 5. The Chairs are ''consumer products,'' and, at all relevant times, phil&teds USA was either the importer, ''distributor'' or ''retailer'' of these consumer products, which were ''distributed in commerce,'' as those terms are defined or used in sections 3(a)(5), (7), (8),and (13) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. 2052(a)(5), (7), (8), and (13). 6. The Chairs are defective and create an unreasonable risk of serious injury because the clamps on the Chairs can detach from the table, posing a fall hazard. If only one side of the Chair detaches, the lack of space between the metal cross bar and the clamps creates a finger pinching, laceration, and amputation hazard. 7. Between September 2009 and October 2010, the Firm obtained sufficient information that reasonably supported the conclusion that the Chairs contained a defect that could create a substantial product hazard or created an unreasonable risk of serious injury. Specifically, the Firm was aware of reports of incidents and injuries, including reports of fingertip amputations to children. The Firm was also aware that two design changes had been implemented to address the defects in the Chair. 8. Despite having information regarding the Chair's defect or risk, the Firm failed to inform the Commission immediately, as required by sections 15(b)(3) and (4) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2064(b)(3) and (4). 9. Because the information in the Firm's possession constituted actual and presumed knowledge, the Firm knowingly violated section 19(a)(4) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2068(a)(4), as the term ''knowingly'' is 20(d) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2069(d). 10. When the Firm filed its Full Report, the Firm: a. underreported the total number of incidents and injuries involving the Chairs, stating that it was aware of 10 ''instances'' involving the product, but provided no details on the instances and failed to indicate that the Firm was aware of two amputation injuries; b. failed to notify staff that the Chairs posed an amputation hazard; and c. withheld information that the Chair had been redesigned to address the hazard and that the sample product supplied with the Full Report was manufactured differently than the Chairs involved in the incident and injury reports. 11. The Firm's failure to report this information resulted in delayed implementation of the corrective action and recall of the product, which was not publicly announced until August 17, 2011. 12. By making these inaccurate and incomplete statements in the Full Report, the Firm knowingly committed a material misrepresentation to an officer or employee in the course of an investigation under the CPSA, which violates section 19(a)(13) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2068(a)(13), as the term ''knowingly'' is 20(d) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2069(d). 13. 20 of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2069, the Firm is subject to civil penalties for its knowing violation of section 19(a)(4) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2068(a)(4) and for the Firm's knowing material misrepresentations in violation of section 19(a)(13) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2068(a)(13). FIRM'S RESPONSE 14. This Agreement does not constitute an admission by the Firm to the charges set forth in paragraphs 4 through 13, including charges that phil&teds USA violated any statute or regulation, failed to timely report, or committed a material misrepresentation in violation of the CPSA. In fact, phil&teds USA took the initiative in reporting incidents surrounding the Chair to the CPSC, disclosed the number of those incidents, and further explained that unreasonable misuse of the product was the cause of serious injuries. AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES 15. Under the CPSA, the Commission has jurisdiction over the matter involving the Chairs and over phil&teds USA, Inc. 16. In settlement of Staff's charges, and to avoid the cost, distraction, delay, uncertainty, and inconvenience of protracted litigation or other proceedings, the Firm shall pay a civil penalty in the amount of three million, five hundred thousand dollars ($3,500,000) (''Total Civil Penalty Amount''). In reliance on the accuracy and completeness of the Firm's representations and warranties in this Agreement, the Commission agrees to suspend all but two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) of the Total Civil Penalty Amount (''$200,000 Payment''), on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The $200,000 Payment shall be paid within thirty (30) calendar days after the Firm receives service of the Commission's final Order accepting the Agreement. All payments to be made under the Agreement shall constitute debts owing to the United States and shall be made by electronic wire transfer to the United States via: http://www.pay.gov for allocation to and credit against the payment obligations of the Firm under this Agreement. 17. phil&teds USA represents and warrants that the financial statements of phil&teds USA provided to the Commission in connection with the matters addressed in this Agreement (''Financial Statements'') are complete, accurate and current and have been prepared on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated except as otherwise noted therein, and that the Financial Statements fairly present the financial condition and results of operations and cash flow of the Firm as of the dates, and for the periods, indicated therein, all consistently applied during the periods involved except as noted therein, and subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to the absence of notes and normal year-end adjustments. 18. The Firm represents and warrants that the information supplied by the Firm to the Commission in connection with the matters addressed in the Agreement (including information about the Firm's financial resources and ability to pay the Total Civil Penalty Amount) did not, at the time provided to the Commission, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 19. The parties agree that an amount equal to Total Civil Penalty Amount minus any amounts paid by phil&teds USA pursuant to this Agreement shall become due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of an ''Event of Default,'' without notice or further action by any party. An ''Event of Default'' means: a. a failure of phil&teds USA to pay the $200,000 Payment (or any portion thereof) when due and payable; b. the breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of phil&teds USA in this Agreement; VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Notices c. the breach or failure by phil&teds USA to observe or perform any of its obligations, covenants or agreements set forth in the Agreement; or d. a failure of phil&teds USA to comply with all CPSC statutes or regulations for three (3) years after the effective date of this Agreement. 20. All unpaid amounts, if any, due and owing under the Agreement shall constitute a debt due and immediately owing by phil&teds USA to the United States, and interest shall accrue and be paid by phil&teds USA at the federal legal rate of interest set forth at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(a) and (b) from the date of Event of Default until all amounts due have been paid in full (hereinafter ''Default Payment Amount'' and ''Default Interest Balance''). phil&teds USA shall consent to a Consent Judgment in the amount of the Default Payment Amount and Default Interest Balance, and the United States, at its sole option, may collect the entire Default Payment Amount and Default Interest Balance or exercise any other rights granted by law or in equity, including but not limited to referring such matters for private collection, and phil&teds USA agrees not to contest, and hereby waives and discharges any defenses to, any collection action undertaken by the United States or its agents or contractors pursuant to this paragraph. phil&teds USA shall pay the United States all reasonable costs of collection and enforcement under this paragraph, respectively, including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses. 21. phil&teds USA shall notify CPSC in writing if any financial information supplied or to be supplied in writing by phil&teds USA to the Commission in connection with the Agreement is, in any material respect, discovered not to be true, accurate or complete; is no longer true, accurate or complete as a result of subsequent events; is discovered to contain an untrue statement of a material fact or to omit a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or contains as a result of subsequent events an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission of a material fact required to be stated, not misleading. 22. After Staff receives this Agreement executed on behalf of phil&teds USA, Staff shall promptly submit the Agreement to the Commission for provisional acceptance. Promptly following the Commission's provisional acceptance of the Agreement, the Agreement shall be placed on the public record and published in the Federal Register, in accordance with the procedures set forth in 16 CFR \u00a7 1118.20(e). If within fifteen (15) calendar days the Commission does not receive any written request not to accept the Agreement, the Agreement shall be deemed finally accepted on the sixteenth (16th) calendar day after the date the Agreement is published in the Federal Register, in accordance with 16 CFR \u00a7 1118.20(f). 23.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket Nos. CP14-554-000; CP15-16-000; CP15-17-000] Florida Southeast Connection, LLC; Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC; Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Southeast Market Pipelines Project The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Hillabee Expansion, Sabal Trail, and Florida Southeast Connection (FSC) Projects as proposed by Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco), Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC (Sabal Trail), and Florida Southeast Connection, LLC (FSC), respectively, in the above- referenced dockets. These are separate, but connected, natural gas transmission pipeline projects collectively referred to as the Southeast Market Pipelines (SMP) Project. The applicants request authorization to construct and operate a total of about 685.5 miles of natural gas transmission pipeline and associated facilities, six new natural gas-fired compressor stations, and modify existing compressor stations in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. The SMP Project would provide about 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to meet growing demands by the electric generation, distribution, and end use markets in Florida and the southeast United States. The draft EIS assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the SMP Project in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The FERC staff concludes that approval of the SMP Project would have some adverse environmental impacts; however, these impacts would be reduced to less-than-significant levels with the implementation of the applicants' proposed mitigation and the additional measures recommended in the draft EIS. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) participated as a cooperating agency in the preparation of the draft EIS. The USACE has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to resources potentially affected by the proposals and is participating in the NEPA analysis. The USACE has jurisdictional authority pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, which governs the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States; section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, which regulates any work or structures that potentially affect the navigable capacity of navigable waters of the United States; and section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act which regulates the temporary occupation of water-related structures constructed by the United States. The USACE may adopt and use the EIS to support its review of the SMP Project. Although the cooperating agency provides input to the conclusions and recommendations presented in the draft EIS, the agency will present its own conclusions and recommendations in its Record of Decision for the project. A copy of the USACE's public notice of its receipt of applications from Transco, Sabal Trail, and FSC is enclosed with our draft EIS. The draft EIS of the SMP Project addresses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the following project facilities: The Hillabee Expansion Project would include: Approximately 43.5 miles of new 42- and 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline loop 1in Alabama; one new compressor station in Choctaw County, Alabama and modifications to three existing compressor stations in Dallas, Chilton, and Coosa Counties, Alabama; and installation of pig 2launchers/ receivers and mainline valves (MLVs). The Sabal Trail Project would include: Approximately 515.5 miles of new natural gas pipeline in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, including: \u00c6480.9 miles of 36-inch-diameter mainline pipeline in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida; \u00c6the 21.5-mile-long, 24-inch- diameter Citrus County Line in Florida; \u00c6the 13.1-mile-long, 36-inch- diameter Hunters Creek Line in Florida; five new compressor stations in Tallapoosa County, Alabama; Dougherty County, Georgia; and Suwannee, Marion, and Osceola Counties, Florida; subsequent modifications to two of the new compressor stations in Dougherty County, Georgia and Suwannee County, Florida; and installation of pig launchers/ receivers, MLVs, and meter and regulating stations. The FSC Project would include: Approximately 126.4 miles of new 30- and 36-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline in Florida; and installation of pig launchers/ receivers, MLVs, and meter and regulating stations. The FERC staff mailed copies of the draft EIS to federal, state, and local government representatives and agencies; elected officials; environmental and public interest groups; Native American tribes; potentially affected landowners and other interested individuals and groups; newspapers and libraries in the project area; and parties to this proceeding. Paper copy versions of this draft EIS were mailed to those specifically requesting them; all others received a CD version. In addition, the draft EIS is available for public viewing on the FERC's Web site (www.ferc.gov) using the eLibrary link. A limited number of copies are available for distribution and public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Public Reference Room, 888 First Street NE., Room 2A, Washington, DC 20426, (202) 502-8371. Any person wishing to comment on the draft EIS may do so.

The meeting will end once all speakers have provided their comments or at 8:00 p.m., whichever comes first. Please note that there may be a time limit of 3 minutes to present comments, and speakers should structure their comments accordingly. If time limits are implemented, they will be strictly enforced to ensure that as many individuals as possible are given an opportunity to comment. The meetings are recorded by a stenographer to ensure comments are accurately recorded. Transcripts will be entered into the formal record of the Commission proceeding. It is important to note that verbal comments hold the same weight as written or electronically submitted comments. Any person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures (18 CFR part 385.214). 3Only intervenors have the right to seek rehearing of the Commission's decision. The Commission grants affected landowners and others with environmental concerns intervenor status upon showing good cause by stating that they have a clear and direct interest in this proceeding which no other party can adequately represent. Simply filing environmental comments will not give you intervenor status, but you do not need intervenor status to have your comments considered. Questions?

The Commission will use this EA in its decision-making process to determine whether the Project is in the public convenience and necessity. This notice announces the opening of the scoping process the Commission will use to gather input from the public and interested agencies on the Project. You can make a difference by providing use with your specific comments or concerns about the Project. Your comments should focus on the potential environmental effects, reasonable alternatives, and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impacts. Your input will help the Commission staff determine what issues need to be evaluated in the EA. To ensure that your comments are timely and properly recorded, please send your comments so that the Commission receives them in Washington, DC on or before October 5, 2015. If you sent comments on this project to the Commission before the opening of this docket on June 5, 2015, you will need to file those comments in Docket No. CP15-513-000 to ensure they are considered as part of this proceeding. This notice is being sent to the Commission's current environmental mailing list for this Project. State and local government representatives should notify their constituents of this planned Project and encourage them to comment on their areas of concern. If you are a landowner receiving this notice, a pipeline company representative may contact you about the acquisition of an easement to construct, operate, and maintain the proposed facilities. The company would seek to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement. However, if the Commission approves the Project, that approval conveys with it the right of eminent domain. Therefore, if easement negotiations fail to produce an agreement and the Project is approved, the pipeline company could initiate condemnation proceedings where compensation would be determined in accordance with state law.

Summary of the Planned Project Texas Gas proposes to construct, install, own, operate, and maintain the proposed Northern Supply Access Project, which (as described more fully below) would involve modifications at eight existing compressor stations along its existing pipeline and one new compressor station located in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The project is designed to provide an additional 384,000 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day of north to south transportation capacity on Texas Gas's system while maintaining bi-directional flow capability on its system. Texas Gas proposes to modify seven existing compressor stations located in Lawrence and Dearborn Counties, Indiana; Webster, Breckinridge, and Jefferson Counties, Kentucky; Tipton County, Tennessee; and Coahoma County, Mississippi, by installing yard and station pipeline and various auxiliary facilities. Texas Gas also proposes to modify the existing Bastrop Compressor Station in Morehouse Parish, Louisiana by classifying four existing compressor units as back-up units (a total of 7,040 horsepower) and adding one new 9,688 horsepower turbine compressor unit. The Project also includes the construction and operation of the new 23,877 horsepower Harrison Compressor Station in Hamilton County, Ohio.

The EA Process The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us 2to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. This discovery process is referred to as ''scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this notice, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues to address in the EA. We will consider all filed comments during the preparation of the EA. In the EA we will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation and maintenance of the planned Project under these general headings: Geology and soils; water resources, fisheries, and wetlands; vegetation and wildlife, including migratory birds; endangered and threatened species; land use, including residential, commercial, and prime farmland uses; cultural resources; socioeconomics; air quality and noise; public safety; and cumulative impacts. We will also evaluate reasonable alternatives to the proposed Project or portions of the Project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. The EA will present our independent analysis of the issues. The EA will be available in the public record through eLibrary. Depending on the comments received durin ghte scoping process, we may also publish and distribute the EA to the public for an allotted comment period.

Consultations Under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act In accordance with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's implementing regulations for section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, we are using this notice to initiate consultation with the applicable State Historic Preservation Office(s), and to solicit their views and those of other government agencies, interested Indian tribes, and the public on the project's potential effects on historic properties. 4We will define the project-specific Area of Potential Effects (APE) in consultation with the SHPO(s) as the project develops. On natural gas facility projects, the APE at a minimum encompasses all areas subject to ground disturbance (examples include construction right-of-way, contractor/pipe storage yards, compressor stations, and access roads). Our EIS for this project will document our findings on the impacts on historic properties and summarize the status of consultations under section 106. Environmental Mailing List The environmental mailing list includes federal, state, and local government representatives and agencies; elected officials; environmental and public interest groups; Native American Tribes; other interested parties; and local libraries and newspapers. This list also includes all affected landowners (as defined in the Commission's regulations) who are potential right-of-way grantors, whose property may be used temporarily for project purposes, or who own homes within certain distances of aboveground facilities, and anyone who submits comments on the project. We will update the environmental mailing list as the analysis proceeds to ensure that we send the information related to this environmental review to all individuals, organizations, and government entities interested in and/or potentially affected by the proposed project. Copies of the completed draft EIS will be sent to the environmental mailing list for public review and comment. If you would prefer to receive a paper copy of the document instead of the CD version or would like to remove your name from the mailing list, please return the attached Information Request (appendix 2). Becoming an Intervenor In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an ''intervenor'' which is an official party to the Commission's proceeding. Intervenors play a more formal role in the process and are able to file briefs, appear at hearings, and be heard by the courts if they choose to appeal the Commission's final ruling.

Abstract: Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA granted partial waivers that allow gasoline containing greater than 10 volume percent (vol%) ethanol up to 15 vol% ethanol (E15) to be introduced into commerce for use in model year (MY) 2001 and newer light-duty motor vehicles, subject to certain conditions. EPA issued final rule establishing several measures to mitigate misfueling of other vehicles, engines and equipment with E15 and the potential emissions consequences of misfueling. The rule prohibits the use of gasoline containing more than 10 vol% ethanol in vehicles, engines and equipment that are not covered by the partial waiver decisions. The rule also requires all E15 gasoline fuel dispensers to have a specific label when a retail station or wholesale-purchaser consumer chooses to sell E15. In addition, the rule requires that product transfer documents (PTDs) specifying ethanol content and Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) accompany the transfer of gasoline blended with ethanol, and a survey of retail stations to ensure compliance with these requirements. The rule also modifies the Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) program by updating the Complex Model to allow fuel manufacturers to certify batches of gasoline containing up to 15 vol% ethanol. This ICR supporting statement addresses associated recordkeeping and reporting items. Respondent's obligation to respond: Mandatory (40 CFR part 80). Estimated of respondents: (total). Estimated number of responses: of response: On occasion. Total estimated burden: 13,270 hours (per year). Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.03(b). Total estimated cost: $ 1,340,292, which includes no annualized capital or operation & maintenance costs. Changes in Estimates: We expect there will be a decrease in the total estimated respondents, responses and cost to the industry compared to the ICR currently approved by OMB. This change in burden is due to no longer requiring the programing of product transfer codes in this collection. The respondent universe decreased from 6,211 to 2,103, a difference of 4,108 members. The number of responses declined from 44,010,211 to 44,000,103, a difference of 10,108 reports. This reduced the industry burden hours from 37,350 to 13,270.

Abstract: The affected entities are subject to the General Provisions of the NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart A), and any changes, or additions to the Provisions specified at 40 CFR part 63, subpart BBBBB. Owners or operators of the affected facilities must submit an initial notification report, performance tests, and periodic reports and results. Owners or operators are also required to maintain records of the occurrence and duration of any startup, shutdown, or malfunction in the operation of an affected facility, or any period during which the monitoring system is inoperative. Reports, at a minimum, are required semiannually. Form Numbers: None. Respondents/affected entities: Semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Respondent's obligation to Mandatory CFR part 63, subpart BBBBB). Estimated number of respondents: 1 (total). Frequency of response: Initially, occasionally and semiannually. Total estimated burden: 41 hours (per year). Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b). Total estimated cost: $4,710 (per year), including $550 in either annualized capital/start-up and/or operation & maintenance costs. Changes in the Estimates: There is a small increase in the respondent burden from the most- recently approved ICR due to an update in assumption and an adjustment in labor rates. In this ICR, we assume the existing major source will read and re-familiar with the rule requirement annually. We have also updated all burden calculations using the latest labor rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Courtney Kerwin, Acting Director, Collection Strategies Division.

ACTION : Notice of adequacy. SUMMARY : In this notice, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notifying the public that the EPA has found the following adequate for transportation conformity purposes: The Cache County, Logan, UT-ID PM 2.5 Attainment Plan, Utah State Implementation Plan Section IX. Part A.23 and its motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEB). As more fully explained in the Supplementary Information section of this notice, this finding will affect future transportation conformity determinations. DATES : This finding is effective on September 28, 2015. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Tim Russ, Air Program, Mailcode 8P-AR, Environmental Protection Agency, Region 8, 1595 Wynkoop Street, Denver, Colorado 80202-1129, telephone number (303) 312-6479, fax number (303) 312-6064, or email russ.tim@epa.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Throughout this document, whenever ''we,'' ''us,'' or ''our,'' are used, we mean the EPA. Whenever ''State'' is used, we mean the State of Utah. Transportation conformity is required by section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The conformity rule provisions at 40 CFR 93 require that transportation plans, programs, and projects conform to a State Implementation Plan (SIP) and establish the criteria and procedures for determining whether or not they do. Conformity to a SIP means that transportation activities will not produce new air quality violations, worsen existing violations, or delay timely attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. The criteria by which we determine whether a SIP revision's MVEBs are adequate for conformity purposes are outlined in 40 CFR 93.118(e)(4), which was promulgated August 15, 1997 (62 FR 43780). We described our process for determining the adequacy of submitted SIP MVEBs in our July 1, 2004 Transportation Conformity Rule Amendments (69 FR 40004). We used these resources in making our adequacy determinations announced in this notice. This notice is simply an announcement of findings that we have already made and are as described below: The Governor submitted the Cache County, Logan, UT-ID PM 2.5Attainment Plan, Utah SIP Section IX. Part A.231to EPA on December 16, 2014. The State prepared the SIP revision submittal to meet the requirements of Part D of Title I of the CAA for PM 2.5attainment plans, subparts 1 and 4 for ''moderate'' areas. As part of our adequacy review, we posted the Cache County, Logan, UT-ID PM 2.5Attainment Plan, Utah SIP Section IX. Part A.23, with its identified MVEBs, for adequacy review on EPA's transportation conformity Web site on March 23, 2015 (see: http://www.epa.gov/otaq/stateresources/transconf/currsips.htm). We requested public comments by April 22, 2015. We did not receive any comments. The EPA sent a letter to the Utah Division of Air Quality on June 17, 2015, stating that the submitted Cache County, Logan, UT-ID PM 2.5Attainment Plan, Utah SIP Section IX. Part A.23 and its MVEBs were adequate for transportation conformity purposes. For the Cache County, Logan, UT-ID PM 2.5Attainment Plan, Utah SIP Section IX. Part A.23, the MVEBs we found adequate were 0.32 tons per day (tpd) for PM 2.5, 4.49 tpd for nitrogen oxides, and 3.23 tpd for volatile organic compounds. Following the effective date listed in the DATES section of this notice, the Cache County Metropolitan Planning Organization, the Utah Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Department of Transportation are required to use these MVEBs for future transportation conformity determinations for projects in the Cache County, Logan, UT-ID PM 2.5 nonattainment area. Please note that our adequacy review of the MVEBs as described above is separate from our future rulemaking action on the Cache County, Logan, UT- ID PM 2.5Attainment Plan, Utah SIP Section IX. Part A.23 revision discussed above and should not be used to prejudge our ultimate approval or disapproval of that SIP revision. Even if we find the Cache County, Logan, UT- ID PM 2.5Attainment Plan and its MVEBs adequate for transportation conformity purposes now, we may later find it necessary to disapprove the SIP revision. Should this situation arise, we would then revisit our adequacy finding. Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq. Dated: August 26, 2015. Shaun L. McGrath, Regional Administrator, Region 8.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Final approval under OMB delegated authority of the extension for three years, without revision, of the following reports: 1. Report title: Notice of Mutual Holding Company Reorganization and the Application for Approval of a Minority Stock Issuance by a Savings Association Subsidiary of a Mutual Holding Company. Agency form number: Form 1522; Form 1523. OMB control number: 7100-0340. Frequency: On occasion. Reporters: Mutual savings associations and savings association subsidiaries or subsidiary holding companies of a mutual holding company. Estimated annual reporting hours: Form 1522: 400 hours; Form 1523: 1,050 hours. Estimated average hours per response: Form 1522: 400 hours; Form 1523: respondents: 1522: Form 3. General description of report: Forms 1522 and 1523 are mandatory and authorized pursuant to section 10 of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA). Section 10 of HOLA (''Regulations of holding companies'') provides generally that ''[t]he Board is authorized to issue such regulations . . . as the Board deems necessary or appropriate to enable the Board to administer and carry out the purposes of this section, and to require compliance therewith and prevent evasions thereof.'' (12 U.S.C. 1467a(g)(1)). With respect to mutual holding companies, HOLA states that a mutual holding company ''shall be subject to such regulations as the Board may prescribe.'' (12 U.S.C. 1467a(o)(7)). Section 10 of HOLA also requires a savings and loan holding company to file ''such reports as may be required by the Board'' and provides that such reports ''shall contain such information concerning the operations of such savings and loan holding company and its subsidiaries as the Board may require.'' (12 U.S.C. 1467a(b)(2)). The information on Forms 1522 and 1523 generally are not considered confidential. However, the notificant or applicant may request confidential treatment for portions of these forms pursuant to exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)) if it believes disclosure of those portions would likely result in substantial competitive harm. All such requests for confidential treatment would need to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and in response to a specific request for disclosure. Abstract: Any mutual savings association that wishes to reorganize to form a mutual holding company must submit a notice (Form 1522) to the Federal Reserve. The notice provides details of the reorganization plan, which is to be approved by the majority of the association's board of directors and any acquired association. Details of the reorganization plan should contain a complete description of all significant terms of the proposed reorganization, shall attach and incorporate any Stock Issuance Plan proposed in connection with the reorganization plan, and comply with other informational requirements specified in (12 CFR 239.6). Any savings association subsidiary or subsidiary holding company of a mutual holding company must file an application (Form 1523) for minority stock issuance. Minority stock issuances applications are required to provide the Federal Reserve with information to determine whether mutual holding companies and their subsidiaries are conducting insider abuse or unsafe and unsound practices. The Federal Reserve intends to update and revise the Notice and Application to conform to Federal Reserve standards in the near future. Current Actions: On June 17, 2015, the Federal Reserve published a notice in the Federal Register (80 FR 34641) requesting public comment for 60 days on the extension, without revision, of the Notice of Mutual Holding Company Reorganization and the Application for Approval of a Minority Stock Issuance by a Savings Association Subsidiary of a Mutual Holding Company. The comment period for this notice expired on August 17, 2015. The Federal Reserve did not receive any comments. The information collection will be extended as proposed. 2. Report title: Application for Conversion, Proxy Statement, Offering Circular, and Order Form. Agency form number: Form 1680, Form 1681, Form 1682, number: 7100-0335. Frequency: On occasion. Reporters: Mutual companies. hours: Form 1680: hours; 1.50 Form 1683: 10 hours. Estimated average hours per response: Form 1680: 299 hours; Form 1681: 500 1683: 10. General description of report: The mutual stock conversion forms are mandatory and authorized by Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) section 10, which provides generally that ''the Board is authorized to issue such regulations . . . as the Board deems necessary or appropriate to enable the Board to administer and carry out the VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:14 Sep Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Notices purposes of this section, and to require compliance therewith and prevent evasions thereof.'' (12 U.S.C. 1467a(g)(1)). With respect to mutual holding companies, HOLA states that a mutual holding company ''shall be subject to such regulations as the Board may prescribe.'' (12 U.S.C. 1467a(o)(7)). Section 10 of HOLA also requires a savings and loan holding company to file ''such reports as may be required by the Board'' and provides that such reports ''shall contain such information concerning the operations of such savings and loan holding company and its subsidiaries as the Board may require.'' (12 U.S.C. 1467a(b)(2). Forms 1681, 1682, and 1683 are distributed to the owners of the mutual holding company; no issues of confidentiality should arise in connection with these forms. One of the elements required for the application on Form 1680 is a consolidated business plan showing how the capital acquired in the conversion will be used. Business plans are not considered confidential, although the applicant may request confidential treatment pursuant to sections (b)(4), of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4),) for portions of the business plan if disclosure would likely result in substantial competitive harm. All such requests for confidential treatment would need to be reviewed on a case- by-case basis and in response to a specific request for disclosure. Abstract: Sections 5(i) (standard conversions) and 5(p) (supervisory conversions) of HOLA authorize mutual to stock conversions. The four individual forms are all one-time submissions that are used by mutual holding companies requesting approval to convert to a stock institution. The Federal Reserve intends to update and revise the mutual stock conversion application forms to conform to Federal Reserve standards in the near future. Current Actions: On June 17, 2015, the Federal Reserve published a notice in the Federal Register (80 FR 34641) requesting public comment for 60 days on the extension, without revision, of the Application for Conversion, Proxy Statement, Offering Circular, and Order Form. The comment period for this notice expired on August 17, 2015. The Federal Reserve did not receive any comments. The information collection will be extended as proposed. 3. Report title: Savings and Loan Holding Company Application. Agency form number: Form H-(e). OMB control number: 7100-0336. Frequency: On occasion. Reporters: Entities seeking prior approval to become a savings and loan holding company (SLHC). Estimated annual reporting hours: 6,000 hours. Estimated average hours per response: 500 hours. Number of respondents: 12. General description of report: The Savings and Loan Holding Company Application is mandatory and authorized pursuant to section 10 of HOLA, which provides that ''the Board is authorized to issue such regulations . . . as the Board deems necessary or appropriate to enable the Board to administer and carry out the purposes of this sections, and require compliance therewith and prevent evasions thereof.'' (12 U.S.C. 1467a(g)(1)). Section 10 of HOLA also requires a savings and loan holding company to file ''such reports as may be required by the Board'' and provides that such reports ''shall contain such information concerning the operations of such savings and loan holding company and its subsidiaries as the Board may require (12 U.S.C. 1467a(b)(2). The information on Form H-(e) is not considered confidential unless the applicant requests confidential treatment pursuant to exemption 4 or 6 of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4),(6)). All such requests for confidential treatment would need to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and in response to a specific request for disclosure. Abstract: The Federal Reserve analyzes each holding company application to determine whether the applicant meets the statutory criteria set forth in section 10(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (Act), as amended, to become a savings and loan holding company. The applications are reviewed for adequacy of answers to items and completeness in all material respects. The applications are event-generated and provide the Federal Reserve with information necessary to evaluate the proposed transaction. The Federal Reserve intends to update and revise the Application forms to conform to Federal Reserve standards in the near future. Current Actions: On June 17, 2015, the Federal Reserve published a notice in the Federal Register (80 FR 34641) requesting public comment for 60 days on the extension, without revision, of the Savings and Loan Holding Company Application. The comment period for this notice expired on August 17, 2015. The Federal Reserve did not receive any comments. The information collection will be extended as proposed. 4. Report title: Recordkeeping Requirements Associated with the Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies. Agency form number: FR 4027. OMB control number: 7100-0327. Frequency: On occasion. Reporters: State member banks, U.S. bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, Edge Act and agreement corporations, and the U.S. operations of foreign banks with a branch, agency, or commercial lending company in the United States. Estimated annual reporting hours: One-time implementation: Large institutions: 2,400 hours and small institutions: 400 hours; Ongoing maintenance: 228,400 hours. Estimated average hours per response: One-time implementation: Large institutions: 480 hours and small hours. Number of institutions: respondents; Ongoing maintenance: 5,710 respondents. General description of report: This information collection is authorized pursuant to sections 9, 11(a), 11(i), 25, and 25A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 248(a), 248(i), 324, 602, and 625), section 5 of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1844), section 10(b)(2) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1467a(b)(2)), and section 7(c) of the International Banking Act (12 U.S.C. 3105(c)). Because the recordkeeping requirements are contained within guidance (and not a statute or regulation) they are voluntary. Because the records will be maintained by each banking institution, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) would only be implicated if the Board's examiners retained a copy of the records as part of an examination or supervision of the banking institution. To the extent the Board collects this information during the course of an examination or supervision of a banking institution, the information is considered confidential under exemption 8 of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)). In addition, the information may also be kept confidential under exemption 4 of the FOIA which protects commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is privileged or confidential (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)). Abstract: Incentive compensation practices in the financial services industry were one of many factors contributing to the financial crisis that began in 2007. Banking organizations too often rewarded employees for increasing the firm's short-term revenue or profit without adequate recognition of the risks the employees' activities VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:14 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Notices posed for the firm. More importantly, problematic compensation practices were not limited to the most senior executives at financial firms. Compensation practices can encourage employees at various levels of a banking organization, either individually or as a group, to undertake imprudent risks that can significantly and adversely affect the risk profile of the firm. The Sound Incentive Compensation Policies (the Guidance) was developed to help protect the safety and soundness of banking organizations and promote the prompt improvement of incentive compensation practices throughout the banking industry. In addition, the guidance is consistent with the Principles for Sound Compensation Practices adopted by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in April 2009, as well as the Implementation Standards for those principles issued by the FSB in September 2009. Compatibility With Effective Controls and Risk Management Principle 2 of the Guidance states that a banking organization should have strong controls governing its process for designing, implementing, and monitoring incentive compensation arrangements. An organization's policies and procedures should: Identify and describe the role(s) of the personnel, business units, and control units authorized to be involved in the design, implementation, and monitoring of incentive compensation arrangements; identify the source of significant risk-related inputs into these processes and establish appropriate controls governing the development and approval of these inputs to help ensure their integrity; and identify the individual(s) and control unit(s) whose approval is necessary for the establishment of new incentive compensation arrangements or modification of existing arrangements. Banking organizations also should create and maintain sufficient documentation to permit an audit of the organization's processes for establishing, modifying, and monitoring incentive compensation arrangements. The Guidance also states that a banking organization should conduct regular internal reviews to ensure that its processes for achieving and maintaining balanced incentive compensation arrangements are consistently followed. Such reviews should be conducted by audit, compliance, or other personnel in a manner consistent with the organization's overall framework for compliance monitoring. An organization's internal audit department also should separately conduct regular audits of the organization's compliance with its established policies and controls relating to incentive compensation arrangements. The results should be reported to appropriate levels of management and, where appropriate, the organization's board of directors. Strong Corporate Governance Principle 3 of the Guidance states that the board of directors should review and approve the overall goals and purposes of the firm's incentive compensation system. The board of directors should provide clear direction to management to ensure that its policies and procedures are carried out in a manner that achieves balance and is consistent with safety and soundness. The board of directors should approve and document any material exceptions or adjustments to the incentive compensation arrangements established for senior executives and should carefully consider and monitor the effects of any approved exceptions or adjustments on the balance of the arrangement, the risk-taking incentives of the senior executive, and the safety and soundness of the organization. The board of directors should receive and review, on an annual or more frequent basis, an assessment by management, with appropriate input from risk management personnel, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the organization's incentive compensation system in providing risk taking incentives that are consistent with the organization's safety and soundness. These reports should include an evaluation of whether or how incentive compensation practices may be encouraging excessive risk taking. These reviews and reports should be appropriately scoped to reflect the size and complexity of the banking organization's activities and the prevalence and scope of its incentive compensation arrangements. In addition, at banking organizations that are significant users of incentive compensation arrangements, the board should receive periodic reports that review incentive compensation awards and payments relative to risk outcomes on a backward-looking basis to determine whether the organization's incentive compensation arrangements may be promoting excessive risk-taking. Current Actions: On June 23, 2015, the Federal Reserve published a notice in the Federal Register (80 FR 35953) requesting comment for 60 days on the Recordkeeping Requirements Associated with the Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies. The comment period for this notice expired on August 24, 2015. The Federal Reserve did not receive any comments. The information collection will be extended as proposed. 5. Report title: Interagency Guidance on Managing Compliance and Reputation Risks for Reverse Mortgage Products. Agency form number: FR 4029. OMB control number: 7100-0330. Frequency: On occasion. Reporters: State member banks that originate proprietary and Home Equity Conversion Program (HECM) reverse mortgages. Estimated annual reporting hours: Implementation of policies and procedures, 680 hours; Review and maintenance of policies and procedures, 136 hours. Estimated average hours per response: Implementation of policies and procedures, 40 hours; Review and maintenance of policies and procedures, 8 hours. Number of respondents: Implementation of policies and procedures, 17 respondents; Review and maintenance of policies and procedures, 17 respondents. General description of report: Previously, the Board's Legal Division determined that the Board was authorized to issue this guidance pursuant to its authority under section 18(f) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which authorized the Board to prescribe regulations regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practice by banks (15 U.S.C. 57a(f)) and section 105 of the Truth in Lending Act, which authorized the Board to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) (15 U.S.C. 1604). However, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) much of the Board's authority under these laws was transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Nonetheless, we continue to believe that the Board has the authority to issue this guidance pursuant to its authority under section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), which generally authorizes the Board to establish safety and soundness standards for depository institutions supervised by the Board (12 U.S.C. 1381p-1(a)). Financial institutions' obligation under this guidance is voluntary. Because the documentation required by the guidance is maintained by each institution, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) would only be implicated if the Board's examiners retained a copy of this information as part of an examination or supervision of a bank. However, records VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:14 Sep Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Notices 1The Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision. 275 FR 50801. 3OMB Control No. 2502-0524. obtained as a part of an examination or supervision of a bank are exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(8), for examination material (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)). In addition, the information may also be kept confidential under exemption 4 of the FOIA which protects commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is privileged or confidential (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)). Abstract: Reverse mortgages are home-secured loans typically offered to elderly consumers. Financial institutions currently provide two types of reverse mortgage products: the lenders' own proprietary reverse mortgage products and reverse mortgages insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Reverse mortgage loans insured by the FHA are made pursuant to the guidelines and rules established by HUD's HECM program. HECM loans and proprietary reverse mortgages are also subject to the rules that implement consumer protection laws such as the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and TILA. In August 2010, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, on behalf of its member agencies, 1 published a Federal Register notice adopting supervisory guidance titled ''Reverse Mortgage Products: Guidance for Managing Compliance and Reputation Risks.'' 2The guidance is designed to help financial institutions with risk management and assist financial institutions' efforts to ensure that their reverse mortgage lending practices adequately address consumer compliance and reputation risks. The guidance describes reporting, recordkeeping, and disclosures for both proprietary and HECM reverse mortgages. A number of these disclosures are ''usual and customary'' business practices for proprietary and HECM reverse mortgages, and these would not meet the PRA's definition of ''paperwork.'' Other included disclosure requirements are currently mandated by RESPA or TILA for all reverse mortgage loans and information collections required by HUD's rules for HECM loans. 3Discussion of these requirements in the guidance is also not considered additional paperwork burden imposed by the guidance. Proprietary reverse mortgage products, however, are not subject to HUD's rules for HECM loans. To the extent that the interagency guidance applies HECM requirements to proprietary loans, this would meet the PRA's definition of paperwork burden. There are also additional provisions in the guidance that apply to both proprietary and HECM reverse mortgages that do not meet the ''usual and customary'' standard, are not covered by already approved information collections and, therefore, likewise meet the PRA's definition of paperwork burden. Proprietary Reverse Mortgages Financial institutions offering proprietary reverse mortgages are encouraged under the guidance to follow or adopt relevant HECM requirements for mandatory counseling, disclosures, affordable origination fees, restrictions on cross-selling of ancillary products, and reliable appraisals. Proprietary and HECM Reverse Mortgages Financial institutions offering either proprietary or HECM reverse mortgages are encouraged to develop clear and balanced product descriptions and make them available to consumers shopping for a mortgage. They should set forth a description of how disbursements can be received and include timely information to supplement disclosures mandated by TILA and other disclosures. Promotional materials and product descriptions should include information about the costs, terms, features, and risks of reverse mortgage products. Financial institutions should adopt policies and procedures that prohibit directing a consumer to a particular counseling agency or contacting a counselor on the consumer's behalf. They should adopt clear written policies and establish internal controls specifying that neither the lender nor any broker will require the borrower to purchase any other product from the lender in order to obtain the mortgage. Policies should be clear so that originators do not have an inappropriate incentive to sell other products that appear linked to the granting of a mortgage. Legal and compliance reviews should include oversight of compensation programs so that lending personnel are not improperly encouraged to direct consumers to particular products. Financial institutions making, purchasing, or servicing reverse mortgages through a third party should conduct due diligence and establish criteria for third-party relationships and compensation. They should set requirements for agreements and establish systems to monitor compliance with the agreement and applicable laws and regulations. They should also take corrective action if a third party fails to comply. Third-party relationships should be structured in a way that does not conflict with RESPA. Current Actions: On June 23, 2015, the Federal Reserve published a notice in the Federal Register (80 FR 35953) requesting comment for 60 days on the Supervisory Guidance on Managing Compliance and Reputation Risks for Reverse Mortgage Products. The comment period for this notice expired on August 24, 2015. The Federal Reserve did not receive any comments. The information collection will be extended as proposed.

ACTION : Notice of public meeting; request for comments. SUMMARY : The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a public meeting entitled ''Drug Interactions with Hormonal Contraceptives: Public Health and Drug Development Implications'' and an opportunity for public comment on the topic of drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives (HCs). The goal of this public meeting is to provide an opportunity for FDA to seek input from experts on the public health concerns associated with use of HCs and interacting drugs that might affect efficacy and safety, pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) considerations in designing drug interaction studies with HCs during drug development, and approaches to translating the results of drug interaction information into informative labeling and communication. The input received may be used to refine FDA's thinking on HC drug interaction study design and interpretation, and labeling communication on drug interaction risk. DATES : The public meeting will be held on November 9, 2015, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Individuals who wish to attend the meeting in person or via Web cast must register by October 9, 2015. Please submit either electronic or written comments by December 15, 2015, to receive consideration.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : I. Background In general, HCs are highly effective in preventing pregnancy when used correctly. However, concomitant use of other drugs may affect the safety and/or efficacy of HCs due to drug interactions affecting either blood levels (PK) and/or physiologic effects (PD) of HC components (e.g., estrogen and progestins). Understanding drug interaction potential of HCs and other drugs is important when investigating HC-related issues, and in the design and conduct of clinical trials. Evolving knowledge on drug interaction mechanisms has led to new insights and increased interest in the clinical investigation of drug interactions with HCs. Historically, most drug interaction studies conducted during drug development with HCs have not had a clearly stated rationale for the choice of HCs being studied. Questions remain as to whether the study results of specific contraceptive steroids can be extrapolated to other progestins or estrogens or other dose strengths. The choice of HC is important because different progestins may have different metabolic and/or transporter pathways and safety profiles. Without a mechanistic understanding of the underlying drug-drug interaction (DDI) mechanism, it is difficult to interpret and extrapolate study results from one HC to another. II. Discussion Topics for the Meeting and for Public Comments The public meeting on November 9, 2015, will include a discussion of the following topics on which FDA is also seeking public comment: Public health concerns associated with use of HCs and interacting drugs that might affect efficacy and safety. PK and PD considerations in designing drug interaction studies with HCs during drug development. Key elements in designing a study include a mechanistic understanding of potential DDI mechanisms, the choice of contraceptive products and their dose, study population/duration, and proper selection of a PK alone or PK-PD-based drug interaction study approach. Drug interaction study result interpretation and its potential impact on guidance of HC use in women of childbearing potential who are enrolled in clinical trials for other therapeutic agents during drug development. The current approach of translating the results from drug interaction studies into labeling recommendations and opportunities to improve the communication to healthcare providers. Research opportunities and tools for investigating the safe use of HCs in the presence of other drugs. The input received may be used to refine FDA's thinking on the drug interaction study design with HCs and labeling communication of drug interaction risks with HCs. III.

To request more information on the proposed projects or to obtain a copy of the information collection plans, call the SAMHSA Reports Clearance Officer on (240) 276- 1243. Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed collections of information are necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Proposed Project: Services Accountability Improvement System\u2014 (OMB No. 0930-0208)\u2014Revision The Services Accountability Improvement System (SAIS) is a real- time, performance management system that captures information on the substance abuse treatment and mental health services delivered in the United States. A wide range of client and program information is captured through SAIS for approximately 650 grantees. Continued approval of this information collection will allow SAMHSA to continue to meet Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) reporting requirements that quantify the effects and accomplishments of its discretionary grant programs which are consistent with OMB guidance. Based on current funding and planned fiscal year 2015 notice of funding announcements (NOFA), the CSAT programs that will use these measures in fiscal years 2015 through 2017 include: Access to Recovery 3 (ATR3); Adult Treatment Court Collaboratives (ATCC); Enhancing Adult Drug Court Services, Coordination and Treatment (EADCS); Offender Reentry Program (ORP); Treatment Drug Court (TDC); Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention\u2014Juvenile Drug Courts (OJJDP-JDC); Teen Court Program (TCP); HIV/AIDS Outreach Program; Targeted Capacity Expansion Program for Substance Abuse Treatment and HIV/AIDS Services (TCE-HIV); Addictions Treatment for the Homeless (AT-HM); Cooperative Agreements to Benefit Homeless Individuals (CABHI); Cooperative Agreements to Benefit Homeless Individuals\u2014States (CABHI- States); Recovery-Oriented Systems of Care (ROSC); Targeted to Peer (TCE-PTP); Pregnant and Postpartum Women (PPW); Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT); Targeted Capacity Expansion (TCE); Targeted Capacity Expansion\u2014Health Information Technology (TCE-HIT); Targeted Capacity Expansion Technology Assisted Care (TCE-TAC); Addiction Technology Transfer Centers (ATTC); International Addiction Technology Transfer Centers (I-ATTC); State Adolescent Treatment Enhancement and Dissemination (SAT- ED); Grants to Expand Substance Abuse Treatment Capacity in Adult Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts and Juvenile Drug Courts; and Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals\u2014Services in Supportive Housing (GBHI). Grantees in the Adult Treatment Court Collaborative program (ATCC) will also provide program-level data using the CSAT Aggregate Instrument. SAMHSA and its Centers will use the data for annual reporting required by GPRA and for National Outcome Measures (NOMs) comparing baseline with discharge and follow-up data. GPRA requires that SAMHSA's report for each fiscal year include actual results of performance monitoring for the three preceding fiscal years. The additional information collected through this process will allow SAMHSA to report on the results of these performance outcomes as well as be consistent with the specific performance domains that SAMHSA is implementing as the NOMs, to assess the accountability and performance of its discretionary and formula grant programs. Note that there are no changes to the instrument from the previous OMB submission.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Thomas Bonetti, Natural Resource Planner, 413-253-8307 (phone); northeastplanning@fws.gov (email). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Introduction With this notice, we continue the CCP process for Chincoteague NWR and Wallops Island NWR, which we began by publishing a notice of intent in the Federal Register (75 FR 57056) on September 17, 2010. For more about the initial process and the history of the refuges, see that notice. On May 15, 2014, we announced the release of the draft CCP/EIS to the public and requested comments in a notice of availability in the Federal Register (79 FR 27906). We subsequently extended the public comment period in another notice in the Federal Register (79 FR 41300) on July 15, 2014. In addition, EPA published a notice announcing the draft CCP and EIS (79 FR 29759; May 23, 2014), as required under section 309 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.). We now announce the final CCP and EIS. Under the CAA, EPA also will announce the final CCP and EIS via the Federal Register. EPA's Role in the EIS Process The EPA is charged under section 309 of the Clean Air Act to review all Federal agencies' EISs and to comment on the adequacy and the acceptability of the environmental impacts of proposed actions in the EISs. EPA also serves as the repository (EIS database) for EISs prepared by Federal agencies and provides notice of their availability in the Federal Register. The EIS Database provides information about EISs prepared by Federal agencies, as well as EPA's comments concerning the EISs. All EISs are filed with EPA, which publishes a notice of availability on Fridays in the Federal Register. The notice of availability is the start of the 45-day public comment period for draft EISs, and the start of the 30-day ''wait period'' for final EISs, during which agencies are generally required to wait 30 days before making a decision on a proposed action. For more information, see http://www.epa.gov/compliance/nepa/eisdata.html. You may search for EPA comments on EISs, along with EISs themselves, at https:// cdxnodengn.epa.gov/cdx-enepa-public/ action/eis/search. We completed a thorough analysis of impacts on the human environment in the final CCP/EIS, and responded to public comments. The CCP will guide us in managing and administering the refuges for 15 years. Alternative B, as we described in the final CCP/EIS, is our preferred alternative. Background The CCP Process The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee) (Refuge Administration Act), as amended by the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, requires us to develop a CCP for each NWR. The purpose for developing a CCP is to provide refuge managers with a 15-year plan for achieving refuge purposes and goals and contributing to the mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System. CCPs should be consistent with sound principles of fish and wildlife management, conservation, legal mandates, and our policies, as well as respond to key issues and public concerns. In addition to outlining broad management direction on conserving wildlife and their habitats, CCPs identify wildlife-dependent recreational opportunities available to the public, including opportunities for hunting, fishing, wildlife observation and photography, and environmental education and interpretation. We will review and update the CCP at least every 15 years, in accordance with the Refuge Administration Act. CCP/EIS Alternatives We evaluated three alternatives for managing Chincoteague NWR and Wallops Island NWR; alternative B is our preferred alternative. Based on feedback on the draft CCP/EIS, some modifications have been made to alternative B and are summarized below. A full description of all alternatives, including changes to our preferred alternative, can be found in the final CCP/EIS at the sources identified in ADDRESSES . Changes to Alternative B, the Service's Preferred Alternative The assigned area, consisting of the 1-mile recreational beach, associated parking, and new Visitor Contact Station, would extend south 1 more mile to the terminus of Swan Cove Trail (2 miles total), thus doubling the length of the assigned area. Over sand vehicles (OSV) and hiking access would continue via Beach Road across Toms Cove south to Fishing Point September 16 through March 14. A new 12-mile, OSV zone to facilitate the six priority uses (March 15 through September 15) would be VerDate Sep<11>2014 15:14 Sep Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Notices developed south of new recreational beach, and added to the new assigned area. We would continue current management of the Overwash and Hook area for shorebirds until the new recreational beach is established, at which time the March 15 through September 15 closure would go into effect. We will keep current biking access open via Swan Cove Trail and will not propose an alternative bike route north to the relocated public beach (from Wildlife Loop to Mallard (C Dike)). The Service Road would continue to be open year-round to hikers north to the refuge/National Seashore boundary. A section of the Affected Environment (Chapter 3) on cultural resources was inadvertently left out of the draft CCP/EIS. This section, which has been coordinated with the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, is included in the final CCP/EIS. Other Features of Alternative B Alternative B would continue established habitat and wildlife management strategies but focus them in light of the new goals and vision established by the CCP. The alternative balances habitat management, public use and access, and administration of the refuge. We would continue to preserve approximately 2,650 acres of wetland impoundments, but make adjustments in accordance with a new impoundment management plan that takes into account various factors, such as the habitat needs of black ducks and monarch butterflies, climate change and natural coastal processes, and relocated beach access and parking. The refuge would continue to protect and enhance the wilderness character of the 1974 proposed wilderness area, and there would be no change in its size (1,300 acres) or location. In recognition of the vulnerability of the current parking, the refuge would develop and implement a site design plan for parking and access to a new beach location, approximately 1.5 miles north of the existing beach. We are committed to working with the National Park Service (NPS) and others to future design, refine, and analyze beach relocation infrastructure in a separate National Environmental Policy Act document. Over the next 15 years, the refuge would maintain and, where possible, expand current hunting opportunities by including additional species, extending hours, and providing special events. The refuge would add mourning doves, light geese, and non-migratory Canada goose hunting opportunities to the refuge's migratory bird hunting program. Additionally, the refuge would allow migratory bird hunting on Federal holidays within the Commonwealth of Virginia hunting seasons. The refuge would also add turkeys to the big game hunting program and pursue development of a trapping program for furbearers. The refuge would continue sika hunting and would conduct research to identify a desired population size. The refuge would pursue partnerships to enhance land conservation, environmental education, and interpretation on the Delmarva Peninsula. The ''Chincoteague ponies'' have a strong cultural tie to the community, and the refuge would implement a Chincoteague pony management plan that meets multiple objectives: visitor viewing, habitat management, and pony health. The refuge would allow grazing of the current pony population, with a maximum pony herd size of 150, per the management agreement with the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. Public Availability of Documents You can view or obtain the final CCP/ EIS as indicated under ADDRESSES . Comments During the public comment period, a total of 236 emails and 94 letters were received, including official comments from the town of Chincoteague, the Chincoteague Chamber of Commerce, The Nature Conservancy, NPS, Environmental Protection Agency, various departments from the Commonwealth of Virginia, and other local interest groups. In addition a petition was submitted supporting Alternative ''A plus,'' an alternative with elements of both alternative A and B, with approximately 600 individuals signing. Another petition supporting the preferred alternative (alternative B) was submitted with 112 individuals signing. We held two public open house meetings in Chincoteague, and additional meetings in Melfa, Virginia, and Pocomoke City, Maryland. As part of the public involvement process, we held a public hearing on June 26, 2014, in Chincoteague with 28 people formally raising a variety of issues and concerns. We evaluated all the letters and emails sent to us during that comment period, along with comments recorded at our public hearing, and addressed all substantive comments. A summary of those comments and our responses to them is included in the final CCP/EIS as appendix R. Next Steps We will document the final decision in a record of decision, which will be published in the Federal Register after a 30-day ''wait period'' that begins when EPA announces this final CCP-EIS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : McEwen Mining Inc. (McEwen) proposes to develop a gold mine in the southwest portion of the Roberts Mountains, approximately 30 miles northwest of Eureka, Nevada. The proposed McEwen Gold Bar Mine Project (Project) consists of a mining Plan of Operations and four ROW grant authorizations to be analyzed in a single NEPA analysis document. Mining would occur from the existing Gold Pick and Gold Ridge pits and the proposed Cabin Creek North and South pits. Additional disturbance would be result from activities associated with gold mining operations, including waste rock disposal areas, crusher and ore stockpile pad, growth media stockpiles, process ponds, haul roads, access roads and power lines, heap leach facility, ancillary facilities, and diversion channels and sediment basins. Total proposed Project disturbance would be approximately 1,300 acres, including disturbance associated with the ROWs (consisting of approximately 1,137 acres of surface disturbance on public land and 163 acres of surface disturbance on private land controlled by McEwen, as well as other private land owners); 366 acres of the total disturbance would occur on areas disturbed by previous mining operations. The proposed Project would take up to 17 years to complete, including: A year of pre- stripping and construction, 8 years of mining, 4 years of reclamation following mine closure, and 4 years of post- reclamation monitoring. The proposed pit depths would not intercept groundwater. No pit dewatering would be necessary and no pit lakes are expected to form after mining operations end. The Project is expected to employ 151 individuals comprised of 90 contractors and 61 staff. Mt. Wheeler Power requested a ROW grant authorization to supply needed power to the Project. McEwen has requested three ROW grant authorizations for the following: 1) Primary access along the Atlas Haul Road; 2) Employee transport and emergency secondary access along North Roberts Creek Road and GB Process Road; and 3) A water supply pipeline. The Gold Bar Project boundary contains 916.5 acres of Greater Sage- Grouse Preliminary Priority Habitat (PPH) on BLM-managed public lands. The total mine disturbance, including the right-of-way (ROW), affecting Greater Sage-Grouse habitat on public land is 294 acres of PPH and 36 acres of Preliminary General Habitat (PGH). Since 2013, BLM biologists at the Mount Lewis Field Office have coordinated with the Nevada Department of Wildlife and the BLM State Office regarding Gold Bar's ROW and disturbance to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. Collectively, the organizations formulated best management practices for Greater Sage- Grouse and other wildlife species and developed measures to offset the potential disturbance associated with the project to benefit Greater Sage- Grouse habitat. For example, as a result of this collaboration, the proposed project's power line was re-routed to use pre-existing routes in order to minimize effects to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. These and other measures, including compliance with the Nevada and Northeastern California Greater Sage- Grouse Land Use Plan Amendment, if finalized, will be among the issues analyzed in the EIS. The purpose of the public scoping process is to determine relevant issues that will influence the scope of the environmental analysis, including alternatives, and guide the process for developing the EIS. At present, the BLM has identified the following preliminary issues: Water resources; air quality; vegetation resources (including noxious weeds); wildlife (including migratory birds and Greater Sage-Grouse); special status species; grazing management; land use and access; cultural geological recreation; values; hazardous materials; Native American cultural concerns; and wild horses. The BLM will utilize and coordinate the NEPA scoping process to help fulfill the public involvement requirements under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (54 U.S.C. 306108) as provided in 36 CFR 800.2(d)(3). The information about historic and cultural resources within the area potentially affected by the proposed Project will assist the BLM in identifying and evaluating impacts to such resources in the context of both NEPA and NHPA. The BLM will consult with Indian tribes on a government-to-government basis in accordance with Executive Order 13175 and other policies. Tribal concerns, including impacts on Indian trust assets and potential impacts to cultural resources, will be given due consideration. Federal, State, and local agencies, along with tribes and other stakeholders that may be interested in or affected by the proposed Project that the BLM is evaluating, are invited to participate in the scoping process and, if eligible, may request or be requested by the BLM to participate in the development of the environmental analysis as a cooperating agency. Before including your address, phone number, email address, or other personal identifying information in your comment, you should be aware that your entire comment\u2014including your personal identifying information\u2014may be made publicly available at any time. While you can ask us in your comment to withhold your personal identifying information from public review, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so. Authority: 40 CFR 1501.7 Joseph S.

Coordination of the remedy programs may include ''acceleration,'' prioritization, organization, and/or phasing of some or all such air bag inflator remedy programs to ensure that defective vehicles and equipment are recalled and remedied. 49 U.S.C. 30118-30120; 49 CFR 573, 577. It may further include, among other things, coordination as to air bag inflator sourcing, production, allocation, delivery, installation, and adequacy of the remedy. 49 U.S.C. 30120(c)(3); 49 CFR 573.14.

NHTSA anticipates that information will be provided in presentations by NHTSA personnel and vehicle manufacturers, and that inflator suppliers and organizations conducting inflator testing may also present information relevant to the investigation into the defective Takata air bag inflators and to the Coordinated Remedy Program Proceeding. NHTSA has determined that given the importance of the subject matter and of public education on this significant defect and recall, it is appropriate to hold a public information meeting to provide updated information relevant to NHTSA's decision-making process in the Coordinated Remedy Program Proceeding. Any interested person may provide written comments regarding a possible Coordinated Remedy Program, including questions or factors the individual believes NHTSA should consider in deciding whether, and if so how, NHTSA should exercise its authority under the Safety Act.

The Line extends between milepost 141.4 in Columbus, Ohio, and milepost 155.4 in Lilly Chapel, Ohio. 2 This transaction is related to a concurrently filed verified notice of exemption in Indiana Boxcar Corporation\u2014Continuance in Control Exemption\u2014Camp Chase Railway Company, LLC, FD 35955, wherein Indiana Boxcar Corporation seeks Board approval to continue in control of CCRY, upon CCRY's becoming a Class III rail carrier. The transaction may not be consummated until September 27, 2015 (30 days after the notice of exemption was filed). CCRY certifies that its projected annual revenues as a result of this transaction will not result in its becoming a Class II or Class I rail carrier and will not exceed $5 million. CCRY states that the transaction does not involve any provision or agreement that limits future interchange with a third-party connecting carrier. If the verified notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the effectiveness of the exemption. Petitions to stay must be filed no later than September 18, 2015 (at least seven days before the exemption becomes effective).

Once consummation has occurred, CCRY will replace CCRA as the owner and operator of the Camp Chase Industrial Track. The transaction may be consummated on or after September 27, 2015, the effective date of the exemption (30 days after the notice of exemption was filed). IBCX currently owns three Class III rail carriers operating in four states: Vermilion Valley Railroad Company, Inc., operating in Illinois; Chesapeake & Indiana Railroad Company, Inc., operating in Indiana; and Youngstown & Southeastern Railway Company, Inc., operating in Ohio and Pennsylvania. IBCX certifies that: (1) The Camp Chase Industrial Track does not connect with any carrier which IBCX owns; (2) the transaction is not part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect these railroads with each other; and (3) the transaction does not involve a Class I rail carrier. Therefore, the transaction is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11323. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). Under 49 U.S.C. 10502(g), the Board may not use its exemption authority to relieve a rail carrier of its statutory obligation to protect the interests of its employees. Section 11326(c), however, does not provide for labor protection for transactions under \u00a7 11324 and \u00a7 11325 that involve only Class III rail carriers. Accordingly, the Board may not impose labor protective conditions here because all of the carriers involved are Class III carriers. If the verified notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the effectiveness of the exemption. Stay petitions must be filed no later than September 18, 2015 (at least seven days before the exemption becomes effective).

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Juanita Perry, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Room 7266, Washington, DC 20410; telephone (202) 402-3970; TTY number for the hearing- and speech- impaired (202) 708-2565 (these telephone numbers are not toll-free), or call the toll-free Title V information line at 800-927-7588. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : In accordance with 24 CFR part 581 and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in National Coalition for the Homeless v. Veterans Administration, No. 88-2503- OG (D.D.C.). Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable, and suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless. Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from the date of this Notice. Where property is described as for ''off-site use only'' recipients of the property will be required to relocate the building to their own site at their own expense. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression of interest to HHS, addressed to: Ms. Theresa M. Ritta, Chief Real Property Branch, the Department of Health and Human Services, Room 5B-17, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, is not a toll-free number.) HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications, the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 24 CFR part 581. For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable. For properties listed as suitable/ unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available. Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the toll free information line at 1- 800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to Ann Marie Oliva at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property address (including zip code), the date of publication in the Federal Register, the landholding agency, and the property number. For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (i.e., acreage, floor plan, existing sanitary facilities, exact street address), providers should contact the appropriate landholding agencies at the following addresses: Air Force: Mr. Robert E.

Calculation of the pay gap using average weekly wages has the advantage of accounting for differences in hours worked, which is not captured in calculations using annual wage data. However, calculations using weekly wage data do not account for forms of compensation other than those paid as weekly wages, unlike annual wage calculations. While neither method is perfect, analyses that account for factors like occupation and qualifications further support the existence of a significant gender-based pay disparity. 6Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Highlights of Women's Earnings (Dec. 2014) (averaging annual data collected from the Current Population Survey, Median Weekly Earnings of Full-Time Wage and Salary Workers), available at http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/cps/highlights-of- womens-earnings-in-2013.pdf (last accessed Feb.10, 2015). DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs 41 CFR Part 60-1 RIN 1250-AA06 Government Contractors, Prohibitions Against Pay Secrecy Policies and Actions AGENCY : Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), Labor. ACTION : Final rule. SUMMARY : The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) publishes this final rule to implement Executive Order 13665 (also referred to as ''the Order,'' infra) issued on April 8, 2014 to prohibit Federal contractors from discriminating against, in any manner, employees and job applicants who inquire about, discuss, or disclose their own compensation or the compensation of other employees or applicants. Executive Order 13665 amends Executive Order 11246, which prohibits employment discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin, by revising the mandatory equal opportunity clauses that are included in Federal contracts and subcontracts, and federally assisted construction contracts, and creating contractor defenses. This final rule defines key terms used in Executive Order 13665 and adopts other key provisions in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). The final rule also adds a section to the implementing regulations for Executive Order 11246. This section not only describes potential defenses for contractors but also requires contractors to notify employees and job applicants of the nondiscrimination protection created by section 2(b) of Executive Order 13665 using existing methods of communicating to applicants and employees. The implementing regulations for Executive Order 11246 set forth the basic equal employment opportunity requirements that apply to Federal contractors and subcontractors. DATES : Effective Date: These regulations are effective January 11, 2016. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Debra A.

The rule also is available on the Regulations.gov Web site at http://www.regulations.gov or on the OFCCP Web site at http://www.dol.gov/ofccp. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Executive Summary The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is a civil rights and worker protection agency. OFCCP enforces an Executive Order and two laws that prohibit employment discrimination and require affirmative action by companies doing business with the Federal Government. 1 Specifically, Federal contractors must not discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran. They must also engage in affirmative action and provide equal employment opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran. OFCCP evaluates the employment practices of nearly 4,000 Federal contractors and subcontractors 2 annually, and investigates individual complaints. OFCCP also engages in outreach to employees of Federal contractors to educate them about their rights, and provides technical assistance to contractors on their nondiscrimination and affirmative action obligations. These compliance evaluations and complaint investigations determine contractor compliance with VEVRAA, which prohibits employment discrimination against certain protected veterans. OFCCP also determines compliance with Section 503, which prohibits employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. Finally, OFCCP assesses compliance with Executive Order 11246, as amended, which prohibits employment discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. Compensation discrimination is one form of discrimination prohibited by Executive Order 11246. On April 8, 2014, President Obama issued Executive Order 13665, entitled ''Non-Retaliation for Disclosure of Compensation Information,'' amending section 202 of Executive Order 11246 to prohibit Federal contractors from discharging or discriminating in any way against employees or applicants who inquire about, discuss, or disclose their own compensation or the compensation of another employee or applicant. 3This final rule adopts key provisions in the NPRM4to promulgate new regulations implementing Executive Order 13665, which apply to covered federal contracts and federally assisted construction contracts. The provisions of this final rule and Executive Order 11246, as amended by Executive Order 13665, apply to covered contracts entered into or modified on or after the rule's effective date. Modified contracts are contracts with any alteration in their terms and conditions, including supplemental agreements, amendments, and extensions. See 41 CFR 60-1.3 Definitions (definition of ''Government contract''). Despite the existence of laws protecting workers from gender-based compensation discrimination for more than five decades, a pay gap between men and women persists today. Among the possible contributing factors to the enduring pay gap is the prevalence of workplace prohibitions on discussing compensation. A comparison of average annual wage data from 2013 reveals that women make 78 cents for every dollar that men make. 5Data on average weekly wages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the same year shows a similar gap, with women making 82 cents for every dollar that men make. 6The wage VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 RULES54935 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 7Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Current Population Survey, Median usual weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers by selected characteristics, annual averages, available at http://www.bls.gov/news. release/wkyeng.t07.htm (last accessed Feb.10, 2015). 8U.S. Census, Current Population Survey, 2012 Person Income, ''Table PINC-10: Wage and Salary Workers\u2014People 15 Years Old and Over, by Total Wage and Salary Income in 2012, Work Experience in 2012, Race, Hispanic Origin, and Sex,'' (comparing median wage for people working 50 or more weeks), available at https://www.census.gov/ hhes/www/cpstables/032013/perinc/pinc10 _ 000.htm (last accessed Feb.10, 2015). 9U.S. American Community, ''Survey 1-Year Estimates 2013, Table DP02: Selected Social Characteristics in the United States,'' available at http://factfinder.census.gov/ faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk (last accessed Aug. 4, 2015). The calculation uses family households headed by females living in a household with family and no husband. A family household includes a householder, one or more people living in the same household who are related to the householder, and anyone else living in the same household. 10U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, ''1-Year Estimates 2013, Geographies: United States, Table DP03: Selected Economic Characteristics,'' available at http:// factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_ 13_1YR_ DP03&prodType=table (last accessed Aug. 4, 2015). To determine whether a household falls below the poverty level, the U.S. Census Bureau considers the income of the householder, size of family, number of related children, and, for 1- and 2-person families, age of householder. The poverty threshold in 2013 was $18,769 for a single householder and two children under 18. 11Maria Shriver, ''The Shriver Report A Women's Nation Pushes Back from the Brink,'' Executive Summary (Jan. 2014). The ''brink'' is defined in the report as less than 200 percent of the federal poverty line, or about $47,000 per year for a family of four. 12Sarah Jane Glynn, Center for American Progress, ''Explaining the Gender Wage Gap,'' (May 2014), available at https:// www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/report/2014/05/19/90039/explaining-the-gender-wage-gap/ (last accessed Aug. 3, 2015). See also Jane Farrell and Sarah Jane Glynn, ''What Causes the Gender Wage Gap?,'' (Apr. 10, 2013). This report concluded that more than 40 percent of the gender wage gap is ''unexplained,'' meaning that there is no obvious measureable reason for a difference in pay. This leaves us with possible explanations that range from overt sexism to unintentional gender-based discrimination to reluctance among women to negotiate for higher pay. 13Sarah Jane Glynn, Center for American Progress, ''Explaining the Gender Wage Gap,'' (May 2014), available at https:// www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/report/2014/05/19/90039/explaining-the-gender-wage-gap/ (last accessed Aug. 3, 2015). 14Sarah Jane Glynn, Center for American Progress, ''Explaining the Gender Wage Gap,'' (May 2014), available at https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/report/2014/05/19/90039/explaining-the-gender-wage-gap/ (last accessed Aug. 3, 2015).

This study found that, when comparing equally qualified women job candidates, women who were mothers were recommended for significantly lower starting salaries, perceived as less competent, and less likely to be recommended for hire than non-mothers. 17Calculation is based on U.S. Census Table P-24: Historical Income Tables: People. See Alex Wall, ''Why It's Time for Equal Pay,'' available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/04/15/tens- thousands-people-have-shared-why-its-time-equal- pay (last accessed Aug. 21, 2015). 18Id. at 2. This study shows that Hispanic men and women, grouped together, had the smallest within-group gap yet earned the least when compared to the other major racial and ethnic groups including white, Asian American, and African-American. Asian Americans earned the most as a group yet had the largest within-group gap. 19Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, ''Current Population Survey, Median usual weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers by selected characteristics, annual averages,'' available at http://www.bls.gov/ news.release/wkyeng.t07.htm (last accessed Feb.12, 2015). gap is wider for some women of color when compared to non-Hispanic white men. On average in 2014, BLS median weekly earnings data shows that African-American women earn 68 cents and Latina women earn 61 cents, and Asian women earn 94 cents for every dollar earned by a non-Hispanic white man. 7Census data shows similar disparities, with African-American women making 64 cents, Latina women making 56 cents, and Asian women making 86 cents per dollar earned by a non-Hispanic white man. 8Research has found that many factors contribute to the wage gap, including discrimination and occupational differences. The impact of the wage gap remains a significant problem, especially for the working poor. While the gap may not be larger for poor women when compared to more affluent women, the economic impact of the disparity is greater for poor women who are already in financial jeopardy. U.S. Census data show that more than 15.2 million family households in the United States are headed by women. 9Nearly 31 percent of these families, or nearly 4,700,000 family households, have incomes that fall below the poverty level. 10 Eliminating the wage gap could go a long way toward closing the overall income gap and reducing the poverty rate for working women. A 2014 report by Maria Shriver and the Center for American Progress found that a third of all American women are living at or near a space called ''the brink of poverty.'' 11According to the report, this equals to 42 million women plus the 28 million children who depend on them. Generally, it is true that men and women tend to work in different industries and occupations. Women are much more likely than men to be clustered in a limited number of occupations, with slightly less than half or 44 percent of all working women employed in the 20 most common occupations for women. These occupations include secretaries and administrative assistants, registered nurses, and school teachers. 12Only about 35 percent of men are employed in the 20 most common occupations for male workers, including truck drivers, managers, and supervisors. 13According to some studies, these differences in occupations result in occupational segregation that significantly contributes to the wage gap. Occupational segregation contributes to the suppression of earnings for women as research shows that women-dominated industries pay lower wages than male- dominated industries requiring similar skill levels, 14and the effect is more pronounced in jobs requiring higher levels of education.15Women are more likely to be concentrated in low-wage work, and they make up the majority of minimum-wage workers in the United States. Although some of the wage gap is due to occupational segregation, that does not mean that the wage difference can be overcome by women making different career or work choices. In part, the gap is due to factors such as sex discrimination, including gender stereotyping. 16By age 65, the typical woman will have lost $420,000 over her working lifetime because of the earnings gap. This is based on median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers at age 25 and above in 2013 and assumes that the woman works every year between ages 25 and 65. 17 In every racial group, women earn less than their male counterparts, according to U.S. Census Bureau data analyzed by the Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR). 18In addition to demonstrating a wage gap between men and women, the research also reveals a wage gap amongst various racial groups. Moreover, at the beginning of 2015, median weekly earnings for African- American men working at full-time jobs totaled $680 per week, only 76 percent of the median for white men ($897), according to BLS data, and the median weekly earnings for African-American women equaled $611 per week, only 68 percent of the median for white men. 19 VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54936 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 20Roland G.

This report found that while earnings for women and men typically increase with higher levels of education, male-female pay gap persists at all levels of education for full-time workers (35 or more hours per week), according to 2009 BLS wage data. See, e.g., June Elliot O'Neill, ''The Gender Gap in Wages, Circa 2000,'' American Economic Review (May 2003). Even so, after controlling for differences in skills and job characteristics, women still earn less than men. Council of Economic Advisers, ''Explaining Trends in the Gender Wage Gap,'' (June 1998), http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/CEA/html/gendergap.html (last accessed March 6, 2015). Ultimately, the research literature still finds an unexplained gap exists even after accounting for potential explanations, and finds that the narrowing of the pay gap for women has slowed since the 1980's.

A study based on the hiring pattern of male and female workers in the state of New Jersey found that employers offered African-Americans lower wages, compared to their white counterparts, when re-entering the job market after periods of unemployment. 20The study showed that the pay gap between these two groups is typically 30 percent. 21 Controlling for various factors such as skills and previous earnings, the study found that up to a third of this pay gap could be attributed to racial discrimination in the labor market. 22 Similarly, a study based on National Longitudinal Survey data found that the pay gap between African-Americans and whites continues to exist, even after controlling for abilities and schooling choices. 23 Many of the studies analyzing pay disparities for Hispanic populations focus on differences in education and age as compared to white workers. 24 However, even after analyzing the effect of these factors, these studies showed that these factors do not account for the entire pay gap for Hispanics. 25 Potentially nondiscriminatory factors can explain some of the gender wage differences, but accounting for them does not account for the full pay gap. 26 Additionally, women earn less even within occupations. In a recent study of newly trained doctors, after considering the effects of specialty, practice setting, work hours and other factors, the gender pay gap was nearly $17,000 in 2008. 27 Catalyst, a nonprofit research organization, reviewed 2011 government data showing a gender pay gap for women lawyers, 28and that data confirms that the gap exists for a range of professional and technical occupations. 29In fact, according to a study by IWPR that used 2011 information from BLS, women frequently earn less than men within the same occupations. 30Despite differences in the types of jobs women and men typically perform, women earn less than men in male dominated occupations such as managers, software developers and CEO's and even in those jobs commonly filled by women such as teachers, nurses and receptionists. 31 These statistics provide an overview of the full societal impact of the pay gap, which will not be fully addressed by this rule. For example, such general information about pay differentials among men and women includes pay differentials that may not be attributed to discrimination. In addition, these statistics include all employers and all employees in the U.S., whereas this final rule applies only to Federal contractors and their employees. Therefore, the potential impact of this rule in reducing the pay gap would be much smaller than the impact of eliminating the pay gap among all working men and women. Whether communicated through a written employment policy or through informal means, restrictions on revealing compensation can conceal compensation disparities that exist among employees. Although very little research has been conducted about pay secrecy policies and their effects, a recent survey by IWPR provides some insight into the prevalence of workplace rules against discussing compensation. The survey found that 51 percent of female respondents and 47 percent of male respondents reported that the discussion of wage and salary information is either discouraged or prohibited and/or could lead to punishment. 32Further, the IWPR study found that institutional barriers to discussing compensation were much more common among private employers than among public employers. 33Sixty- two percent (62 percent) of women and 60 percent of men working for private employers reported that discussion of wage and salary information is discouraged or prohibited, compared to only 18 percent of women and 11 percent of men working in the public sector. 34 In a different survey of private sector employers, 49 percent of the employers surveyed admitted having a specific policy regarding pay secrecy or confidentiality issues, 35and most managers agreed with the use of pay secrecy policies. 36This survey also found that only 1 in 14 employers VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54937 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 37Id. at 125 (citing HRnext Survey). 38Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding between OFCCP and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), OFCCP generally refers individual discrimination complaints subject to both Executive Order 11246 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the EEOC for investigation, but keeps systemic discrimination complaints, 76 FR 71029 (Nov. 16, 2011). 39OFCCP reviews approximately 4,000 Federal contractors annually. These contractors are scheduled for compliance evaluations based on various sources of information, including federal procurement databases, Employer Information Reports (EEO-1 reports), Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) data, U.S. Census data, and statistical thresholds such as industry type and employee counts of federal contractor establishments. The scheduling process is ''neutral'' rather than ''random'' because it is based on a methodology that includes specific criteria. OFCCP does not target specific contractors. 40White House National Pay Task Force, ''Fifty Years After the Equal Pay Act: Assessing the Past, Taking Stock of the Future,'' June American Prospect, April 23, 2008, http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=tap_talks_ with_ lilly_ ledbetter (last accessed Feb.13, 2015). 41Id. at 22. 42Ledbetter v.

Underpaid employees, who may be paid less because of their gender or race, will remain unaware of the disparity if compensation remains hidden. Thus, they are precluded from exercising their rights through OFCCP's complaint procedures. OFCCP enforces the prohibition against compensation discrimination by investigating class complaints of compensation discrimination and conducting compliance evaluations under Executive Order 11246. 38If a contractor's employees are unaware of how their compensation compares to that of employees with similar jobs because the risk of punitive action inhibits discussions about compensation, employees will not have the information they need to assert their rights. An unwarranted difference in rates of pay, or other forms of compensation, that is based on a protected status like sex or race will likely continue and potentially grow more severe over time. Simply allowing employees to discuss compensation may help bring illegal compensation practices to light and allow employees to obtain appropriate legal redress. Policies prohibiting employee conversations about compensation can also serve as a significant barrier to Federal enforcement of the laws against compensation discrimination. OFCCP primarily enforces prohibitions in Executive Order 11246 against pay and other forms of compensation discrimination by conducting compliance evaluations of Federal contractors. 39While OFCCP typically develops statistical analyses to establish systemic compensation discrimination, interviewing managers, human resources professionals, and employees potentially impacted by discriminatory compensation is also an invaluable way for the agency to determine whether compensation discrimination in violation of Executive Order 11246 has occurred and to support its statistical findings. Therefore, the accuracy of OFCCP's investigative findings depends in part on the willingness of a contractor's employees to speak openly with OFCCP investigators about a contractor's compensation practices. If a contractor has a policy or practice of punishing or discouraging employees from discussing their pay, the employees may be fearful and less forthcoming during interviews with OFCCP staff. Prohibiting discrimination against workers who discuss, inquire about, or disclose compensation will help dispel an atmosphere of secrecy around the topic of compensation and promote the agency's ability to uncover illegal compensation discrimination. The experience of Lilly Ledbetter demonstrates how pay secrecy enables illegal compensation discrimination. For Ledbetter, her employer's insistence on pay secrecy likely cost her the ability to seek justice for the compensation discrimination she suffered throughout her career. Ledbetter was employed at the Gadsden, Alabama plant of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. While there, she filed a charge with the EEOC alleging that she was paid a discriminatorily low salary as an area manager because of her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 40Ledbetter discovered how much her male co-workers were earning years after she began working at the plant and only after she found an anonymous note in her mailbox disclosing her pay and the pay of three males who were doing the same job. In an interview, she said that her employer told her, ''You do not discuss wages with anyone in this factory.'' 41The Supreme Court, in 2007, issued its ruling in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. holding that Ledbetter's claim was untimely.42 The Court held that Ledbetter was required to have filed her claim within 180 days of when Goodyear initially made its discriminatory pay decision, regardless of whether Ledbetter's paycheck continued to reflect the discriminatory pay policy and regardless of when she discovered that Goodyear was discriminating against her. Congress addressed the timing issues in the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, 43which states that each discriminatory paycheck is a separate violation and resets the 180-day limitations period. It remains necessary, however, to end pay secrecy policies so that workers can more easily discover if they are victims of discriminatory pay policies. Pay secrecy policies interfere with the Federal Government's interest in efficiency in procurement. Economy and efficiency in Federal procurement require that contractors compensate employees under merit-based practices, without any barriers to success. As set out in Executive Order 13665, the Federal contractors with pay secrecy practices are subject to enforcement actions and, as a result, may face a higher risk of disruption, delay and expense associated with contract performance. Allowing discussions of pay by employees of these contractors will contribute to minimizing these risks. This final rule eliminates some of the barriers created by pay secrecy policies and helps ensure that Federal contractors compensate employees based on merit. In addition to disruptions and delays, Federal contractors with pay secrecy policies may also experience a decrease in worker productivity. Workers, due to a lack of compensation information, may experience a reduction in performance motivation and are likely to perceive their employer as unfair or untrustworthy. Both reduce work productivity. 44For example, one study has shown that workers without access to compensation information are less satisfied and less productive. 45The precise reasons for this drop in productivity have not been investigated; however, a number of theories can be drawn from the empirical evidence gathered in this field. Two such theories on the loss of productivity are that employees are unable to link their performance or their worth to the organization, and that employer secrecy policies foster distrust of management. The first of these theories is based on the idea that because of pay secrecy VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54938 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 46Id. at 969. 47Lauren Weber and Rachel Emma Silverman, ''Workers Share Their Salary Secrets,'' Wall St. J.

To the extent that this rule uses terms or concepts borrowed from Title VII or other EEO statutes, however, their usage here is limited to claims brought pursuant to Executive Order 13665 and this final rule. OFCCP's interpretation of Executive Order 13665 does not in any way limit the enforcement of Title VII or other EEO statutes. policies, some workers do not know whether their own wages are reflective of job performance. This information gap makes it more difficult for workers to make informed choices about their own compensation and creates unnecessary barriers to enforcing laws against compensation discrimination. Information asymmetries provide an advantage and market power to the party with more information. When workers have access to more information about colleagues' compensation, salaries may be likely to be more closely linked to productivity on the job and compensation may be much less likely to be influenced by factors unrelated to job performance such as sex and race. As a result, workers with the ability to inquire about, discuss, and disclose compensation information may make informed decisions about their careers. These workers may become aware of their current value to the organization, but also of their potential value, based on information they receive about the salaries of longer tenured employees or employees in higher wage positions. This phenomenon has a unique consequence in labor markets where those involved in the transaction are people who, unlike machines, are likely to be affected by the information in terms of motivation and effort. In companies with pay secrecy policies, negative influences on productivity may stem from workers overestimating the lower limits of pay for others in similar positions leading to an inaccurate compression of the pay range, and causing a perception that increased work will not result in a corresponding reward. 46Workers with knowledge of compensation information are given accurate aspirational goals because they are aware of the salaries of the best- compensated employees, and can make rational decisions about the cost of increased effort at work in relation to the benefit of increased compensation resulting from success in the job. 47 The second theory is that worker distrust of corporate management may be another potential cause of the lag in productivity for workers subject to pay secrecy policies. Restrictions on sharing compensation information may create a sense that the company has something to hide with respect to compensating employees. Feelings of institutional unfairness may have a negative impact on workers' productivity. 48 Eliminating pay secrecy policies may have benefits beyond improving the productivity of Federal contractors and their employees. Generally, employers seek to provide opportunities for employees to advance within the corporate hierarchy because these employees will work harder to achieve goals and secure advancement. The result of this may be not only higher productivity and better quality, but also lower turnover, retention of organizational knowledge, and lower training and onboarding expenses. 49 Employers, including Federal contractors, may encounter more difficulty achieving these benefits if they have pay secrecy policies. Another benefit of eliminating these policies is that younger employees and jobseekers view employers without these policies more favorably. A report found that younger employees value openness in general and are more suspicious of companies instituting pay secrecy rules. 50 Under the final rule, contractors could also realize a reduction in the cost and burden associated with investigating baseless claims of compensation discrimination. Workers with knowledge of compensation relative to other employees can make more accurate determinations about the presence or absence of discriminatory practices. 51When workers' suspicions of discriminatory practices are discredited by information about other employees' compensation, the company avoids the costs and time associated with defending against discrimination lawsuits filed by employees. Transparency about compensation also allows companies and their employees to identify and resolve unwarranted disparities in compensation prior to the employee filing a formal complaint or pursuing litigation. This additional openness about compensation could decrease discrimination complaints and investigations, saving both the contractor and the government time and money. Moreover, the employees may receive a faster remedy through internal resolution than would be possible through a complaint process or subsequent litigation. The preceding paragraphs present several reasons why the final rule could yield productivity benefits or cost savings for covered Federal contractors. However, OFCCP notes that, in addition to these benefits, and in order to achieve its goal of ensuring employees receive fair wages, this final rule is expected to result in increased wage payments to employees. This may be the result of employees using the information that they receive about the compensation paid to others to pursue increased wage payments. Employers may either voluntarily increase wages or be required to do so through actions taken by employees. These higher wage payments may, in some instances, result in net costs to covered contractors. I. Statement of Legal Authority Issued in 1965, and amended several times in the intervening years, Executive Order 11246 has two purposes. First, it prohibits covered Federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating against employees and applicants because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. 52Second, it requires covered Federal contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action to ensure that they provide equal opportunity in all aspects of employment. The nondiscrimination and affirmative action obligations of Federal contractors and subcontractors cover all aspects of employment, including rates of pay and other compensation. The requirements in Executive Order 11246 generally apply to any business or organization that (1) holds a single Federal contract, subcontract, or federally assisted construction contract in excess of $10,000; (2) has Federal contracts or subcontracts that combined total in excess of $10,000 in any 12- month period; or (3) holds Government bills of lading, serves as a depository of Federal funds, or is an issuing and paying agency for U.S. savings bonds and notes in any amount. Pursuant to Executive Order 11246, receiving a Federal contract comes with a number of responsibilities.

A contractor in violation of the Executive Order 11246 may have its contracts canceled, terminated, or suspended or may be subject to debarment after the opportunity for a hearing. 53 II. Major Proposed Revisions in the Final Rule The final rule protects employees' inquiries, discussions, and disclosures of their own pay and benefits, and similar employee activities related to the pay and benefits of others, if they obtained that information through ordinary means such as conversations with co-workers. What the Order, and in turn this final rule, does not protect is the disclosure of others' pay information that an employee obtained as part of the employee's essential job functions. So, for example, if the employee making the disclosure to others had access to the information as a part of carrying out the essential job functions of the position of payroll administrator or benefits administrator, the contractor may be justified in taking adverse action based on that disclosure. This is because the employee, as payroll or benefits administrator, had access to the information as an essential part of the job and shared that information with others who do not otherwise have access to such information, which could undermine a contractor's ability to maintain necessary confidentiality concerning compensation. The nondiscrimination provision of the final rule may not protect this employee. The final rule specifically allows a contractor to take adverse action when an employee, with access to compensation information as part of an essential job function, discloses that information to others and the disclosure does not fall into one of the exemptions. The exemptions are disclosures made in response to a formal complaint or charge, in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing or action, including an investigation by the contractor, or disclosures consistent with the contractor's legal duty to furnish the information. Nothing in the final rule prohibits contractors from proactively promoting what they view as good about their pay policies and practices. As a best practice, contractors are encouraged to remove barriers to employees knowing that the contractor's pay and benefit practices are competitive with other companies within the same industry, and to promote their company's practices regarding advancement opportunities, merit increases in pay, and other factors that affect their employees' pay. The more a contractor's employees know about where they stand in terms of their pay within the company, the more the employees should feel that they have a stake in the company and its financial success. The final rule applies to all Federal contractors with contracts entered into or modified on or after the effective date of the rule that exceed $10,000 in value. The major provisions in the final rule: Revise the equal opportunity clause that is currently included in qualifying Federal Government contracts, federally assisted construction contracts, subcontracts, and purchase orders. The revised clause includes a provision prohibiting contractors from discharging, or in any manner discriminating against, any employee or applicant for employment because the employee or applicant inquired about, discussed, or disclosed the compensation of the employee or applicant or another employee or applicant. Define ''compensation'' in a manner consistent with the definition used by OFCCP in other existing guidance. Compensation is defined for these purposes as any payments made to, or on behalf of, an employee or offered to an applicant as remuneration for employment, including but not limited to salary, wages, overtime pay, shift differentials, bonuses, commissions, vacation and holiday pay, allowances, insurance and other benefits, stock options and awards, profit sharing, and retirement. Define ''compensation information'' as the amount and type of compensation provided to employees or offered to applicants, including but not limited to the desire of the contractor to attract and retain a particular employee for the value they are perceived to add to the contractor's profit or productivity; the availability of employees with like skills in the marketplace; market research about the worth of similar jobs in the relevant marketplace; job analysis, descriptions, and evaluations; salary and pay structures; salary surveys; labor union agreements; and contractor decisions, statements, and policies related to setting or altering employee compensation. Define ''essential job function'' to provide clarity about the positions covered by minimizing the degree of subjectivity involved in the determination. A job function may be considered essential if: (1) The access to compensation information is necessary in order to perform that function or other routinely assigned business task; or (2) the function or duties of the position include protecting and maintaining the privacy of employee personnel records, including compensation information. Establish a General defenses provision and an Essential job functions defense provision. Both provide contractor defenses to alleged violations of the nondiscrimination obligation for employees who inquired about, disclosed or discussed compensation. The nature of the defenses differs, however. The essential job functions defense, per the text of the Order, is a complete defense, such that if an employee discloses compensation information accessed or received through performance of an essential job function, unless the disclosure falls into one or more exemptions, the protections of the Order shall not apply and a contractor is allowed to take adverse action on those grounds. Contractors may also pursue a general defense if the discipline it imposes is for violation of a consistently and uniformly applied rule, policy, practice, agreement, or other instrument that does not prohibit, or tend to prohibit, employees or applicants from discussing or disclosing their compensation or the compensation of other employees or applicants. Given the difference in structure and function of this defense, this rule clarifies that it is not a complete defense, but rather is to be employed within the analytical framework discussed herein. Require contractors to disseminate a nondiscrimination provision, as prescribed by the Director of OFCCP and made available on the OFCCP Web site. Contractors must disseminate the provision to employees and applicants using their existing employee manuals or handbooks, and either electronically or by posting the prescribed provision in conspicuous places available to employees and job applicants. III. Cost and Benefits This is not economically significant under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, though it is a ''significant regulatory action.'' The total cost of the final rule is $42,726,188.

Notice to subcontractors is provided by amending the existing equal opportunity clause that contractors are currently required to include in their subcontracts and purchase orders. Contractors are not required to develop and deliver new staff or management training on the new nondiscrimination obligation in the final rule; however, providing such training is considered a best practice. The final rule also includes a defenses provision that allow contractors to pursue a defense to a claim of discrimination under certain circumstances. At an estimated cost of $85 per company, the final rule should result in benefits to workers who have historically experienced pay discrimination, and also transfers between groups of employees and from contractors, employers, or taxpayers to workers. The provisions in the final rule should help to ensure that fear of discrimination does not inhibit the employees of Federal contractors from sharing information with one another about their compensation. The final rule's provisions, as discussed earlier in the preamble, also promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement, potentially contribute to the economic security of working women and their families, and support enforcement of nondiscrimination and equal employment opportunity protections. Overview of the Final Rule Prior to issuing an NPRM, OFCCP conducted listening sessions with individuals from the contractor community, civil rights groups, and other interested parties to understand their perspectives on the scope and intent of Executive Order 13665 amending Executive Order 11246. After reviewing all of the comments on the NPRM, OFCCP's final rule incorporates many of the provisions in the NPRM. However, in order to clarify and focus the scope of one or more provisions in the final rule, while not increasing the estimated burden, the final rule revises some of the NPRM's provisions. OFCCP received 6,524 comments on the NPRM, of which 6,443 were the result of organized efforts using form letters generally in support of the NPRM. The remaining group of 81 unique or non-form letter comments represented diverse perspectives including one contractor, three law firms, four contractor associations, 13 civil rights organizations, four employee associations and unions, and 56 individuals. The commenters raised a range of issues, including concerns about the definitions of ''compensation,'' ''compensation information,'' and ''essential job functions.'' A few commenters urged OFCCP to make the definition of ''compensation'' consistent with existing OFCCP Directive 2013-03, Procedures for Reviewing Contractor Compensation Systems and Practices. The final rule adopts this definition. Another commenter was concerned that the proposed definition of ''compensation information'' would include information covered by the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis, the final rule modifies the definition of compensation information. It provides more specificity as to the type of information covered but the final rule does not adopt other suggested changes related to concerns about attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine. The information that OFCCP could request would not involve legal opinions or advice, but would include factual data that informed the contractor's compensation decisions. The information sought is not significantly different in nature from what OFCCP could request during a compliance evaluation or complaint investigation. A definition for ''essential job functions'' that was proposed in the NPRM was based on the approach used in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended, and OFCCP's regulations implementing Section 503. The ''essential job function'' analysis and evidence in these instances relate to issues of reasonable accommodation and qualification. However, in the context of Executive Order 13665, the purpose or goal of the ''essential job functions'' analysis is different. Most of the commenters stated that the definition proposed in the NPRM for ''essential job functions'' is too broad. They proposed narrowing it to employees whose jobs are to maintain and protect the privacy of employee personnel records, and minimizing the amount of subjectivity available to contractors when determining what constitutes essential job functions. Others commented that the proposed definition of essential job functions was too narrow. Some commenters believed that the definition of essential job functions is inconsistent with the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and that the proposals in the NPRM are unnecessary because the NLRA covers pay secrecy issues under the right to discuss ''terms and conditions of employment.'' The final rule rejects the ADA, as amended, definition of essential job functions as proposed in the NPRM. The final rule also rejects the comparison made by some commenters with the NLRA. Instead, the final rule identifies two types or categories of essential job functions to minimize subjectivity and provide specificity for the types of job functions that would be covered as essential. Some commenters sought to expand the defenses provisions in the NPRM to allow contactors to take action when employees or applicants access information without the contractor's authorization, or violate contractor policies or other limitations created pursuant to applicable laws protecting private or confidential information. The final rule does not expand the defenses to include these recommendations, nor does it limit the ability of contractors to take disciplinary actions for violations of security policies and applicable privacy laws. A significant number of commenters raised issues about the legal framework that would apply to analyzing an alleged violation. Commenters were concerned that the NPRM proposed prohibiting ''discrimination'' for conduct that is more appropriately considered ''retaliation.'' The commenters noted that the proposed prohibition is not based on the employees' or applicants' membership in one of the protected categories under VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54941 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 54Directive 2013-03, Procedures for Reviewing Contractor Compensation Systems and Practices, Feb. 28, 2013. Title VII. Similarly, several commenters wrote that it is unclear whether a violation would be analyzed under the ''motivating factor'' standard or ''but for'' standard under Title VII\u2014the ''but for'' standard being applicable to retaliation claims while ''motivating factor'' applies to discrimination claims. Other commenters viewed the NPRM's prohibition as a nondiscrimination provision and asserted that the motivating factor standard would be appropriate. One commenter requested that OFCCP expressly state that it could use all Title VII discrimination remedies once a violation is established, including declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees and costs. This final rule, as discussed in the section- by-section analysis, clarifies that adverse action taken by a contractor against an employee or applicant that violates the provisions of Executive Order 13665 and these regulations is appropriately viewed as discrimination and analyzed as such under that legal framework. Other commenters proposed that OFCCP require contractors to take additional measures to disseminate the equal opportunity clause such as requiring mandatory training to ensure that managers and employees understand the proposed protections. The commenters considered this training especially necessary where a contractor has longstanding pay secrecy policies or a culture of secrecy surrounding pay disclosures. One commenter would require training for departmental leadership responsible for handling compensation-related matters. Several commenters opposed mandatory training but encouraged it as a best practice, including one noting that training is no guarantee of effectiveness and that compliance is best achieved through clear guidance to contractors. Another commenter believed that training on the proposed new protections described in the NPRM could result in confusion, and encourage frivolous claims because employees are already aware that compensation discrimination is unlawful. The minority of the comments included one that proposed eliminating the equal opportunity clause altogether and focusing on collecting data. The final rule declines to require mandatory staff and management training. There were also comments associated with the cost and burden of the proposed rule, and the authority of OFCCP to undertake this rulemaking. Other comments on the NPRM addressed access to technical assistance and training, alternatives to the proposals in the NPRM, and the absence of a provision obligating the government to intervene and pay costs and attorneys' fees should a prime contractor terminate a subcontractor under a government mandate. OFCCP carefully considered all comments in the development of this final rule. Section-By-Section Analysis 41 CFR Part 60-1\u2014Obligations of Contractors and Subcontractors SUBPART A\u2014Preliminary Matters; Equal Opportunity Clause; Compliance Reports Section 60-1.3 Definitions The proposed rule provided definitions for three terms used in Executive Order 13665. The NPRM defined the term ''compensation'' to include payments made to an employee, or on behalf of an employee, or offered to an applicant as remuneration for employment, including but not limited to salary, wages, overtime pay, shift differentials, bonuses, commissions, vacation and holiday pay, allowances, insurance and other benefits, stock options and awards, profit sharing, and retirement. This definition of ''compensation'' aligns with the definition OFCCP uses in the context of compensation discrimination investigations. OFCCP received three comments regarding the definition of ''compensation.'' One commenter generally supported the proposed definition. Another commenter supported the definition, but suggested expanding it to include ''sick time'' and ''paid leave.'' The third commenter stated that the definition of ''compensation'' in the NPRM differed from the definition of that term in OFCCP's Directive 2013-03, and further suggested that both the final rule and the Directive contain the same definition. After consideration, OFCCP does not believe it would be appropriate to include ''sick time'' and ''paid leave'' expressly in the definition of compensation. The NPRM's definition of ''compensation'' includes a general list of compensation types, but was not meant to be exhaustive. As a matter of consistency OFCCP will use the definition as stated in the NPRM, which aligns with the definition used in the context of its compensation discrimination investigations. OFCCP also notes the comment regarding the differing definitions in Directive 2013- 03 and the NPRM, which advocates for making them consistent. However, OFCCP's guidance and regulations have historically included salary, wages, overtime pay, shift differentials, bonuses, commissions, vacation and holiday pay, allowances, insurance and other benefits, stock options, profit sharing and retirement. Though the definition of compensation in Directive 2013-03 and the final rule are not identical, Directive 2013-03 should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the final rule. The proposed definition in the NPRM for the term ''compensation information'' is consistent with the approach described in OFCCP's existing compensation guidance. 54The definition covers information related to any aspect of compensation, including but not limited to information about the amount and type of compensation as well as decisions, statements, or actions related to setting or altering employees' compensation. OFCCP intended the proposed definition of ''compensation information'' to be broad enough to encompass any information directly related to employee compensation, as well as the process or steps that led to a decision to award a particular type or amount of compensation. OFCCP received one comment on the definition of ''compensation information.'' The commenter was critical of the proposed definition, stating that it was ''vaguely defined and may be deemed broad enough to encompass information related to compensation that is subject to the attorney-client privilege.'' OFCCP does not believe that the definition of ''compensation information'' would interfere with the operation of the attorney-client privilege. The attorney- client privilege only protects disclosure of communication; it does not protect the disclosure of the factual bases underlying the communication between a client and his or her attorney. Therefore, the privilege generally would not cover ''compensation information'' data. However, in reviewing the proposed definition, the final rule slightly modifies the definition so that it would mean the amount and type of compensation provided to employees or offered to applicants, including, but not limited to, factual information about the desire of the contractor to attract and retain a particular employee for the value they are perceived to add to the contractor's profit or productivity; the availability of employees with like skills in the marketplace; market research about the worth of similar jobs in the relevant marketplace; job analysis, descriptions, and evaluations; salary and pay structures; salary surveys; labor union agreements; contractor VerDate RULES54942 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations decisions, statements and policies related to setting or altering employee compensation. This modification in the final rule, by way of including several examples, provides contractors with additional guidance. Lastly, the NPRM also proposed a definition for the term ''essential job functions.'' OFCCP had proposed to use the ADA, as amended, definition of essential job functions. Under that definition, a job function may be considered essential for any of several reasons, including: (1) The function may be essential because the reason the position exists is to perform that function; (2) the function may be essential because of the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed; and/or (3) the function may be highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function. OFCCP received a number of comments, some indicating that the ADA, as amended, definition was too narrow, and others indicating that it was too broad or needed further specificity. In response to these comments, the final rule modifies the proposal in the NPRM by eliminating the use of the ADA, as amended, definition of essential job functions in favor of identifying two categories or types of essential job functions. In the final rule, a job function may be considered an essential job function if: (1) The access to compensation information is necessary in order to perform that function or another routinely assigned business task; or (2) the function or duties of the position include protecting and maintaining the privacy of employee personnel records, including compensation information. Generally, those commenters who favored broadening the definition of ''essential job functions,'' and therefore the exception to the rule's protections, suggested that OFCCP adopt a definition that relies more on whether employees required access to confidential compensation information in the performance of their job duties, rather than on whether the employee's position description related to handling compensation information. One commenter noted that the complexity of large enterprises made it unrealistic that such employers could effectively operate through only selected employees whose ''fundamental'' job duties involved access to pay information or whose job exists only to perform those functions or who have specialized expertise or ability somehow related to pay information. Another commenter suggested that the test for what constitutes an essential job function should rely on whether access to compensation information was granted as necessary to the performance of a legitimate, assigned business task. Another commenter suggested that the definition of ''essential job functions'' should include all employees who have authorized access to an employer's compensation information, whether or not that access falls within the employee's primary job responsibilities. OFCCP agrees with many of these comments and has determined that a definition of ''essential job functions'' that is driven by the employee's position description, rather than the assigned tasks, could create confusion among employers in determining which employees are covered by the definition. Instead, the revised definition makes clear that employees performing job functions or routinely assigned tasks that require them to have access to confidential compensation information will be covered. Additionally, job functions that require protecting or maintaining the privacy of employee personnel records will be covered by the revised definition. Some commenters identified specific occupations that they thought should be covered by the definition, such as IT employees and program staffers who prepare bids for government contracts that regularly require access to compensation information, even if the position was not created for the purpose of handling compensation data. The determination of whether any particular employee received compensation information in the course of their ''essential job functions'' will be determined on a case-by-case basis by OFCCP. OFCCP agrees, however, that a position where the functions of that position require access to compensation information, or protecting and maintaining the privacy of employee personnel records, should generally fall within the definition of ''essential job functions.'' Some commenters, on the other hand, were concerned that the exception could be construed too broadly, such that groups of employees with access to compensation information, such as human resource employees, could be denied protection under the regulations. Many of these commenters suggested that the employer's ability to assert ''essential job functions'' as an affirmative defense must be limited to only a very narrow subset of employees whose job is to maintain and protect the privacy of employee personnel records. One commenter also suggested that the definition should focus on whether employees used compensation information as part of their essential job functions, rather than whether they have access to such information. The revised definition includes ''protecting and maintaining the privacy of employee personnel records'' as one category of ''essential job functions.'' However, it also includes functions and routinely assigned business tasks for which accessing compensation information is necessary to their performance. This definition provides adequate protection to employers in preserving the confidentiality of compensation and personnel data but limits the scope of the exception to those positions that require access to the information to perform their job functions and tasks. Furthermore, as discussed below, the application of the ''essential job functions'' defense is narrowed by the fact that even employees in positions covered by the definition are protected if they discuss compensation information that they obtained from a source outside of their essential job functions, or if they discuss information relating to their own possible claim of compensation discrimination, or if they discuss compensation information of others accessed within their essential job functions so long as the discussion takes place internally with a management official of the contractor or while using the contractor's internal complaint process. Some of the commenters favoring a narrow interpretation also wanted the definition of ''essential job functions'' to rely less on subjective factors. They suggested that an employer's judgment should not be given conclusive weight on the question of what constitutes an essential job function. The revised definition replaces the more subjective factors under the ADA, as amended, definition with two categories that more clearly identify which classes of job functions should be deemed essential for purposes of these regulations. As noted in paragraph 3 of the regulatory definition, this definition of ''essential job functions'' is limited to the discrimination claims governed by Executive Order 13665 and its implementing regulations, and does not apply to claims brought pursuant to other EEO laws. Section 60-1.4 Equal Opportunity Clause As proposed in the NPRM, the final rule revises the equal opportunity clause in \u00a7 60-1.4(a) and \u00a7 60-1.4(b) to include the new nondiscrimination provision. Section 60-1.4 requires contracting agencies to include this VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 RULES54943 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 55Cappelli, Peter, and Kevin Chauvin, ''An Interplant Test of the Efficiency Wage Hypothesis,'' Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106, 769-787, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2937926(1991); Reich, Michael, Dube, Arindrajit, and Naidu, Suresh, ''Economics of Citywide Minimum Wages,'' Institute for Industrial Relations, University of California, Berkeley Policy Brief (2005); Cowherd, D.M. and Levine, D.I., ''Product Quality and Pay Equity Between Lower-level Employees and Top Management: An Investigation of Distributive Justice Theory,'' Administrative ''Exposing Pay Secrecy,'' 32 Acad. of Management Rev. 55, 58 (2007). 57Government Contractors, Requirement To Report Summary Data on Employee Compensation, 79 FR 46562 (Aug. 8, 2014). This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) would amend the regulation by adding a requirement that certain Federal contractors and subcontractors supplement their Employer Information Report (EEO-1 Report) with summary information on compensation paid to employees, as contained in the Form W-2 Wage and Tax Statement (W-2) forms, by sex, race, ethnicity, and specified job categories, as well as other relevant data points such as hours worked, and the number of employees. 58Section 7 of the NLRA examines the right of employees to ''self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities'' for the purpose of collective bargaining or other ''mutual aid or protection.'' Section 8 of the NLRA describes unfair employer and labor organization practices that interfere with the rights granted employees in section 7. See 29 U.S.C. 157-158 (1935). OFCCP recognizes that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) interprets Section 7 to protect employees and applicants from discrimination based on discussion or disclosure of their own compensation or the compensation of other employees or applicants. Paraxel International LLC, 356 NLRB No. 82, slip op. at 3 (2011). equal opportunity clause in government contracts and modifications to government contracts if the clause was not included in the original contract. By accepting Federal contracts, contractors accept the discrimination and affirmative action requirements contained in the equal opportunity clause and agree to include the requirements contained in the clause in their subcontracts and purchase orders unless exempted by law, regulations, or order of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor. The final rule revises \u00a7 60-1.4(a) by inserting a new paragraph 3 into the equal opportunity clause and by renumbering the subsequent paragraphs in the clause. The text of the new paragraph in \u00a7 60-1.4(a) is identical to the text in section 2(b) of Executive Order 13665. Under the terms of this new provision, it is unlawful for contractors to discharge or discriminate in any other manner against any employee or job applicant because such employee or applicant has inquired about, discussed, or disclosed the compensation of the employee or applicant or another employee or applicant. This provision does not apply when an employee with access to the compensation information of other employees or job applicants as a part of such employee's essential job functions discloses the compensation of such other employees or applicants to individuals who do not otherwise have access to such information, unless such disclosure is in response to a formal complaint or charge, in support of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the employer, or is consistent with the contractor's legal duty to furnish information. Under the equal opportunity clause in \u00a7 60-1.4(b), administering agencies involved in federally assisted construction through grants, loans, insurance, or guarantee must include text in their contracts for construction work informing the funding applicant that the equal opportunity clause must be incorporated into the contracts and contract modifications if they are funded in whole or in part by Federal money. This section further provides the exact language for the equal opportunity clause. As with \u00a7 60-1.4(a), by accepting funding the contractor agrees to assume the nondiscrimination and affirmative action obligations of Executive Order 11246, including incorporating the equal opportunity clause into their subcontracts and purchase orders unless exempted by law, regulations, or order of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor. The final rule revises \u00a7 60-1.4(b) by inserting a new paragraph 3 into the equal opportunity clause, and renumbering the subsequent paragraphs in the clause. The text of the new paragraph is identical to the text in section 2(b) of Executive Order 13665. OFCCP made changes to \u00a7 60-1.4 with the intent to eliminate the secrecy and fear surrounding a discussion or disclosure of compensation information. When employees lack access to compensation information it is more difficult for them to make informed choices about their own compensation, and it creates unnecessary barriers to filing complaints with civil rights agencies such as OFCCP. Secrecy may also have a detrimental impact on business productivity, employee morale and retention, and could drive increased cost related to human resources management as discussed earlier in the preamble to the final rule. 55Studies have shown that these pay secrecy policies are common among contractors and foster negative consequences for some employees and applicants for employment. 56The final rule does not require employees to share information about compensation with other employees. OFCCP received three comments on the proposed revisions to \u00a7 60-1.4. One commenter suggested that OFCCP eliminate the proposed equal opportunity clause provisions and focus instead on establishing ''thorough but undemanding reporting requirements'' to detect compensation discrimination. With respect to that comment, OFCCP proposed an NPRM on August 8, 2014, entitled ''Government Contractors, Requirement To Report Summary Data on Employee Compensation.'' 57OFCCP will address any changes to compensation reporting requirements through this separate rulemaking. Further, eliminating the proposed equal opportunity clause provisions would be contrary to the express requirements of Executive Order 13665. OFCCP, therefore, adopts the revised equal opportunity clause provisions into the final rule. Another commenter suggested that the final rule modify the equal opportunity clause by adding language from Sections 7 and 8 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). 58Although the language may not be identical to the NLRA, the revised equal opportunity clause language includes language detailing employees' right to engage in wage discussions and employers' nondiscrimination obligations related to this right. Consequently, OFCCP believes that inclusion of the suggested NLRA language is unnecessary. Furthermore, the language inserted into the equal opportunity clause mirrors language contained in the Order giving OFCCP the authority and responsibility to ensure Federal contractors do not discriminate against any employee or job applicant because such employee or applicant has inquired about, discussed, or disclosed the compensation of the employee or applicant or another employee or applicant. The other comment regarding revisions to \u00a7 60-1.4 asserted that it is not necessary for OFCCP to alter the heading for \u00a7 60-1.4(d) from ''Incorporation of the equal opportunity clause by reference'' to ''Inclusion of the equal opportunity clause by reference;'' or to alter the first sentence of \u00a7 60- 1.4(d) by deleting ''incorporated by reference'' and inserting ''included by reference.'' OFCCP does not agree that this change is unnecessary and will change the current regulatory language of the heading and first sentence of \u00a7 60-1.4(d). Making the change to ''inclusion'' is consistent with the VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 RULES54944 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 59133 S.Ct. 978 (2013). 60Id. 61Id. 62See No. 2002 WL 31932547, at *4 (Admin.

See Lawson v. FMR, LLC, 134 S.

SUBPART B\u2014General Enforcement; Compliance Review and Complaint Procedure Section 60-1.35 Contractor Obligations and Defenses to Violation of the Nondiscrimination Requirement for Compensation Disclosures As proposed in the NPRM, \u00a7 60-1.35 becomes a new section to part 60-1 in this final rule, to implement the requirements of section 2(b), as well as the contractor defenses set forth in the Executive Order. Analytical Framework In the NPRM, OFCCP stated that it viewed Executive Order 13665 ''as establishing a new prohibition against discrimination against any employee or applicant'' and announced its intent to use the burdens and standards of proof applicable to Title VII discrimination claims\u2014including the use of a motivating factor framework for analyzing causation. OFCCP provided three broad reasons for adopting this approach in the NPRM: (1) the equal opportunity clause paragraph set out in section 2(b) of Executive Order 13665 is framed in terms of discrimination; (2) the prohibitions set forth in Executive Order 13665 diverged from the traditional Title VII retaliation framework, to which the different ''but- for'' standard of review applies; and (3) the application of the motivating factor framework would maintain consistency with the review of similar claims under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which also utilizes the motivating factor approach. OFCCP received seven comments on the proposed analytical framework. Five of these comments, largely from organizations representing employers, opposed the proposal, and urged instead that OFCCP adopt a ''but-for'' causation standard, citing the recent Univ. of Texas Southwestern Med. Ctr. v. Nassar Supreme Court case. 59Two commenters, both civil rights advocacy organizations, strongly supported the proposed motivating factor framework and urged its inclusion in the Final Rule. As discussed below, OFCCP adopts the framework as proposed in the NPRM with some further clarification. A discussion of the various issues raised in the comments follows. The most frequent comments on the proposed analytical framework concerned the applicability of the Nassar decision to Executive Order 13665. In Nassar, the Court analyzed the retaliation statute under Title VII, codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e-3, which prohibits adverse employment action against an employee for opposing a practice made unlawful by Title VII, or for filing a charge, testifying, or otherwise participating in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII. 60The Court held that but-for causation, rather than a motivating factor review, applied to retaliation claims under Title VII. 61 The comments from the organizations representing employers all stated that the holding in Nassar dictated the analytical framework that must be utilized under Executive Order 13665, as the protections under the Order are akin to Title VII retaliation claims as opposed to Title VII discrimination claims for which the motivating factor analysis is reserved. Some of these commenters also pointed to the text of the Order\u2014such as the lack of specific ''motivating factor'' language\u2014to buttress their conclusions. Comments from civil rights advocacy groups disagreed. These commenters stated that pay secrecy policies are inextricably intertwined with compensation discrimination. They further asserted that because the adverse action in the pay secrecy context often occurs before an employee engages in activity that would be protected under Title VII, the protections in the Order are fundamentally different in kind from anti-retaliation protections under Title VII. Historically, OFCCP has followed Title VII principles in cases brought under Executive Order 11246. 62While that approach continues, we agree with the commenters echoing our position in the NPRM that the protection afforded by Executive Order 13665 ''diverges from the traditional Title VII retaliation framework'' at issue in Nassar. Title VII retaliation claims require, as an initial matter, that the plaintiff oppose an unlawful employment practice, file a charge of discrimination, or participate in an ''investigation, proceeding, or hearing'' related to Title VII claims. 42 U.S.C. 2000e-3. Executive Order 13665 is different, as it protects any compensation inquiries, discussions, or disclosures and requires neither opposition to an alleged violation of the underlying law nor participation in an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or litigation asserting rights protected by the underlying law. 63A benign question from co-worker to co-worker about the annual bonus she received or an employee's inadvertent disclosure of a difference in pay between herself and a colleague are conceivable predicates for a claim under the Order. This difference in scope underpinned OFCCP's position in the NPRM that the Order is ''framed in terms of discrimination'' and that its protections are uniquely directed toward ''protecting workers from pay discrimination itself,'' thus supporting a discrimination analysis. While two of the commenters took issue with this latter statement, asserting that Title VII's retaliation statute serves the same purpose, we believe there is an important difference\u2014the Order's protections are geared not only to safeguard the integrity of existing pay discrimination laws, but to also allow workers to discover discrimination that would otherwise be hidden. This purpose is explicitly referenced multiple times in the text of Executive Order 13665. 64This also dovetails with OFCCP's existing regulations, as the Order's protection of open communication regarding compensation is interrelated with contractors' existing and ongoing affirmative action obligations to evaluate and report on their compensation systems for the existence of potentially discriminatory disparities. See 41 CFR 60-2.17(b)(3). While OFCCP recognizes the lack of specific ''motivating factor'' language in the Order and the other textual arguments raised by commenters, 65the policy language embedded in the Order, the differences between the Order's protections and current case law VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 RULES54945 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 66Parexel International LLC, 356 NLRB No. 82, slip op. at 3 (2011). 67See, e.g., Makky v. Chertoff, 541 F.3d 205, 213- 451 360 F.3d 1103, 1122 (9th Cir. 2004). interpretations of the Title VII retaliation provision, and related affirmative action and nondiscrimination obligations under the existing regulations provide important text and context for determining the appropriate analytical framework to employ. Accordingly, OFCCP does not believe that Nassar dictates that a ''but- for'' analytical framework must be used to analyze pay secrecy claims under Executive Order 13665. The NPRM also included the motivating factor framework in part because of the overlap in legal protections offered by the Order and the National Labor Relations Act, which also uses a motivating factor analysis. Two commenters took issue with this rationale. One stated simply that the NLRA was ''not applicable'' to claims under the Order, while another asserted that there are differences in the scope and remedial schemes of the NLRA and the Order that necessitated differing analytical frameworks. Regarding the first of these commenters, OFCCP respectfully disagrees that the NLRA is simply ''not applicable'' to the discussion of how claims under Executive Order 13665 should be analyzed. As we stated in the NPRM, there is a close relationship in the type of activity each law protects. Section 7 of the NLRA guarantees the right to engage in ''concerted activities for the purpose of . . . mutual aid or protection,'' 29 U.S.C. 157, and the National Labor Relations Board has long held that this includes the right ''to ascertain what wages are paid by their employer, as wages are . . . probably the most critical element in employment.'' 66This makes the NLRA the federal law that most closely mirrors the types of pay secrecy policies that the Order addresses. Given that millions of workers, employed by thousands of employers, will be affected by pay secrecy policies under both the NLRA and the Order, reference to the NLRA in an attempt to provide, to the extent possible, a uniform framework of analysis and reduce confusion over the appropriate legal standard is appropriate. The second commenter raised two broad issues. First, it stated that the analytical framework under the NLRA was different from that proposed under the Executive Order 13665, in that under the NLRA an employer can escape all liability if it can establish that it would have taken the adverse action against the employee in any event. As stated in the NPRM, the reasoning behind the proposed motivating factor framework was ''consistency with Title VII and NLRA principles.'' 79 FR 55720 (emphasis added). The initial motivating factor analysis under both laws is essentially the same: the complainant must demonstrate that discrimination was a motivating factor in the employer's action, and then the employer has a defense provided that it demonstrates that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of protected conduct. Were OFCCP to abandon a motivating factor framework, the analyses under the Order and the NLRA would then be out of alignment despite the existence of substantially identical claims under each. The NLRA and Title VII then diverge in the remedial structure following a successful articulation of the defense: under the NLRA, the employer can escape all liability, whereas under Title VII, the court may still grant injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as attorneys' fees. While the final rule follows Title VII rather than NLRA principles in this regard, the enforcement mechanisms in the Order significantly lessen the distinction with the NLRA in two ways. First, the Order does not permit OFCCP to recover attorneys' fees and costs, thus, as with the NLRA, monetary remedies are not available if an employer establishes a defense in a case proceeding under the motivating factor framework. Second, the inclusion of a specific, complete ''essential job functions'' defense in the Order, discussed elsewhere in the preamble, provides a mechanism for contractors to avoid liability in certain circumstances consistent with the NLRA. The commenter also noted that the interpretation of the Order in the NPRM covers more people and more types of activity than does the NLRA and that this will lead to an ''exponential increase'' in claims, and that applying a motivating factor analysis will further result in an increase in the number of frivolous claims, thus raising costs for the contractor community. As to any potential increase in claims, it is true that one specific purpose of the Order is to expand protections against pay secrecy policies to individuals and types of activities beyond that protected by the NLRA; otherwise, there would be no need for the Order. As discussed at length in the NPRM and in the preamble here, pay discrimination, as well as the existence of pay secrecy policies, remains widespread despite the protections in the NLRA. To the extent there is an increase in meritorious claims, this would indicate the Order's success at addressing these widespread problems. As to the assertion that there would be an untenable increase in the number of frivolous claims solely because of the availability of a motivating factor framework, we respectfully disagree. Significantly, there is no private right of action under Executive Orders 11246 or 13665; OFCCP is responsible for investigating complaints filed and bringing enforcement actions, which it has discretion to do only if there is a violation and it has attempted to resolve such violations through informal means. See 41 CFR 60-1.24. Simply put, OFCCP will not pursue frivolous claims, which substantially addresses the concerns raised by the commenter. For the foregoing reasons, OFCCP concludes that the motivating factor framework is a permissible approach for claims brought under the Executive Order 13665. However, the fact that it is a permissible approach should not be interpreted to say that it is the only approach OFCCP may use to prove discrimination. For instance, numerous circuit courts examining Title VII discrimination claims since the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which codified the motivating factor framework, have held that, despite the availability of the motivating factor analysis, plaintiffs may also proceed under the more traditional burden shifting framework first set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). 67 Under this approach, often referred to as the ''determinative factor'' approach, the plaintiff must first make a prima facie showing of discrimination, which includes evidence that he or she is a member of a protected class and was subjected to an adverse action. The employer then has the opportunity to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action it has taken, which the plaintiff must then demonstrate was a pretext for discrimination in order to succeed. Which approach OFCCP uses will be heavily influenced by the facts of the case as they are developed in its investigation and in discovery. In true ''mixed motive'' cases\u2014where, for instance, the employer can show that it fired an employee in part for taking excessive breaks, but where there is also evidence that the employer fired the employee in part for discussing compensation\u2014the motivating factor approach would be appropriate. Conversely, where the evidence appears VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54946 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 68Price Waterhouse v.

OFCCP may also opt to prove its case via both frameworks, arguing, for instance, that discrimination was the determinative factor in an employer's adverse action but, in the alternative, that it was at least a motivating factor. The Supreme Court and multiple circuit courts have recognized this approach as consistent with the way in which many Title VII cases are litigated. 68In sum, while the motivating factor analytical framework is permissible under this Final Rule, OFCCP may use other approaches, based on the evidence available in a particular case, to demonstrate that unlawful discrimination occurred. Consistency and Compatibility With NLRA A number of comments concerned the compatibility or consistency of the Order with the NLRA beyond those comments addressed in the analytical framework section above. Some commenters noted that the NLRA already provides some protection for disclosure of compensation information and, therefore, believe this rule is unnecessary. As an initial matter, the Order plainly requires OFCCP to draft implementing regulations. See E.O. 13665, sec. 3. Further, as discussed at length in the NPRM and above in this final rule, pay secrecy policies continue to be prevalent despite the existence of the NLRA, preventing workers from discovering and remedying potential discrimination. Finally, also discussed above, the scope of the Order is broader, covering a broader range of workers, including supervisors, and a broader scope of protected activity than that covered under the NLRA. One commenter took issue with this last point, stating that the Department has not presented sufficient data to justify coverage of supervisors. Another commenter noted, conversely, that coverage of supervisors is important specifically because they are not covered by the NLRA. We decline the recommendation to limit coverage of the Order solely to employees who are not supervisors. Neither the Order nor any of the comments provide a basis for doing so. The plain text of the Order extends protections to ''any employee or applicant for employment,'' providing no language in any way limiting the scope of workers who should be covered by the rule. 69Significantly, as discussed in the proposed rule, one of the catalysts for the signing of the Order is the case of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. 70That case concerned a supervisor who discovered that her wages were less than that of male supervisors and who was warned by company management not to disclose or otherwise discuss this information. Ms. Ledbetter's experience, by no means unique, exemplifies the fact that pay secrecy policies and pay discrimination negatively affect workers on all rungs of the company ladder, and demonstrates the necessity for the broad protections in this rule. We also note that the NLRA concerns the rights of employees to organize and bargain and, therefore, excludes supervisors from its protections for reasons unrelated to this rule. This rule concerns a different policy purpose, that is, the promotion of pay transparency to ensure equitable pay for all of a contractor's employees. Therefore, it is appropriate that this rule covers a wider class of employees. One commenter raised an issue about having the opportunity to comment on coordination it believes is necessary between the Department and the NLRB in terms of having a consistent standard and a consistent class of covered employees for pay transparency cases. Because sufficient notice about the standard to be applied as well as the covered class was provided during this comment period, there was sufficient opportunity for input on these issues. The Department enforces statutes with overlapping jurisdiction with other agencies and coordinates when necessary. There is no justification for not covering all employees who are covered generally by the protections provided under Executive Order 11246. Contractor Defenses As was proposed in the NPRM, and as was established in Executive Order 13665, the final rule contains contractor defenses to alleged violations. First, the contractor may pursue a defense if its adverse action against an employee or applicant is not based on a rule, policy, practice, agreement or other instrument that prohibits employees and applicants from disclosing compensation. Second, the protections of the Order do not apply, and thus a contractor is allowed to take adverse action against an employee or applicant, if the employee discloses compensation information accessed or received based on performing an essential job function unless the disclosure falls into one or more exemptions. The structure and function of these defenses are notably different from each other in the text of Executive Order 13665 and, accordingly, are so under these regulations. The ''essential job functions'' defense is set forth in the same paragraph as the prohibition on discrimination, and states that the prohibition ''shall not apply'' in instances in which employees disclose compensation data that they have access to as part of their essential job functions. 71This prohibition, and the defense, are incorporated into the text of Executive Order 11246, as amended. 72 The second type of defense is phrased quite differently. It is not listed alongside the complete ''essential job functions'' defense in the text of the Order, nor is it incorporated into the amended Executive Order 11246; rather, it is listed separately in a ''General Provisions'' section. 73Further, it is described as a defense that the Order does not prohibit a contractor from pursuing, rather than one that completely excises the application of the Executive Order. 74We believe these differences are intentional and important, and frame how the defenses are to be employed in actions brought under the Order. A discussion of the function of these defenses, and a response to the comments we received, follows. Section 60-1.35(a) General Defenses The NPRM proposed to include a general contractor defense to an alleged violation of paragraph (3) of the equal opportunity clauses listed in \u00a7 60-1.4(a) and (b) under which a contractor's actions would not be deemed to be discrimination if the contractor could show that it disciplined the employee for violation of a consistently and uniformly applied rule, policy, practice, agreement, or other instrument that does not prohibit, or tend to prohibit, VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54947 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations employees or applicants from discussing or disclosing their compensation or the compensation of other employees or applicants. OFCCP invited comments on how to harmonize contractors' enforcement of legitimate workplace rules with the rights of applicants and employees to discuss, disclose, or inquire about compensation. OFCCP received several comments on this proposed defense. Some commenters were concerned that the defense was so broad that it could be used as pretext for discrimination and that it allowed for excessive employer subjectivity. These commenters explained that the example cited in the NPRM, where a contractor disciplines an employee for standing on her desk and repeatedly shouting out her pay in violation of a workplace rule prohibiting disruptive behavior, illustrated that contractors could apply such workplace rules in a subjective and discriminatory manner because contractors could define ''disruptive'' to include all conversations about compensation. These commenters suggested that OFCCP should provide specific definitions and examples of legitimate workplace rules. One commenter also suggested that OFCCP should identify sources that employers could draw from when citing a legitimate workplace rule, such as employee handbooks or collective bargaining agreements. One other commenter suggested that OFCCP delete ''and uniformly'' from the phrase ''by proving that the contractor disciplined the employee for violation of a consistently and uniformly applied rule . . .'' because ''uniformly'' was superfluous and because contractors should not be required to apply a rule ''uniformly'' in situations when circumstances warrant a different approach. OFCCP believes that the defense, as proposed in the NPRM, adequately prevents contractors from using a legitimate workplace rule as a way to avoid liability in the event that it discriminated against an employee or applicant for discussing compensation. The defense requires the contractor to show that it applied a legitimate workplace rule to the employee or applicant in a consistent and uniform manner. If the contractor cannot demonstrate a track record of consistent and uniform application of the workplace rule, then the contractor will not be able to successfully use this defense. Although a contractor need not discipline all employees in an identical way under the workplace rule, it must show that it did not discipline the employee or applicant in question more severely under the rule because of the employee's or applicant's protected activity. In response to the concern that contractors could use workplace rules, such as those that prohibit disruptive employee behavior, to target discussions of compensation, OFCCP notes that contractors may only rely on workplace rules that do not prohibit, or tend to prohibit, employees or applicants from discussing or disclosing their compensation or the compensation of other employees or applicants. A rule that treated all discussions of pay as ''disruptive'' would violate these regulations. OFCCP declines to articulate specific workplace rules that contractors may assert pursuant to this defense. There are many legitimate workplace rules that contractors may be entitled to enforce; OFCCP cannot predict the content or the source of any particular rule that a contractor may rely upon in asserting this defense. Regardless of the type of workplace rule relied upon, however, every contractor must show that the identified workplace rule does not prohibit, or tend to prohibit, employees or applicants from discussing their compensation and that any such rule has been consistently and uniformly applied. For example, if a contractor disciplined an employee or applicant, who was also discussing pay, pursuant to an allegedly legitimate workplace rule, but, for example, had never promulgated or enforced that rule before, the contractor may not be able to show that the workplace rule qualified as a legitimate workplace rule under this defense. Finally, OFCCP will retain the word ''uniformly'' in the final rule. OFCCP recognizes that different circumstances may warrant different forms of discipline under the same workplace rule; the fact that an employee or applicant was also discussing compensation, however, should not justify applying the workplace rule in a non-uniform manner. For example, it may be a consistent application for a contractor to suspend all employees who exceed their allotted break time by an hour, even if the contractor only provides a verbal warning to employees who exceed their allotted break time one time by five minutes. For the contractor to act in a uniform manner, it should apply the same corrective action\u2014here, a verbal warning\u2014to employees who exceed their allotted break time once by five minutes, including any employees who may have been discussing compensation. As mentioned above, an employee's or applicant's protected activity should not affect the severity of the discipline they receive pursuant to a workplace rule. Requiring that contractors uniformly apply workplace rules to similarly situated employees, regardless of their protected activity, prevents contractors from using the rule as a way to avoid liability for discrimination. Therefore, OFCCP believes that the use of the word ''uniformly'' is not superfluous and will remain in the final rule. Two commenters proposed adding more specific defenses to the regulation. One commenter suggested that OFCCP add a defense for contractors who limit discussion or disclosure of compensation information pursuant to laws enacted to protect private and/or confidential information. Another commenter recommended that the rule include a specific defense against hacking, such that if an employee obtained salary information through unauthorized access, then the employer should be able to discipline the employee for doing so. As previously mentioned, the final rule does not expand the defenses to include these recommendations; however, it does not limit the ability of contractors to take disciplinary actions for violations of security policies and applicable privacy laws. Furthermore, as noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, the general defense provision is intended to permit employers to have personnel policies that are uniformly applied to maintain discipline in the workplace and to protect their business. We note generally that a policy that would have the effect of broadly prohibiting employee communication about compensation would be unlawful under this rule. However, a company policy that is narrowly tailored to prohibit disclosure of specific proprietary business information or trade secrets, or that is otherwise designed to be consistent with federal or state privacy laws, if violated, could fall within the general defenses already set forth in the rule. Similarly, if a contractor consistently and uniformly applies a rule prohibiting employees from accessing information without authorization, then this too could potentially fall within the general defense provision. Whether a company policy concerning confidentiality or unauthorized access would be deemed unlawful would be a highly fact-specific inquiry. However, because the general defense set forth could potentially be invoked for these purposes, OFCCP declines to adopt the recommendations to include these specific defenses. Accordingly, OFCCP declines to make the suggested changes and adopts the defense requirements outlined in the VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54948 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 75As discussed supra, if the facts of the case dictate that proceeding under the McDonnell Douglas determinative factor model is appropriate in a given case, the contractor could use its workplace rule as its asserted legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, which OFCCP would then have the opportunity to demonstrate was a pretext for discrimination. 76As was mentioned in the NPRM, in 2013 at least 71.9 percent of human resources professionals in three occupational categories were women. For further discussion, please refer to the NPRM at 79 FR 55721 (September 17, 2014). NPRM into the final rule. OFCCP is, however, rewording the defense to make clear that relying on a workplace rule will not serve as a complete defense, but rather is subject to the analytical framework as discussed above. Consistent with Title VII principles, and the language of Executive Order 13665, a contractor cannot escape all liability within the ''motivating factor'' framework if the agency can show that discrimination motivated the contractor, even in part, to discipline an employee or applicant. The focus of the Executive Order is on ''[e]nsuring that employees of Federal contractors may discuss their compensation without fear of adverse action'' so that contractors and their employees can ''detect and remediate unlawful discriminatory practices.'' E.O. 13665, sec. 1. This policy will not be truly effectuated until all forms of discriminatory actions, even if they are combined with some lawful motivations, are rooted out of the workplace. To the extent that a desire to perpetuate unlawful pay secrecy policies motivated a contractor's actions, OFCCP will seek to enjoin such practices in the future. A contractor may, however, limit the scope of an adverse remedial order if it can show that it would have taken the same action against the employee or applicant in the absence of any discriminatory motive. 75 Section 60-1.35(b) Essential Job Functions As proposed in the NPRM, \u00a7 1.35(b) contains a second contractor defense to a claim of discrimination under these regulations. Pursuant to this defense, a contractor will not violate these regulations if it takes adverse action against an employee, who has access to the compensation information of other employees or applicants as part of his or her essential job functions, for disclosing the compensation of other employees or applicants, unless the disclosure occurs in certain limited circumstances. These limited circumstances include disclosures in response to a formal complaint or charge, in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing or action, including an investigation conducted by the contractors, or consistent with the contractor's legal duty to provide information. A formal complaint or charge would include, for example, written and oral complaints submitted by the employee, or someone on behalf of the employee, to the contractor's human resources or other appropriate office or official, and to a Federal, state or local government entity, including courts and administrative boards and councils. Under \u00a7 1.35(b), the employee would typically be making the disclosure within, related to, or pursuant to some sort of official action, process, policy, or procedure if the conduct is to be protected from adverse action by the contractor. As discussed above, OFCCP has revised the definition of ''essential job functions'' to identify two specific categories of job functions: (1) the access to compensation information is necessary in order to perform that function or other routinely assigned business task; or (2) the function or duties of the position include protecting and maintaining the privacy of employee personnel records, including compensation information. Many of the comments that OFCCP received on this topic related to the definition of ''essential job functions'' and have been previously addressed. To reiterate, some commenters felt that the definition of essential job functions, and therefore the accompanying defense, should be broadened, while others felt it should be narrowed. As stated in the NPRM, this defense acknowledges that an employee who has access to compensation information of others within an organization as part of his or her essential job functions has a duty to protect such information from disclosure. The revised definition of ''essential job functions'' reflects these concerns, while also limiting an employer's subjectivity in deciding what functions constitute essential job functions. As was stated in the NPRM, however, if an employee discloses or discusses the compensation of other applicants or employees based on information that the employee receives through means other than essential job functions access, the defense would not apply. Similarly, the defense would not apply where such an employee pursues her own possible compensation discrimination claim or raises possible disparities involving the compensation of other employees to a management official with the contractor or while using the contractor's internal complaint process. This balance protects employers' confidential information, but does not inhibit those workers with access to such information from pursuing their own claims of compensation discrimination or raising possible disparities to the contractor's own management to consider and address if necessary to comply with the law. Without this distinction, employees with essential job functions access, who primarily work in human resources departments and who are predominantly women, 76would receive less protection than other employees who learn of possible compensation disparities in a similar manner. As with any defense, OFCCP will evaluate the availability of a defense under section 1.35(b) based on the specific facts and circumstances of each case. As discussed above, this defense may serve as a complete bar to liability under these regulations. The ''motivating factor'' framework will not limit the application of the essential job functions defense because releasing compensation information obtained during the course of an employee's essential job functions is not protected by Executive Order 13665 or this final rule. The policy underlying Executive Order 13665 recognizes that contractors are entitled to prohibit some of their employees from releasing sensitive and confidential information relating to compensation; accordingly, such prohibitions will not give rise to impermissible ''motivating factors'' under these regulations, and therefore will not implicate the remedial structure under the ''motivating factor'' framework. Section 60-1.35(c) Dissemination of nondiscrimination provision The NPRM proposed to require that Federal contractors incorporate the nondiscrimination provision described in section 2(b) of Executive Order 13665 into existing employee manuals or handbooks, and disseminate the nondiscrimination provision to employees and job applicants. The NPRM proposed that the Director of OFCCP would prescribe the language in the nondiscrimination provision, and that OFCCP would make the language available on the OFCCP Web site. The NPRM stated that contractors would disseminate the provision either electronically or by posting a copy of the provision in conspicuous places available to employees and job applicants. The NPRM did not require or recommend in-person or face-to-face communication of the provision, however, the proposed rule stated that contractors might use this method if they typically communicate information VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54949 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations to all employees or applicants in this manner. OFCCP received six comments on this proposed requirement. One commenter encouraged OFCCP to create a new ''pay transparency'' poster and add a requirement for contractors to post it in the workplace. Two commenters recommended that OFCCP revise the current ''EEO is the Law'' poster to include language describing the prohibition against discrimination based on compensation inquiries, discussions, or disclosures, instead of requiring publication of the prescribed nondiscrimination provision in employee manuals and handbooks. Another commenter challenged the use of prescribed language by the OFCCP's Director. The commenter stated that contractors would be best suited to develop language that articulates both employee and employer rights and obligations. OFCCP believes that contractors can accomplish the goal of providing notice of the nondiscrimination provision to applicants and employees through existing structures, such as handbooks and manuals. Moreover, OFCCP is mindful of the additional burden that a new posting requirement would impose on contractors, as explained in the below Regulatory Procedures section of this preamble. OFCCP also considered the suggestion that individual contractors develop the language they would use to describe the nondiscrimination provision in their employee handbooks and manuals. However, OFCCP believes that uniformity of such language is necessary to ensure consistency and clarity in the information provided to applicants and employees. Of course, nothing in this rule limits contractors' ability to provide additional information to their employees about employer and employee rights and obligations. Further, OFCCP seeks to lessen the costs and burden associated with dissemination of the nondiscrimination provision by prescribing the language to describe it. Accordingly, OFCCP declines to make the suggested changes and adopts the dissemination requirements proposed in the NPRM into the final rule. OFCCP agrees with the suggested inclusion of language describing the prohibition against discrimination based on compensation inquiries, discussions, or disclosures on the ''EEO is the Law'' poster that contractors are currently required to post. OFCCP will take necessary steps toward producing a poster with this new language. However, posting the ''EEO is the Law'' poster will not eliminate the obligation to publish the prescribed nondiscrimination provisions in employee manuals and handbooks. In the proposed rule, OFCCP sought comments on the feasibility of a proposition that would require contractors with existing manager trainings or meetings to include in them a review of the prohibition on discrimination based on an employee or applicant inquiring about, discussing, or disclosing compensation information. The training requirement, as proposed, would have applied only to contractors that provide manager trainings or meetings; OFCCP would have encouraged other contractors to adopt such training as a best practice for minimizing the likelihood of workplace discrimination. OFCCP received five comments in support and three comments in opposition of this proposed requirement. Generally, commenters supporting the training proposal asserted that requiring manager training should be required for all contractors. Such a requirement would ensure effective implementation of the new provision, particularly for those contractors with longstanding polices that prohibit wage discussions. Some of these commenters asserted further that contractors with existing training could incorporate required new training into already existing training sessions, as proposed. One commenter suggested extending the training requirement to require contractors to provide employees with individual notice at staff meetings, performance reviews, and other channels. However, commenters in opposition to the training requirement generally asserted that the proposed training provision would not guarantee effectiveness, would create confusion, would involve significant expense, and would be unnecessary given that contractors are likely already subject to similar Federal and state provisions. One commenter specifically asserted that requiring training for some contractors while only encouraging it for other contractors would create confusion amongst the regulated community with regard to what is required for compliance. Another commenter stated that contractors would achieve increased compliance with the new nondiscrimination provision through clearer guidance from OFCCP as opposed to mandated contractor training. Yet another commenter opposed the requirement because the expense for contractors to update existing training programs would be significant. Such an update would require several levels of internal company review, in addition to costs to re-deploy training modules. Rather than impose a training requirement on some contractors, some of the comments in opposition suggested that OFCCP only encourage providing this training as a best practice for all contractors. After consideration of the foregoing comments, the final rule does not require any contractors to modify their existing trainings or meetings to include a review of the prohibition on discriminating based on an employee or applicant inquiring about, discussing, or disclosing compensation information. In making this determination, OFCCP considered the added burden to contractors resulting from them modifying their training materials, as well as the potential for contractors to become confused about which of them would be covered by the training requirement. Although this final rule does not require training, OFCCP encourages all contractors to incorporate personnel training on this new nondiscrimination provision as a best practice. Alternatives or Additions to Proposed Regulations In the NPRM, OFCCP requested comments from small contractors on possible alternatives that would minimize the impact of the proposed rule while still accomplishing its goals. Specifically, OFCCP invited interested persons to submit comments on NPRM estimates, including the number of small entities affected by the Order's prohibition on Federal contractors discriminating against employees and job applicants, the compliance cost estimates, and whether alternatives exist that would reduce burden on small entities while still remaining consistent with the objectives of Executive Order 13665. OFCCP received two comments proposing alternative approaches. The commenters suggested that the final rule require Federal contractors to create and maintain publicly available employee pay scales, similar to the pay scales maintained for Federal employees. The commenters' proposal is beyond the scope of Executive Order 13665 and, even if within its scope, such an alternative would be more burdensome than what was proposed in the NPRM. OFCCP further finds that the proposed requirement to disseminate the nondiscrimination provision is the least burdensome means of fostering discussion among employees about pay and allowing for openness among employees to discuss compensation practices.

Vulnerability resulting from the damaging effects of lifelong pay inequity is evident in the 20 percent poverty rate shared by senior citizen women who are widowed or divorced or have never married. Regulatory Procedures Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and Executive Order 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review) OFCCP is issuing this final rule in conformity with Executive Orders 13563 and 12866, which directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 recognizes that some benefits are difficult to quantify and provides that, where appropriate and permitted by law, agencies may consider and discuss qualitatively values that are difficult or impossible to quantify, including equity, human dignity, fairness, and distributive impacts. Under Executive Order 12866, OFCCP must determine whether a regulatory action is significant and therefore subject to the requirements of the Executive Order and to review by OMB. 77Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a ''significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule that: (1) has an annual effect of $100 million or more, or adversely affects in a material way a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as economically significant); (2) creates serious inconsistency or otherwise interferes with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alters the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raises novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. 78 This rule has been designated a ''significant regulatory action'' although not economically significant under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. The rule is not economically significant because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. Accordingly, the rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The Need for the Regulation On April 8, 2014, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13665, Non-Retaliation for Disclosure of Compensation Information. 79 FR 20749 (April 11, 2014). This Executive Order prohibits Federal contractors from discharging or discriminating in any other way against employees or applicants who inquire about, discuss, or disclose their own compensation or the compensation of another employee or applicant. Executive Order 13665 necessitates the regulatory changes in this rule to ensure that employees of Federal contractors and subcontractors are able to discuss their compensation without fear of adverse action. Federal contractors also need the regulatory changes to enhance their ability to detect and remediate unlawful discriminatory practices. OFCCP designed the rule to contribute to a more efficient market in Federal contracting, and to ensure that the most qualified and productive workers receive fair wages. The existence of pay secrecy practices means some workers can be fired for even disclosing their compensation or asking their co-workers how much they earn. Even employers who do not specifically restrict employee communications about compensation take great care to guard individual compensation information. This final rule benefits OFCCP's enforcement by incorporating into the equal opportunity clauses the prohibition against pay secrecy policies, specifically that an employer cannot discriminate against an employee or applicant who has inquired about, discussed, or disclosed compensation information. 79By including the provision in the equal opportunity clauses OFCCP clearly defines such actions as discriminatory and enhances its ability to take action when it finds pay secrecy policies or practices during compliance evaluations and investigations. Currently, OFCCP lacks sufficient, reliable data to assess the gender- or race-based pay gap experienced by employees of Federal contractors or subcontractors, including how much of the potential pay gap is attributable to pay discrimination instead of nondiscriminatory factors, and how many contractors are violating the pay discrimination laws OFCCP enforces. Pay secrecy ranks among one of the most prevalent employer policies and practices that makes discrimination more difficult to discover and remediate. 80OFCCP's work led to the determination that there is a substantial need for regulatory action. U.S. Census data show that more than 15.2 million family households in the United States are headed by women. 81 Nearly 31 percent of these families, or nearly 4,700,000 family households, have incomes that fall below the poverty level. 82These and other data provide general information about the potential impact of eliminating pay differentials among men and women, including pay differentials not attributed to discrimination, on the poverty rate of women and their families. 83The data on earnings and the pay gap includes all VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54951 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 84Ariane Hegewisch et al., ''Separate and Not Equal?

There is at least one reason to believe the SAM data yield an underestimate of the number of entities affected by this rule and other reasons to believe the data yield an overestimate. SAM does not necessarily include all subcontractors, thus potentially leading to an underestimate, but this limitation of the data is offset somewhat because of the overlap among contractors and subcontractors; a firm may be a subcontractor on some activities but have a contract on others and thus be included in the SAM data. The SAM data may produce an overestimate of the entities affected by this rule because the data set includes: inactive contractors, contracts below this proposed rule's $10,000 threshold, and recipients of Federal grants and Federal financial assistance. employers and all employees in the U.S., whereas this rule would apply to only a subset of such employers and employees. Therefore, the potential impact of this rule would be much smaller than the impact of eliminating pay differentials among all working men and women. Discrimination, occupational segregation, and other factors contribute to creating and maintaining a gap in earnings and keeping a significant percentage of women in poverty. It is worth noting, however, that some research has established that women earn less than men regardless of the field or occupation. 84According to some studies, differences in occupations result in occupational segregation which contributes to the wage gap 85and the effect is more pronounced in jobs requiring higher levels of education. 86 The gender pay gap may also affect the economy as a whole as it exists for both women and men of color when compared to white, non-Hispanic men. At the beginning of 2015, median weekly earnings for African-American men working at full-time jobs totaled $680 per week, only 76 percent of the median for white men ($897). 87 According to BLS data, the median weekly earnings for African-American women equaled $611 per week, only 68 percent of the median for white men. Discussion of Impacts In this section, OFCCP presents a summary of the costs associated with the requirements in the final rule at \u00a7\u00a7 60-1.3, 60-1.4 and 60-1.35. The estimated labor cost to contractors is based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data in the publication ''Employer Costs for Employee Compensation'' issued in December 2013, which lists total compensation for management, professional, and related occupations as $51.58 per hour and for administrative support as $24.23 per hour. Unless specified otherwise, OFCCP estimates that 25 percent of the time burden for complying with this rule will be spent by persons in management, professional and related occupations and 75 percent will be spent by persons in administrative support occupations. There are approximately 500,000 contractor companies or firms registered in the General Service Administration's System for Award Management (SAM). Therefore, OFCCP estimates that 500,000 contractor companies or firms may be affected by the final rule. 88This may be an overestimate because SAM captures firms that do not meet OFCCP's jurisdictional dollar threshold. OFCCP's jurisdiction covers active contracts with a value in excess of $10,000. Cost of Regulatory Familiarization OFCCP acknowledges that 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(1)(i) requires agencies to include in the burden analysis for new information collection requirements the estimated time it takes for contractors to review and understand the instructions for compliance. In order to minimize the burden, OFCCP will publish compliance assistance materials including, but not limited to, fact sheets and ''Frequently Asked Questions.'' OFCCP will also host webinars for the contractor community that will describe the new requirements and conduct listening sessions to identify any specific challenges contractors believe they face, or may face, when complying with the requirements. OFCCP believes that Federal contractors' human resources or personnel managers will be responsible for understanding or becoming familiar with the new requirements. OFCCP estimates that it will take one hour for a management professional at each contractor company to either read the compliance assistance materials provided by OFCCP or participate in an OFCCP webinar to learn more about the new requirements. One commenter asserted that one hour was an underestimation of the time needed for familiarization. The commenter asserted that multiple individuals at each contractor company would be required to become familiar with the requirements. OFCCP acknowledges that the precise amount of time each company will take to engage in certain activities will be difficult to estimate. However, the estimate used does take into account the fact that many contractors are smaller and may not have the same staff or human resources capabilities. Therefore, OFCCP retains its original estimate that it will take 60 minutes for regulatory familiarization. The estimated cost of this burden is assumed to be entirely at the Management, Professional, and Related Occupations level. Consequently, the estimated time burden for rule familiarization is 500,000 hours (500,000 contractor companies \u00d7 1 hour = 500,000 hours). The estimated cost is $25,790,000 (500,000 hours \u00d7 $51.58/ hour = $25,790,000). Cost of New Provisions The final rule prohibits discrimination based on employees and applicants inquiring about, discussing, or disclosing their compensation or the compensation of others unless the employee has access to compensation information of other employees or applicants as a part of such employee's essential job functions. The prohibition against discrimination would apply to all Federal contractors and subcontractors and federally assisted construction contractors and subcontractors with contracts or subcontracts in excess of $10,000. The new requirements are located at \u00a7\u00a7 60- 1.3, 60-1.4 and 60-1.35. The final rule amends \u00a7 60-1.3 to include definitions for compensation, compensation information, and essential job functions as it relates to employees who have access to compensation information. Some commenters indicated that OFCCP should be required to assess additional burden because of the compensation VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54952 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 89Federal Contract Compliance Manual Chapter 2, Section 2L03 and Chapter 3, section 3H03 (Oct. 2014). definition. The commenter asserted that the definition would require contractors to change their analysis of employment processes. Another commenter suggested that OFCCP assess the burden for additional data requests that are made during compliance evaluations. OFCCP declines to adopt either of these two positions. The final rule does not change the requirement to conduct an in-depth analysis of employment practices. Contractors are required by existing regulations to analyze their personnel activity data annually, including compensation, to determine whether and where impediments to equal employment opportunity exist. The final rule establishes a definition of compensation, but does not change the existing regulatory requirement at 41 CFR 60-2.17(b)(3). OFCCP's guidance and regulations have historically included salary, wages, overtime pay, shift differentials, bonuses, commissions, vacation and holiday pay, allowances, insurance and other benefits, stock options, profit sharing and retirement. 89Thus, OFCCP found no need to change the assessed burden for this requirement. The provision of a definition for compensation does not increase the costs of compliance with this rule. In response to the comment related to requests made during compliance evaluations, the addition of a definition of compensation does not change the manner by which OFCCP conducts its compliance evaluations, nor does it require the compliance officers to collect more data. The Federal Contract Compliance Manual and OFCCP's Directive 2013-03 instruct compliance officers to analyze all aspects of pay. Thus, the requests for additional data are not a new cost or burden to contractors. In \u00a7 60-1.4(a)(3), the final rule mandates that each contracting agency incorporate the prohibition into the equal opportunity clause of Federal contracts and contract modifications, if the provision was not included in the original contract. More specifically, existing \u00a7 60-1.4(a)(3) provisions on notices sent to each labor union or representative of workers would be placed in \u00a7 60-1.4(a)(4); existing \u00a7 60- 1.4(a)(4) would be placed in \u00a7 60- 1.4(a)(5); existing \u00a7 would be placed in 60-1.4(a)(6); \u00a7 60-1.4(a)(6) would be placed in \u00a7 60- 1.4(a)(7); and existing \u00a7 60-1.4(a)(7) would be placed in new \u00a7 60-1.4(a)(8). The equal opportunity clause may be incorporated by reference into Federal contracts and subcontracts. In \u00a7 60-1.4(b)(3), the final rule mandates that each administering agency incorporate the prohibition into the equal opportunity clause of a grant, contract, loan, insurance, or guarantee involving federally assisted construction that is not exempted from the equal opportunity clause. More specifically, existing \u00a7 60-1.4(b)(3) provisions on notices sent to each labor union or representative of workers would be placed in \u00a7 60-1.4(b)(4); existing \u00a7 60- 1.4(b)(4) would be placed in \u00a7 60- 1.4(b)(5); existing \u00a7 would be placed in 60-1.4(b)(6); \u00a7 60-1.4(b)(6) would be placed in \u00a7 60- 1.4(b)(7); and existing \u00a7 60-1.4(b)(7) would be placed in new \u00a7 60-1.4(b)(8). The equal opportunity clause may be incorporated by reference into federally assisted contracts and subcontracts. To comply with this requirement, contractors may incorporate the equal opportunity clause into their nonexempt subcontracts either in its entirety or by including it by reference. While some contractors may need to locate the revised equal opportunity clause and incorporate it into existing contract templates, other contractors that include the clause by reference will make no change to existing subcontract language. One commenter asserted that it would take at least ten hours to comply with the new requirement. The commenter asserted that it would involve attorneys, procurement, logistics, and vendor services. However, the commenter did not provide any specificity that would explain or support this estimate. OFCCP disagrees with this assessment as the activity simply involves finding the new clause, provided by either OFCCP or the procurement officer, and incorporating that new wording into a contract template. OFCCP's estimate takes into account the fact that many contractors are smaller and may not have staffing or departments devoted to procurement, logistics, or vendor services. Therefore, OFCCP retains its original estimate that contractors will spend approximately 15 minutes modifying existing contract templates to ensure the additional language is included. The estimated time burden for this provision is 125,000 hours (500,000 contractors \u00d7 0.25 hours = 125,000 hours). The estimated cost of this provision is $3,883,438 ((125,000 hours \u00d7 0.25 \u00d7 $51.58) + (125,000 \u00d7 $3,883,438). The final rule adds \u00a7 60-1.35(a) and (b) discussing contractor defenses to an allegation of violation of \u00a7 60-1.4(a)(3) and (b)(3). The text of paragraph (a) incorporates the text in section 5(a) of Executive Order 13665. The text of paragraph (b) is drawn from the text in section 2(b) of the same Executive Order. There is no burden associated with the inclusion of these new paragraphs. Section 60-1.35(c) of the final rule requires contractors to disseminate the nondiscrimination provision by incorporating it into existing employee manuals or handbooks, and disseminating it to employees and to job applicants. This dissemination can be executed electronically or by posting a copy of the provision in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment. In person or face-to-face communication of the provision is not required or recommended, however, contractors may use this method if they typically communicate information to all employees or applicants in this manner. In order to reduce the burden to contractors associated with disseminating the provision, the final rule requires contractors to adopt the nondiscrimination language provided by OFCCP into contractors' existing employee manuals or handbooks and otherwise make it available to employees and applicants. One commenter indicated that disseminating the policy to employees and applicants would take considerably more time as it would not only be necessary to incorporate the provision into handbooks and post the policy, but it would also require additional personnel to communicate and approve the changes to handbooks and postings. The provisions of this rule apply to all Federal contractors and subcontractors, thus when estimating the cost, it is necessary to factor in that many Federal contractors are small and do not have the same staff or human resources capabilities. Thus, OFCCP retains its original calculation, as it is more reflective of the range of Federal contractors and their respective practices. A second commenter indicated that contractors should be allowed to develop their own statements for incorporation into handbooks. OFCCP disagrees with both of these commenters. By providing the required language, OFCCP significantly reduces the burden of this requirement. The statement as written in the regulations must be included verbatim into existing handbooks. Allowing contractors to develop their own statements would be more burdensome for contractors, requiring additional resources for the development and review of the statement. Moreover, using a uniform statement eliminates confusion about VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54953 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 90This is based on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission representation that 98 percent of the employers submitting the EEO-1 report file their submissions electronically through a Web based online filing system. See Supporting Statement for Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Employer Information Report (EEO-1), p. 1, OMB Control 3046-0007 Employer Information Report (EEO-1), available at http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_ nbr=201412-3046-001 (last accessed May 5, 2015). 91OFCCP assumes that administrative support will identify the appropriate clause, and insert it into the handbook (75 percent) with management oversight (25 percent). 92OFCCP assumes that administrative support will copy and paste the clause into a notice and either post or send it electronically (75 percent) with management oversight (25 percent). the appropriateness of the statement, and minimizes possible confusion by employees and applicants about the nature and purpose of the statement. Thus, OFCCP has selected the least burdensome alternative. Section 60-1.35(c)(i) requires contractors to include the nondiscrimination provision in existing employee manuals or handbooks. OFCCP assumes that most contractors (98 percent) maintain these documents electronically. 90For those contractors that maintain the documents electronically, we are not requiring contractors to physically reproduce their manuals to include the provision if they do not maintain hardcopies of manuals and handbooks. However, for those contractors that do not maintain their handbooks electronically, OFCCP believes those contractors (2 percent) will prepare and print a single errata sheet to update their hardcopy manual. OFCCP estimates it will take 20 minutes for contractors to locate, review, and reproduce the provision as provided by OFCCP and 15 minutes to incorporate it into existing employee manuals or handbooks; the total time required is 35 minutes (or 0.58 hours) to comply with this provision. Therefore, OFCCP estimates the time burden of this provision is 290,000 hours (500,000 contractor companies \u00d7 0.58 hours = 290,000 hours). The estimated cost of this provision is $9,009,575 ((290,000 hours \u00d7 \u00d7 $24.23)). 91OFCCP believes that this estimation may overstate the burden as it assumes that all 500,000 contractors have a handbook including contractors with fewer than 10 employees. The smaller contractors, those with 10 or fewer employers, represent 58 percent of the contractors in the SAM database and are the less likely to have formal employee handbooks. Section 60-1.35(c)(ii) requires contractors to disseminate the nondiscrimination provision to employees and to job applicants. This dissemination can be executed by electronic posting or by posting a copy of the provision in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment. OFCCP believes that 99 percent of contractors will post the information electronically while 1 percent will post the provision on employee bulletin boards. OFCCP's estimate is that it will take 15 minutes (or 0.25 hours) for contractors posting the provision electronically to prepare and post the provision. Additionally, OFCCP estimates it will take 75 minutes (or 1.25 hours) for contractors posting the provision manually to prepare the provision and post it in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment. Therefore, OFCCP estimates that the time burden of this provision is 130,000 hours ((500,000 contractor companies \u00d7 99% \u00d7 0.25 hours) + (500,000 contractor companies \u00d7 1% \u00d7 1.25 hours) = 130,000 hours). The estimated cost of this provision is $4,038,775 ((123,750 hours \u00d7 \u00d7 0.75 \u00d7 $24.23)). 92 Contractors are required to maintain documentation of other notices; the regulations implementing Executive Order 11246, VEVRAA and Section 503 currently require recordkeeping related to personnel and employment activity. See 41 CFR 60-1.12; 60-4.3(a)(7); 60- 300.80; 60-741.80. Consequently, there is no new time burden or cost for retaining copies of the notices to employees. OFCCP estimates that the combined time burden for becoming familiar with and complying with the final rule is 1,045,000 hours (500,000 hours + 125,000 hours + 290,000 hours + 130,000 hours = 1,045,000 hours). Operations and Maintenance Costs In addition to the time burden calculated above, OFCCP estimates that contractors will incur operations and maintenance costs, mostly in the form of materials. Section 60-1.35(c)(i) OFCCP estimates that 1 percent of contractors (5,000 contractor companies) will incorporate the nondiscrimination provision into their existing hardcopy handbook or manual. OFCCP estimates that these 5,000 contractor companies will incorporate into an existing handbook or manual a single one-page errata sheet that includes the nondiscrimination provision. OFCCP estimates the one- time operations and maintenance cost of this provision is $400 (500,000 contractors \u00d7 1% $400). Section 60-1.35(c)(ii) OFCCP estimates that 1 percent of contractors will inform employees by posting the provision on existing employee bulletin boards. OFCCP assumes that on average these contractors will post the policy on 10 bulletin boards. Therefore OFCCP estimates the operations and maintenance cost of this provision is $4,000 (500,000 contractor companies \u00d7 1% \u00d7 10 pages \u00d7 $0.08 = $4,000). The estimated total first year cost of the final rule is $42,726,188 or $85 per contractor company. Below, in Table 1, is a summary of the burden hours and costs; Table 2 shows the total cost summary for the first year and recurring years.

This rule, to the extent that it is effective, has equity and fairness benefits, which are explicitly recognized in Executive Order 13563. Enabling the employees and applicants of Federal contractors to discuss their compensation without fear of adverse action can contribute to reducing pay discrimination and ensuring that qualified and productive employees receive fair compensation. OFCCP designed the final rule to achieve these benefits by: Supporting more effective enforcement of the prohibition against compensation discrimination. Providing better remedies to workers victimized by compensation discrimination. Increasing employees' and applicants' understanding of the value of their skills in the labor market. Enhancing the ability of Federal contractors and their employees to detect and remediate unlawful discriminatory practices. Social Benefits of Improved Nondiscrimination Enforcement Social science research suggests antidiscrimination law can have broad social benefits, not only to those workers who are explicitly able to mobilize their rights and obtain redress, but also to the workforce and the economy as a whole. In general, discrimination is incompatible with an efficient labor market. Discrimination interferes with the ability of workers to find jobs that match their skills and abilities and to obtain wages consistent with a well-functioning marketplace. 93 Discrimination may reflect market failure, where collusion or other anti- discriminatory practices allow majority group members to shift the costs of discrimination to minority group members. 94 For this reason, effective nondiscrimination enforcement can promote economic efficiency and growth. For example, a number of scholars have documented the benefits of the civil rights movement and the adoption of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on the economic prospects of workers and the larger economy. 95 One recent study estimated that improved workforce participation by women and minorities, including through adoption of civil rights laws and changing social norms, accounts for 15-20 percent of aggregate wage growth between 1960 and 2008. 96On a smaller scale, the benefits of this rule have the potential to make an economic impact by providing employees of Federal contractors with a tool that allows them to identify potential compensation discrimination that undermines their financial security. Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 13272 (Consideration of Small Entities) The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as amended requires agencies to prepare regulatory flexibility analyses and make them available for public comment, when proposing regulations that will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. See 5 U.S.C. 603. If the rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities the RFA allows an agency to certify such, in lieu of preparing an analysis. See 5 U.S.C. 605. As explained in the initial Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 13272 section of the proposed rule, OFCCP did not expect the proposed rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 79 FR 55712 (September 17, 2014).

In the NPRM, OFCCP specifically requested comments on the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, including the number of small entities affected by the Executive Order's prohibition on Federal contractors from discriminating against employees and job applicants, the compliance cost estimates, and whether alternatives exist that will reduce burden on small entities while still remaining consistent with the objective of Executive Order 13665. See 79 FR 55726 (September 17, 2014). While OFCCP received eleven comments that addressed the costs and burdens of the proposed rule, none commented on the initial regulatory flexibility analysis. Thus, as explained below, OFCCP is adopting the proposed rule's economic analysis for purposes of the final rule. In the NPRM, OFCCP estimated the impact on small entities that are covered contractors of complying with the requirements contained in this final rule, OFCCP certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In making this certification, OFCCP determined that all small entities subject to Executive Order 11246 would be required to comply with all of the provisions of the final rule and that the compliance cost would be approximately $85 per contractor. Such compliance requirements are more fully described above in other portions of this preamble. The following section analyzes the cost of complying with Executive Order 13665. In estimating the annual economic impact of this rule on the economy, OFCCP determined the compliance cost of the rule and whether the costs would be significant for a substantial number of small contractor firms (i.e. small business firms that enter into contracts with the Federal Government). If the estimated compliance costs for affected small contractor firms are less than 3 percent of small contractor firms' revenues, OFCCP considered it appropriate to conclude that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on the small contractor firms covered by Executive Order 13665. OFCCP has chosen 3 percent as the significance criteria; however, using this benchmark as an indicator of significant impact may overstate the significance of such an impact, since the costs associated with prohibiting discrimination against employees and job applicants who inquire about or discuss their own compensation or the compensation of other employees or applicants are expected to be mitigated to some degree by the benefits of the rule. The benefits, which may include improved employee productivity and decreased employee turnover, are discussed more fully in the preamble of this final rule. The data sources used in the analysis of small business impact are the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Table of Small Business Size Standards, 97the Current Population Survey (CPS), and the U.S. Census Bureau's Statistics of U.S. Businesses (SUSB). 98Since Federal contractors are not limited to specific industries, OFCCP assessed the impact of the proposed rule across the 19 industrial classifications. 99Because data limitations do not allow OFCCP to determine which of the small firms within these industries are Federal contractors, OFCCP assumes that these small firms are not significantly different from the small Federal contractors that will be directly affected by the rule. OFCCP used the following steps to estimate the cost of the proposed rule per small contractor firm as measured by a percentage of the total annual receipts. First, OFCCP used Census SUSB data that disaggregates industry information by firm size in order to perform a robust analysis of the impact on small contractor firms. OFCCP applied the SBA small business size standards to the SUSB data to determine the number of small firms in the affected industries. Then OFCCP used receipts data from the SUSB to calculate the cost per firm as a percent of total receipts by dividing the estimated annual cost per firm by the average annual receipts per firm. This methodology was applied to each of the industries and the results by industry are presented in Tables 3-21 below. In sum, the increased cost of compliance resulting from the proposed rule is de minimis relative to revenue at small contractor firms no matter their size. All of the industries had an annual cost per firm as a percent of receipts of 3 percent or less. For instance, the manufacturing industry cost is estimated to range from 0.00 percent for firms that have average annual receipts of approximately $985 million to 0.02 percent for firms that have average annual receipts of under $500,000. Management of companies and enterprises is the industry with the highest relative costs, with a range of 0.00 percent for firms that have average annual receipts of approximately $2 million to 0.36 percent for firms that have average annual receipts of under $24,000. Therefore, OFCCP determined that in no instance was the effect of the proposed rule greater than 3 percent of total receipts. OFCCP then determined the number of small contractor firms actually affected by the proposed rule. This information is not readily available. The best source for the number of small contractor firms that are affected by this proposed rule is GSA's System for Award Management (SAM). OFCCP used SAM data to estimate the number of affected small contractor firms since SAM data allow us to directly estimate the number of small contractor firms. Federal contractor status cannot be discerned from the SBA firm size data. It can only be used to estimate the number of small firms, not the number of small contractor firms. OFCCP used the SBA data to estimate the impact of the proposed regulation on a ''typical'' or ''average'' small firm in each of the 19 industries. OFCCP then assumed that a typical small firm is similar to a small contractor firm. Thus, based on its analysis, OFCCP believes that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small businesses. Based on the most current SAM data available, if OFCCP defines small as fewer than 500 employees, then there are 328,552 small contractor firms. If OFCCP defines small as firms with less than $35.5 million in revenues, then there are 315,902 small contractor firms. Thus, OFCCP established the range from 315,902 to 328,552 as the total number of small contractor firms. Of course, not all of these contractor firms will be impacted by the proposed rule; only those contractor firms that have policies VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54956 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations that prohibit employees and job applicants from inquiring about, discussing or disclosing their own compensation or the compensation of other employees or job applicants. Thus, this range is an overestimate of the number of firms affected by the proposed rule because some of those small contractor firms do not have such a policy or practice. As the proposed regulation applies to contractors covered by Executive Order 11246, OFCCP estimates that the range of small firms impacted ranges from 315,902 to 328,552 or all covered Federal contractor companies. OFCCP has closely reviewed the economic analysis it utilized in the proposed rule and carefully considered all the comments received. Based on its review and consideration, OFCCP has concluded that the method used to conduct the economic analysis in the proposed rule reasonably estimated the annual effect of the rule, based on the data sources available to OFCCP. OFCCP is accordingly adopting the proposed rule's economic analysis for purposes of the final rule.

Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and its attendant regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, requires that OFCCP consider the impact of paperwork and other information collection burdens imposed on the public. Under the PRA an agency may not collect or sponsor the collection of information, nor may impose an information collection requirement unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. See 5 CFR 1320.8(b)(3)(vi). The OMB has assigned control number 1250-0008 to the third party disclosure of the equal opportunity clause provisions to subcontractors. The OMB has assigned control numbers 1250-0001 and 1250- 0003 to the general recordkeeping provisions of the laws administered by OFCCP. In accordance with the PRA, OFCCP solicited public comments on the proposed changes to the information collection proposed in the NPRM, as discussed below. See 79 FR 55712 (September 17, 2014). OFCCP also submitted a contemporaneous request for OMB review of the proposed information collection in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d). On December 5, 2014, the OMB issued a notice that instructed the agency to resubmit the information collection request upon promulgation of the final rule and after consideration of public comments received. Compliance Date Affected parties do not have to comply with the new information collection requirements under \u00a7 60-1.35 until the Department publishes a Notice in the Federal Register stating that OMB has approved the information collections under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., or until this rule otherwise takes effect, whichever is later. Circumstances Necessitating Collection Executive Order 13665 amends the equal opportunity clause provided in Executive Order 11246 by adding the prohibition that Federal contractors may not discriminate against employees and job applicants who inquire about, discuss or disclose their own compensation or the compensation of other employees or applicants. Federal contractors are required to amend the equal opportunity clauses incorporated into their subcontracts, and notify job applicants and employees of the requirement. Executive Order 13665 became effective at signing and applies to contracts entered into on or after the effective date of this final rule. The final rule contains several provisions that could be considered ''collections of information'' as defined by the PRA: The amendment to the equal opportunity clause incorporated into contracts and subcontracts, and the notification given to employees and job applicants. Proposed \u00a7 60-1.35(c)(i) and (ii) required the incorporation of the new provision verbatim into existing handbooks and manuals, and the dissemination of a notification to employees and applications. The disclosure of information originally supplied by the Federal government to the recipient for the purpose of disclosure is not included within the PRA's definition of ''collection of information.'' See 5 CFR 1320.3(c)(2). OFCCP determined that proposed \u00a7 60- 1.35(c)(i) and (ii) did not meet the PRA's definition of ''collection of information'' and therefore these provisions are not subject to the PRA's requirements. However, OFCCP determined that the proposed changes to \u00a7 60-1.4 could be considered information collections, therefore an information collection request (ICR) was submitted to OMB for PRA authorization. Information and Technology Each contractor determines its own methods for developing and maintaining information, including creating electronic templates. Contractors may meet the requirements of this rule using paper or electronic means. Public Comments OFCCP sought public comments regarding the potential burdens imposed by information collections contained in the NPRM which reflected burden related to the amendment to the equal opportunity clause incorporated into contracts and subcontracts. OFCCP received 11 comments regarding costs and burdens from employer groups, women's groups, employers and individuals. Of the 11 comments, one stated that the new rule should not incur any significant cost as the language will be prescribed by OFCCP and that the rule eliminates a VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 RULES54973 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 100Federal Contract Compliance Manual, Chapter 2, Section 2L03 and Chapter 3, section 3H03 (Oct. 2014). policy of taking adverse action against employees. Some of the commenters indicated that the rule was unduly burdensome or unnecessary because it had no clear effect on addressing the pay gap. Some of these commenters indicated that the pay gap could be explained by other nondiscriminatory explanations. OFCCP disagrees that the rule is unnecessary and unduly burdensome. OFCCP worked with several other Federal agencies on the National Equal Pay Task Force to identify the persistent challenges to equal pay enforcement and to develop an action plan for implementing recommendations to resolve those challenges. OFCCP also consulted a number of sources in order to assess the need for the rule. For instance, OFCCP reviewed national statistics on earnings by gender produced by BLS and the U.S. Census Bureau. Those statistics show persistent pay gaps for female and minority workers. These well-documented earnings differences based on race and sex have not been fully explained by nondiscriminatory factors including differences in worker qualifications such as education and experience, occupational differences, work schedules or other similar factors. Thus, some of the remaining unexplained portion of the pay gap may be attributable to discrimination. In addition, prohibiting pay secrecy policies will enhance the ability of Federal contractors and their employees to detect and remediate unlawful discriminatory practices. Thus, the rule improves the efficacy of Executive Order 11246 and the efficiency of the market in Federal contracting. In order to reduce the burden of implementing Executive Order 13665, OFCCP allows contractors to incorporate the equal opportunity clause by reference into its subcontracts. In addition, OFCCP is providing specific language for incorporation into handbooks and the notice for applicants and employees. Thus, OFCCP has proposed the most efficient manner to implement the amendments. Other commenters asserted that OFCCP underestimated the burdens created by the new rule. In this area, one commenter proposed alternative calculations related to the implementation of the rule. In considering the alternative calculations of burden, OFCCP took into consideration that although the commenter represents a segment of the contractor universe, it is not reflective of the entire SAM contractor universe. OFCCP expects the costs to vary by contractor. While some contractors may incur more costs, others will likely incur less. Thus, the estimates of burden reflect an average estimate for all covered contractors in the SAM contractor universe. Therefore, OFCCP has retained its calculation of the burden as proposed in the NPRM. Another commenter indicated that OFCCP did not include burdens associated with the definition of compensation and the impact that the definition proposed in the NPRM may have on Federal contractors. The commenter indicated that OFCCP should take the burden that the compensation definition ''will impose on annual evaluations under contractors' identification of problem areas section of their affirmative action programs.'' OFCCP disagrees with this commenter's assertion. Contractors are required to perform an in-depth analysis of its total employment process to determine whether and where impediments to equal employment opportunity exist. See 41 CFR 60- 2.17(b). The evaluation includes an analysis of each contractor's compensation system. OFCCP's guidance and regulations have historically included salary, wages, overtime pay, shift differentials, bonuses, commissions, vacation and holiday pay, allowances, insurance and other benefits, stock options, profit sharing and retirement. 100Thus, OFCCP did not assess additional burden as this obligation has not changed. Another commenter asserted that OFCCP did not assess the additional burden associated with data requests received during compliance evaluations. The collection of information during an investigation or the conduct of a civil action is an exception within the PRA's definition of collection of information. See 5 CFR 1320.4(a)(2). One commenter suggested that OFCCP allow contractors discretion regarding the wording of the notice for incorporation in the handbook and posting. In order to reduce burden, OFCCP provides the wording for the notification. As the majority of comments received related to burden were opposed to increasing burden, OFCCP declines to increase burden and instead will provide the exact wording for the notice and language to incorporate into existing employee handbooks. OFCCP has resubmitted the revised information collection (1250-0008) to OMB for approval, and OFCCP intends to publish a notice announcing OMB's decision regarding this information collection request. A copy of the information collection request can be obtained by contacting OFCCP as shown in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this preamble. Comments to the OMB should be directed to: Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Attention OMB Desk Officer for the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10235, Washington, DC 20503; Telephone: 202-395-7316 (these are not toll-free numbers). Comments can be submitted to OMB by email at OIRA_ submission@omb.eop.gov. The OMB will consider all written comments it receives within 30 days of publication of this final rule. The OMB and the Department are particularly interested in comments that: Evaluate whether the proposed collections of information are necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility; Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of IT (e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses). Number of Respondents All nonexempt Federal contractors with contracts, subcontracts, federally assisted construction contracts or subcontracts in excess of $10,000 are required to comply with this final rule. There are approximately 500,000 contractor firms registered in the General Service Administration's SAM. Therefore, OFCCP estimates there are 500,000 contractor firms. Summary of Paperwork Burdens The estimated total annual burden for complying with the new regulatory requirement is listed in Table 22, below. The burden is calculated as an annual burden based on a three-year approval of this information collection request. OFCCP believes that in the first year of implementation contractors will modify their equal opportunity clauses. Additionally, OFCCP estimates that in subsequent years 1 percent of the contractors will be required to modify VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:03 Sep RULES54974 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations their equal opportunity clauses, as they will be new contractors.

Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 This rule is not a major rule as defined by section 804 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. This rule will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of the United States-based companies to compete with foreign- based companies in domestic and export markets. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 For purposes of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1532, this rule does not include any Federal mandate that may result in excess of $100 million in expenditures by state, local, and tribal governments in the aggregate or by the private sector. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) OFCCP has reviewed this rule in accordance with Executive Order 13132 regarding federalism, and has determined that it does not have ''federalism implications.'' This rule will not ''have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.'' Executive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments) This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175 that requires a tribal summary impact statement. The rule does not have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Effects on Families The undersigned hereby certifies that the rule would not adversely affect the well-being of families, as discussed under section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999. Executive Order 13045 (Protection of Children) This rule would have no environmental health risk or safety risk that may disproportionately affect children.

There is, thus, no corresponding environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. Executive Order 13211 (Energy Supply) This rule is not subject to Executive Order 13211. It will not have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. Executive Order 12630 (Constitutionally Protected Property Rights) This rule is not subject to Executive Order 12630 because it does not involve implementation of a policy that has takings implications or that could impose limitations on private property use. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice Reform Analysis) This rule was drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12988 and will not unduly burden the Federal court system. The rule was: (1) reviewed to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguities; (2) written to minimize litigation; and (3) written to provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct and to promote burden reduction.

Reportable Events and Certain Other Notification Requirements; Final Rule VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 1The old regulation provided a waiver in some circumstances generally based on 80 percent funding on a premium basis. However, in PBGC's experience, that test was inadequate, as it was passed by many plans that underwent distress or involuntary terminations. See Well-Funded Plan Safe Harbor below. A safe harbor based on paying no VRP, in contrast, is consistent with a Congressional determination of the level of underfunding that presents risk to the pension insurance system. PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION 29 CFR Parts 4000, 4001, 4043, 4204, 4206, and 4231 RIN 1212-AB06 Reportable Events and Certain Other Notification Requirements AGENCY : Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. ACTION : Final rule. SUMMARY : In 2013, PBGC proposed to establish risk-based safe harbors that would exempt most companies and plans from many of its reportable events requirements and target reporting toward the minority of plan sponsors and plans presenting the most substantial risk of involuntary or distress termination. After holding a hearing on the proposal, and carefully considering the public's written and oral comments, PBGC is publishing this final rule to make the requirements of the sponsor risk-based safe harbor more flexible, make the funding level for satisfying the well-funded plan safe harbor lower and tied to the variable- rate premium, and add public company waivers for five events. The waiver structure under the final rule will further reduce unnecessary reporting requirements, while at the same time better targeting PBGC's resources to plans that pose the greatest risks to the pension insurance system. PBGC anticipates the final rule will exempt about 94 percent of plans and sponsors from many reporting requirements and result in a net reduction in reporting to PBGC. This rulemaking is a result of PBGC's regulatory review under Executive Order 13563. DATES : Effective October 13, 2015. See Applicability in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION .

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Executive Summary\u2014Purpose of the Regulatory Action This rule is needed to make reporting more efficient and effective, to avoid unnecessary reporting requirements, and to conform PBGC's reportable events regulation to changes in the law. A better-targeted and more efficient reporting system helps preserve retirement plans. PBGC's legal authorities for this action are section 4002(b)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which authorizes PBGC to issue regulations to carry out the purposes of title IV of ERISA, and section 4043 of ERISA, which gives PBGC authority to define reportable events and waive reporting. Executive Summary\u2014Major Provisions of the Regulatory Action Changing the Waiver Structure Under the regulation's long-standing waiver structure for reportable events, which primarily focused on the funded status of a plan, PBGC often did not get reports it needed; at the same time, it received many reports that were unnecessary. This mismatch occurred because the old waiver structure was not well tied to the actual risks and causes of plan terminations, particularly the risk that a plan sponsor will default on its financial obligations, ultimately leading to an underfunded termination of its pension plan. The final rule provides a new reportable events waiver structure that is more closely focused on risk of default than was the old waiver structure. Some reporting requirements that poorly identify risky situations\u2014 like those based on a supposedly modest level of plan underfunding\u2014 have been eliminated; at the same time, a new low-default-risk ''safe harbor''\u2014 based on company financial metrics\u2014is established that better measures risk to the pension insurance system. This sponsor safe harbor is voluntary and based on existing, readily-available financial information that companies already use for many business purposes. With the low-default-risk safe harbor, PBGC is establishing a risk tolerance level for certain events faced by plans and plan sponsors that trigger reporting requirements so that PBGC can monitor and address situations that are most likely to pose problems to the pension insurance system. This reporting system is analogous to that used by an unsecured creditor in loan arrangements with a borrower so as to be alerted to important issues facing the borrower impacting its ability to meet its loan obligations. The final rule also provides a safe harbor based on a plan's owing no variable-rate premium (VRP) (referred to as the well-funded plan safe harbor). 1 Other waivers, such as public company, small plan, de minimis segment, and foreign entity waivers, have been retained in the final rule, and in many cases expanded, to provide additional relief to plan sponsors where the risk of an event to plans and the pension insurance system is low. With the expansion in the number of waivers available in the final rule, PBGC estimates that 94 percent of plans covered by the pension insurance system will qualify for at least one waiver of reporting for events dealing with active participant reductions, controlled group changes, extraordinary dividends, benefit liability transfers, and substantial owner distributions. Revised Definitions of Reportable Events The rule simplifies the descriptions of several reportable events and makes some event descriptions (e.g., active participant reduction) narrower so that compliance is easier and less burdensome. One event is broadened in scope (loan defaults), and clarification of another event has a similar result (controlled group changes). These changes, like the waiver changes, are aimed at tying reporting burden to risk. Conforming to Changes in the Law The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) made changes in the law that affect the test for whether advance reporting of certain reportable events is required. This rule conforms the advance reporting test to the new legal requirements. Mandatory E-Filing The rule makes electronic filing of reportable events notices mandatory. This furthers PBGC's ongoing implementation of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. E-filing is more efficient for both filers and PBGC and has become the norm for PBGC's regulated community. Background The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) administers the pension plan termination insurance program under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Section 4043 of ERISA requires that PBGC be notified of the occurrence of certain ''reportable events.'' The statute provides for both post-event and VerDate RULES54981 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 2Except as otherwise noted, this preamble discusses post-event reporting only. 3For example, alerts from recent reportable events notices of missed contribution events have allowed PBGC to timely intervene to protect plan assets and participant benefits. In one such case, PBGC's involvement ensured that there was no interruption in benefits when PBGC ultimately terminated the plan. In a second case, PBGC's monitoring of the plan as a result of the reportable event filing ensured that there were sufficient funds from the sale of a business to complete a standard termination. In a third case, PBGC's early intervention provided an opportunity to examine options with the plan sponsor to continue the plan. As another example, a reportable event notice of an active participant reduction event led to a negotiated settlement with the plan sponsor that resulted in an additional $400,000 contribution to the plan. When the sponsor later filed for bankruptcy, PBGC took over the plan with a smaller amount of unfunded liabilities than if the contribution from the settlement had not been made. 4For ease of reference, the preamble refers to the regulation as it exists before this final rule becomes applicable as the ''old regulation'' and refers to the regulation as amended by this final rule as the ''new regulation.'' See Applicability below. 5Category 1 events include Extraordinary Dividend or Stock Redemption, Active Participant Reduction, Change in Contributing Sponsor or Controlled Group, Distributions to a Substantial Owner, and Transfer of Benefit Liabilities events. As discussed below, these are events for which the low-default risk and well-funded plan safe harbors will apply under the final regulation. 6See footnote 3 above. advance reporting.2PBGC's regulation on Reportable Events and Certain Other Notification Requirements (29 CFR part 4043) implements section 4043. Reportable events include such plan events as missed contributions, insufficient funds, and large pay-outs, and such sponsor events as loan defaults and controlled group changes\u2014 events that may present a risk to a sponsor's ability to continue a plan. When PBGC has timely information about a reportable event, it can take steps to encourage plan continuation\u2014 for example, by exploring alternative funding options with the plan sponsor\u2014 or, if plan termination is called for, to maximize recovery of the shortfall from all possible sources. 3Without timely information about a reportable event, PBGC typically learns that a plan is in danger only when most opportunities for protecting participants and the pension insurance system have been lost. The regulation does however, include a system of waivers and extensions to ease reporting burdens where the circumstances surrounding some events may make reporting unnecessary or where the PBGC has other ways to obtain needed information. The regulation (both the old regulation and the new regulation 4) also provides that PBGC may grant waivers and extensions on a case-by- case basis. Reportable events are rare and reporting is often waived. As a result, each year, on average only 4 percent of plans experience an event and are required to report it; even fewer are required to report Category 1 events. 5 Although the impact of the reportable events regulation on any company or plan or on the pension community as a whole is very small, a reportable events notice is potentially very important to PBGC, the pension insurance system, and participants of affected plans. 6 2009 Proposed Rule On November 23, 2009 (at 74 FR 61248), PBGC published in the Federal Register for notice and comment a proposed rule (the 2009 proposal) that eliminated most automatic waivers. The proposal reflected PBGC's concern that it was not receiving reports of significant events because the existing automatic waivers were too broadly applicable. PBGC received comments from actuaries, pension consultants, and organizations representing employers and pension professionals. The public comments on the 2009 proposal uniformly opposed the proposed elimination of most waivers. Commenters said that without the waivers, reporting would be required for events that posed little risk to PBGC and said that the increase in the public's burden of compliance would outweigh the benefit to the pension insurance system of the additional reporting. They also expressed concern that the proposed changes to the rule would discourage employers from continuing to maintain pension plans covered by Title IV. Several commenters urged PBGC to rethink and repropose the rule to address issues raised by the comments. VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES54982 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 7PBGC's Plan for Regulatory Review can be found at http://www.pbgc.gov/documents/plan-for- regulatory-review.pdf (August 23, 2011). 8The 2013 proposal also received comments from one plan sponsor. 9See Summary Chart, below, for an overview of waivers and safe harbors under the old regulation and this final rule. 10For this purpose, large plans means those plans that have more than 100 participants. The charts included in this preamble do not reflect waivers for de minimis segments or foreign entities. Executive Order 13563 On January 18, 2011, the President issued Executive Order 13563 on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (76 FR 3821, January 21, 2011). Executive Order 13563 encourages identification and use of innovative tools to achieve regulatory ends, calls for streamlining existing regulations, and reemphasizes the goal of balancing regulatory benefits with burdens on the public. Executive Order 13563 also requires agencies to develop a plan to review existing regulations to identify any that can be made more effective or less burdensome in achieving regulatory objectives. 7 2013 Proposal PBGC reconsidered the reportable events regulation in the spirit of Executive Order 13563 and in light of the comments to the 2009 proposal. On April 3, 2013 (at 78 FR 20039), PBGC published a new proposed rule (the 2013 proposal). The 2013 proposal took a very different approach to waivers from the 2009 proposal. Whereas the 2009 proposal simply eliminated most automatic waivers, the 2013 proposal substituted a new system of waivers (safe harbors) to reduce burden where possible without depriving PBGC of the information it needs to protect the pension insurance system. One of the waivers in the 2013 proposal was for employers that met a safe harbor based on what the proposal described as sponsor financial soundness (i.e., an employer's capacity to meet its financial commitments in full and on time) as determined through credit report scores and the satisfaction of related criteria. A second safe harbor that was more stringent than the existing funding-based waivers was available for plans that were either fully funded on a termination basis or 120 percent funded on a premium basis. The 2013 proposal also preserved or extended some waivers under the old regulation (including small-plan waivers) that the 2009 proposal would have eliminated. PBGC received 13 comment letters on the 2013 proposal, mainly from the same sources as the comments on the 2009 proposal. 8PBGC also held its first- ever regulatory public hearing, at which eight of the commenters discussed their comments. Most of the commenters on the 2013 proposal expressed appreciation for PBGC's re-proposing the rule and for the opportunity for further public input. Several commenters complimented PBGC on its general overall effort or said the 2013 proposal was an improvement on the 2009 proposal. One commenter approved PBGC's efforts to balance its need for information with the public's burden of providing it and to streamline the reporting process. Another commenter applauded PBGC on its common sense, risk-based approach to reporting, and yet another commended PBGC for the proposed rule's significant relief for small plans, as well as the general focus on tying reporting to risk. Nonetheless, all of the commenters took issue with aspects of the proposal, particularly with the safe harbors, which four commenters suggested could cause more sponsors to leave the defined benefit system. Other concerns dealt with the difficulty of monitoring events in controlled groups and with proposed changes to the events dealing with active participant reductions and missed contributions. Some plan sponsor groups expressed general concern that by creating a plan sponsor financial soundness safe harbor, PBGC, on behalf of the Federal government, inevitably would become an entity that makes formal pronouncements on the financial prospects of American businesses. Two commenters urged that the proposal be withdrawn. The comments on the 2013 proposal and PBGC's responses are discussed below with the topics to which they relate. Final Rule Waivers In response to the comments, PBGC is issuing a final rule with safe harbors that are simpler, more flexible, and easier to comply with and that clearly target risk to the pension insurance system. 9Under the final rule, all small plans (about two-thirds of all plans) will be waived from reporting Category 1 events (other than substantial owner distributions). Further, if a reportable event occurs, 82 percent of large plans qualify for at least one waiver for these events: 10 VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 RULES54983 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations As a result, if a reportable event occurs, 94 percent of all plans will qualify for at least one waiver under the final regulation (an increase from 89 percent under the old regulation): VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 RULES54984 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 11In 2013, 66 percent of reportable events reports from filers that were below investment grade resulted in the opening of investigations. For this purpose, ''investment grade'' means a credit rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody's or BBB- or higher by Standard and Poor's. 12See e.g., Department of Agriculture biorefinery assistance program (7 CFR 4279.202(d)); Department of Education requirements for institutions to participate in Federal student Low-Default-Risk Safe Harbor for Plan Sponsors To address the issue of risk, the 2013 proposal provided a risk-based safe harbor tied to the risk of default on financial obligations of a plan sponsor. PBGC developed the proposed safe harbor based on its experience that the default risk of a plan sponsor generally correlates with the risk of an underfunded termination of the sponsor's pension plan. One major component of the risk of underfunded termination is the likelihood that the plan sponsor will, within the near future, fall into one of the ''distress'' categories in section 4041(c)(2)(B) of ERISA (liquidation, reorganization, or inability to pay debts when due and to continue in business). Another is that the sponsor will go out of business, abandoning the plan and forcing PBGC to terminate it under section 4042 of ERISA. Thus, the 2013 proposal recognized that the risk of underfunded termination of a plan within the near future depends most significantly on the plan sponsor's financial strength. 11 The 2013 proposal provided a waiver from reporting for each of five events (active participant reductions, substantial owner distributions, controlled group changes, extraordinary dividends, and benefit liabilities transfers) if, as of the date an event occurred, each contributing sponsor (or highest US member of its controlled group) was what the proposal termed ''financially sound,'' that is, had adequate capacity to meet its obligations in full and on time as evidenced by its satisfaction of five criteria: 1. The entity had a qualifying commercial credit report score. 2. The entity had no secured debt (with certain exceptions). 3. The entity had positive net income for the most recent two fiscal years. 4. The entity did not experience any loan default event in the previous two years (regardless of whether reporting was waived). 5. The entity did not experience a missed contribution event in the previous two years (unless reporting was waived). To focus public input on this issue, the 2013 proposal asked specific questions about the financial soundness standard and sought suggestions for alternative approaches to determining financial soundness based on widely available and accepted financial standards. One commenter found the sponsor financial soundness safe harbor to be a reasonable attempt to accomplish the goal of providing broad waivers in situations where there is no significant risk to PBGC. But most commenters opposed the safe harbor as a concept, arguing that it would not be business- friendly or helpful in protecting the pension insurance system. Some commenters characterized the financial soundness test as a pronouncement by PBGC on the financial status of American businesses, which they believed to be inappropriate for a government agency. However, many federal agencies have rules that include standards for measuring aspects of financial health or ability to meet certain financial obligations for a wide variety of purposes, including eligibility to use certain forms, qualification for funding, or participation in certain activities. These regulations govern not only the financial services industry, but such wide-ranging activities as agriculture, education, energy, and the environment. 12The provisions of the VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 RULES54985 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations assistance programs (34 CFR 668.15); Department of Energy loan guarantees for projects that employ innovative technologies (10 CFR part 609); and Environmental Protection Agency rules on owners and operators of underground carbon dioxide storage wells (40 CFR 146.85). 13Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act proscribes federal regulations that require the use of credit ratings, but Section 939 also requires agencies to replace references to credit ratings in regulations with alternative standards of creditworthiness. Section 939A is premised on the fact that federal agencies can and do use standards of financial capacity for various purposes. 14For example, recent rules promulgated by Federal banking agencies use similar language that PBGC reviewed in developing its own standard for its regulation on reportable events. The 2013 proposal states: For purposes of this part, an entity that is a plan sponsor or member of a plan sponsor's controlled group . . it has adequate capacity to meet its obligations in full and on time as evidenced by its satisfaction of all of the five criteria described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section''). This language is similar to an FDIC rule (''an insured savings association . . . , shall not acquire or retain a corporate debt security unless the savings association . . . determines that the issuer of the security has adequate capacity to meet all financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the security'') and an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) rule (''Investment grade means the issuer of a security has an adequate capacity to meet financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the asset or exposure. An issuer has an adequate capacity to meet financial commitments if the risk of default by the obligor is low and the full and timely repayment of principal and interest is expected'').

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub. L. 111- 203) (the Dodd-Frank Act) clearly contemplate the use of some types of creditworthiness standards in federal regulations. 13And there is precedent in federal regulations for using the ''adequate capacity'' standard in determining financial soundness. 14 PBGC understands that the proposed ''financial soundness'' terminology caused concern for some commenters, who perceived that the provisions of the safe harbor tests could be seen as measuring the overall financial prospects of a company. However, the safe harbor tests were never meant for that purpose. Rather, they were intended to measure the likelihood that a company would be able to continue to sponsor a plan and thus not present a risk to the pension insurance system. To clarify this point, the final regulation more precisely characterizes this safe harbor as the company low-default-risk safe harbor rather than the sponsor financial soundness safe harbor, and refers to a safe harbor for plans (described below) as the well-funded plan safe harbor rather than the plan financial soundness safe harbor. PBGC's company low-default-risk safe harbor is entirely voluntary and relies mainly on private-sector financial metrics derived from a company's own financial information; one component of the safe harbor, which is not required to be used to satisfy the low-default-risk standard, is based on widely available financial information that most plan sponsors (and their U.S. parents) already have, and that represents well- known, objective, non-governmental assessments of default risk used in a wide variety of business contexts. Use of the safe harbor is not conditioned on an evaluation by PBGC of plan sponsor financial soundness. Nor does it involve sponsors' reporting to PBGC (or anyone) any financial metrics, such as company financial information, credit scores or other evidence of creditworthiness. PBGC remains convinced that adding a company low-default-risk safe harbor to the reportable events regulation furthers PBGC's goals of tying reporting to risk and avoiding unnecessary reports. Thus, the final rule contains a risk-based safe harbor with modifications to mitigate commenters' concerns, particularly by providing more flexibility in applying the safe harbor and clarifying when and how the satisfaction of the low-default-risk standard is determined. Adequate Capacity Standard The final rule provides that an entity (a ''company'') that is a contributing sponsor of a plan or the highest level U.S. parent of a contributing sponsor satisfies the low-default-risk standard if the company has adequate capacity to meet its obligations in full and on time as evidenced by satisfying either (A) the first two, or (B) any four, of the following seven criteria: 1. The probability that the company will default on its financial obligations is not more than 4 percent over the next five years or not more than 0.4 percent over the next year, in either case determined on the basis of widely available financial information on the company's credit quality. 2. The company's secured debt (with some exceptions) does not exceed 10 percent of its total asset value. 3. The company's ratio of total-debt- to-EBITDA 15is 3.0 or less. 4. The company's ratio of retained- earnings-to-total-assets is 0.25 or more. 5. The company has positive net income for the two most recent completed fiscal years. 6. The company has not experienced any loan default event in the past two years regardless of whether reporting was waived. 7. The sponsor has not experienced a missed contribution event in the past two years unless reporting was waived. For reporting to be waived for an event to which the safe harbor applies, both the contributing sponsor and the highest level U.S. parent of the contributing sponsor must satisfy the company low-default-risk safe harbor. (The 2013 proposal required only that, for each contributing sponsor of the plan, either the sponsor or the highest level U.S. parent of the contributing sponsor satisfy the safe harbor requirements.) Requiring that both entities satisfy the safe harbor requirements addresses the issue of intercompany transactions between or among members of a controlled group that may disperse assets and liabilities within the controlled group. Although the low-default-risk safe harbor has some similarities with standards PBGC described in its 2013 guidelines concerning enforcement of ERISA section 4062(e), 16differences exist because of the different purposes of the statute. The 4062(e) guidelines were intended to inform PBGC's exercise of its discretion in enforcing monetary liability for certain business cessations, whereas the reportable events regulation provides rules for the public on compliance with ERISA section 4043's reporting requirements. The final rule revises two criteria (probability of default in the first criterion and secured debt level in the second criterion) from the 2013 proposal and adds two new criteria (based on a ratio of total-debt-to- EBITDA described in the third criterion listed above and a ratio of retained- earnings-to-total-assets described in the fourth criterion listed above). PBGC selected these four criteria based on historical data on rates of company defaults on financial obligations from widely published financial information. 17These criteria represent VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 RULES54986 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 18Thirteen months allows for some variation from year to year on the date that annual financials are reported. 19See \u00a7 4010.9. 20See e.g., Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, AU Section 508 Reports on Audited Financial Statements http://pcaobus.org/standards/ auditing/pages/au508.aspx#ps-pcaob _e65bc2e0- ad78-42d7-a99b-8c59d98b3fd3; American Institute of CPAs (AICPA), AU-C Section 705 Modifications to the Opinion in the Independent Auditor's Report http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/DownloadableDocuments/AU-C- 00705.pdf; and AICPA, AR Section 90 Review of Financial Statements http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/CompilationReview/DownloadableDocuments/AR-00090.pdf. 21PBGC compared company one-year default rates from information PBGC reviewed that is referred to in footnote 17 above with CCRC score financial metrics that are easily identified from existing sources of information and are used regularly by creditors as indicators of a company's ability to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Lenders take into account such rates of default when extending credit to borrowers on terms showing the borrowers have adequate capacity to meet financial obligations. The revised criteria take into account one commenter's suggestion that PBGC consider incorporating into the safe harbor alternative risk measures such as debt-to-EBITDA and debt-to-total-capital ratios that are used in common debt covenants and routinely tracked by companies that issue debt or borrow from banks. The changes to the low- default-risk standard are described in more detail below. Determination Date To make the safe harbor user-friendly, the final rule provides that a company determine whether it qualifies for the low-default-risk safe harbor once during an annual financial reporting cycle (on a ''financial information date''). If it qualifies on that financial information date, its qualification remains in place throughout a ''safe harbor period'' that ends 13 months later or on the next financial information date (if earlier). 18 If it does not qualify, its non-qualified status remains in place until the next financial information date. The description of financial information used to determine whether the safe harbor is available is similar to that used in PBGC's regulation on Annual Financial and Actuarial Information Reporting. 19PBGC used this description so that the pension plan community would be familiar with the provisions and to maintain consistency across PBGC regulations, to the extent possible. The financial information date for a company is the date annual financial statements (including balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and notes to the financial statements) are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 10-K (if the company is a public company) or the closing date of the company's annual accounting period (if the company is not a public company). For a company that does not have annual financial statements, the financial information date is the date the company files with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) its annual federal income tax return or IRS Form 990. The final regulation refers to the annual financial statements or applicable IRS return or Form 990 associated with a financial information date as ''supporting financial information.'' The supporting financial information associated with a financial information date will also be used to evaluate whether the secured debt, EBITDA-to-total-debt, and/or retained- earnings-to-total-assets criteria are met. To evaluate whether the positive net income criterion is met, supporting financial information associated with the two most recent consecutive fiscal years must be used. If an accountant's audit or review report expresses a material adverse view or qualification, the company will not satisfy the low-default-risk standard for the safe harbor. Common adverse qualifiers used in the accounting profession that will render supporting financial information unsatisfactory for purposes of the safe harbor include such language as ''awareness of one or more material modifications that should have been made in order for the financial statements to be in conformity with [applicable accounting standards]''; ''the financial statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the company's financial condition and results of operations in conformity with [applicable accounting standards]''; or ''substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.'' 20 Commercial Measures Criterion To satisfy the criterion for the company financial soundness safe harbor under the 2013 proposal, a company needed to have a credit score, reported by a commercial credit reporting company (CCRC) commonly used in the business community, that indicated a low likelihood that the company would default on its obligations over the next twelve months. Examples of such scores were to be listed in PBGC's reportable events forms and instructions. Seven commenters were critical of the commercial credit score criterion. Most of these commenters opposed the use of the score as a criterion altogether, while some indicated that the use of credit scores or similar information would be acceptable in limited circumstances if it were voluntary. Some concerns raised by commenters centered on the extent to which companies pay attention or have access to CCRC scores. Large public companies typically are more familiar with their credit ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs) registered with the SEC, and some small companies may not have CCRC scores. Other concerns included costs associated with obtaining or monitoring scores, inaccurate score data, and a lack of specificity as to how and when PBGC would update its forms and instructions with valid CCRC score examples. The final regulation addresses these concerns. Under the final rule's company low-default-risk safe harbor provision, the criterion that corresponds to the proposed CCRC score criterion is optional. In addition, CCRC scores are not the exclusive benchmark for satisfying that new criterion. Instead, companies are not limited to using particular reports or tools and are afforded broad flexibility to use widely available business metrics that measure default probability. This approach avoids the need to list and update examples of scores in PBGC's forms and instructions. Under the final rule, the first criterion (referred to as the ''commercial measures'' criterion) will be met for a company if the probability that the company will default on its financial obligations is not more than 4 percent over the next five years or not more than 0.4 percent over the next year, in either case determined on the basis of widely available financial information on the company's credit quality\u2014not limited to CCRC scores. PBGC's intent is to provide flexibility to companies in meeting the standard and allow a company to determine whether it satisfies the new criterion by referring to third party information that the company considers reliable and already uses with confidence for other business purposes. Thus, the final rule does not require the use of a CCRC score to satisfy the commercial measures criterion (although a company may still choose to obtain a CCRC score if it does not have one, as contemplated in the 2013 proposal). The commercial measures standard replicates the underlying probability of default risk reflected in the CCRC score standard under the 2013 proposal 21and VerDate Sep<11>2014 RULES54987 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations data; see e.g., https://www.dnb.com/product/FSS/ FAQsv7.1.pdf. 22See e.g., tying adequate capacity to meet financial obligations to the lowest tier of investment grade rating in Table 3 in http://www.standardandpoors.com/spf/general/RatingsDirect_ Commentary_ 979212_ 06_22_2012_ 12_42_54.pdf. 23This company was suggested by one of the commenters on the 2013 proposal. According to CreditRiskMonitor's Web site, the company provides comprehensive commercial credit reports for more than 40,000 public companies world-wide. 24The distributions to substantial owner event does not have a small plan waiver. 25See Department of Treasury Final Rule: Modification of Treasury Regulations Pursuant to Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. (78 FR 54758, September 6, 2013) (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ FR-2013-09-06/pdf/2013-21752.pdf). The relevant regulatory text states: ''Sec. 1.249-1 Limitation on deduction of bond premium on repurchase: (e)(2)(ii) In determining the amount under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, appropriate consideration shall be given to all factors affecting the selling price or yields of comparable nonconvertible obligations. Such factors include general changes in prevailing yields of comparable obligations between the dates the convertible obligation was issued and repurchased and the amount (if any) by which the selling price of the convertible obligation was affected by reason of any change in the issuing corporation's credit quality or the credit quality of the obligation during such period (determined on the basis of widely published financial information or on the basis of other relevant facts and circumstances which reflect the relative credit quality of the corporation or the comparable obligation). (Emphasis added.) 26See e.g., SEC Final Rule: Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings Under the Investment Company Act (79 FR 1321, January 8, 2014) (http:// www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-01-08/pdf/2013- 31425.pdf): ''We believe, however, that credit ratings can serve as a useful data point for evaluating credit quality, and as noted above, a fund's board (or its delegate) may not rely solely on the credit ratings of an NRSRO without performing additional due diligence''; and Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration Proposed Amendments to Class Prohibited Transaction Exemptions To Remove Credit Ratings Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (78 FR 37578-9, June 21, 2013) (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-06- 21/pdf/2013-14790.pdf ): ''In making these determinations, a fiduciary would not be precluded from considering credit quality reports prepared by outside sources, including credit ratings prepared by credit rating agencies, that they conclude are credible and reliable for this purpose'' and ''For purposes of this amendment, the Department believes that a fiduciary's determination of the credit quality of commercial paper according the proposed standard, should, as a matter of prudence, include the reports or advice of independent third parties, including, where appropriate, such commercial paper's credit rating.'' 27This figure is based on review of financial statement data for companies in PBGC databases that could meet the commercial measures criterion. represents a threshold below which PBGC believes there is legitimate concern as to a company's long-term ability to continue a pension plan. 22The one- and five-year time periods for measuring default rate are typical periods over which third parties analyze the risk of default. PBGC believes that almost every sponsor and its highest level U.S. parent will be able to obtain widely available financial information that indicates their probability of default over either a one- or five-year period. Typical metrics (from 2013) that would meet the probability-of-default standard include a D&B score of 1477, risk class of 3, or percentile of 46-55; a CreditRiskMonitor 23score of 9, and may include other financial metrics reflecting a level of investment grade rating. PBGC believes that 70 percent of plan sponsors will be able to meet the probability-of-default criterion based on widely available financial information on their credit quality. Sponsors of small plans, which are more likely to have difficulty obtaining credit quality information, will generally qualify for the small-plan waiver for four of the five events 24covered by the company low- default-risk safe harbor. In crafting the revised commercial measures criterion, PBGC reviewed language used in a recent final rule designed to bring a Department of Treasury regulation into compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act. 25PBGC also took into account other agency rulemakings where credit ratings were used in compliance with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act. Explaining the usefulness of outside sources of credit quality information, including credit ratings, these agencies suggested in preambles to their rules that the voluntary use of credit ratings from NRSROs is permissible where they are one but not the sole source of information used to determine credit quality. 26 One of the commenters requested that PBGC provide relief from information penalties if a company relies on a CCRC score that turns out to be inaccurate or stale. PBGC believes such relief is unnecessary under the final rule because a company may choose a measure that the company knows is accurate, or the company may choose to satisfy the low-default-risk safe harbor in other ways. Secured Debt Criterion Under the 2013 proposal, one of the criteria required to satisfy the sponsor financial soundness standard was that the entity had no secured debt, disregarding leases or debt incurred to acquire or improve property and secured only by that property (e.g., mortgages and equipment financing, including capital leases). In the preamble to the 2013 proposal, PBGC said it was aware that there may be other circumstances in which a company capable of borrowing without security might nonetheless choose to offer security to a lender\u2014for example, if doing so would significantly reduce the cost of a loan. PBGC sought public comment on the extent to which the proposed no-secured-debt test might be failed by plan sponsors that had a low risk of default and on how to make the test correspond better with commercial reality (e.g., by disregarding more types of secured debt). Two commenters stated that a plan sponsor's use of secured debt is not appropriate as a measure of the plan sponsor's financial health because, as PBGC acknowledged in the 2013 proposal, a financially healthy company may obtain secured debt for a variety of business reasons that do not relate to the credit risk of the company, such as to obtain favorable interest rates or because the company has assumed the debt from an entity it acquires. These comments gave PBGC a better appreciation for how widespread a practice it is for creditworthy companies to obtain secured debt. Under the final rule, the criterion will be satisfied if a company's secured debt (disregarding leases or debt incurred to acquire or improve property and secured only by that property) does not exceed 10 percent of the company's total assets. PBGC was reluctant to try to predict the types of secured debt that low-risk borrowers would be more likely to have than higher-risk borrowers. The 10 percent threshold included in the criterion serves to make a simple allowance for secured debt that good credit quality businesses may have. In addition, PBGC's experience is that approximately 90 percent of companies that would meet the commercial measures criterion of the safe harbor do not have a ratio of secured-debt-to-total- assets above 10 percent. 27PBGC believes this correlation between the ability to meet financial obligations and the level of secured debt supports the use of 10 percent as an appropriate threshold for this safe harbor criterion. Net-Income Criterion Another criterion for the sponsor financial soundness safe harbor in the 2013 proposal was that the company had positive net income for the past two years. (For non-profit entities, ''net income'' was to be measured as the excess of total revenue over total expenses as required to be reported on Internal Revenue Service Form 990.) Four commenters raised issues regarding the positive net income criterion. Two commenters stated that the requirement did not necessarily VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES54988 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations reflect the financial risk profile of a company because, for example, accounting losses, such as non-cash adjustments, could create negative net income for purposes of financial statements but not reflect the health of business operations. One of these commenters suggested that if the positive net income criterion were retained, PBGC should consider adjustments to reflect these unusual charges. PBGC did not revise this criterion in the final rule in response to the commenters' concerns about non-cash accounting losses. Net income measures the economic value a company creates over the measurement period, and a lack of net income is one indication of risk that a company may lack the resources to fulfill its obligations. Because non- cash losses (as well as non-cash gains) are components of such economic value, PBGC considers it appropriate not to exclude non-cash charges from the net- income criterion. The description of the net-income criterion in the 2013 proposal indicated that net income was to be measured under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) standards. PBGC included GAAP and IFRS in the 2013 proposal to provide rigorous and widely-used accounting standards for determining net income and because some companies may need to comply with IFRS as a result of the international scope of their operations. One commenter stated that because GAAP and IFRS are not compatible standards, two similarly situated companies might have different reporting requirements. PBGC has addressed this concern by eliminating the references to GAAP and IFRS in the final rule. Another commenter said that a company might not know net income for the prior fiscal year when an event occurs, making it impossible to determine whether the safe harbor was available. The final rule addresses this concern by providing that the low- default-risk safe harbor is satisfied on a financial information date (discussed above) rather than on a date an event occurs. One commenter said that the net- income criterion was unfair because it could not be satisfied by financially healthy companies in cyclical industries or companies that experience rare and significantly adverse events, such as a natural disaster. As also explained in Active Participant Reduction below, PBGC is not making special exceptions from the reporting obligations due to a natural disaster or other unusual event because such an occurrence can cause significant financial challenges to a company and raise concerns about its ability to meet future pension and other financial obligations. Similarly, PBGC believes that it would be inappropriate to provide an exclusion for companies in cyclical industries because a company at a low point in its income cycle may for just that reason be vulnerable to an event that would cause concern about meeting its pension obligations. Alerting PBGC to the possibility that a company may not be able to meet such obligations is exactly what the reportable events regulation is intended to do, regardless of what caused the default risk to rise. In any event, such a company might still be able to avail itself of the safe harbor by choosing another way of meeting the low-default-risk standard. One commenter objected to the application of the criterion to non- profits as inconsistent with the nature of non-profit organizations. PBGC disagrees. A non-profit may have positive net income that does not jeopardize its non-profit status, so long as the income is related to the non- profit's purpose and is not distributed to the non-profit's officers, directors, or others connected to the non-profit. In fact, many large non-profits with defined benefit plans, such as certain hospital systems, have substantial net income. Thus, PBGC does not view this criterion to be inconsistent with non- profit operating realities. Criteria Related to Loan Defaults and Missed Contributions The 2013 proposal contained two other financial soundness safe harbor criteria, which were intended to supplement and confirm the general picture of financial soundness painted by the satisfaction of the credit report test. These criteria were: For the past two years, the company had no missed contribution events, unless reporting was waived. For the past two years, the company had no loan default events, whether or not reporting was waived. Two commenters urged PBGC to disregard for purposes of the missed contribution criterion a missed contribution that occurred because of a missed or untimely funding balance election or because of a mandatory reduction of a funding standard carryover balance or prefunding balance. The latter can retroactively create a late quarterly contribution that may not be known of by the reporting deadline. As discussed in the Missed Contributions section below, the final rule includes a modification of the missed contribution event (which is the basis for the operation of this criterion) to excuse a missed timely funding balance election. PBGC did not make a similar change with respect to a mandatory reduction of a funding standard carryover balance or prefunding balance. The commenter who raised this issue acknowledged that such a situation should be a reportable event but expressed concern that a company should not be deprived of qualifying for the safe harbor for this reason alone. With the changes in the final rule that allow for more flexibility in meeting the low-default-risk safe harbor, a company that experiences a mandatory reduction in its funding balance can still qualify for the safe harbor by meeting another criterion. One of these commenters also requested that PBGC clarify that late contribution reporting under section 303(k) (for amounts over $1 million) would not be considered when making the determination of whether the criterion was met. PBGC declined to make this change. Having unpaid contributions exceeding $1 million is too serious a deficit to ignore and in PBGC's view, not consistent with adequate capacity to meet one's obligations. One commenter asked that PBGC make an exception to the no-loan- default criterion to excuse ''meaningless technical defaults'' that are not indicative of any financial challenges. As explained in detail in the Loan Default section, the final rule distinguishes between events of default (which can lead to substantial contractual remedies for a lender to protect its investment) and other circumstances (which may be violations of an agreement but do not trigger such remedies). New Criteria\u2014Ratios of Total-Debt-to- EBITDA and Retained-Earnings-to- Total-Assets In addition to giving companies the ability to satisfy the low-default-risk safe harbor by various combinations of criteria, the final rule includes two additional criteria available for companies to use. Both of these new criteria are financial metrics that are easily derived from standard financial information. One of these criteria is based on the ratio of total-debt-to-EBITDA. This ratio is commonly referred to as a leverage ratio and is used to assess a company's ability to meet its debt obligations. Companies with a ratio of total-debt-to- EBITDA of 3.0 or less correspond fairly closely with those that would satisfy the VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES54989 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 28See e.g., Table 3 in http://www.standardand poors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?articleType= HTML&assetID=1245329097686 . 29To underscore this point, PBGC is required under accounting rules to identify contingent liabilities on PBGC's financial statements in this manner. 30This safe harbor essentially restores a similar waiver under the old regulation, which waived notice for six events if no VRP was required to be paid for the plan for the event year. commercial measures criterion.28Thus, for the debt-to-EBITDA criterion to be satisfied, a company must have a ratio of total-debt-to-EBITDA of 3.0 or less. The other new criterion is based on the ratio of retained-earnings-to-total- assets. To satisfy this criterion, a company must have a ratio of retained- earnings-to-total-assets of 0.25 (one-to- four) or more. PBGC included this safe harbor criterion because it shows how much of a company's assets have been financed with the company's profits. In PBGC's experience, companies with high retained earnings tend to have higher profitability and/or a longer operating history that enables the accumulation of retained earnings\u2014 qualities that indicate the ability to meet financial obligations. Analysis of information available to PBGC suggests that companies that would meet the commercial measures criterion have an average ratio of retained-earnings-to- total-assets of at least 0.25. Well-Funded Plan Safe Harbor The old regulation had waivers based on several different measures of funded status, sometimes combined with other factors such as public company status. The 2013 proposal also used plan funding as a basis for relief from filing requirements, but with two different measures, both of which were to apply to the same five events as the company risk-based safe harbor (active participant reductions, substantial owner distributions, controlled group changes, extraordinary dividends, and benefit liabilities transfers). Reporting was to be waived if the plan was either fully funded on a termination basis or 120 percent funded on a premium basis (determined, in either case, using prior- year data). In the preamble to the 2013 proposal, PBGC explained that from its perspective, it is more appropriate to measure plan funding levels using termination-basis assumptions than ongoing-plan assumptions because termination liability is a better measure of the financial impact of plan termination on PBGC and participants. 29However, PBGC was aware that for plans, measuring funding on an ongoing-plan basis is more common because variable-rate premiums, required contributions, benefit restrictions, and annual funding notices are all based on ongoing-plan calculations. Thus, PBGC proposed both ways of meeting the safe harbor. To compensate for the different assumptions and timing that generally make termination liability higher than on-going plan liability, the 2013 proposal included a 20-percent cushion to make those two measures more nearly equivalent. Nine commenters on the 2013 proposal criticized the plan financial soundness safe harbor because the required funding ratios were unrealistically high. The commenters also generally opposed basing a safe harbor on termination-basis liability since few plans ordinarily make that determination. Three commenters also said that funding at 100 percent of termination liability could create a risk of excise tax liability. After consideration of the comments, PBGC is persuaded that a well-funded plan safe harbor based on termination- basis liability would be unnecessarily burdensome for most plans\u2014especially if the threshold remained at 100 percent\u2014and would give reporting relief to few plans. Thus, the final rule eliminates the test for the well-funded plan safe harbor based on termination- basis liability. PBGC is also persuaded that a well- funded plan safe harbor based on 120 percent funding on a premium basis is not helpful to most plans since plans are not likely to fund that high, despite PBGC's belief that such a level of funding would better reflect the risk to the pension insurance system. After considering various levels of funding as suggested by commenters, PBGC concluded that 100 percent funding\u2014 meaning a plan would pay no variable- rate-premium (VRP)\u2014is a realistic and reasonable goal and strikes an appropriate balance between the burden of reporting and PBGC's need for information to protect the pension insurance system. Thus, the well- funded plan safe harbor in the final rule applies if the plan owed no VRP for the plan year preceding the event year. 30 Plans exempt from the VRP (e.g., certain new plans) will qualify for the safe harbor regardless of their funding percentage. This safe harbor is less protective of the pension insurance system because, among other reasons, liabilities measured on an on-going basis are generally lower than liabilities measured on a termination basis, and for premium purposes, only vested liabilities are counted. Thus, PBGC anticipates that it will not receive some potentially useful reports. However, PBGC accepts this trade-off in the interest of addressing sponsor and plan concerns. The 2013 proposal looked to the VRP data for the year before the event year to determine whether a plan qualified for the safe harbor. One commenter suggested that PBGC allow plans that did not meet the test with prior year premium information to meet the test based on current year premium information, if available by the date an event occurs. Under this approach, a calendar-year plan with a reportable event in November 2014 could determine its eligibility for the waiver based on its 2014 VRP filing, instead of its 2013 VRP filing. After consideration of the comment, PBGC is not accepting this suggestion. PBGC does not want to lose reports from plans when funding improves without gaining reports from plans whose funding deteriorates. Yet PBGC does not want to require all plans to reassess qualification for the safe harbor when VRP data become available. Basing the safe harbor on prior year premium information keeps the safe harbor simple and predictable; plans will know for certain prior to year-end whether they will qualify for the safe harbor for the entire next plan year. The 2013 proposal gave small plans a filing extension\u2014for events to which this plan financial soundness safe harbor applied\u2014until one month after the prior year's premium filing due date (i.e., five months after the end of the prior year). PBGC's recent final rule on premiums (see 79 FR 13547, March 11, 2014), which advances the small-plan premium due date 6 12months, makes this extension unnecessary, and thus it is not included in the final reportable events regulation. Small-Plan Waivers The 2013 proposal included small- plan waivers for five events, as compared to two events under the old regulation. One commenter specifically commended PBGC for expanding the availability of small plan waivers. The final rule changes the small-plan category from fewer than 100 participants to 100 participants or fewer for consistency with PBGC's recent premium final rule. Otherwise, the small-plan waiver is unchanged from the 2013 proposal. Public Company Waiver The old regulation contained a limited public company waiver for reporting controlled group change and VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES54990 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 31See http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/form8- k.pdf. 32The exceptions for results of operations and financial statements fall under SEC Form 8-K Item 2.02 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) and Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits). The final rule's public company waiver includes these exceptions because disclosure of a reportable event under these items may be incidental to the event that requires SEC disclosure. For example, the release of results of operations may include a reference to a reportable event in the context of the overall business activities during a fiscal quarter. In such a case, PBGC believes the SEC disclosure often may be a passing reference with little information about the reportable event and likely made long after the event may have occurred. 33Information about these events is often filed on SEC Form 8-K under either Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure or Item 8.01 (Other Events) rather than under one of the specified disclosure items on SEC Form 8-K. Publicly-traded companies may also be subject to additional requirements to disclose events such as dividend transactions that are fulfilled through filing an 8-K report. For example, the New York Stock Exchange states that ''a listed company is expected to release quickly to the public any news or information which might reasonably be expected to materially affect the market for its securities'' and includes dividend announcements as an example of a news item that should be handled on an immediate release basis through SEC regulation FD disclosure. See Sections 202.05 and 06 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. http://nysemanual.nyse.com/lcm/ . PBGC anticipates that not all controlled group changes will be reported on SEC Form 8-K. See e.g., Item 2.01 (Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets). The requirement is only to disclose the completion of an acquisition or disposition of a significant amount of assets. 34Although such events may be disclosed in quarterly or annual SEC reports in financial statements, the disclosure would not be timely or provide adequate information for PBGC purposes. 35For instance, in one case, a company did not report the shutdown of one of its facilities in a March 2008 SEC filing. PBGC discovered the shutdown through a Form 10 filing and negotiated a settlement under ERISA section 4062(e) that resulted in a $400,000 contribution into the plan before the company filed bankruptcy and terminated the pension plan. 36SEC Form 8-K's Item 2.04 (Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement) requirement is only triggered if the consequences of the event are material to the registrant. 37Both types of waiver apply to controlled group change, liquidation, and extraordinary dividend; the foreign entity waiver also applies to loan default and bankruptcy. The foreign entity waiver is limited to entities that are not direct or indirect parents of contributing sponsors; discussion of the foreign-entity waiver in this preamble should be understood to incorporate this limitation. 38The waiver would use the ten percent standard for de minimis segments. For liquidation, loan default, and insolvency, the de minimis waiver is available only if the entity involved in the event was not a contributing sponsor. liquidation events. Reporting of these events was waived if the plan's contributing sponsor before the effective date of the transaction was a public company and the fair market value of the plan's assets was at least 80 percent of the plan's vested benefits amount. In the case of a liquidation event, the waiver applied only if each plan maintained by the liquidating member was maintained by another member of the plan's controlled group after the liquidation. The old regulation also contained an extension for public companies to report controlled group change, liquidation, and extraordinary dividend events until 30 days after the earlier of the first Form 10-Q filing deadline that occurred after the transaction or the date when a press release with respect to the transaction was issued. The 2013 proposal did not include a reporting waiver for public companies. One commenter urged PBGC to exempt public company sponsors from reportable events requirements entirely. This commenter asserted that because publicly-traded companies already report significant events on their SEC filings, there is no reason for them to provide duplicative filings to PBGC. In evaluating the commenter's suggestion, PBGC reviewed SEC reporting requirements and reportable event notices to determine the extent to which PBGC could get timely and relevant information from SEC filings that could substitute for reportable events filings. 31Based on this review, the final rule waives reporting where any contributing sponsor of the affected plan is a public company and the contributing sponsor timely files a SEC Form 8-K disclosing the event, except where such disclosure is under a SEC Form 8-K item relating primarily to results of operations or financial statements. 32This waiver applies to the same five events as the low-default-risk and well-funded plan safe harbors. PBGC found that SEC filings provide adequate and timely information to PBGC with respect to these events because they are either required to be reported under a specific Form 8-K item or because they are material information for investors. 33 The public company waiver does not apply to other events because PBGC found that for those events SEC filings would not necessarily provide adequate and timely information. For instance, SEC rules do not require specific reporting of ERISA events, such as an inability to pay benefits when due or a missed contribution, on SEC Form 8-K unless the events would be considered material to investor decisions, 34which often may not be the case for small plans sponsored by large companies. Yet these events may still pose a risk to the plan and the pension insurance system. 35 Similarly, corporate events such as loan default and liquidation events may not be disclosed in SEC filings because the information is not considered material to investors (and thus not required to be reported under SEC rules). 36Further, even if an event is disclosed in an SEC filing, the filing will likely not contain actuarial or other important information that would be included in a reportable events notice. These kinds of events present a high risk to the pension insurance system by their very nature and thus, timely and complete information on them is particularly important. There is no need for a public company waiver for the insolvency event in the final regulation (Bankruptcy or Similar Settlements under the old regulation), since the new event description excludes Bankruptcy Code filings, and public company insolvencies are handled through proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code. The public company waiver's requirement of actual disclosure (and not mere public company status) is consistent with the requirement of actual disclosure for public company extensions under the old regulation. Such extensions are no longer necessary because all public companies will be waived from reporting these events so long as the event is actually disclosed. Foreign Entity and De Minimis Waivers The old regulation provided reporting waivers for several events where the entity or entities involved in the event were foreign entities or represented a de minimis percentage of a controlled group. 37The 2013 proposal expanded the availability of those waivers to five events (extraordinary dividends, controlled group changes, insolvencies, liquidations, and loan defaults). 38The final rule's treatment of de minimis and foreign-entity waivers is unchanged from the 2013 proposal. With respect to de minimis waivers, one commenter requested that PBGC clarify whether an investment in a subsidiary is included in tangible or intangible assets, particularly in the case of shell companies whose only asset is the stock of a subsidiary, for purposes of determining whether the entity is de minimis. PBGC believes that treatment of stock in a subsidiary should be consistent with the regulatory and accounting requirements sponsors follow to prepare financial statements. Controlled Group Situations One commenter raised concerns about the difficulty in monitoring members of complex controlled groups for reportable events, particularly for the VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 RULES54991 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 39See 78 FR 20047-8. 40This commenter suggested that the preamble to the 2013 proposal downplayed the significance of reportable events on loan covenants and loan defaults. The commenter estimates that five to ten percent of its time is spent monitoring and revising corporate events to avoid reporting. 41This commenter also stated at the hearing that one of its members would have faced bankruptcy proceedings unless it was able to renegotiate its credit agreement to include a material adverse effect clause to a provision that required the absence of a reportable events filing. The commenter indicated that the sponsor was successful in this effort. five reportable events that involve reporting at the controlled group level rather than the plan level: Controlled group changes, liquidation, loan defaults, extraordinary dividends, and insolvency events. The commenter stated that complicated controlled group situations require significant coordination across plan sponsors and controlled group members to gather information and test the various reporting waivers. Some commenters suggested that the proposal was unclear about whether the sponsor safe harbor tests had to be met by all controlled group members. Similar issues existed under the old regulation. Nonetheless, the final rule makes changes from the proposal to addresses these concerns and minimizes burden for plans that experience events involving controlled groups in a number of ways. The final rule: Includes public company waivers for five events. Clarifies that the company low- default-risk safe harbor (which also applies to controlled group changes and extraordinary dividends) requires satisfaction by a contributing sponsor and the highest level U.S. parent of the contributing sponsor, not by the whole controlled group or by the contributing sponsor or highest level U.S. parent alone. Provides that satisfaction of the low-default-risk safe harbor is based on a single point in time during an annual financial cycle rather than determination after each of one or more events during a year. Besides those changes in the final rule, the exclusion of proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code from the insolvency event description in the final rule (as in the 2013 proposal) will obviate most reporting of insolvency cases that involve controlled groups, since most such companies will go through federal bankruptcy proceedings in the event of insolvency. The final regulation (like the proposal) provides relief from monitoring smaller controlled group members (through the de minimis 10- percent segment waivers) and all foreign controlled group members that are not parent entities. The inclusion of a small- plan waiver for the controlled group change event also provides relief in this regard. PBGC believes these exceptions will alleviate the need to monitor the controlled group members that are potentially the most difficult to track. In addition, PBGC expects that many smaller controlled group members typically will not undergo loan default events because their debt levels will not meet the $10 million reporting threshold. Thus, PBGC determined that no further changes in the final regulation were necessary to address concerns about controlled group monitoring. Effect of Proposal on Loan Agreements As discussed in the 2013 proposal, PBGC reviewed loan agreements to better understand the concerns of commenters on the 2009 proposal about the effect of the proposal on loan agreements. 39Based on this review, PBGC concluded that the elimination of reporting waivers would not adversely affect most plan sponsors with loan agreements. Further, PBGC was not aware of any instance where filing notice of a reportable event caused a lender to declare a default. PBGC believes that if a lender were to declare a default it would be because the underlying event indicated a deterioration in the debtor's financial situation. PBGC sought further feedback from the public on this issue in the 2013 proposal and asked that commenters provide copies of relevant loan agreements and information about the number and circumstances of plan sponsors that have experienced default or suffered other adverse consequences related to loan agreements as a result of a reportable event. No such documentation was received. One commenter on the 2013 proposal said that since the 2009 proposal, many companies already have renegotiated agreements to provide that the occurrence of a reportable event that is not automatically waived is an event of default only if the event could result in a certain amount of financial liability or could have a material adverse effect on the borrower. But the commenter went on to say that a material adverse effect clause does not provide clarity as to when the clause actually has been or could be triggered. A second commenter, while agreeing with PBGC that in most cases, a non-waived reportable event will not result in an automatic default, said it is the creditor who determines whether the event results in material adverse effect. 40Both commenters suggested that lenders may try to renegotiate agreements under the pretext that a reportable event had resulted in (or could have) a material adverse effect on the borrower, which would be time consuming and costly and could force the borrower to accept unfavorable terms. Two commenters urged PBGC to retain the old reportable events regulation because companies have taken the regulation's provisions into account in contracting with not only lenders but also with employee benefit plan investors (who invest in swaps and futures agreements). 41However, the old regulation has been unchanged since 1997, when the economy, defined benefit pension plans and the pension insurance program looked very different than they do today. Based on more than 15 years of experience with the old regulation, PBGC has found that the regulation is not effective in providing timely reports for plans that pose the most risk to the pension insurance system. Moreover, reportable events notices are designed to give PBGC notices of events that could impair the payment of a debt (i.e., a pension obligation). If a lender invokes a material adverse effect clause as a result of a reportable event, it is because the lender has concerns that the event will impair the company's ability to pay on the loan, not because the event is reported to PBGC. In other words, a company's lender's concerns in this regard and PBGC's concerns are likely to be congruent. Although PBGC's understanding of the impact of the regulation on loan agreements has not changed, PBGC believes that the changes made in this final rule should assuage commenters' concerns in this area. The final rule provides more waivers than under the 2013 proposal. PBGC anticipates that about 94 percent of plans covered by PBGC will qualify for at least one waiver under the active participant reduction, controlled group change, extraordinary dividend, benefit liability transfer, and substantial owner distribution event provisions. Along with missed contribution events (which PBGC does not expect to be reported in greater numbers under the final rule), these five events accounted for over 90% of filings between 2012 and 2014. Thus, with more waivers covering the most common events, sponsors will be better off under the new regulation than under the old regulation, and PBGC expects an overall net reduction in reporting under the final rule (see discussion in Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 and Paperwork Reduction Act), and an VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 RULES54992 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 42When credit and investment agreements are renegotiated, borrowers might be able to address uncertainty raised by having material adverse effect clauses by negotiating a dollar figure threshold that would trigger an event of default. 43See PBGC guidance on disaster relief at http:// www.pbgc.gov/res/other-guidance/dr.html . 44Such required contributions include quarterly contributions under ERISA section 303(j)(3) and Code section 430(j)(3), liquidity shortfall contributions under ERISA section 303(j)(4) and increase in the reporting of events that are a true concern to the pension insurance system. In addition, the deferral of the applicability date for the final regulation should give plan sponsors time to consult with loan providers about appropriate amendments to loan agreements, which, as mentioned by the commenter referred to above, companies appear already to be doing. 42 Descriptions of Events Under the Final Rule The next sections of the preamble address specific event descriptions, which can impact reporting requirements in much the same way as waivers. The final rule follows the 2013 proposal that reporting of an insolvency event is required only when a member of a plan's controlled group is involved in insolvency proceedings that are not under the federal Bankruptcy Code) and makes no changes in event descriptions that were not addressed in the 2013 proposal. Active Participant Reduction Under ERISA section 4043(c)(3), in general, a reportable active participant reduction occurs when the number of active participants is reduced below 80 percent of the number at the beginning of the year or below 75 percent of the number at the beginning of the prior year. Creeping losses of active participants may cross the two percentage thresholds at different times in one year. The 2009 proposal added a reporting waiver to limit reporting to once a year on the premise that PBGC would monitor for at least a year any plan that reported an active participant reduction. The 2013 proposal introduced a new approach to reporting active participant reductions. It distinguished between rapid reductions\u2014which would have to be reported immediately\u2014and slower reductions attributable to attrition\u2014 which would have to be tested for and reported only once a year. This approach addressed a comment on the 2009 proposal requesting relief from the need to monitor constantly for creeping active participant reductions that might exceed one of the percentage thresholds. Because the attrition event can occur only once a year, PBGC eliminated the 2009 proposal's waiver from reporting subsequent active participant reduction event notices after the first such event in the same year was reported. PBGC reasoned that quick drops in the number of active participants should be easy to spot without exercising unusual vigilance. Under the 2013 proposal, a ''quick'' active participant reduction event would occur when the reporting threshold was crossed either within a single 30-day period (a short-period event) or as a result of a single cause (a single-cause event), such as the discontinuance of an operation, a natural disaster, a reorganization, a mass layoff, or an early retirement incentive program. An attrition event would occur if the active participant count at the end of a plan year fell below one of the percentage thresholds. A 120-day reporting extension beyond the end of the year would provide time to count active participants. The final rule generally tracks the 2013 proposal but eliminates the short- period event (as one commenter requested), lengthens the reporting extension for attrition events, and makes some minor editorial changes for clarification. PBGC concluded that the burden of monitoring for short-period events would outweigh the value of short-period event reports, since most short-period events would likely also be either single-cause events or eventually captured in an attrition-event filing. In addition, PBGC decided to extend the reporting deadline for attrition events until the premium due date for the plan year following the event year. Two commenters requested reinstatement of the waiver of reporting more than once a year from the 2009 proposal, or clarification of when more frequent reporting would be required. As explained above, the ''once-a-year'' waiver is no longer necessary for creeping active participant losses because the attrition event can arise only once a year. And after consideration, PBGC has concluded that it cannot adequately monitor plans for multiple rapid active participant reduction events in the same year. Further, two or more distinct events in the same year could signal extreme financial distress that merit timely reporting to PBGC. Thus the ''once-a- year'' waiver is not in the final rule. Two commenters suggested exempting frozen plans from the active participant reduction event or waiving reporting unless plan liabilities increased (as from a triggering of shut- down benefits). PBGC has not adopted these suggestions. Although the active participant reduction event may be more easily triggered for a frozen plan, such plans can pose just as much risk to the pension insurance system as plans that are not frozen. One commenter asked for a waiver or extension of the requirement to report active participant reductions caused by natural disasters. The issue here would appear to apply equally to all reportable events, but even limiting the proposal to the active participant reduction event, PBGC is concerned that the occurrence of a disaster may increase, rather than obviate, the importance of timely reporting because a natural disaster may have a lasting negative impact on the ability of a business to continue operating. Thus, PBGC is providing no special rules for disasters in the final rule. Note, however, that in appropriate cases, PBGC issues disaster relief notices that provide temporary relief from reporting requirements. 43Case-by- case waivers and extensions are also available. One commenter wanted PBGC to waive reporting of active participant reductions due to spinoffs within a controlled group. PBGC sees no more reason to waive reporting where there is an intra-group spinoff than where there is no spinoff. The loss of active participants is of concern itself, regardless of cause. Further, such a spin-off may be a precursor to the transfer of benefit liabilities outside the controlled group. Accordingly, no such waiver is provided in the final rule, though case-by-case waivers are available. Finally, this commenter also questioned the utility of reports of active participant reduction events, suggesting that PBGC is unaffected by active participant reductions and takes no action on a report of such an event unless accompanied by some other event. PBGC disagrees with this assessment. Notices of active participant reductions (which often result from business restructurings) give PBGC a chance to intervene to protect plan assets when a restructuring fails and plan termination becomes a significant possibility. Missed Contributions Under the old regulation (\u00a7 4043.25), a missed contribution event occurs when a plan sponsor fails to make any required plan contribution by its due date. The final rule (like the 2009 and 2013 proposals) clarifies the language in \u00a7 4043.25. This reportable event does not apply only to contributions required by statute, 44but also to contributions VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 RULES54993 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations Code section 430(j)(4), and contributions to amortize funding waivers under ERISA section 303(e) and Code section 430(e). 45Such ''non-statutory'' contributions are not taken into account under ERISA section 303(k) and Code section 430(k), dealing with liens that arise because of large missed contributions, and are therefore disregarded under \u00a7 4043.81, which implements those provisions. However, violating the conditions of a funding waiver typically means that contributions that were waived become retroactively due and unpaid and are counted for purposes of \u00a7 4043.81. 46See similar language in SEC Form 8-K Item 1.01 used to define a material definitive agreement. required as a condition of a funding waiver that do not fall within the statutory provisions on waiver amortization charges. 45The final rule (like the 2013 proposal) includes waivers for this event for a missed contribution made up within 30 days after its due date and for small plans that miss quarterly contributions. One commenter suggested that PBGC add a waiver for contributions missed solely because of a failure to timely make a funding balance election. The final rule adds a waiver for a missed contribution where the failure to timely make the contribution is due solely to the plan sponsor's failure to timely make a funding balance election. The final rule also clarifies a technical point from the 2013 proposal. The requirement to submit a reportable event notice for a missed contribution is satisfied by submission of Form 200 for the same event. However, reliance on Form 200 to satisfy the reportable event filing requirement does not transform Form 200 into a reportable event notice. Thus, the final rule makes clear that a Form 200 filing is not protected by the non-disclosure provisions of ERISA section 4043(f). Inability To Pay Benefits When Due In general, a reportable event occurs when a plan fails to make a benefit payment timely or when a plan's liquid assets fall below the level needed for paying benefits for six months. The old regulation excuses failure to pay due to inability to locate the payee or any other administrative delay of less than two months (or two benefit payment periods). In reviewing the proposed rule, PBGC concluded that it would be unfair to require a plan to report an inability to pay benefits when due simply because (despite the diligence called for by the fiduciary standards) a payee could not be located within the prescribed time limit. Accordingly, the final rule clarifies that the time limit does not apply to delay in paying a missing payee. Other administrative delays are excused only to the extent they do not exceed the prescribed time limit. Distribution to Substantial Owner Under the old regulation, distributions to substantial owners generally were required to be reported if the total distributions to an owner exceeded $10,000 in a year, unless the plan was fully funded for nonforfeitable benefits. The 2013 proposal limited the event to circumstances where the distributions to one substantial owner exceeded one percent of plan assets or the distributions to all substantial owners exceeded five percent of plan assets. In addition, PBGC proposed to limit reporting for a distribution in the form of an annuity to one notice, which would satisfy all future reporting requirements for the annuity so long as the annuity did not increase. Once notified that an annuity was being paid to a substantial owner, PBGC would need no further notices that the annuity was continuing to be paid. One commenter asked PBGC to exclude from reporting payments made to comply with the minimum required distribution rules of Code section 401(a)(9), which might involve an increasing annuity if the substantial owner were still working and accruing benefits but required to take minimum distributions. In response, the final rule provides that reporting for distributions in the form of annuities is required only once, without the limitation that the annuity be non-increasing. Controlled Group Change Under \u00a7 4043.29 (both in the old regulation and the new regulation), a reportable event occurs for a plan when there is a transaction that results, or will result, in one or more persons' ceasing to be members of a plan's controlled group. For this purpose, the term ''transaction'' includes a written or unwritten legally binding agreement to transfer ownership or an actual transfer or change of ownership. (A transaction is not reportable if it will result solely in a reorganization involving a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization, however effected.) One commenter to the 2013 proposal raised concerns that elimination of the waivers for this event under the old regulation (which the 2013 proposal replaced with other waivers) would require significant monitoring of every transaction in which any controlled group member engages throughout the year and analysis of each such transaction to determine whether reporting is required. This commenter further asserted that the 2013 proposal would add significant administrative burdens without a corresponding increase in the security of the pension insurance system and urged PBGC to restore the funding and public company waivers that applied under the old regulation. PBGC has addressed this concern with the final rule's inclusion of the small plan and public company waivers, without regard to plan funding status. See the discussion above in the sections Public Company Waiver and Controlled Group Situations. The 2013 proposal deleted the example in \u00a7 4043.29(e)(3) of the old regulation that indicated that a reportable event occurred when a member of a controlled group ceased to exist upon being merged into another member in the course of a reorganization. However, this point was not made clearly by the language in \u00a7 4043.29(a) describing the event. The final rule adds language further clarifying that a controlled group member's ceasing to exist because of a merger into another member of the group is not a reportable event. Like the 2013 proposal, the final rule provides that whether an agreement is legally binding is to be determined without reference to any conditions in the agreement. For this purpose, a legally binding agreement means an agreement that provides for obligations that are material to and enforceable by and against the parties to the agreement, regardless of whether any conditions of the agreement have been met or satisfied (in other words, an agreement does not fail to be legally binding solely because it is subject to conditions that have not been performed). 46Example 2 in the regulatory text has been modified to make clear when the filing is triggered. The provisions on controlled group change events are otherwise unchanged from the 2013 proposal. Extraordinary Dividends Under the old regulation, an extraordinary dividend or stock redemption occurred when a member of a plan's controlled group declared a distribution (a dividend or stock redemption) that alone or in combination with previous distributions exceeded a level specified in the regulation. The 2013 proposal eliminated much of the computational detail that the old regulation prescribed for determining whether a reportable event had occurred by providing that the computations be done in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Although PBGC did not receive comments on the 2013 proposal for this event, PBGC decided to include in the VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 RULES54994 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 47Under Code section 414(l), transfers of liabilities must be covered by assets. In most cases of liabilities transfers, assets from the transferor plan also will be transferred to the transferee plan, which would reduce the amount of assets in the transferor plan and may affect its funded percentage. 48PBGC is requiring reporting of risk transfers on premium forms, starting with filings for plan years beginning in 2015. See http://www.pbgc.gov/Documents/2015-Premium-Payment- Instructions.pdf. final rule a waiver for public companies from reporting extraordinary dividends and stock redemptions, as discussed above under Public Company Waiver. Transfer of Benefit Liabilities The reportable events regulation requires reporting to PBGC when, in any 12-month period, three percent or more of a plan's benefit liabilities are transferred to a person outside the transferor plan's controlled group or to a plan or plans maintained by a person or persons outside the transferor plan's controlled group. Transfers of benefit liabilities are of concern to PBGC because they may reduce the transferor plan's funded percentage 47and because the transferee may be a higher default risk than the transferor. Both the 2009 and 2013 proposals clarified that satisfaction of a plan's benefit liabilities through the payment of a lump sum or the purchase of an irrevocable commitment to provide an annuity would not constitute a transfer of benefit liabilities that must be reported under the regulation. In the preamble to the 2013 proposal (78 FR at 20050), PBGC stated it had concluded that such transfers need not be reported because the provisions in section 436 of the Code and section 206(g) of ERISA (as added by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA)) prohibit or limit cashouts and annuitizations by significantly underfunded plans. In addition, since cashouts and annuitizations do not involve benefit liabilities transferring to another plan, PBGC reasoned there would be no concern about a transferee plan's financial health. One commenter on the 2013 proposal opposed the exclusion of lump sums and annuity purchases from the reporting requirement. This commenter suggested that cash-outs or annuitizations on a large scale, sometimes referred to as de-risking or risk transfers, presage the decline of the defined benefit pension plan system. This commenter stated PBGC could gather information that might lead to regulatory or statutory protection for participants impacted by these types of transactions. During the hearing on the 2013 proposal, however, all of the co- panelists of this commenter expressed opposite views. PBGC shares concerns about the potential impact of cashouts and annuitizations on a large scale on retirement security, including concerns that some of these transactions may leave a plan underfunded or effectively be part of a standard termination without meeting the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements (including reporting to PBGC and disclosure to participants). PBGC also recognizes that such transactions may create burdens on individuals whose options to obtain lifetime income in retirement are limited or who may not have the resources or experience to manage lump sum distributions in a way that replicates the professional investment management (with the associated fiduciary responsibilities) of defined benefit plan assets. PBGC notes, however, that few companies would be subject to advance reporting of such transactions, thus severely limiting the utility of such reporting, as compared to its burden. Therefore, PBGC is not adopting the commenter's suggestion in this final rule. Accordingly, the final rule retains the treatment of lump sum distributions and annuity purchases from the proposals. Nevertheless, PBGC believes there are ways to address the commenter's concerns. PBGC believes it has useful tools to monitor and analyze trends (e.g., Form 5500 and premium filings) as well as tools to provide education and outreach to participants, and is carefully considering how best to do so. 48 Loan Default Under the old regulation, a loan default reportable event occurred, with respect to a loan with an outstanding balance of $10 million or more to any member of a plan's controlled group, when a loan payment was more than 30 days late (10 days in the case of advance reporting), when the lender accelerated the loan, or when there was a written notice of default based on a drop in cash reserves, an unusual or catastrophic event, or the debtor's persistent failure to meet agreed-on performance levels. PBGC believes that the significance of both potential and actual loan defaults on such large loans is so great that reporting should not be restricted to the current list of reporting triggers. Rather, PBGC believes that not only any default on a loan of $10 million or more\u2014even a default on a loan within a controlled group\u2014but waivers and amendments of loan covenants that are made to avoid a default (to keep the loan arrangement functioning) may reflect financial difficulty and pose serious challenges for the pension insurance system. Accordingly, in the 2013 proposal PBGC expanded the definition of the loan default event. Under the 2013 proposal, a reportable event would occur if a member of a plan's controlled group had an outstanding loan balance of $10 million or more and\u2014 There was an acceleration of payment or a default under the loan agreement, or The lender waived or agreed to an amendment of any covenant in the loan agreement for the purpose of avoiding a default. These changes were to apply for both post-event notices and advance notices. In the preamble to the 2013 proposal, PBGC stated its belief that the reporting requirement for loan defaults under the proposed rule would be comparable to what a typical creditor would require of a borrower to monitor the ability of the borrower to meet its obligations under the loan agreement. PBGC sought the views of the public on specific issues dealing with loan defaults, including how PBGC might better replicate reporting of information to creditors and whether there is a category of ''technical'' defaults that should not be reportable events. One commenter was concerned that the proposal would require PBGC to determine a plan sponsor's intent behind a waiver or amendment and was not sure how such intent could be determined. To address this comment, the final rule replaces words ''for the purpose of avoiding a default'' in the 2013 proposal with the words ''the effect of which is to cure or avoid a breach that would trigger a default.'' This commenter also said that the scope of the proposed expansion of the event definition was too broad, especially for public companies that might face SEC disclosure issues. The commenter urged PBGC to modify the proposal to require the reporting of an amendment or waiver only to ''material financial covenants,'' and not all covenants (e.g., non-financial covenants such as compliance with ERISA and similar laws). Another commenter, in responding to the proposed loan default criterion of the sponsor financial soundness safe harbor, was also concerned that the proposed rule's description of the loan default event was too broad because so-called meaningless ''technical defaults'' that are waived by a lender and are not indicative of financial stress would be reported. Other than these comments, PBGC did not receive feedback on loan default concerns. After reviewing the comments and further analysis of typical loan VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES54995 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 49Several other PBGC regulations also refer to plan funding concepts using citations outmoded by PPA: The regulations on Filing, Issuance, Computation of Time, and Record Retention (29 CFR part 4000); Terminology (29 CFR part 4001); Variances for Sale of Assets (29 CFR part 4204); Adjustment of Liability for a Withdrawal Subsequent to a Partial Withdrawal (29 CFR part 4206); and Mergers and Transfers Between Multiemployer Plans (29 CFR part 4231). Thus, these regulations must also be revised to be consistent with ERISA and the Code as amended by PPA and with the revised premium regulations. The final rule makes the necessary conforming revisions, as proposed. 50See 79 FR 13547 (March 11, 2014). 51Although changes to the paperwork would not have to go through notice and comment rulemaking, they would still have to be reviewed by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, which typically requires two public notices and a total of 90 days for submission of public comments. agreement provisions, PBGC has decided to not make further changes to the event description in response to comments. Covenants that are tied to event-of-default triggers are put into loan agreements because lenders believe that failure to comply with such covenants is significant and serves as an early indicator that a company may be experiencing financial difficulties resulting in its inability to pay its debts on time and in full. Distinctions should be made between a breach of any covenant in a loan agreement and a breach of a particular covenant that gives rise to a possible event-of-default trigger. The former may cover the kinds of minor loan agreement violations of the kind the commenter who asked that ''technical defaults'' of loan agreements be excluded from reporting under the regulation. The latter are those types of breaches (e.g., non-payment, failure to meet a financial ratio, or failure to provide some important information) that the parties to the loan agreement have agreed are serious enough to undermine the loan agreement arrangement. Under the final regulation, PBGC will act as any another creditor would by requiring reporting of all incidents within the expanded scope of the loan default event. If a sponsor believes that an event triggering the loan default reporting requirement does not reflect financial difficulty or the ability of the sponsor to meet its pension obligations, PBGC will consider a request for a case-by-case waiver. The final rule makes one other change to this event from the 2013 proposal. The final rule deletes a paragraph from the old regulation on the notice date for payment acceleration or loan default that referred to ''other conditions'' for such occurrences to be reportable. Because the provisions concerning ''other conditions'' are eliminated (following the 2013 proposal), this paragraph is no longer necessary. Form 200 Reporting One commenter suggested that PBGC allow for simplified reporting for Form 200 filings in limited situations, such as when the missed contribution has been made up by the filing due date and the plan has not missed any other contributions within a certain period of time. PBGC thought this was a good suggestion. Accordingly, under the final rule, if a plan sponsor makes up a missed contribution by the Form 200 notice due date, and the sponsor has not missed any other required contributions during the two-year period ending on the Form 200 notice due date, the plan may file the Form 200 notice without any of the attachments (e.g., controlled group listing and company financial statements) otherwise required by the Form 200 and instructions. Other Topics Under the Final Rule Advance Reporting In general, reportable events must be reported to PBGC within 30 days after they occur. But section 4043(b) of ERISA requires advance reporting by a contributing sponsor for certain reportable events if a ''threshold test'' is met, unless the contributing sponsor or controlled group member to which an event relates is a public company. The advance reporting threshold test is based on the aggregate funding level of plans maintained by the contributing sponsor and members of the contributing sponsor's controlled group. The funding level criteria are expressed by reference to calculated values that are used to determine VRPs under section 4006 of ERISA. PPA changed the plan funding rules in Title I of ERISA and in the Code and amended the VRP provisions of section 4006 of ERISA to conform to the changes in the funding rules. The final rule, like the prior proposals, conforms the regulation to the changes made under PPA. 49 The regulatory language under the final rule is slightly modified to conform to changes made in a recent final rule on PBGC premiums under which small plans generally calculate the VRP using data from the plan year preceding the premium payment year, a requirement referred to as the ''look- back rule.'' 50Thus, the reportable events final rule clarifies that the VRP data used for this advance reporting test are not the data for the prior year, but the data used to determine the VRP for the prior year. There is no change in the final rule from the 2013 proposal that eliminated advance-notice extensions for loan default and voluntary insolvency events. (The notice date of an event where insolvency proceedings are filed against a debtor by someone outside the plan's controlled group is extended to 10 days after proceedings begin). Thus, under the final rule, the due date for these events is the same as for other reportable events subject to the advance- notice requirements (i.e., 30 days prior to the event). Forms and Instructions PBGC issues three reporting forms for use under the reportable events regulation. Form 10 is for post-event reporting under subpart B of the regulation; Form 10-Advance is for advance reporting under subpart C of the regulation; and Form 200 is for reporting under subpart D of the regulation. Failure to report is subject to penalties under section 4071 of ERISA. The final rule eliminates some of the documentation that was required to be submitted with notices of two reportable events under the old regulation, but also requires that filers submit with notices of most events some information that is typically requested by PBGC after notices are reviewed. The final rule also requires the use of prescribed reportable events forms and moves from the regulation to the forms and instructions the lists of information items that must be reported. Three commenters expressed concern about moving the information requirements from the regulation to the forms and instructions because public input on any changes might be limited; one of these commenters said that Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) notices are easy to miss. PBGC does not agree. PBGC posts all pending PRA submissions on its Web site at http://www.pbgc.gov/res/laws- and-regulations/information- collections-under-omb-review.html. Interested persons can sign up for notifications of new postings through PBGC's Web site at http://www.pbgc.gov/res/res/stay- informed.html. PBGC observes that the public was provided an opportunity to comment on the forms and instructions in connection with the 2013 proposal and PBGC received only one substantive comment (noted below). Moving the information requirements to the forms and instructions will allow PBGC to be more flexible in responding to future developments, such as changes in information technology. 51 One commenter felt that the 2013 proposal dramatically increased the information required to be initially reported. As explained in the 2013 VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES54996 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations 52See 78 FR 20052-3. proposal (78 FR 20051), PBGC acknowledges that initial information requirements generally will increase. However, the total amount of information submitted to PBGC (including both initial reports and follow-up information requested by PBGC) generally will not increase, and providing information all at one time is more efficient than doing so in multiple installments. Further, by requiring more information with the initial filing, the new requirements will allow PBGC to intervene to protect plans and participants more quickly in appropriate circumstances. Mandatory Electronic Filing The final rule, like the 2009 and 2013 proposals, requires electronic filing of reportable events notices. This requirement is part of PBGC's ongoing implementation of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. Filers are permitted to email filings with attachments using any one or more of a variety of electronic formats that PBGC is capable of reading as provided in the instructions on PBGC's Web site. (PBGC accepts imaged signatures for filings.) PBGC may consider other E-filing enhancements, such as a Web-based filing application for reportable events similar to the applications for PBGC's section 4010 and premium filings, as internet capabilities and standards change. Such developments would be reflected in PBGC's reportable events e- filing instructions. PBGC sought public comment on its proposal to require electronic filing. One commenter favored electronic reporting while two others requested a paper filing option. In view of the fact that all plans subject to the reportable events regulation must file Form 5500 and PBGC premiums electronically, a paper option within the regulation for the occasional reportable event notice seems unnecessary. However, PBGC may grant case-by-case waivers of the electronic filing requirement. Other Changes The final rule makes a change to \u00a7 4043.20 that was not included in the 2013 proposal to clarify that the responsibility for a failure to file a reportable event notice if there is a change in plan sponsor or plan administrator lies with the person who is the plan administrator or contributing sponsor of the plan on the due date. Without this change, if there were a change in plan administrator or sponsor after a notice had been filed but before the due date, the new plan administrator or sponsor would be required to file another notice. A similar change is made to \u00a7 4043.61(a) with respect to a change in a contributing sponsor and the responsibility to file advance-notice reports. The final rule also makes applicable to the regulation generally a provision\u2014 limited to one event in the old regulation\u2014waiving reporting for statutory reportable events outside the scope of the reportable events described in the regulation. This provision has been reworded and moved from \u00a7 4043.31(c)(1) (dealing with extraordinary dividends) to \u00a7 4043.4(e) (dealing with waivers generally). The 2013 proposal made other technical changes that are retained in the final rule. 52 Summary Chart The following tables summarize waiver and safe harbor provisions for reportable events for which post-event reporting is required. The first table shows waivers and safe harbors available under this final rule, and the second table shows a comparison of such provisions between the old regulation and this final rule. As explained in detail above, the final rule also provides reporting relief\u2014like the relief provided by waivers\u2014through changes to the definitions of certain reportable events, including substantial owner distributions and active participant reductions and through the requirement for filing only once a plan year for active participant reductions that occur by attrition.

The one-percent threshold echoes the waiver for this event nnder the old regulation but that was eliminate in the fmal rule. 54999 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES Events with limited or no safe harbors Event Waivers under old regulation Safe Harbors under final rule Bankruptcy/ Member in bankruptcy is non-parent foreign entity (regardless of size) Event revised to exclude Bankruptcy Code cases .

Applicability The changes to Part 4043 made by this final rule are applicable to post-event reports for reportable events occurring on or after January 1, 2016, and to advance reports due on or after that date. Regulatory Procedures Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 PBGC has determined that this rule is a ''significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. The Office of Management and Budget has therefore reviewed this rule under Executive Order 12866. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 require that a comprehensive regulatory impact analysis be performed for any economically significant regulatory action, defined as an action that would result in an annual effect of $100 million or more on the national economy or that have other substantial impacts. In accordance with OMB Circular A-4, PBGC has examined the economic and policy implications of this rule and has concluded that the action's benefits justify its costs. As discussed above, some reportable events present little or no risk to the pension insurance system\u2014where, for example, the plan sponsor presents a low risk of default and the risk of plan termination is correspondingly low. Reports of such events are unnecessary in the sense that PBGC typically reviews but takes no action on them. PBGC analyzed 2013 records to determine how many such reports it received for events to which the proposed sponsor safe harbor would apply, then reanalyzed the data to see how many unnecessary reports would have been received if the plan sponsor safe harbor in the proposed rule had been in effect (that is, excluding reports that would have been waived under the plan sponsor safe harbor test). 56It found that the proportion of unnecessary filings would be much lower under the final regulation than under the old regulation\u20149 percent (19 filings) compared to 50 percent (215 filings). Such improved efficiency will be reflected in dramatically reduced regulatory burden on sponsors and plans that satisfy the risk-based safe harbors. Further, PBGC estimates that the number of total filings will be reduced under the final regulation. Fewer unnecessary reports means a more efficient reporting system and a greater proportion of filings that present the opportunity for increased plan protection through monitoring and possible intervention in transactions based on risk, leading to better protection for the pension insurance system and retirement security generally. Using data from 2013, PBGC has estimated the benefit of better-targeted reporting under the new regulation in terms of the value of early intervention as a creditor where a reportable event may foreshadow sponsor default. Early intervention as a creditor leads to higher recoveries of plan underfunding. PBGC estimates that the value of early intervention would exceed the dollar equivalent of the increased burden associated with the higher rate of targeted reporting by approximately $4.3 million. Under Section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866, a regulatory action is economically significant if ''it is likely to result in a rule that may . . . [h]ave an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.'' PBGC has determined that this final rule does not cross the $100 million threshold for economic significance and is not otherwise economically significant. This action is associated with retrospective review and analysis in PBGC's Plan for Regulatory Review issued in accordance with Executive Order 13563 on ''Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review.'' Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act imposes certain requirements with respect to rules that are subject to the notice and comment requirements of section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act and that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Unless an agency determines that a rule is not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that the agency present an initial regulatory flexibility analysis at the time of the publication of the proposed rule describing the impact of the rule on small entities and seeking public comment on such impact. Small entities include small businesses, organizations and governmental jurisdictions. For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act requirements with respect to the proposed amendments to the reportable events regulation, PBGC considers a small entity to be a plan with fewer than 100 participants. This is the same criterion used to determine the availability of the ''small plan'' waiver, and is consistent with certain requirements in Title I of ERISA 57and the Code,58as well as the definition of a small entity that the Department of Labor (DOL) has used for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 59Using this definition, about 64 percent (14,349 of 22,344) of plans covered by Title IV of ERISA in 2014 were small plans. 60 Further, while some large employers may have small plans, in general most small plans are maintained by small employers. Thus, PBGC believes that assessing the impact of the final rule on small plans is an appropriate substitute for evaluating the effect on small entities. The definition of small entity considered appropriate for this purpose differs, however, from a definition of small business based on size standards promulgated by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.201) pursuant to the Small Business Act. PBGC requested comments on the appropriateness of the size standard used in evaluating the impact on small entities of the proposed amendments to the reportable events regulation. PBGC received no comments in response to this request. On the basis of its definition of small entity, PBGC certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) that the amendments in this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, as provided in section 605 VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES55001 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), sections 603 and 604 do not apply. This certification is based on the fact that the reportable events regulation requires only the filing of one-time notices on the occurrence of unusual events that affect only certain plans and that the economic impact of filing is not significant. The average burden of submitting a notice\u2014based on the estimates discussed under Paperwork Reduction Act, below\u2014is less than 5 12hours and $745 (virtually the same as under the old regulation). Paperwork Reduction Act PBGC is submitting the information collection requirements under this rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act. There are two information collections under part 4043, approved under OMB control number 1212-0013 (covering subparts B and C), which expires May 31, 2018, and OMB control number 1212-0041 (covering subpart D), which expires June 30, 2018. PBGC is making the following changes to these information requirements that were approved by OMB: PBGC's experience is that in order to assess the significance of virtually every post-event filing for a missed contribution, inability to pay benefits, loan default, liquidation, or insolvency, it must obtain from the filer certain actuarial, financial and controlled group information. Filers were previously required to submit some of this information for some events, but PBGC has made its information collection for all these events more uniform. Accordingly, in connection with the final rule, PBGC now requires that every post-event filing for one of these events include the following financial and controlled group information (actuarial information was already required): 1. The financial information required will be copies of audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year. (If audited statements were not immediately available, copies of unaudited financial statements (if available) or tax returns would be required, to be followed up with required financial statements when available.) 2. The controlled group information required will be tailored to the event being reported and will generally include identifying information for each plan maintained by any member of the controlled group and a description of the controlled group with members' names. Similarly, PBGC has found that it needs the same financial and controlled group information for advance-notice filings (in addition to actuarial information already required). For notices of applications for funding waiver requests, the information can typically be gleaned from the copy of the application that accompanies the reportable event notice. With this exception, PBGC is requiring that every advance notice filing include these items (unless the information is publicly available). Controlled group changes and benefit liability transfers involve both an ''old'' controlled group and a ''new'' controlled group. PBGC had already required submission of controlled group information with notices of controlled group changes under the old regulation and is now also requiring the same for benefit liability transfers. Because extraordinary distributions raise questions about controlled group finances, PBGC now requires submission of financial information with notices of events of this type. PBGC now requires that notices of substantial owner distributions give the reason for the distribution to help PBGC analyze its significance. Inability to pay benefits raises the specter of imminent sponsor shutdown and plan termination. Accordingly, for notice of this event, PBGC now requires submission of copies of the most recent plan documents and IRS qualification letter. PBGC is adding to the Form 200 information submission requirements a requirement to provide information about all controlled group real property, and identity of controlled group principal executive offices. Simplified reporting for Form 200 filings is now available where the filer has not missed any required contribution (other than the missed contribution that triggered the Form 200 filing requirement during the two-year period ending on the notice due date for the Form 200) and has made up the missed contribution by the notice due date; under the simplified reporting provision, none of the attachments that are otherwise required to be included in the filing (e.g., controlled group listing and company financial statements) need to be provided. In missed contribution cases, there is sometimes a credit balance that is available for application to a contribution that is due. PBGC needs to be able to determine whether all or a portion of the credit balance has been properly applied toward payment of the contribution. Accordingly, PBGC is requiring Form 200 filers to indicate how much (if any) of the carryover balance or prefunding balance was used for partial payment of the missed contribution and submit copies of election letters relating to the application of the carryover balance and prefunding balance to the contribution. PBGC is requiring a description of each controlled group member's operational status (in Chapter 7 proceedings, liquidating outside of bankruptcy, on-going, etc.) in Form 200 filings. PBGC needs the information in reportable events filings under subparts B and C of part 4043 (Forms 10 and 10- Advance) to determine whether it should terminate plans that experience events that indicate plan or sponsor financial problems. PBGC estimates that it will receive such filings from about 816 respondents each year and that the total annual burden of the collection of information will be about 4,496 hours and $607,570. This represents a decreased burden compared to that under the old regulation, as the following table shows: Annual burden: Under old regulation: ...... $607,570. As discussed above, the final rule is designed to reduce burden dramatically on well-funded plans and low-default- risk sponsors; thus, burden under the final rule is substantially associated with higher-risk events, which are much more likely to deserve PBGC's attention. PBGC separately estimated the average burden changes for low-default-risk and non-low-default-risk entities. The burden for low-default-risk sponsors is down from 443 hours and $118,025 to zero. The burden for non-low-default- risk sponsors is up by 402 hours and $64,742.

PBGC estimates that it will receive such filings from about 165 respondents each year and that the total annual burden of the collection of information will be about 990 hours and $146,406.

This part prescribes the requirements for notifying PBGC of a reportable event under section 4043 of ERISA or of a failure to make certain required contributions under section 303(k)(4) of ERISA or section 430(k)(4) of the Code. Subpart A contains definitions and general rules. Subpart B contains rules for post-event notice of a reportable event. Subpart C contains rules for advance notice of a reportable event. Subpart D contains rules for notifying PBGC of a failure to make certain required contributions. \u00a7 4043.2 Definitions. The following terms are defined in \u00a7 4001.2 of this chapter: benefit liabilities, Code, contributing sponsor, controlled group, ERISA, fair market value, irrevocable commitment, multiemployer plan, PBGC, person, plan, plan administrator, plan year, single-employer plan, and substantial owner. In addition, for purposes of this part: De minimis 10-percent segment means, in connection with a plan's controlled group, one or more entities that in the aggregate have for a fiscal year\u2014 (1) Revenue not exceeding 10 percent of the controlled group's revenue; (2) Annual operating income not exceeding the greater of\u2014 (i) 10 percent of the controlled group's annual operating income; or (ii) $5 million; and (3) Net tangible assets at the end of the fiscal year(s) not exceeding the greater of\u2014 (i) 10 percent of the controlled group's net tangible assets at the end of the fiscal year(s); or (ii) $5 million. De minimis 5-percent segment has the same meaning as de minimis 10-percent segment, except that ''5 percent'' is substituted for ''10 percent'' each time it appears. Event year means the plan year in which a reportable event occurs. Foreign entity means a member of a controlled group that\u2014 (1) Is not a contributing sponsor of a plan; (2) Is not organized under the laws of (or, if an individual, is not a domiciliary of) any state (as defined in section 3(10) of ERISA); and (3) For the fiscal year that includes the date the reportable event occurs, meets one of the following tests\u2014 (i) Is not required to file any United States federal income tax form; (ii) Has no income reportable on any United States federal income tax form other than passive income not exceeding $1,000; or (iii) Does not own substantial assets in the United States (disregarding stock of a member of the plan's controlled group) and is not required to file any quarterly United States tax returns for employee withholding. Foreign parent means a foreign entity that is a direct or indirect parent of a person that is a contributing sponsor of a plan. Low-default-risk has the meaning described in \u00a7 4043.9. Notice due date means the deadline (including extensions) for filing notice of a reportable event with PBGC. Participant means a participant as defined in \u00a7 4006.2 of this chapter. Public company means a person subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or a subsidiary (as defined for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of a person subject to such reporting requirements. U.S. entity means an entity subject to the personal jurisdiction of the U.S. district court. Well-funded plan safe harbor has the meaning described in \u00a7 4043.10. \u00a7 4043.3 Requirement of notice. (a) Obligation to file\u2014(1) In general. Each person that is required to file a notice under this part, or a duly authorized representative, must submit the information required under this part by the time specified in \u00a7 4043.20 (for post-event notices), \u00a7 4043.61 (for advance notices), or \u00a7 4043.81 (for Form 200 filings). Any information filed with PBGC in connection with another matter may be incorporated by reference. If an event is subject to both post-event and advance notice requirements, the notice filed first satisfies both filing requirements. (2) Multiple plans. If a reportable event occurs for more than one plan, the filing obligation with respect to each plan is independent of the filing obligation with respect to any other plan. (3) Optional consolidated filing. A filing of a notice with respect to a reportable event by any person required to file will be deemed to be a filing by all persons required to give PBGC notice of the event under this part. If notices are required for two or more events, the notices may be combined in one filing. (b) Contents of reportable event notice. A person required to file a reportable event notice under subpart B or C of this part must file, by the notice date, the form specified by PBGC for that purpose, with the information specified in PBGC's reportable events instructions. (c) Reportable event forms and instructions. PBGC will issue reportable events forms and instructions and make them available on its Web site (http://www.pbgc.gov). (d) Requests for additional information. PBGC may, in any case, require the submission of additional relevant information not specified in its forms and instructions. Any such information must be submitted for subpart B of this part within 30 days, and for subpart C or D of this part within 7 days, after the date of a written request by PBGC, or within a different time period specified therein. PBGC may in its discretion shorten the time period where it determines that the interests of PBGC or participants may be prejudiced by a delay in receipt of the information. (e) Effect of failure to file. If a notice (or any other information required under this part) is not provided within the specified time limit, PBGC may pursue any equitable or legal remedies available to it under the law, including assessing against each person required to provide the notice a separate penalty under section 4071 of ERISA. \u00a7 4043.4 Waivers and extensions. (a) Waivers and extensions\u2014in general. PBGC may extend any deadline or waive any other requirement under this part where it finds convincing evidence that the waiver or extension is appropriate under the circumstances. Any waiver or extension may be subject to conditions. A request for a waiver or extension must be filed with PBGC in writing (which may be in electronic form) and must state the facts and circumstances on which the request is based. (b) Waivers and extensions\u2014specific events. For some reportable events, automatic waivers from reporting and extensions of time are provided in subparts B and C of this part. If an occurrence constitutes two or more reportable events, reporting requirements for each event are determined independently. For example, reporting is automatically waived for an occurrence that constitutes a reportable event under more than one section only if the requirements for an automatic waiver under each section are satisfied. (c) Multiemployer plans. The requirements of section 4043 of ERISA are waived with respect to multiemployer plans. (d) Terminating plans. No notice is required from the plan administrator or contributing sponsor of a plan if the VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES55004 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations notice date is on or after the date on which\u2014 (1) All of the plan's assets (other than any excess assets) are distributed pursuant to a termination under part 4041 of this chapter; or (2) A trustee is appointed for the plan under section 4042 of ERISA. (e) Events not described in this part. Notice of a reportable event described in section 4043(c) of ERISA is waived except to the extent that reporting is required under this part. \u00a7 4043.5 How and where to file. Reportable event notices required under this part must be filed electronically in accordance with the instructions posted on PBGC's Web site, http://www.pbgc.gov. Filing guidance is provided by the instructions and by subpart A of part 4000 of this chapter. \u00a7 4043.6 Date of filing. (a) Post-event notice filings. PBGC applies the rules in subpart C of part 4000 of this chapter to determine the date that a submission under subpart B of this part was filed with PBGC. (b) Advance notice and Form 200 filings. Information filed under subpart C or D of this part is treated as filed on the date it is received by PBGC. Subpart C of part 4000 of this chapter provides rules for determining when PBGC receives a submission. \u00a7 4043.7 Computation of time. PBGC applies the rules in subpart D of part 4000 of this chapter to compute any time period under this part. \u00a7 4043.8 Confidentiality. In accordance with section 4043(f) of ERISA and \u00a7 4901.21(a)(3) of this chapter, any information or documentary material that is not publicly available and is submitted to PBGC pursuant to subpart B or C of this part will not be made public, except as may be relevant to any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or for disclosures to either body of Congress or to any duly authorized committee or subcommittee of the Congress. This provision does not apply to information or material submitted to PBGC pursuant to subpart D of this part, even where the submission serves as an alternative method of compliance with \u00a7 4043.25. \u00a7 4043.9 Company low-default-risk safe harbor. (a) Low-default-risk. An entity (a ''company'') that is a contributing sponsor of a plan or the highest level U.S. parent of a contributing sponsor is ''low-default-risk'' on the date of an event if that date falls within a safe harbor period of the company as described in paragraph (b) of this section. (b) Safe harbor period. A safe harbor period for a company means a period that\u2014 (1) Begins on a financial information date (as described in paragraph (c) of this section) on which the company satisfies the low-default-risk standard in paragraph (e) of this section, and (2) Ends 13 months later or (if earlier) on the company's next financial information date. (c) Financial information date. A financial information date for a company means\u2014 (1) A date on which the company files on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (''SEC'') audited annual financial statements (including balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and notes to the financial statements) for the company's most recent completed fiscal year preceding the date of such filing; (2) The date (the ''closing date'') on which the company closes the annual accounting period that results in the production of audited or unaudited annual financial statements for the company's most recent completed fiscal year preceding the closing date, if audited annual financial statements are not required to be filed with the SEC; or (3) A date on which the company files with IRS an annual federal income tax return or IRS Form 990 (in either case, a ''return'') for the company's most recent completed fiscal year preceding the date of such filing, if at the time the return is filed there are no annual financial statements for the year of the return. (d) Supporting financial information. For purposes of this section, the ''supporting financial information'' is the annual financial statements or return associated with the establishment of the financial information date. (e) Low-default-risk standard\u2014(1) Adequate capacity. For purposes of this part, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a company meets the low-default-risk standard as of a financial information date (the ''qualifying date'') if the company has adequate capacity to meet its obligations in full and on time on the qualifying date as evidenced by satisfying either: (i) Both of the criteria described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, or (ii) Any four of the seven criteria described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section. (2) Criteria evidencing adequate capacity. The criteria referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are: (i) The probability that the company will default on its financial obligations is not more than four percent over the next five years or not more than 0.4 percent over the next year, in either case determined on the basis of widely available financial information on the company's credit quality. (ii) The company's secured debt (disregarding leases and debt incurred to acquire or improve property and secured only by that property) does not exceed 10 percent of the company's total assets. (iii) The company has a ratio of retained-earnings-to-total-assets of 0.25 or more. (iv) The company has a ratio of total- debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of 3.0 or less. (v) The company has positive net income for the two most recently completed fiscal years preceding the qualifying date. (vi) During the two-year period ending on the qualifying date, the company has not experienced an event described in \u00a7 4043.34(a)(1) or (2) (dealing with a default on a loan with an outstanding balance of $10 million or more) with respect to any loan with an outstanding balance of $10 million or more to the company regardless of whether reporting was waived under \u00a7 4043.34(b). (vii) During the two-year period ending on the qualifying date, there has not been any failure to make when due any contribution described in \u00a7 4043.25(a)(1) or (2) (dealing with failure to make required minimum funding payments), unless reporting was waived under \u00a7 4043.25(c). (3) Using financial information to evaluate criteria\u2014(i) Subject to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to evaluating the criterion described in paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section, to evaluate whether criteria described in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) through (v) of this section are met, a company must use the supporting financial information described in paragraph (d) of this section associated with the qualifying date. (ii) In addition to the use of the supporting financial information to evaluate criteria as described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, to evaluate whether the criterion described in paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section is met, the company must also use the supporting financial information as described in paragraph (d) of this section associated with the financial information date for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year covered by the VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES55005 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations supporting financial information associated with the qualifying date. (iii) For purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section, the excess of total revenue over total expenses as reported on the IRS Form 990 is considered to be net income. (4) Exception. If a company receives an audit or review report for supporting financial information described in paragraph (d) of this section associated with the qualifying date that expresses a material adverse view or qualification, the company does not satisfy the low- default-risk standard. \u00a7 4043.10 Well-funded plan safe harbor. For purposes of this part, a plan is in the well-funded plan safe harbor for an event year if no variable-rate premium was required to be paid for the plan under parts 4006 and 4007 of this chapter for the plan year preceding the event year. Subpart B\u2014Post-Event Notice of Reportable Events \u00a7 4043.20 Post-event filing obligation. The plan administrator and each contributing sponsor of a plan for which a reportable event under this subpart has occurred are required to notify PBGC within 30 days after that person knows or has reason to know that the reportable event has occurred, unless a waiver or extension applies. If there is a change in plan administrator or contributing sponsor, the responsibility for any failure to file or defective filing lies with the person who is the plan administrator or contributing sponsor of the plan on the 30th day after the reportable event occurs. \u00a7 4043.21 Tax disqualification and Title I noncompliance. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs when the Secretary of the Treasury issues notice that a plan has ceased to be a plan described in section 4021(a)(2) of ERISA, or when the Secretary of Labor determines that a plan is not in compliance with title I of ERISA. (b) Waiver. Notice is waived for this event. \u00a7 4043.22 Amendment decreasing benefits payable. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs when an amendment to a plan is adopted under which the retirement benefit payable from employer contributions with respect to any participant may be decreased. (b) Waiver. Notice is waived for this event. \u00a7 4043.23 Active participant reduction. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs for a plan: (1) Single-cause event. On the date in a plan year when, as a result of a single cause\u2014such as a reorganization, the discontinuance of an operation, a natural disaster, a mass layoff, or an early retirement incentive program\u2014the number of active participants is reduced to less than 80 percent of the number of active participants at the beginning of such plan year or less than 75 percent of the number of active participants at the beginning of the plan year preceding such plan year. (2) Attrition event. At the end of a plan year if the number of active participants covered by the plan at the end of such plan year is less than 80 percent of the number of active participants at the beginning of such plan year, or less than 75 percent of the number of active participants at the beginning of the plan year preceding such plan year. (b) Determination rules\u2014(1) Determination dates. The number of active participants at the beginning of a plan year may be determined by using the number of active participants at the end of the previous plan year, and the number of active participants at the end of a plan year may be determined by using the number of active participants at the beginning of the next plan year. (2) Active participant. ''Active participant'' means a participant who\u2014 (i) Is receiving compensation for work performed; (ii) Is on paid or unpaid leave granted for a reason other than a layoff; (iii) Is laid off from work for a period of time that has lasted less than 30 days; or (iv) Is absent from work due to a recurring reduction in employment that occurs at least annually. (3) Employment relationship. The employment relationship referred to in this paragraph (b) is between the participant and all members of the plan's controlled group. (c) Reductions due to cessations and withdrawals. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a reduction in the number of active participants is to be disregarded to the extent that it\u2014 (1) Is attributable to an event described in ERISA section 4062(e) or 4063(a), and (2) Is timely reported to PBGC under ERISA section 4063(a). (d) Waivers\u2014(1) Small plan. Notice under this section is waived if the plan had 100 or fewer participants for whom flat-rate premiums were payable for the plan year preceding the event year. (2) Low-default-risk. Notice under this section is waived if each contributing sponsor of the plan and the highest level U.S. parent of each contributing sponsor are low-default-risk on the date of the event. (3) Well-funded plan. Notice under this section is waived if the plan is in the well-funded plan safe harbor for the event year. (4) Public company. Notice under this section is waived if any contributing sponsor of the plan before the transaction is a public company and the contributing sponsor timely files a SEC Form 8-K disclosing the event under an item of the Form 8-K other than under Item 2.02 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) or in financial statements under Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits). (e) Extension\u2014attrition event. For an event described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the notice date is extended until the premium due date for the plan year following the event year. \u00a7 4043.24 Termination or partial termination. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs when the Secretary of the Treasury determines that there has been a termination or partial termination of a plan within the meaning of section 411(d)(3) of the Code. (b) Waiver. Notice is waived for this event. \u00a7 4043.25 Failure to make required minimum funding payment. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs when\u2014 (1) A contribution required under sections 302 and 303 of ERISA or sections 412 and 430 of the Code is not made by the due date for the payment under ERISA section 303(j) or Code section 430(j), or (2) Any other contribution required as a condition of a funding waiver is not made when due. (b) Alternative method of compliance\u2014Form 200 filed. If, with respect to the same failure, a filing is made in accordance with \u00a7 4043.81, that filing (while not considered to be submitted to PBGC pursuant to section 4043 of ERISA for purposes of section 4043(f) of ERISA) satisfies the requirements of this section. (c) Waivers\u2014(1) Small plan. Notice under this section is waived with respect to a failure to make a required quarterly contribution under section 303(j)(3) of ERISA or section 430(j)(3) of the Code if the plan had 100 or fewer participants for whom flat-rate premiums were payable for the plan year preceding the event year. VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES55006 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations (2) 30-day grace period. Notice under this section is waived if the missed contribution is made by the 30th day after its due date. (3) Late funding balance election. Notice under this section is waived if the failure to make a timely required contribution is solely because of the plan sponsor's failure to timely make a funding balance election. \u00a7 4043.26 Inability to pay benefits when due. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs when a plan is currently unable or projected to be unable to pay benefits. (1) Current inability. A plan is currently unable to pay benefits if it fails to provide any participant or beneficiary the full benefits to which the person is entitled under the terms of the plan, at the time the benefit is due and in the form in which it is due. A plan is not treated as being currently unable to pay benefits if its failure to pay is caused solely by\u2014 (i) A limitation under section 436 of the Code and section 206(g) of ERISA (dealing with funding-based limits on benefits and benefit accruals under single-employer plans), (ii) The inability to locate a person, or (iii) Any other administrative delay, including the need to verify a person's eligibility for benefits, to the extent that the delay is for less than the shorter of two months or two full benefit payment periods. (2) Projected inability. A plan is projected to be unable to pay benefits when, as of the last day of any quarter of a plan year, the plan's ''liquid assets'' are less than two times the amount of the ''disbursements from the plan'' for such quarter. ''Liquid assets'' and ''disbursements from the plan'' have the same meaning as under section 303(j)(4)(E) of ERISA and section 430(j)(4)(E) of the Code. (b) Waiver\u2014plans subject to liquidity shortfall rules. Notice under this section is waived unless the reportable event occurs during a plan year for which the plan is exempt from the liquidity shortfall rules in section 303(j)(4) of ERISA and section 430(j)(4) of the Code because it is described in section 303(g)(2)(B) of ERISA and section 430(g)(2)(B) of the Code. \u00a7 4043.27 Distribution to a substantial owner. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs for a plan when\u2014 (1) There is a distribution to a substantial owner of a contributing sponsor of the plan; (2) The total of all distributions made to the substantial owner within the one- year period ending with the date of such distribution exceeds $10,000; (3) The distribution is not made by reason of the substantial owner's death; (4) Immediately after the distribution, the plan has nonforfeitable benefits (as provided in \u00a7 4022.5 of this chapter) that are not funded; and (5) Either\u2014 (i) The sum of the values of all distributions to any one substantial owner within the one-year period ending with the date of the distribution is more than one percent of the end-of- year total amount of the plan's assets (as required to be reported on Schedule H or Schedule I to Form 5500) for each of the two plan years immediately preceding the event year, or (ii) The sum of the values of all distributions to all substantial owners within the one-year period ending with the date of the distribution is more than five percent of the end-of-year total amount of the plan's assets (as required to be reported on Schedule H or Schedule I to Form 5500) for each of the two plan years immediately preceding the event year. (b) Determination rules\u2014(1) Valuation of distribution. The value of a distribution under this section is the sum of\u2014 (i) The cash amounts actually received by the substantial owner; (ii) The purchase price of any irrevocable commitment; and (iii) The fair market value of any other assets distributed, determined as of the date of distribution to the substantial owner. (2) Date of substantial owner distribution. The date of distribution to a substantial owner of a cash distribution is the date it is received by the substantial owner. The date of distribution to a substantial owner of an irrevocable commitment is the date on which the obligation to provide benefits passes from the plan to the insurer. The date of any other distribution to a substantial owner is the date when the plan relinquishes control over the assets transferred directly or indirectly to the substantial owner. (3) Determination date. The determination of whether a participant is (or has been in the preceding 60 months) a substantial owner is made on the date when there has been a distribution that would be reportable under this section if made to a substantial owner. (c) Alternative method of compliance\u2014annuity. In the case of an annuity for a substantial owner, a filing that satisfies the requirements of this section with respect to any payment under the annuity and that discloses the period, the amount of the payment, and the duration of the annuity satisfies the requirements of this section with respect to all subsequent payments under the annuity. (d) Waivers\u2014(1) Low-default-risk. Notice under this section is waived if each contributing sponsor of the plan and the highest level U.S. parent of each contributing sponsor are low-default- risk on the date of the event. (2) Well-funded plan. Notice under this section is waived if the plan is in the well-funded plan safe harbor for the event year. (3) Public company. Notice under this section is waived if any contributing sponsor of the plan before the transaction is a public company and the contributing sponsor timely files a SEC Form 8-K disclosing the event under an item of the Form 8-K other than under Item 2.02 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) or in financial statements under Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits). \u00a7 4043.28 Plan merger, consolidation or transfer. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs when a plan merges, consolidates, or transfers its assets or liabilities under section 208 of ERISA or section 414(l) of the Code. (b) Waiver. Notice under this section is waived for this event. However, notice may be required under \u00a7 4043.29 (for a controlled group change) or \u00a7 4043.32 (for a transfer of benefit liabilities). \u00a7 4043.29 Change in contributing sponsor or controlled group. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs for a plan when there is a transaction that results, or will result, in one or more persons' ceasing to be members of the plan's controlled group (other than by merger involving members of the same controlled group). For purposes of this section, the term ''transaction'' includes, but is not limited to, a legally binding agreement, whether or not written, to transfer ownership, an actual transfer of ownership, and an actual change in ownership that occurs as a matter of law or through the exercise or lapse of pre- existing rights. Whether an agreement is legally binding is to be determined without regard to any conditions in the agreement. A transaction is not reportable if it will result solely in a reorganization involving a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization, however effected. (b) Waivers. (1) De minimis 10- percent segment. Notice under this section is waived if the person or VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:20 Sep RULES55007 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations persons that will cease to be members of the plan's controlled group represent a de minimis 10-percent segment of the plan's old controlled group for the most recent fiscal year(s) ending on or before the date the reportable event occurs. (2) Foreign entity. Notice under this section is waived if each person that will cease to be a member of the plan's controlled group is a foreign entity other than a foreign parent. (3) Small plan. Notice under this section is waived if the plan had 100 or fewer participants for whom flat-rate premiums were payable for the plan year preceding the event year. (4) Low-default-risk. Notice under this section is waived if each post-event contributing sponsor of the plan and the highest level U.S. parent of each post- event contributing sponsor are low- default-risk on the date of the event. (5) Well-funded plan. Notice under this section is waived if the plan is in the well-funded plan safe harbor for the event year. (6) Public company. Notice under this section is waived if any contributing sponsor of the plan before the transaction is a public company and the contributing sponsor timely files a SEC Form 8-K disclosing the event under an item of the Form 8-K other than under Item 2.02 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) or in financial statements under Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits). (c) Examples. The following examples assume that no waiver applies. (1) Controlled group breakup. Plan A's controlled group consists of Company A (its contributing sponsor), Company B (which maintains Plan B), and Company C. As a result of a transaction, the controlled group will break into two separate controlled groups \u2014 one segment consisting of Company A and the other segment consisting of Companies B and C. Both Company A (Plan A's contributing sponsor) and the plan administrator of Plan A are required to report that Companies B and C will leave Plan A's controlled group. Company B (Plan B's contributing sponsor) and the plan administrator of Plan B are required to report that Company A will leave Plan B's controlled group. Company C is not required to report because it is not a contributing sponsor or a plan administrator. (2) Change in contributing sponsor. Plan Q is maintained by Company Q. Company Q enters into a binding contract to sell a portion of its assets and to transfer employees participating in Plan Q, along with Plan Q, to Company R, which is not a member of Company Q's controlled group. There will be no change in the structure of Company Q's controlled group. On the effective date of the sale, Company R will become the contributing sponsor of Plan Q. A reportable event occurs on the date of the transaction (i.e., the date the binding contract was executed), because as a result of the transaction, Company Q (and any other member of its controlled group) will cease to be a member of Plan Q's controlled group. The event is not reported before the notice date. If on the notice date the change in the contributing sponsor has not yet become effective, Company Q has the reporting obligation. If the change in the contributing sponsor has become effective by the notice date, Company R has the reporting obligation. \u00a7 4043.30 Liquidation. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs for a plan when a member of the plan's controlled group\u2014 (1) Is involved in any transaction to implement its complete liquidation (including liquidation into another controlled group member); (2) Institutes or has instituted against it a proceeding to be dissolved or is dissolved, whichever occurs first; or (3) Liquidates in a case under the Bankruptcy Code, or under any similar law. (b) Waivers\u2014(1) De minimis 10- percent segment. Notice under this section is waived if the person or persons that liquidate do not include any contributing sponsor of the plan and represent a de minimis 10-percent segment of the plan's controlled group for the most recent fiscal year(s) ending on or before the date the reportable event occurs. (2) Foreign entity. Notice under this section is waived if each person that liquidates is a foreign entity other than a foreign parent. \u00a7 4043.31 Extraordinary dividend or stock redemption. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs for a plan when any member of the plan's controlled group declares a dividend or redeems its own stock and the amount or net value of the distribution, when combined with other such distributions during the same fiscal year of the person, exceeds the person's net income before after-tax gain or loss on any sale of assets, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, for the prior fiscal year. A distribution by a person to a member of its controlled group is disregarded. (b) Determination rules. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the net value of a non-cash distribution is the fair market value of assets transferred by the person making the distribution, reduced by the fair market value of any liabilities assumed or consideration given by the recipient in connection with the distribution. Net value determinations should be based on readily available fair market value(s) or independent appraisal(s) performed within one year before the distribution is made. To the extent that fair market values are not readily available and no such appraisals exist, the fair market value of an asset transferred in connection with a distribution or a liability assumed by a recipient of a distribution is deemed to be equal to 200 percent of the book value of the asset or liability on the books of the person making the distribution. Stock redeemed is deemed to have no value. (c) Waivers\u2014(1) De minimis 10- percent segment. Notice under this section is waived if the person making the distribution is a de minimis 10- percent segment of the plan's controlled group for the most recent fiscal year(s) ending on or before the date the reportable event occurs. (2) Foreign entity. Notice under this section is waived if the person making the distribution is a foreign entity other than a foreign parent. (3) Small plan. Notice under this section is waived if the plan had 100 or fewer participants for whom flat-rate premiums were payable for the plan year preceding the event year. (4) Low-default-risk. Notice under this section is waived if each contributing sponsor of the plan and the highest level U.S. parent of each contributing sponsor are low-default-risk on the date of the event. (5) Well-funded plan. Notice under this section is waived if the plan is in the well-funded plan safe harbor for the event year. (6) Public company. Notice under this section is waived if any contributing sponsor of the plan before the transaction is a public company and the contributing sponsor timely files a SEC Form 8-K disclosing the event under an item of the Form 8-K other than under Item 2.02 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) or in financial statements under Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits). \u00a7 4043.32 Transfer of benefit liabilities. (a) Reportable event. A reportable event occurs for a plan when\u2014 (1) The plan makes a transfer of benefit liabilities to a person, or to a plan or plans maintained by a person or persons, that are not members of the transferor plan's controlled group; and VerDate RULES55008 Federal Register / Vol. 80, No. 176 / Friday, September 11, 2015 / Rules and Regulations (2) The amount of benefit liabilities transferred, in conjunction with other benefit liabilities transferred during the 12-month period ending on the date of the transfer, is 3 percent or more of the plan's total benefit liabilities. Both the benefit liabilities transferred and the plan's total benefit liabilities are to be valued as of any one date in the plan year in which the transfer occurs, using actuarial assumptions that comply with section 414(l) of the Code. (b) Determination rules\u2014(1) Date of transfer. The date of transfer is to be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the particular situation. For transfers subject to the requirements of section 414(l) of the Code, the date determined in accordance with 26 CFR 1.414(l)- 1(b)(11) will be considered the date of transfer. (2) Distributions of lump sums and annuities. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the payment of a lump sum, or purchase of an irrevocable commitment to provide an annuity, in satisfaction of benefit liabilities is not a transfer of benefit liabilities. (c) Waivers\u2014(1) Small plan. Notice under this section is waived if the plan had 100 or fewer participants for whom flat-rate premiums were payable for the plan year preceding the event year. (2) Low-default-risk. Notice under this section is waived if each contributing sponsor of the plan and the highest level U.S. parent of each contributing sponsor are low-default-risk on the date of the event. (3) Well-funded plan. Notice under this section is waived if the plan is in the well-funded plan safe harbor for the event year. (4) Public company. Notice under this section is waived if any contributing sponsor of the plan before the transaction is a public company and the contributing sponsor timely files a SEC Form 8-K disclosing the event under an item of the Form 8-K other than under Item 2.02 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) or in financial statements under Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits). \u00a7 4043.33 Application for minimum funding waiver.
