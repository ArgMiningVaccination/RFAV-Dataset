Acupuncture, practiced by a certified acupuncturist using fine, sterile needles, is a low-risk treatment for wellness, fertility, reproductive health, and a multitude of common conditions. From a western perspective, acupuncture stimulates your body's nerves, connective tissue, and muscles. From the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture activates Qi (energy) at points along each person's Meridians, enabling the body to rebalance itself. WS-TCM treatments may also include: herbal medicine electro stimulation tui na massage cupping moxa nutritional and lifestyle recommendations We also offer these treatments: Frequency specific micro-current Allergy elimination technique Integrative medicine Frequency Specific Micro-current Extensive study has concluded that each specific biological function or interaction is characterized by a unique frequency. Using frequencies to heal with the resonance effect is physics applied to biology. There are frequencies for everything from neutralizing the histamine (allergy reaction) to restoring the adrenals and brain balancing to eliminating pain. Frequency protocols are sequences of frequencies observed to have a certain clinical effect in various conditions as determined by practitioners. These protocols may be run once in a treatment session, or may be run repeatedly by using a specifically programmed home unit to self treat. We have found this treatment method to be very complementary to TCM and have seen positive results for our patients. Integrative Medicine At Acupuncture Healing Center, we believe it's important to work in tandem with other physicians to integrate conventional and whole-systems medicine, an integrative approach which has been shown to be safe and effective. We are happy to recommend the [Integrative Medical Clinic](https://www.imcnorthcarolina.com/). We also integrate Western medicine into our treatments by working with labs that provide blood, stool, and saliva analyses. This ensures that we are able to give you the best quality of care by getting a comprehensive overview of your current state of health. "}
