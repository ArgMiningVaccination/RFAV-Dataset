The purpose of this study was to examine predictors of seasonal influenza vaccination among pregnant women. Methods: Between 2009 and 2012, the Vaccines and Medications in Pregnancy Surveillance System (VAMPSS) conducted a prospective cohort study of influenza vaccine safety among pregnant women in the US and Canada that oversampled vaccinated women. Data for the present paper are from an addi- tional cross-sectional telephone survey completed during the 2010-2011 influenza season. We examined predictors of influenza vaccination, focusing on Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs. Results: We surveyed 199 pregnant women, 81% of whom had received a seasonal influenza vaccine. Vaccination was more common among women who felt more susceptible to influenza (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.10-3.01), who perceived greater vaccine effectiveness (OR = 3.92, 95% CI 1.48-10.43), and whose doctors recommended they have flu shots (OR = 3.06, 95% CI 1.27-7.38). Those who perceived greater barriers of influenza vaccination had lower odds of vaccination (OR = 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.75). Perceived social norms, anticipated inaction regret, and worry also predicted uptake, though demographic characteristics of respondents did not. Conclusion: The HBM provides a valuable framework for exploring influenza vaccination among pregnant women. Our results suggest several potential areas of intervention to improve vaccination rates. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction While all healthy adults are eligible for seasonal influenza vaccination in the US and Canada, guidelines recommend vacci- nation for pregnant women and those who may become pregnant during the influenza season because of their increased risk for influenza-related morbidity and mortality [1,2] . Prior to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, seasonal influenza vaccination rates among pregnant women were consistently low at around 15% [1-3] . Rates increased signicantly to 47% for the seasonal influenza vaccine during the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic [4] and remained elevated through the 2010-2011 influenza season [5]. However, these levels remain well below the Healthy People 2020 target of 80%.

Studies also show somewhat higher influenza vaccination rates among non-Hispanic white women as compared to other racial and ethnic groups [6,7] . Behavioral theories provide an a priori framework for explaining why and how a health behavior occurs and provide opportunities to identify potential points of intervention. The Health Belief Model (HBM) [8] focuses on the influence of people's beliefs and attitudes on their health behaviors. The model's constructs are consistently predictive of vaccination behavior across diverse populations [9]. The constructs in the model as applied to influenza vaccination behavior are: (1) perceived susceptibility to contracting influenza; (2) perceived severity of influenza; (3) perceived effectiveness of vaccination to protect against influenza; (4) perceived barriers to vaccination, including practical barriers such as time and effort as well as potential side effects of the vaccine; and (5) cues to action, such as vaccination reminders from healthcare providers. There is limited understanding of whether constructs from health behavior theories influence vaccination behavior among pregnant women. While researchers have begun to explore individual beliefs and perceptions associated with influenza 0264-410X/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Gorman et al. / Vaccine 31 (2012) 213- 218 vaccination uptake among pregnant women [5-7,10,11] , only one specically identied the HBM as a theoretical framework, and this study did not examine seasonal influenza vaccine uptake [7]. The primary aim of our study was to examine HBM constructs as pre- dictors of seasonal influenza vaccination among pregnant women. Secondarily, we explored how vaccine uptake during pregnancy was associated with other health beliefs and attitudes shown to be predictors of vaccination behavior among healthy adults [12,13] : perceived social norms, anticipated inaction regret (anticipated aversive feelings about not vaccinating given a negative outcome), anticipated vaccination regret (anticipated aversive feelings about vaccinating given a negative outcome), and worry. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Design of parent study The Vaccines and Medications in Pregnancy Surveillance System (VAMPSS) influenza vaccine and medications study is a federally funded study initiated in 2009 to monitor and evaluate fetal and maternal risks of H1N1 vaccine, seasonal influenza vaccine, and antiviral medications [14] . One arm of the VAMPSS influenza vac- cine study is a prospective cohort study of currently pregnant women. Participants are referred by a network of 13 Teratogen Information Service call centers, located in academic centers and health departments, that respond to calls from across the U.S. and Canada. These centers provide evidence-based counseling and referral to about 70,000-100,000 callers each year about exposures during pregnancy and potential risks for adverse birth outcomes. These services are available free of charge to all women in the U.S. and Canada. The VAMPSS influenza vaccine cohort study planned to recruit 1100 women between October 2009 and February 2012, with 82% vaccinated during any trimester of pregnancy, in order to test specic hypotheses related to adverse pregnancy outcomes. 2.2. Design of additional survey Between October 2010 and June 2011, participants in the VAMPSS influenza vaccine cohort study were invited to take an additional cross-sectional 15 min telephone survey on their beliefs about seasonal influenza vaccination. Of 438 women enrolled in the cohort study during this time frame, 199 women (45% of those eligible) completed the additional survey. Not all cohort study par- ticipants were asked or agreed to complete the additional survey due to telephone interviewer schedules and time limitations for the participants. The University of California San Diego Institutional Review Board approved the parent study and additional survey. 2.3. Measures The baseline interview for the larger cohort study collected information about demographics, mother's reproductive history, and health behavior in the current pregnancy. In our follow-up interview, 16 items measured 9 individual theoretical constructs (Table 1). Response scales had four response options, coded 1-4 with higher values indicating greater endorsement of the construct. For perceived susceptibility, response options were \"very unlikely\", \"somewhat unlikely\", \"somewhat likely\", and \"very likely\". response options were \"not at all\", \"a little\", \"a moderate amount\", and \"quite were \"strongly disagree\", \"disagree, \"agree\", and \"strongly agree\". When multiple items measured a construct, we calculated mean scores and Cronbach's alpha to assess internal consistency. We pilot testedthe survey in anonymous telephone surveys with ve pregnant or recently pregnant women. 2.4. Statistical analyses We compared demographics, mother's health behavior, and reproductive history variables by vaccination status using ANOVA, chi-square tests, and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. We calculated raw mean scores of each individual theoretical con- struct by vaccination status. We then developed logistic regression models to determine the association between vaccination uptake during pregnancy. In the primary analysis, Model 1, we used simul- taneous regression based on the a priori theoretical framework of the ve HBM domains. For Model 2, we used forward selec- tion stepwise logistic regression to develop the most parsimonious model predicting vaccination. We added each HBM construct into the model followed by the remaining constructs (perceived social norms, anticipated inaction regret, anticipated vaccination regret, and worry) in a stepwise fashion, retaining only those with p < 0.05. In exploratory bivariate analyses, we evaluated the correlation between influenza vaccination and specic items measuring barri- ers to vaccination. We calculated the raw mean score for each items by vaccination status. We analyzed data in SAS Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) using two-tailed tests (critical alpha < 0.05). 3. Results 3.1. Respondent characteristics A total of 199 pregnant women completed the survey. On aver- age, study participants were 32 years old and about 24 weeks' gestation at the time of the survey. The majority of participants were white (non-Hispanic) (83%) and indicated a high socioeco- nomic status (82%). Rates of tobacco and illicit drug use during pregnancy were 7% and 3%, respectively, and 44% of women reported at least some alcohol exposure (including prior to becom- ing aware of the pregnancy). This was the rst pregnancy for about half of participants, 57% were nulliparous, and 26% had experienced a prior miscarriage. Half of participants (50%) reported they had previously received an influenza vaccination (H1N1 or seasonal), and 19% reported experiencing influenza, in the previous influenza season (2009-2010). 3.2. Influenza vaccination For the 2010-2011 influenza season, 81% of participants had received a seasonal influenza vaccine during or prior to pregnancy. In a comparison of characteristics across vaccination uptake groups, those vaccinated were more likely to have received an influenza vaccination in the previous influenza season (p < 0.001) (Table 2). Those who had received an influenza vaccination in the previ- ous season had higher odds of vaccination than those who had not (91.8% vs. 68.5%; OR = 5.15, 95% CI 2.28-11.64). There were no statistically signicant differences in the 11 other characteris- tics (demographics, health behaviors, reproductive history, or prior season influenza) by vaccination status. 3.3. Health beliefs In bivariate analyses, participants who received an influenza vaccine had higher perceived susceptibility to influenza (p < 0.001), perceived severity of influenza (p < 0.001), perceived effectiveness of the vaccination (p < 0.001), perceived social norms regarding vac- cination during pregnancy (p = 0.06), anticipated inaction regret (p < 0.001), and worry (p < 0.001) (Table 3).

A higher percentage of those who received a vaccine reported being reminded by their doctor to do so (66% vs. 35%, p < 0.001). These results are in the expected directions and con- sistent with the theoretical framework (Table 3). In a multivariate logistic regression model simultaneously controlling for all ve HBM constructs (Model 1, Table 3), those with higher perceived susceptibility to influenza (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.10-3.01), those with higher perceived vaccine effec- tiveness (OR = 3.92, 95% CI 1.48-10.43), and those who were reminded by their doctor to have a flu shot (representing cues to action) (OR = 3.06, 95% CI 1.27-7.38) had higher odds of influenzavaccination. Those with higher perceived barriers had lower odds of vaccination (OR = 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.75). In the multivariate logistic regression model to explore the role of \"other beliefs\" predicting vaccination (Model 2, Table 3), those who were reminded by their doctor to have a flu shot (OR = 3.08, 95% CI 1.18-8.07), those who believed that most other pregnant women received an influenza vaccination (OR = 5.31, 95% CI 1.75-16.13), those with higher anticipated inaction regret (OR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.11-3.48), and those with greater worry about influenza (OR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.04-3.47) had greater odds of vac- cination. Those with higher perceived barriers had lower odds of vaccination (OR = 0.16, 95% CI 0.04-0.72).

Worry was moderately correlated with both perceived effectiveness (r = 0.44) and perceived susceptibility (r = 0.45). Adding prior season vacci- nation behavior did not change the statistical signicance of any variables in Model 1 or Model 2. In exploratory bivariate analyses, four of the ve items measur- ing barriers were associated with vaccination status (p < 0.05) and all scores were in the expected direction (higher mean scores for those not vaccinated). Only the item measuring cost as a barrier did not differ between groups (Table 4). 4. Discussion Influenza vaccination rates among pregnant women have increased following the 2009-2010 influenza season, but they have remained below the 80% goal set by Healthy People 2020 [5,15] . Previous research indicates that the HBM's constructs are among the most important predictors of vaccination decisions [9]. However, theory-based research of influenza vaccination among pregnant women is limited. Our results suggest that the HBM pro- vides a valuable framework for exploring influenza vaccination among pregnant women and that \"other beliefs\" deserve further evaluation. Our ndings also point toward several potential areas of intervention to improve influenza vaccination uptake among pregnant women. Consistent with other research [4,5,10,16] , we found that healthcare providers played an important role in encouraging vac- cination. Participants who reported that a doctor had reminded them to have a flu shot at least once during their pregnancy had three times the odds of being vaccinated compared to those who had not been reminded. This also suggests that, even if a doc- tor is unable to provide an influenza vaccination at that time, the reminder is still benecial. The ndings of this and other studies indicate that patient-provider communication regarding vaccina- tion recommendations during pregnancy continue to be important.Women who do not have annual flu vaccines may also repre- sent a higher risk group for targeted communication efforts during pregnancy. As in other studies [5,9] , those who had an influenza vaccination in the previous season had higher odds of vaccination than those who had not. Perceived susceptibility to influenza, effectiveness of vaccina- tion, and barriers were also statistically signicant predictors in an analysis using the ve main HBM constructs. Women who believed they were more susceptible to influenza and those who believed that vaccination would provide protection against influenza had greater odds of vaccination. This is consistent with research indi- cating lower vaccination rates among pregnant women with beliefs that contracting influenza is not likely and that vaccines are not effective [5-7,10,11] . Yudin and colleagues found that pregnant women have limited understanding of their susceptibility to influenza, current vaccination recommendations, and safety of vac- cination during pregnancy, which could impact vaccination uptake [11] . In our exploratory bivariate analysis, those who felt that vac- cination posed a risk to themselves or their baby had lower odds of vaccination. This is consistent with a recent CDC survey, which found that 37% of women reported having concerns about safety risks to themselves or their baby as reasons for not receiving an influenza vaccination [5]. Beliefs about the severity of having the flu during pregnancy did not remain statistically signicant after con- trolling for other HBM constructs. While a recent CDC survey cites beliefs about the severity of getting the flu (\"I don't think I would get very sick if I got the flu\" and \"If I get the flu, I will just get some medication to treat it\") among the top ve reasons for not receiving an influenza vaccination during pregnancy [5], these are different aspects than we assessed. A cross-sectional study undertaken dur- ing the 2009 H1N1 epidemic found that perceived severity was an independent predictor of influenza vaccination among pregnant women [7], but results may have been influenced by the intense media coverage regarding H1N1 during that time. Results of our study suggest that health communication campaigns focused onJ.R. Gorman et al. / Vaccine 31 (2012) 213- 218 217 awareness of susceptibility to influenza and vaccine effectiveness during pregnancy in combination with efforts to address safety concerns, such as through patient-provider interaction and dis- semination of relevant research and recommendations, may help pregnant women make informed vaccination decisions. Social norms theory suggests that perceptions about how oth- ers in their social group are behaving (descriptive norms) influence people's behavior [17-19] . This theoretical approach has been used extensively in the development of interventions to reduce risk behaviors such as substance use, particularly among college stu- dents [17,18] . The results of Model 2 indicate that this theory may also be useful in predicting vaccination behavior; women who believed that other pregnant women were having influenza vaccinations had greater odds of vaccination. If vaccination rates are higher than most women believe them to be, then interven- tions presenting accurate information about influenza vaccination among pregnant women in their peer group may be benecial in encouraging vaccination. However, such an approach would not be effective, and could have unanticipated negative effects, if vaccina- tion behavior is less common than believed [20] . Our ndings suggest that emotional aspects of risk, such as anticipated inaction regret and worry, are important constructs to consider when exploring determinants of vaccination behavior [9,13,21] . Researchers have found anticipated regret to be impor- tant predictors of vaccination in other populations [13,21-23] . Weinstein and colleagues found that adults with higher scores of inaction regret, those who would regret getting the flu because they were not vaccinated, were more likely to be vaccinated [21] . Our study results are consistent with this; pregnant women with higher scores of anticipated inaction regret had higher odds of vac- cination. Results presented in Model 2 also suggest that worry may be an important predictor of vaccination, and may be a stronger predictor than perceived susceptibility to influenza or perceived vaccine effectiveness. The ndings may also be con- sistent with mediation, such that cognitive evaluations lead to affective responses which more proximally motivate behavior, as proposed by Kiviniemi and colleagues [24] . While worry was mod- erately correlated with both perceived susceptibility and perceived effectiveness, these remain distinct theoretical constructs [13] . Further research to identify individual and environmental fac- tors associated with worry and anticipated regret of not being vaccinated could aid in the development of effective vaccination promotion campaigns. 4.1. Study limitations and strengths A strength of this study was enrollment of geographically diverse participants from the US and Canada and use of a theoreti- cal framework. A main limitation is that this was a cross-sectional study, limiting our ability to make causal inferences [25] . This sample is not representative of pregnant women in general as par- ticipants were a convenience sample from a larger cohort study that was not designed to reflect population vaccination rates. Because most participants were recruited through Teratogen Information Services, it is also possible that women in this study were more con- cerned about their prenatal health because of co-morbidities, addi- tional exposures, or other health concerns and therefore, responded differently to health behavioral questions such as perceived suscep- tibility. Most were White (non-Hispanic) and had a high socioeco- nomic status [26] . Influenza vaccination status was self-reported by participants and not veried by medical record. However, while no studies address the validity of self-reported influenza vaccina- tion among pregnant women, recall is moderately reliable among elderly populations and other risk groups [27-29] . Finally, we relied on self-report of having received a doctor's reminder to have aninfluenza vaccination during pregnancy. It is possible that some women did not recall this information accurately. 5. Conclusions Health behavior theories, such as the HBM, provide a valuable framework for increasing our understanding of factors associ- ated with vaccination behavior. The results of this study indicate that perceived susceptibility to influenza, perceived effectiveness of vaccination, perceived barriers (particularly those related to harms of vaccination), and cues to action via a doctor's reminder independently predict influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Perceived norms regarding vaccination, anticipated inaction regret, and worry also appear to be important. Campaigns addressing these issues along with sustained health communication efforts among health care providers may help to maintain and improve vaccina- tion rates.
