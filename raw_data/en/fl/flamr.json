Common Types of Counseling Individual Counseling Individual counseling gives affirming and supportive one-on-one counseling for adults, adolescents or children to resolve depression, anxiety or other trauma related symptoms. Individual counseling can help reduce stress and help you find healthy ways to keep stress at a minimum. It can help with anger management and be a helpful source during those times of personal adjustment to foreseen and unforeseen life issues and transitions. Counseling can be an opportunity to change non-helpful patterns and enhance personal development. Couple and Marital Counseling When you find that you continue to have the same arguments over again without resolution and you may be feeling increasingly distant from your partner, our experts can help with couple or marital counseling. You will have the opportunity to resolve old issues and change coping patterns that may no longer serve your relationship goals. You will be able to learn new skills that can serve to enhance every dimension of your relationship. Thinking about getting married? Premarital counseling is offered to enhance and support your new life together. If, on the other hand, you have decided to divorce or separate, couple or marital counseling can help to negotiate some of the common issues associated with those decisions.
