While taking supplements to boost the immune system health can help your body fight off illness and disease, it's important to remember that it cannot cure or prevent illness altogether. Learn more supplements to boost the immune system that you can start incorporating into your routine. About Immune System Support The human body's immune system is made up of a complicated assortment of chemicals, cells, and processes. These [ work together](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279364/) to protect the body from harmful pathogens, like bacteria, toxins, viruses, or diseases. You can keep your immunity strong by making good health choices for your body. This will help your body scare off the worst of invading pathogens. Some of the most important ways to boost your immune system include: - Taking vitamins for the immune system. - Getting the right amount of sleep and rest. - Eating a balanced, nutritious diet with immune system booster nutrients. - Exercising regularly. The intake of herbs, minerals, and vitamins can work as an immune system booster and help defend the body from infections and illnesses. Taking these in the form of a supplement - such as [MDimmune](https://www.mdbiowellness.com/products/mdimmune-hemp-oil-immunity-supplement) - is the easiest way to get the vitamins for the immune system that your body needs. However, it is essential to remember that some of these [plant medicine](https://www.mdbiowellness.com/blogs/doctors-desk/plant-based-medicine-to-soothe-your-body) supplements can interact with other medications. That's why it's crucial to talk to your healthcare provider before adding a supplements to boost the immune system to your wellness routine. 8 Essential Supplements to Boost Immune System Wellbeing Our MDimmune product focuses on eight core ingredients, each offering immune system booster properties. Here's what you can expect. 1. Vitamin C Vitamin C is one of the most commonly used vitamins for [immune system support](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707683/). It is known to protect the body from infections and keep us feeling healthy. This vitamin is found in foods such as: - Citrus fruit - Strawberries - Kiwi fruit - Spinach - Broccoli - Kale - Peppers Vitamin C supports immune cell function, improving the cells' ability to defend the body. It also assists in the removal of dead cells from the body and replaces them with fresh ones. This helps keep the immune system operating optimally. Moreover, vitamin C is a highly effective antioxidant. Antioxidants help protect body cells from oxidative stress, which happens when reactive molecules known as free radicals accumulate. Free radicals can damage healthy cells, which can lead to accelerated aging and disease. Many people take vitamin C as an immune system booster for its ability to prevent colds and flu or at least help the body get over these upper respiratory tract infections more easily. Studies show that regular ingestion of vitamin C supplements [ lessens cold duration](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23440782/) by 8% in adults and 14% in children. Research also indicates that taking this vitamin regularly can minimize the chances of catching a cold by 50%, even in individuals under intense physical stress. When given in higher doses, vitamin C can even help people suffering from severe infections like acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. Scientific studies confirm the ability of vitamin C supplements to boost the immune system. Dosage is usually between 250 to 1000mg daily. 2. Vitamin D Vitamin D as one of the supplements to boost the immune system improves white blood cell efficacy, which helps the body fight off diseases. As a fat-soluble nutrient, vitamin D also helps minimize inflammation in the body, which [aids immune responses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166406/) and reduces the chances of developing conditions like arthritis, cancer, and heart disease. This vitamin is present in foods such as: - Fish like sardines, salmon, swordfish, and tuna - Cod liver oil - Beef liver - Egg yolk - Breakfast cereals You also absorb vitamin D when spending time in the sun. People living in colder climates often suffer from vitamin D deficiencies and should take supplements to boost the immune system. If your vitamin D levels are low, you may be more prone to colds and flu and allergic asthmatic reactions. People who supplement with vitamin D may thus also help to minimize their chances of getting these kinds of respiratory illnesses. In this way, vitamin D is another of the popular vitamins for immune system support. [Other research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3308600/) indicates that vitamin D may enhance the body's responses to antiviral treatment in those with conditions like HIV and hepatitis C. Typically, the dosage for these supplements to boost the immune system ranges from 1000 to 4000 IU, depending on individual blood levels. [Newer research](https://www.webmd.com/lung/vitamin-d-covid-19-what-to-know%231) has shown that vitamin D may help stop inflammation and accelerate respiratory healing in COVID-19 patients. This research is ongoing on this as the vitamins for the immune system. 3. Zinc Zinc aids immune cell growth and communication, making it an essential component of vitamins for [ immune system health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2277319/). This mineral also strengthens tissue barriers, which helps to stop pathogens from getting into the body. If you have a zinc deficiency, you will likely be more prone to infections and illnesses like colds, flu, and pneumonia. Studies show that 16% of severe respiratory infections globally are linked to a zinc deficiency. Up to [30% of older adults](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5748737/) worldwide experience zinc deficiency, often due to poor diet or malnutrition. This mineral has also been shown to help people who are already ill recover more quickly. Zinc occurs naturally in the body but can also be found in red meat, chicken, and breakfast cereals. Most people absorb enough zinc vitamins for immune system health by eating a balanced diet. However, others may need to take a supplement. The dosage for zinc supplements is safe for up to 40mg. Taking too much zinc may interfere with copper absorption in the body, which can increase the risk of getting infections. 4. Full-Spectrum Hemp Oil Full-spectrum hemp oil is a supplement comprised of more than one kind of cannabis (mainly hemp) plant extract. The supplement is made up of a range of cannabinoids such as cannabinol and cannabidiol, as well as terpenes and essential oils. It can also have traces of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which gives people that 'high' feeling. However, in such low doses, it will not likely have this effect. If you take a [CBD product](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/cbd-isolate-vs-full-spectrum-cbd%23what-is-the-difference) like full-spectrum hemp oil as an immune system booster, you won't experience the high. It does help ease the symptoms of several conditions. These can include insomnia, aches and pains, and many other conditions. While many herbalists strongly advocate CBD products for their immune-boosting properties, research is still needed to prove this. Autoimmune disease patients often need a supplement or remedy to calm the immune system. CBD products are said to be effective at doing this as one of the vitamins for the immune system. Research on the effects of CBD on the immune system is ongoing and, therefore, at present, not definitive. 5. Quercetin More and more evidence suggests that quercetin has several benefits for the immune system and other health factors. The compound forms part of the plant pigment group known as flavonoids. This compound is found in food groups like vegetables, fruit, grains, and nuts. It's also often found in tea. When in supplement form, it's usually extracted from the buds and flowers of the Japanese pagoda tree. Quercetin is an antioxidant, like all flavonoids, which means it helps balance out the effects of damaging free radicals. This means it can help prevent aging and several other conditions such as heart disease, arthritis, and cancer. Its antioxidant properties may also help ward off dementia and [ chronic inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808895/). It is known as an immune system booster as it helps protect the body from the symptoms of seasonal allergies. It may also help with other issues. It is said to be an effective remedy for reducing oxidative stress in arteries, thereby minimizing the onset of blood clots. 6. Black Seed Oil Black seed oil has been used from as far back as 1025 A.D. for its health and immune-boosting benefits. It is well documented in ancient texts. Due to its phytochemical and nutritional components, black seed oil is said to be highly effective in balancing immune function. It is particularly effective in supporting heart and cardiovascular health, metabolic health, and minimizing inflammation. A lot of research has been done to ascertain the effects of these supplements to boost the immune system. A [2007 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17868210/) on asthma patients displayed that symptoms eased in the group receiving black seed oil, while the placebo group did not show improvements. Researchers suggest that the effect of black seed oil on the immune system cannot be separated from its impact on metabolic health. This is because the metabolism influences the immune system. New research is continuously being done to ascertain the health benefits as an immune system booster of black seed oil. It's even being considered an ingredient for some pharmaceutical medications. 7. Valerian Root With its origins in Ancient Greece, Valerian root has been used for its multitude of benefits. The valerian plant displays white or pink flowers and is native to Asia and Europe. Nowadays, it's also grown in North America. Valerian root has been used to help people sleep for many centuries. It has been used to treat stress and calm one down. This remedy can be taken in many forms, including pills, tinctures, and teas. While it may not directly work on the immune system, its effects can help the immune system function better. By helping people get the rest and experience the calmness they need, the immune system is exposed to less strain, thereby allowing the body to fend off infections and illnesses more effectively. Scientists have established that valerian root has [mild sedative effects](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-valerian-root%231), which is why it is effective in treating stress and insomnia. However, scientists are not certain how the root assists in alleviating sleeplessness or stress. Currently, it is believed that a combination of factors assists. One factor is that valerian root is shown to increase gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the brain. GABA is a neurotransmitter, and therefore, it prevents undesirable activity in the nervous system. Higher levels of GABA have been shown to allow people to fall asleep faster and have better quality rest. Regarding the root's impact on stress, [ some research](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-valerian-root%231) indicates valerian acid is likely to be the cause of anxiety reduction. This acid showed anti-anxiety effects during the research. 8. Monolaurin A derivative of glycerin and lauric acid, and a coconut fat by-product, monolaurin is touted as having powerful immune support properties. The compound is said to be especially effective at [preventing cardiovascular disease and cholesterol issues](https://www.healthline.com/health/monolaurin%23health-benefits). It also has anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, antioxidant, and anti-atherogenic effects. Monolaurin is easily absorbed by the human body and is known to be safe to take. Some [ sources of lauric acid](https://www.healthline.com/health/monolaurin), and thereby monolaurin, include: - Coconut oil (highest percentage) - Fresh coconut and coconut milk - Coconut cream (raw or canned) - Dietary supplements - Human breast milk - Goat and cow's milk (small percentage) In the course of the last 20 years, investigation has been done into the possibility of applying monolaurin to areas such as food preservation, sanitization, and medication. Researchers are also looking to monolaurin to assist with the global antibiotic resistance issue. Many infections in food and hospitals are no longer quelled by existing antibiotics. This means people are dying of conditions that should be treatable today. Scientists are hoping monolaurin could form a part of a new antiviral and antibiotic medicine to respond to this crisis. As it hasn't been formally evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medical treatment, there are no official dosing rules. The main advocate of monolaurin, Dr. Jon Kabara, indicates that people 12 years old and up should take 750mg of monolaurin two to three times a day. They can slowly take more overtime, aiming to take up to 3000mg two to three times a day. While a lot of information about monolaurin has been established, more studies are necessary to ascertain its effects. Other Immune System Boosting Supplements Besides the vitamins, [herbs](https://www.mdbiowellness.com/blogs/doctors-desk/7-immune-boosting-herbs-other-support-for-immunity), and compounds discussed above, there are many other supplements to boost immune system health. Some of the most commonly used ones include the following: - Andrographis - Rich in [andrographolide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8622020/), this herb helps support the respiratory system. Andrographolide is a terpenoid compound that has antiviral effects against viruses that attack the respiratory system. It can help prevent or minimize the effects of influenza and other respiratory conditions. - Astragalus -This herb is commonly used by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners. Studies suggest [astragalus extract](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/astragalus)may improve immune responses in the body. - B complex vitamins - [Vitamins B12 and B6](https://www.nature.com/articles/1602439)are essential for a healthy immune response. Many people have a vitamin B deficiency, which may result in a weakened immune system. - Curcumin - This compound is [active in turmeric](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17211725/). It has been found to have strong anti-inflammatory properties. Studies show it may help strengthen immune system functioning. - Echinacea - A genus of the daisy family, echinacea species may help to improve immune system health. It may also help fight viruses that target the respiratory system. - Garlic - Studies indicate garlic has prevailing antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Research shows it enhances immunity by stimulating NK and macrophages (white blood cells). Results for humans are limited, however. - Licorice - This substance, with its unmistakable flavor that's loved by some and detested by others, has many components, such as glycyrrhizin, that could help defend the body against viruses. [Test-tube research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12814717/)shows that glycyrrhizin has antiviral action against coronavirus infections where severe respiratory issues are present. - Pelargonium sidoides -Research shows that extract from this plant is effective at easing [symptoms of respiratory problems](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24146345/)such as bronchitis and colds. Results are not yet conclusive, however. - Propolis - A substance created by honeybees as a hive sealant, propolis has [remarkable immunity-enhancing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6335834/)effects. It may also help to prevent viruses, though more research is necessary. - Selenium - Studies done with animals show selenium is an essential mineral for immune health. Research shows the substance may improve the [body's defense](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30593352/)against influenza strains. As you can see, research shows these substances can have significant immune system booster properties. However, it is worth remembering that a lot of these studies have been done with animals, not humans, so more research is necessary to find more conclusive results.
