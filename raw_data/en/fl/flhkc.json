Th e risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes is increased with influ enza-like infection, and vaccination against influenza may improve cardio vascular outcomes. Objectives T o assess the potential benets of influenza vaccination for pr imary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases on 18 October 20 13:The Cochrane Library (including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Economic Evaluation Database (EED) and Health T echnology Assessment database (HTA)), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science and ongoing trials registers ( www.controlled-trials.com/ andwww.clinicaltrials.gov ). We examined reference lists of relevant primary studies and systematic reviews. We perfor med a limited PubMed search on 20 February 2015, just before pu blication. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of influenza vaccination com pared with placebo or no treatment in participants with or with out cardiovascular disease, assessing cardiovascular death or non -fatal cardiovascular events. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The C ochrane Collaboration. We carried out meta-analyses only for cardiovascular death, as other outcomes were reported too infr equently. We expressed effect sizes as risk ratios (RRs), and we used random-effects models. Main results We included eight trials of influenza vaccination compared with p lacebo or no vaccination, with 12,029 participants receiving at l east one vaccination or control treatment. We included six new studie s (n = 11,251), in addition to the two included in the previous ver sion of the review. Four of these trials (n = 10,347) focused on preve ntion of influenza in the general or elderly population and re ported cardiovascular outcomes among their safety analyses; four tri als (n = 1682) focused on prevention of cardiovascular events in p atients with established coronary heart disease. These populations were analysed separately. Follow-up continued between 42 day s and one 1 Influenza vaccines for preventing cardiovascular disease ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.year. Five RCTs showed decits in at least three of the risk of b ias criteria assessed. When reported (seven studies), vaccinatio n provided adequate immunogenicity or protection against influenza. Car diovascular mortality was reported by four secondary prevent ion trials and was signicantly reduced by influenza vaccination overall (ri sk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% condence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.76; P val ue 0.003) with no signicant heterogeneity between studies, an d by three trials reporting cardiovascular mortality as part o f their safety analyses when the numbers of events were too small to permit co nclusions. In studies of patients with coronary heart disease , composite outcomes of cardiovascular events tended to be decreased with in fluenza vaccination compared with placebo. Generally no signica nt difference was found between comparison groups regarding ind ividual outcomes such as myocardial infarction. Authors' conclusions In patients with cardiovascular disease, influenza vaccination may reduce cardiovascular mortality and combined cardiovascular events. However, studies had some risk of bias, and results were not a lways consistent, so additional higher-quality evidence is ne cessary to conrm these ndings. Not enough evidence was available to est ablish whether influenza vaccination has a role to play in the pr imary prevention of cardiovascular disease. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Flu vaccines for preventing cardiovascular disease Flu infection may make cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart attack , stroke) and associated death more likely, and flu vaccination m ay reduce this risk. We included randomised studies comparing peo ple receiving flu vaccine with those receiving no vaccine (placebo or no treatment). For this review update, we found eight trials s tudying 12,029 participants. Four of these studies examined patients with known heart disease (1682 participants), and the other four focu sed on the general population or elderly people (10,347 parti cipants). The general population studies reported cardiovascular dise ase outcomes as part of their safety analyses, but the numbers of cases were too few to allow a judgement on whether flu vaccination was prote ctive in these populations, and no differences were seen betwe en groups. Overall, studies in people with heart disease sugge st that flu vaccination may reduce death as a result of cardiovascul ar disease and may reduce combined cardiovascular disease events (such as hea rt attacks, strokes, necessity for bypass operations, etc.). Ho wever, these studies were small and had some risk of bias, so larger s tudies of better quality are needed to conrm the results. B A C K G R O U N D This is an update of the original review published in 2008. Description of the condition Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the number one cause of death globally ( WHO 2011a ). Cardiovascular disease is the result of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and includes cerebr ovas- cular disease, coronary heart disease (CHD) and peripheral art erial disease (PAD) ( WHO 2011b ). In 2008, an estimated 17.3 million people died from CVD, representing 30% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.3 million were due to CHD and 6.2 million to stroke ( WHO 2011a ). More than 80% of CVD deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and the num- ber of CVD deaths is expected to increase to 23.3 million by 2030 (Mathers 2006 ;WHO 2011a ). These data demonstrate that new treatment modalities and better preventive strategies are needed.Description of the intervention Influenza vaccine is protective against influenza infection in healthy adults ( Jefferson 2007 ), and large cohort studies have shown that influenza vaccination is effective in preventing mor - bidity and mortality in the community. Influenza vaccination re - duces influenza-like disease, pneumonia and risk of death amon g elderly persons ( Nichol 2007 ). Furthermore, a possible associa- tion has been shown between influenza vaccination and reduced all-cause death, heart attack and stroke ( Nichol 2003 ). However, given the observational nature of these studies, the result s are po- tentially prone to bias ( Nelson 2007 ;Simonsen 2007 ). Generally, influenza vaccine is safe and well tolerated. Local r eac- tion (soreness, redness, tenderness or swelling) at the site of in- jection is observed in 64% of vaccinated people. Red eyes, fever , runny noise, hoarse voice and cough have occasionally been re- ported. Rarely, influenza vaccine can cause allergic reactions (im - mediate hypersensitivity reactions) ( Fiore 2010 ). No clear link 2 Influenza vaccines for preventing cardiovascular disease ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) has been observed over many years of vaccine use. However, if any risk should occur, no more than one or two cases per million vaccinations would be expected (ACIP 2012 ). In the light of all risks and benets, risk of a serious reaction to influenza vaccine is much less than risk of severe in- fluenza disease, which can be prevented by vaccination. Influenza vaccine is considered a very safe product with many benets, es- pecially for members of high-risk groups. How the intervention might work Increased risk of cardiovascular disease during influenza infe ction has been shown in a large case series that used within-person comparisons ( Smeeth 2004 ). Smeeth with rst myocardial infarction and 19,063 persons with rst stroke from the General Practitioner Database. They showed t hat, although no increase was seen after influenza vaccination, risk of acute cardiovascular events increased vefold in the rst three days after respiratory tract infection. In addition, risk of strok e increased threefold during this period. These ndings suggest a causal role for acute infection triggering cardiovascular events. Warren-Gash 2009 carried out a systematic review of the evidence that influenza infection triggers acute myocardial infection and cardiovascula r death. These review authors included 37 observational studi es and two randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Observational studi es showed a consistent association between influenza infection an d myocardial infarction. Evidence of an association with cardiova s- cular death was weaker. Investigators found similar associat ions in two subsequent large observational studies from the UK an d Hong Kong ( Warren-Gash 2011 ;Warren-Gash 2012 ). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain why influenz a infection may trigger cardiovascular events ( Hebsur 2014 ;Rogers 2012 ). Although several infectious agents are thought to increase cardiovascular risk through a cascade of systemic infection and subsequent inflammation, the influenza virus may play a more specic role in triggering acute events by exclusively targeti ng areas of atherosclerosis and destabilising preexisting plaques. tential mechanisms include high-density lipoprotein, loss of anti- inflammatory properties, endothelial dysfunction, deposit ion of immune complexes in atherosclerotic plaques and elevation of macrophage circulation into the arteries. Several studies have shown that influenza vaccination protects against acute coronary syndromes ( Naghavi 2000 ;Nichol 2003 ; Siscovick 2000 ). In a large cohort study, Nichol and co-work- ers found that hospitalisation for acute coronary syndromes was reduced among participants who received influenza vaccina- tion ( Nichol 2003 ). During two consecutive seasons, more than 140,000 members of managed care organisations 65 years of age or older were studied. During two consecutive years, influenza vaccination reduced the risk of hospitalisation for cardiac dis ease by 19% and reduced the risk of hospitalisation for cerebrovascu lar disease by 16%. Therefore investigators concluded that influe nzavaccination was associated with reduced risk of heart disease an d cerebrovascular disease during influenza season. Why it is important to do this review The observational nature of most studies makes it difcult to draw denitive conclusions, and many questions remain. Observati onal studies in this area may be prone to the following sources of bi as: (1) \"healthy user bias\", whereby 'healthy' people have higher v accine uptake than 'unhealthy' people and are likely to exhibit a ra nge of healthy behaviours and to have better health outcomes regard less of vaccination; (2) \"frailty selection bias\", by which more frail people who are closer to death may be less likely to receive influ enza vaccine than other people; and (3) apparent protective effects of influenza vaccine against death outside the influenza season, w hich are shown in some observational studies, suggesting residu al biases or mechanisms other than influenza prevention. In addition, the effectiveness of influenza vaccination is depe ndent on many factors including the age and immunity of recipients and the effectiveness of the vaccine. Indeed, influenza vaccination i s most effective when the inactive influenza strains in the vaccine match the circulating strains in the community. In seasons with a poor match, the reduction in hospitalisation and death is smal ler than in seasons with a good match ( Nichol 2007 ). Because effective influenza vaccines are cheap and widely availab le, use of influenza vaccination to prevent acute coronary syndromes is an appealing prevention strategy for those at risk. Whethe r influenza vaccination reduces cardiovascular disease remains no t fully established. This systematic review assesses the eff ects of in- fluenza vaccination in people with and without cardiovascular di s- ease for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. O B J E C T I V E S T o assess the potential benets of influenza vaccination for pr imary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review T ypes of studies We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing in- fluenza vaccination with placebo or no intervention when data on one of the outcomes was reported. We excluded all non-ran- domised controlled trials. 3 Influenza vaccines for preventing cardiovascular disease ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.T ypes of participants We included participants 18 years of age and older of either sex if influenza vaccination was given as a routine influenza preventi on programme, as primary prevention of myocardial infarction an d as secondary prevention. Participants may (secondary prevention ) or may not (primary prevention) have had a history of CVD (stable or unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke or PAD). We included participants who were taking medication. T ypes of interventions Influenza vaccination (inactivated whole virus, detergent-trea ted split products or puried haemagglutinin and neuraminidase sur- face antigen formulation of the three influenza virus strains in- fluenza A, B and C) administered by any route, at any dosage. We included studies comparing types, doses or schedules of influen za vaccine if one of the comparison groups received placebo or no in- tervention. Use of co-interventions was not an exclusion criter ion if the same were used in different comparison groups. T ypes of outcome measures T rials had to report one of the following outcomes. Primary outcomes For patients without previous cardiovascular disease, the fo llowing were primary outcomes. 1. First-time myocardial infarction. 2. First-time unstable angina. 3. Death from cardiovascular causes. For patients with previous cardiovascular disease, the follo wing were primary outcomes. 1. Myocardial infarction. 2. Unstable angina. 3. Death from cardiovascular causes. Secondary outcomes We also considered related outcomes (e.g. composite clinical out- comes). It was noted whether cardiovascular outcomes were re- ported as primary outcomes and whether the vaccine was shown to be effective in reducing influenza infection. Search methods for identication of studies We developed the search strategy for this review in accordance wi th guidelines of the Cochrane Heart Group. We applied no languag e restrictions.Electronic searches We sought all RCTs of influenza vaccination compared with placebo or no intervention, using the following databases, o n 18 October 2013. 1.

Search strategies from 2008 are provided inAppendix 2 . As the review update was broadened to CVD as compared with coronary heart disease, we have revised the sear ch strategies for the update and have run the search without date limits. The RCT lter for MEDLINE mended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic ventions (Lefebvre 2011 ). The RCT lter used for Web of Science is an adaptation of the Cochrane MEDLINE RCT lter. Searching other resources We searched reference lists of relevant primary studies and sy stem- atic reviews for further studies. We contacted the primary aut hors for additional information if necessary. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies T wo review authors (CC, NF) independently and systematically selected potentially eligible trials from the search. We exclu ded studies when they did not full the inclusion criteria. If elig ibility was unclear from the title/abstract of the record, we consulted t he full-text article. We resolved discrepancies in selection betwe en the two review authors by discussion. 4 Influenza vaccines for preventing cardiovascular disease ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Data extraction and management T wo review authors (CC, ZO) independently extracted data usin g a predened review form. We extracted the following data syst em- atically. 1. T rial characteristics: design, duration, country, setting. 2. Intervention: type and method of vaccination, control intervention. 3. Participants: inclusion and exclusion criteria, total numbe r and numbers in comparison groups, baseline characteristics (age , sex, cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular medication), similarity of groups at baseline, withdrawals, losses to fo llow-up. 4. Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes as per trial, myocardial infarction or reinfarction, unstable angina, deat h from cardiovascular causes and related outcomes. We resolved discrepancies in data extraction by discussion. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies We assessed risk of bias in trials by using the Cochrane 'Risk o f bias' tool, assessing the following criteria. 1. Random sequence generation (adequacy of method). 2. Allocation concealment. 3. Blinding of participants and personnel. 4. Handling of incomplete outcome data. 5. Dropouts/losses to follow-up. 6. Intention-to-treat analysis. 7. Selective reporting. 8. Similarity at baseline. 9. Any other bias noted. T wo review authors (CC, ZO) independently assessed risk of bi as, and we resolved discrepancies by discussion. Measures of treatment effect All outcomes of interest were dichotomous outcomes and were presented as risk ratios (RRs) at the last reported follow-up. Dealing with missing data When substantial information was missing (e.g. trial informa tion available only in abstract form), we contacted study authors to a sk for further information.Assessment of heterogeneity We assessed heterogeneity by using the I2statistic and the Chi2 statistic with signicance levels set at P value = 0.1. Data synthesis We summarised data on cardiovascular death in a meta-analysis using the method of Mantel-Haenzel and a random-effects model. We plotted data on other cardiovascular outcomes for graphical representation, but we applied no summary statistics, as het ero- geneity between studies was signicant. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Potentially relevant subgroup analyses include the followi ng. 1. Age (participants < 65 years or 65 years). 2. Sex (male vs female). 3. General population versus population with established CVD. 4. Among participants with established heart disease, participants with acute coronary syndrome versus those with stable angina/elective percutaneous coronary intervention. 5. Studies reporting effective protection of the vaccination against influenza versus studies reporting less effective pr otection against influenza.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 1. Study flow diagram. 6 Influenza vaccines for preventing cardiovascular disease ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Of 109 records examined in full, we considered 13 to be eligi- ble for inclusion, and we found two additional studies by sear ch- ing the reference sections of relevant reviews and by updating our search of databases of ongoing trials. These 15 records repres ented nine independent studies ( De Villiers 2009 2011 ;Wu 2010 ) (some of the 15 records were conference abstracts and have not been listed in the reference section). One of the trials was available in abstract f orm only ( IVCAD 2009 ), but we obtained additional information by contacting the study author. Six of these trials reported cardi o- vascular death ( FLUCAD 2011a ;Phrommintikul 2011 ) and could be included in a meta-analysis of this outcome. T wo had already been included in the previous version of the review ( FLUCAD 2008 ;FLUVACS 2002 ), and the remainder were newly added. Included studies For details of the study characteristics of individual studies , see Characteristics of included studies . Study design All included RCTs were parallel trials using individual rand omisa- tion. Four were multi-centre trials ), ( Wu ( Govaert 1994 ). Follow-up was provided be- tween 42 days and one year after vaccination. Participants Study participants fell within three main groups (n = 12,029 in total). The rst group of studies (n = 5267 participants) compris ed two RCTs including healthy adults over 18 years of age ( Langley 2011a ) or between 18 and 60 years of age ( Wu 2010 ). In the study byLangley 2011a , adults with controlled chronic disease were eligible, but no information was provided as to what proport ion of participants had chronic disease. Wu 2010 excluded participants with chronic disease. Participants in the study by Langley 2011a were between 18 and 91 years of age (mean age of participants younger than 65 years was around 39 years, and 72 years for participants 65 years of age or older), and mean age was around 42 years in the study by Wu 2010 . Between 40% and 47% of participants were men. The second group of two studies (n = 5080) included participants of 60 years of age or older ( De Villiers 2009 ;Govaert 1994 ) with controlled chronic conditions. Participants were between 60 an d98 years of age, mean age was around 70 years in the study by De Villiers 2009 and most participants were between 60 and 74 years old in the study by Govaert 1994 . Between 39% and 49% of par- ticipants were men. Between 13.5% and 16% had cardiac disease (undened), and 2% to 9% had diabetes mellitus. In the study by De Villiers 2009 , 50.5% of participants had hypertension. The third group comprised four studies (n = 1682) including par- ticipants with known coronary artery disease ( FLUCAD 2008 ; FLUVACS 2002 ;IVCAD 2009 ;Phrommintikul 2011 ) with vari- able age cutoffs (older than 21 to older than 50 years). FLUCAD 2008 andFLUVACS 2002 reported outcomes for subgroups of participants with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and those un- dergoing coronary revascularisation procedures. IVCAD 2009 also included these two groups of participants without distinguis h- ing between subgroups, and the study by Phrommintikul 2011 included participants admitted to hospital with an acute coro- nary syndrome. Mean age of participants was between 58 and 67 years, and between 52% and 74% were men. Studies included participants with acute MI (with ST or non-ST segment MI) as well as those with coronary stenosis or angina and those under go- ing revascularisation procedures. Details of the type of coron ary artery disease, of cardiovascular comorbidities and of pharma co- logical therapy for cardiovascular conditions can be found in the Characteristics of included studies . Interventions Details of the vaccines received can be found in Characteristics of included studies . Six trials gave single injections of influenza vaccine, and two trials gave a second dose after 21 days ( Langley 2011a ;Wu 2010 ). Most trials compared one intervention group with a control group, and only Wu 2010 included six intervention groups with different doses of whole or split virion vaccines w ith or without aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. In most trials, the co ntrol group received placebo injections; one trial had a 'no interven tion' control group ( Phrommintikul 2011 ). Outcome measures For half of the trials, the primary focus was on prevention of influenza infection (influenza/influenza-like illness or immun o- genicity) and cardiovascular outcomes were reported among the safety analyses ( De Villiers 2009 ;Govaert 1994 ;Langley 2011a ; Wu 2010 ); for the other half, the focus was on secondary cardio- vascular prevention ( FLUCAD 2008 ;FLUVACS 2002 ;IVCAD 2009 ;Phrommintikul 2011 ). Cardiovascular outcomes reported in safety analyses included car- diovascular death, stroke and angina. Three of the secondary prevention studies included cardiovascu lar death in their primary outcomes. Other outcomes were composite 7 Influenza vaccines for preventing cardiovascular disease ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.outcomes (major adverse coronary event (MACE - composite of cardiovascular death, acute MI, coronary revascularisation); cor o- nary ischaemic event (MACE or hospitalisation for myocardial i s- chaemia); double or triple endpoint of cardiovascular death, no n- fatal MI or severe recurrent ischaemia; acute coronary syndrome (acute MI or unstable angina)), acute MI, stroke, heart failure an d unstable angina or coronary revascularisation (percutaneous ca r- diac intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)). Protection against influenza If cardiovascular adverse events are associated with influenza infec- tion, it is important to show that the vaccines were really effe ctive in preventing infection. Four studies reported that influenz a in- fections were signicantly reduced by the vaccination ( De Villiers 2009 ;FLUCAD 2008 ;Govaert 1994 ;IVCAD 2009 ); three stud- ies reported that the vaccines produced adequate seroprotectio n (IVCAD 2009 ;Langley 2011a ;Wu 2010 ); one study reported that no cases of influenza were seen over the initial six-month f ol- low-up in the intervention or the comparison group ( FLUVACS 2002 ); and one study did not report on the effectiveness of the vaccination against influenza ( Phrommintikul 2011 ). Funding All trials reported their source of funding. One trial was fun ded by industry ( De Villiers 2009 ), three had mixed industrial ( FLUCAD 2008 ;Langley 2011a FLUVACS 2002 ; Govaert 1994 ;IVCAD 2009 2011 ).Ongoing studies The ongoing trial ( NCT01945268 ) is a double-blind secondary prevention RCT carried out in Canada (see Characteristics of ongoing studies ). Around 600 participants with heart disease (New York Heart Association functional class II, III and IV) are inclu ded, and the effects of influenza vaccination on major adverse vascula r events are evaluated. Excluded studies We excluded 95 records for the following reasons: The study was not an RCT (n = 59), eligible outcomes were not reported (n = 20) or the study did not have a placebo or 'no intervention' group (n = 14). One record could not be obtained (but was unlikely to be an RCT) and one ongoing trial was identied ( MacIntyre 2007 ), but contact with study authors suggested that the trial was abando ned and replaced by a case-control study. Risk of bias in included studies The overall risk of bias of included studies is shown in Figure 2 . Risk of bias for each individual study is shown in Figure 3 . None of the studies fullled all of the specied criteria. The three studies of highest quality had small decits in one or two of the criteri a (De Villiers 2009 ;FLUCAD 2008 ;Wu 2010 ), three studies had decits in three or four of the criteria ( Govaert 1994 ;Langley 2011a ;Phrommintikul 2011 ) and two studies had decits in more than half of the risk of bias criteria ( FLUVACS 2002 ;IVCAD 2009 ). 8 Influenza vaccines for preventing cardiovascular disease ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Allocation The randomisation process was clearly reported and adequate i n ve studies ( De Villiers 2009 ;FLUCAD 2008 ;Langley 2011a ; Phrommintikul 2011 ;Wu 2010 ); the others were unclear about method of randomisation. Only two studies had clearly adequa te allocation concealment ( FLUCAD 2008 ;Wu 2010 ). Blinding All of the studies reported blinding of outcome assessment. P artic- ipants and personnel were blinded in ve trials ( De Villiers 2009 ; FLUCAD 2008 ;Govaert 1994 ;Langley 2011a ;Wu 2010 ). One trial did not clearly describe whether participants and person nel were blinded ( FLUVACS 2002 ); in the IVCAD 2009 study, only participants were blinded; and in another study ( Phrommintikul 2011 ), blinding was not possible as the control was 'no interven- tion'. Incomplete outcome data Attrition bias was adequately addressed in most trials, and two studies did not provide a clear description ( IVCAD 2009 ;Langley 2011a ). Dropouts and losses to follow-up were generally well bal- anced between comparison groups. The proportion of participan ts who completed the study ranged between 89% and 100% (over 95% for most studies). All but two studies ( Govaert 1994 ;IVCAD 2009 ) clearly used intention-to-treat analysis. Selective reporting Most studies reported outcomes as outlined in the Methods sect ion of the respective paper. The FLUVACS 2002 study reported on certain composite outcomes that were subsequently not reporte d, and some of the outcomes were only selectively reported in the subgroups assessed. Information on the IVCAD 2009 study was available only in abstract form and from information provide d by the study author, so whether outcomes were reported as origin ally planned could not be assessed. Other potential sources of bias Most studies reported that comparison groups were balanced at baseline with respect to the most important characteristics. A d if- ference in the proportion of participants taking calcium channel blockers at baseline may have been seen in the FLUCAD 2008 study (signicance not reported). The authors of the FLUVACS 2002 study stated that groups were balanced with respect to age, sex and signs of necrosis (undened), but some of the other pa- rameters reported look less well balanced (e.g. hypertension , dis- tribution of types of MI). In the study by Phrommintikul 2011 ,a small signicant difference was observed in participants tak ing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensi n II receptor blockers at baseline. Wu 2010 reported a limited number of baseline characteristics. A power analysis was carried out and power was adequate in the f ol- lowing studies: De Phrommintikul 2011 . A power analysis was carried out in the FLUVACS 2002 study, but the actual number of participants sug- gests that the study was underpowered for measuring the prim ary outcome. Effects of interventions Cardiovascular death Cardiovascular death was reported by all secondary preventio n studies and by three of the studies reporting mortality as pa rt of their safety analyses. Overall analyses for cardiovascular d eath are shown in Analysis 1.2 . In the secondary prevention studies, signicantly fewer cardi ovas- cular deaths occurred in the vaccine group than in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% condence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.76, P value 0.003) with no signicant heterogeneity betw een studies. Cardiovascular death occurred in 2.3% of participants in the vaccine groups and in 5.1% of those in the control groups. Among individual studies, only FLUVACS 2002 reported a signif- icantly lower cardiovascular death rate in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (6.2% vs 17.7%, P value 0.002) at one year; thi s was not maintained at two-year follow-up (P value 0.14). Among subgroups of participants with acute coronary syndromes/MI an d those with stable angina/percutaneous cardiac intervention s in the FLUCAD 2008 andFLUVACS 2002 studies, no signicant dif- ference in cardiovascular death was seen in either of the subgro ups overall. In studies reporting cardiovascular death as part of their saf ety analyses, no signicant difference in cardiovascular death was ob- served between vaccine and placebo groups. Cardiovascular deat h occurred in 0.7% of participants in the vaccine groups and in 0.8% of participants in the placebo groups. The outcome reported by De Villiers 2009 was death from all causes; the distribution of causes of death was not given for th e comparison groups, but study authors stated that the most fre - quent causes of death were MI, cardiac failure and cerebrovascu- lar disorders, and that these occurred in statistically simila r pro- portions of vaccine and placebo recipients (all P values 0.422; Analysis 1.1 ). 11 Influenza vaccines for preventing cardiovascular disease ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Other cardiovascular outcomes Analysis 1.4 toAnalysis 1.14 show results for other cardiovascular events as reported by study investigators. Studies targeting a reduction in cardiovascular events report ed a range of cardiovascular outcomes. In the FLUCAD 2008 study, no signicant differences in major ad- verse coronary events (MACE - cardiovascular death, MI or coro- nary revascularisation) over 12 months were reported in the v ac- cine group compared with the placebo group (3.00% vs 5.87%, P value 0.13; Analysis 1.3 ). However, the rate of coronary ischaemic events (MACE or hospitalisation for myocardial ischaemia) ove r 12 months was signicantly lower in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (6.02% vs 9.97%, P value 0.047; Analysis 1.4 ). This applied to the participant population overall and to the subg roup with an acute coronary syndrome, but no signicant difference in coronary ischaemic events was noted in the subgroup with stabl e angina. No signicant difference was reported between groups in terms of individual cardiac events, namely, cardiovascular de ath, MI (ST segment elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST segment el- evation for myocardial (see Analysis 1.15 ;Analysis 1.10 ; Analysis 1.14 ). This applied to the participant population overall and to both subgroups (those with an acute coronary syndrome and those with stable angina). Multi-variate analyses identi ed fe- male sex (hazard ratio (HR) 2.15, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.15%, P value 0.024) and recent acute coronary syndrome (HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.52 to 5.65, P value 0.001) as predictors of coronary ischaemic events, and influenza vaccination was found to be protective (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.78, P value 0.009). No effects were seen for age, smoking, hypertension, lipop rotein (LDL)-cholesterol, diabetes mellitus. In the FLUVACS 2002 study (see Analysis 1.5 ;Analysis 1.6 ; Analysis 1.15 ;Analysis 1.10 ;Analysis 1.14 ), the triple endpoint (acute MI, rehospitalisation for recurrent angina, death) was seen less frequently in the vaccine group than in the placebo group fo r the whole population (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85, P value 0.009) and in the subgroup with acute MI (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.83, P value 0.008) but not for the PCI stenting subgroup a t six months. No signicant difference in MI was reported in either s ub- group. Also no signicant differences in cardiac revascularisa tion were noted in the PCI stenting group. Among participants with acute MI, signicantly fewer were rehospitalised for ischaemi a in the vaccine group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.0, P value 0.03), and signicantly fewer participants had a double endpoint (of r ein- farction, hospitalisation for ischaemia and death) (RR 0.30, 9 5% CI 0.22 to 1.28, P value 0.03). These results were largely main - tained at one-year follow-up. In the whole study group, 22% of participants had a triple endpoint in the vaccine group and 37% i n the placebo group (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.86, P value 0.004). The difference was also signicant in the subgroup with acute MI at one year (19% vs 42%, RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.71, not in the PCI stenting group. Signicant benet o f the vaccination for occurrence of the double endpoint was seen only in the MI subgroup (10% vs 28%, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.72, P value 0.002), not in the whole study population. No signicant difference in MI or rehospitalisation for ischaemi a was seen. Cox regression analyses were done for the combined trip le endpoint at one year for the following subgroups: participan ts older or younger than 65 years, those with ST segment elevati on or non-ST segment elevation MI, participants with elevation or n o elevation of enzymes at entry, those with diabetes or no diab etes, participants with a history or no history of smoking, those wi th thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk score below or above 6 and participants with a history or no history of revascu - larisation. Signicantly greater benet with influenza vaccin ation was seen among participants with non-ST segment elevation MI (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.52, P value 0.004), those older than 65 years (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.92, P value not given), non- smokers (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.57, P value not given) and those at high risk for future ischaemic episodes (TIMI risk sco re > 6) (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.87, P value not given). The IVCAD 2009 study reported no signicant differences be- tween the vaccination group and the placebo group in individual cardiovascular outcomes over one year (CABG, PCI, MI, episodes of unstable angina, cardiovascular death; see Analysis 1.8 ;Analysis 1.9;Analysis 1.10 ;Analysis 1.13 ). Signicantly more participants with at least one cardiac adverse event (acute coronary syndrome , coronary revascularisation, cardiovascular death) were repor ted in the placebo group than in the vaccine group at six months, but this nding was not maintained at one-year follow-up (29% in the intervention group vs 26% in the placebo group, P value 0.6;Analysis 1.7 ). Study authors also reported that angina sever- ity scores were more improved in the vaccine group than in the placebo group. In the study by Phrommintikul 2011 (seeAnalysis 1.3 ;Analysis 1.11;Analysis 1.12 ;Analysis 1.14 ), participants in the vaccine group had signicantly fewer major adverse coronary events (MACE, composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation fo r acute coronary syndrome, heart failure or stroke) at 12 months than did participants in the placebo group (9.5% vs 19.3%, unad- justed HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.86, P value 0.004). The rate of hospitalisation for acute coronary syndrome was also signica ntly lower in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (4.5% vs 10.6%, unadjusted HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.91, P value 0.032). Effects for these two outcomes remained signicant with adjust - ments for age, sex, serum creatinine, ACE inhibitor treatmen coronary revascularisation. difference was repo rted for cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure or hospi- talisation for stroke. No signicant difference in effects for MACE was observed for the following subgroups: participants youn ger than 65 years or older than 65 years, male or female participan ts, those with or without diabetes mellitus, participants with S T seg- ment elevation or non-ST segment elevation MI, those with ser um 12 Influenza vaccines for preventing cardiovascular disease ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.creatinine levels less than 1.1 mg/dL or greater than 1.1. mg/ dL and participants with or without revascularisation. Limited information on non-fatal cardiovascular adverse even ts was reported by studies that included cardiovascular events in their safety analyses. Govaert 1994 reported three cases of 'intercurrent illness (undened), cerebrovascular accident' - two in the placebo group (0.2%) and one in the vaccine group (0.1%) (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.41). Wu 2010 reported ve cases of angina in the intervention groups (0.8%) and none in the placebo groups (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.1 to 32.85). Adverse events De Villiers 2009 reported that more reactogenicity events (includ- ing runny nose/nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, headache , muscle aches, tiredness and decreased appetite) occurred in the vaccine group 11 days after vaccination (P value 0.042). No signif- icant differences in serious adverse events were observed bet ween vaccination and placebo groups over four weeks (1% vs 1.5%, P value 0.27) or eight months (10.1% vs 8.6%) post vaccination. In the study by Langley 2011a , no signicant differences were observed between vaccine and placebo groups over one year in reporting of one or more serious adverse events (3.2% vs 4.0%) or reporting of one or more medically attended events (30% vs 30.4%). Wu 2010 reported the following rates of adverse events for the different intervention groups over 42 days: whole virion + A l 5 \u00b5g 12.9%, whole virion + Al 10 \u00b5g + Al \u00b5g 11.9% and placebo 7.0%. The highest rate was seen with whole virion + Al 10 \u00b5g vaccine (P value 0.016 vs whole virion + Al 15 \u00b5g), but no signicant association with dosage, presence of aluminium adjuvant or type of vaccine (whole virion vs split virion) was described. The rate of mild adverse event s ranged between 5.0% and 17.6%, that of moderate adverse even ts between 0 and 2.0% and that of severe adverse events between 0 and 1%. No adverse events beyond the cardiovascular outcomes already summarised were reported in the following studies: FLUCAD 2008 ,Govaert 1994 ,IVCAD 2009 andPhrommintikul 2011 . D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results We included eight trials of influenza vaccination compared with placebo or no vaccination, with 12,029 participants receiving at least one vaccination or control treatment. Four of these trial s (n = 10,347) focused on prevention of influenza in general or elde rly populations and reported cardiovascular outcomes among theirsafety analyses, and four trials (n = 1682) focused on preventi on of cardiovascular events among participants with established coro- nary heart disease. Follow-up was between 42 days and one year . When reported (seven studies), vaccination provided adequate immunogenicity or protection against influenza. Cardiovascul ar mortality was reported by four secondary prevention trials a nd was signicantly reduced by influenza vaccination (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% condence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.76, P value 0.003) with no signicant heterogeneity between studies. In three t rials reporting cardiovascular mortality as part of their safety an alyses, no differences were found between study groups, but numbers o f events were too small to permit conclusions. Among studies of participants with coronary heart disease, composite outcomes o f cardiovascular events also tended to be decreased with influenz a vaccination compared with placebo. Generally no signicant dif- ference was observed between comparison groups regarding ind i- vidual outcomes such as myocardial infarction. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence As the main focus of the general population studies including ca r- diovascular events in their safety analyses was not cardiovas cular prevention, these studies were most likely underpowered fo r as- sessing cardiovascular events. Often reporting of cardiovascu lar death and of details on non-fatal cardiovascular events was ver y limited. Studies of participants with coronary heart disease gener- ally included small sample sizes (around 100 to 150 participant s per comparison group in most), often without power analyses or with clear evidence that they were underpowered. Quality of the evidence Moderate risk of bias was seen, with ve RCTs showing decits in at least three of the risk of bias criteria assessed. This in cluded three studies of participants with coronary artery disease, a nd only one of these studies was rated as having low risk of bias ( FLUCAD 2008 ). Potential biases in the review process This review included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to assess effects of influenza vaccination on cardiovas- cular events. Given that these events are rare, especially in p rimary prevention trials, future updates of the review may benet f rom more detailed examination of observational data on the asso ciation between influenza vaccination and prevention of cardiovascular events. 13 Influenza vaccines for preventing cardiovascular disease ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews We identied two other systematic reviews of the association between influenza vaccination and cardiovascular outcomes ( Loomba 2012 ;Udell 2013 ).Loomba 2012 summarised three RCTs and two observational studies including a total of 292,3 83 participants. Included studies examined participants with car dio- vascular disease and mixed populations with and without cardi o- vascular disease. Overall, their meta-analyses showed a sign icant reduction in all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% 0.57 MI (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.93) and major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.74). The review had some quality decits, and results should be vie wed with caution. The systematic review by Udell 2013 was of higher quality. The review authors included RCTs (sample size of at least 50) of adu lts comparing experimental or commercially approved influenza vac- cinations with placebo, no vaccination or another vaccination strategy. The same four trials of participants with coronary a rtery disease examining cardiovascular outcomes were included as in t he present review ( FLUCAD 2008 ;FLUVACS 2002 ;IVCAD 2009 ; Phrommintikul 2011 ), along with two of the studies including cardiovascular events in their safety analyses ( De Villiers 2009 ; Govaert 1994 ), as well as safety analyses of six RCTs compar- ing different vaccine formulations. A meta-analysis of ve RCT s (three of participants with coronary artery disease and two wit h cardiovascular events in their safety analyses) showed a sign icant reduction in composite cardiovascular events with influenza vac- cination compared with control (2.9% vs 4.7%, CI 0.48 to 0.86, P value 0.003). When cardiovascular mortality was examined in the same ve trials, no signicant effect was se en overall (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.83, P value 0.61). The great- est effects of the vaccine were seen among participants at highes t risk with more active coronary disease. These results are consi stent with those of the present review. Findings of this review are in line with international recomm en- dations for practice. Patients with chronic heart disease are g ener- ally believed to be at high risk for influenza infection, and di ffer- ent guidelines highly recommend use of influenza vaccine in thes e groups. The current influenza vaccination guideline in the UK recom- mends annual influenza vaccination for patients with chronic he art disease, including those with congenital heart disease, hype rten- sion with cardiac complications or chronic heart failure, and fo r individuals requiring regular medication and/or follow-up f or is- chaemic heart disease ( UK Dept of Health 2014/15 ). Both the Eu- ropean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDPC) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rec- ommend influenza vaccination for individuals with chronic car-diovascular diseases such as congenital heart disease, congest ive heart failure and coronary artery disease ( CDC Europe 2014/15 ; CDC USA 2015 ). The World Health Organization (WHO) categorises patients wit h cardiac diseases (atherosclerotic heart disease, cardiomyopa thy/ chronic congestive heart failure and congenital heart disease ) in the high-risk group and recommends annual influenza vaccina- tion in accordance with resources available in each country ( WHO 2012 ). A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice Available RCTs did not provide enough information to show th e effectiveness of influenza vaccination in the primary preventi on of cardiovascular death or non-fatal cardiovascular events. In pat ients with established cardiovascular disease, limited evidence su ggests that influenza vaccination may reduce cardiovascular mortality and combined cardiovascular events. Implications for research Future studies of primary and secondary prevention of cardiov as- cular events by influenza vaccination must be adequately powere d to measure these outcomes and must observe other established quality criteria. Studies should be carried out in population s with established cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hyperlipidaemi a, hy- pertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity) to determine the e ffects of influenza vaccination in the primary prevention of cardiovascul ar disease - not just among inpatients with established cardiov ascular disease. In general population studies, subgroups of parti cipants with cardiovascular risk factors and subgroups of elderly part ici- pants (e.g. 65 years or older) should be examined with respect t o cardiovascular events.
