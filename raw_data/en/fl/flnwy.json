This next-generation bivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b5, consists of RNAs encoding enhanced prefusion spike proteins for the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain (wild-type) and an Omicron variant. The enhanced spike protein encoded from the mRNAs in BNT162b5 has been modified with the aim of increasing the magnitude and breadth of the immune response that could better protect against COVID-19. This is the first of multiple vaccine candidates with an enhanced design which the companies plan to evaluate as part of a long-term scientific COVID-19 vaccine strategy to potentially generate more robust, longer-lasting, and broader immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated COVID-19. BNT162b5 will be evaluated in a U.S.-based study enrolling approximately 200 participants aged between 18 and 55 who have received one booster dose of a U.S.-authorized COVID-19 vaccine at least 90 days prior to their first study visit. Participants will be stratified by the number of months since their last dose of COVID-19 vaccine received prior to entering the study (three to six months or more than six months). The study does not include a placebo (injection with no active ingredient). For more information about this study please visit [www.clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov) [on this link. ](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05472038?term=NCT05472038&draw=2&rank=1) The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, BNT162b2, which is based on BioNTech's proprietary mRNA technology, was developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer.

The booster schedule is based on the labeling information of the vaccine used for the primary series - a second booster dose to individuals 50 years of age and older who have received a first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine - a second booster dose to individuals 12 years of age and older with certain kinds of immunocompromise and who have received a first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine Emergency Use Authorization Emergency uses of the vaccine have not been approved or licensed by FDA, but have been authorized by FDA, under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) in individuals 6 months of age and older. The emergency uses are only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under Section 564(b)(1) of the FD&C Act unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. INTERCHANGEABILITY FDA-approved COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine FDA authorized for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for individuals 12 years of age and older can be used interchangeably by a vaccination provider when prepared according to their respective instructions for use. The formulations of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine authorized for use in individuals 6 months through 4 years of age, 5 through 11 years of age, and 12 years of age and older are different and should therefore not be used interchangeably. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine authorized for use in children 6 months through 11 years of age should not be used interchangeably with COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA). IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Tell your vaccination provider about all of the vaccine recipient's medical conditions, including if the vaccine recipient: - has any allergies - has had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) - has a fever - has a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner - is immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects the immune system - is pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding - has received another COVID-19 vaccine - has ever fainted in association with an injection Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) may not protect all vaccine recipients - The vaccine recipient should not receive Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) if the vaccine recipient has had a severe allergic reaction to any of its ingredients or had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae - There is a remote chance that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where the vaccine was administered for monitoring after vaccination. If the vaccine recipient experiences a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest hospital Seek medical attention right away if the vaccine recipient has any of the following symptoms: - difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over the body, dizziness, and weakness - Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received the vaccine, more commonly in males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low Seek medical attention right away if the vaccine recipient has any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine, particularly during the 2 weeks after receiving a vaccine dose: - Chest pain - Shortness of breath - Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart - Fainting - Unusual and persistent irritability - Unusual and persistent poor feeding - Unusual and persistent fatigue or lack of energy - Persistent vomiting - Persistent pain in the abdomen - Unusual and persistent cool, pale skin - Fainting can happen after getting injectable vaccines, including Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA). Sometimes people who faint can fall and hurt themselves. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask the vaccine recipient to sit or lie down for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine - Some people with weakened immune systems may have reduced immune responses to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) - Additional side effects include rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, injection site pain, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, injection site swelling, injection site redness, nausea, feeling unwell, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, arm pain, and fainting in association with injection of the vaccine and irritability These may not be all the possible side effects of the vaccine. Call the vaccination provider or healthcare provider about bothersome side effects or side effects that do not go away. - You should always ask your healthcare providers for medical advice about adverse events.
