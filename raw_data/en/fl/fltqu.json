Beginning next June (2014) I will have 3-4 months off in which I am interested in learning more about healing in different cultures. I understand Ayurveda is a complex field that takes several years of study and practice. Because of this, I do not think I am interested in a short-term course, but instead would be interested in 'shadowing' a chiropractor or ayurvedic practitioner for a couple months. Is this something that is common for foreigners? Does anyone have any advice on how to contact professionals to inquire about their willingness to 'teach' me? I understand Kerala is a popular Ayurveda destination, but I would be looking more at northern India - no specific destination. Unfortunately I speak only English and Spanish so will not be versed in local dialect. Thank you for "}
