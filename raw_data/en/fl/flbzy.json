Natural Medicine The past 30 years has seen an extraordinary increase in consumer demand for safe, effective, and cost-effective natural medicine. Naturopathic medicine has emerged as the health-care profession best suited to meet this demand, with naturopathic doctors trained in the art and science of both natural and conventional medicine. Naturopathic medicine is recognized as one of the original systems of medicine offering safe, effective patient-centered care that is a vital part of healthcare in the twenty-first century. Naturopathic Medicine Principals The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medical practice: - The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae): Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process through the use of natural medicines. - Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. - First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere): Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: - Utilize methods and natural medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; - Avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; and - Acknowledge, respect, and work with individuals' self-healing process. - - Doctor as Teacher (Docere): Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. - Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic physicians treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. - Prevention: Naturopathic physicians emphasize the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and by making appropriate natural medicine interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. -American Association of Naturopathic Physicians Naturopathic Doctor: Portland Oregon Natural medicine works effectively in a wide variety of acute and chronic problems, including infections, allergies, gynecologic difficulties, digestive problems, etc. It also be used to help prevent future trouble by increasing the individual's strength and resistance to disease.
