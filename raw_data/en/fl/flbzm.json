Soto Street, Suite 302D, Los Angeles, CA 90032. davidbla@usc.edu Mindfulness meditation represents a mental training framework for cultivating the state of mindful awareness in daily life. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in how mindfulness meditation improves human health and well-being. Although studies have shown that mindfulness meditation can improve self-reported measures of disease symptomatology, the effect that mindfulness meditation has on biological mechanisms underlying human aging and disease is less clear. To address this issue, we conducted the rst comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of mindfulness meditation on immune system parameters, with a specic focus on ve outcomes: (1) circulating and stimulated inflammatory proteins, (2) cellular transcription factors and gene expression, (3) immune cell count, (4) immune cell aging, and (5) antibody response. This analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity across studies with respect to patient population, study design, and assay procedures. The ndings suggest possible effects of mindfulness meditation on specic markers of inflammation, cell-mediated immunity, and biological aging, but these results are tentative and require further replication. On the basis of this analysis, we describe the limitations of existing work and suggest possible avenues for future research. Mindfulness meditation may be salutogenic for immune system dynamics, but additional work is needed to examine these effects. is an intrinsic and modiable capac- ity of the human mind. As a state and process of consciousness, it is most commonly dened as \"the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudg- mentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment\" (p. 145).1Mindfulness meditation, in turn, represents a systematic framework and process for cultivating mindfulness in daily life by inten- tional and sustained practice. Several standardized programs have been devel- oped for cultivating mindfulness meditation, with the goal of realizing its potential benets for human health and well-being. Credit is ordinarily assigned to the 1970s Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduc- tion (MBSR) program as the rst standardizedmindfulness-based intervention (MBI). These pro- grams are based on secularized teachings from var- ious historical mindfulness meditation traditions, especially Eastern humanistic contemplative tradi- tions rooted in the cultivation of personal insight and wisdom.2,3T o reduce symbolic dissonance and surmount cultural barriers to access and participa- tion, MBIs serve as a template for translating ancient teachings into a language and practice that is accept- able and easily understood by contemporary society. The presence of MBIs in major healthcare settings is at an all-time high. Indeed, almost 80% of the 140 accredited medical schools or their associated universities in the United States presently incorporate MBIs into their treatment, education, and/or research programs.4Reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown doi: 10.1111/nyas.12998 1 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. xxxx (2016) 1-12 C/circlecopyrt2016 New York Academy of Sciences.Mindfulness meditation and the immune system Black & Slavich that MBIs can exert some benecial effects on stress-related ailments, psychiatric disorders, and disease symptomatology.5-9However, mindfulness meditation is not regarded as a therapeutic panacea for all ailments, and the effects of MBIs on health appear similar in magnitude to those demonstrated by other conventional approaches for treating stress, pain, and illness, including the administration of psychoactive medications, psychotherapy, health education, and behavior modication.6,10-15MBIs nevertheless enjoy increasing appeal, stemming from a mix of promising empirical evidence, a modern medicine paradigm that increasingly emphasizes the role of patients as active and accountable participants in health care (e.g., self-management of disease and engagement in preventive behaviors),16-18and a growing emphasis on transtherapeutic interventions.19 So far, the research base documenting the effectiveness of MBIs relies heavily on participants' self-reports of their own health status, which can be prone to bias.2,8,10,20A more recent, yet relatively small, literature also exists examining how MBIs affect objective biological markers of human health,21but to date, no comprehensive literature reviews have been conducted to evaluate how mindfulness meditation influences biological processes that are most centrally involved in disease pathogenesis. Markers of immune system activity are particularly relevant in this context, given that immune system dynamics have been implicated in several major mental and physical health problems, including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, certain types of cancer, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression.22,23Therefore, in the present review, we examined the question of whether MBIs can influence peripheral biomarkers of immune system activity. T o conduct this review, we performed a compre- hensive literature search that involved identifying all of the RCTs that tested the effects of mindful- ness meditation on immune system biomarkers. We focused specically on ve immune system outcomes that are relevant for health, namely (1) circulating and stimulated inflammatory proteins, (2) cellular transcription factors and gene expression, (3) immune cell count, (4) immune cell aging, and (5) antibody response. Below, we describe the methods and results of this systematicreview. We then discuss the ndings and highlight lingering issues and possible avenues for future research in order to help advance the goal of better understanding how mindfulness meditation may shape biological aging and disease. Literature review methods and ndings We scanned all potentially relevant articles pub- lished between January 1966 and July 2015 to examine the literature on mindfulness meditation and immune system activity. The year 1966 was selected as a start date because this was when the rst empirical paper on mindfulness meditation appeared. The terms immune ,inflammation , cytokine ,proinflammatory ,biomarker ,blood ,saliva , urine ,telomere ,a n d infection were used to search the American Mindfulness Research Association's publication database (www.goAMRA.org), which archives over 4000 published journal articles, pulling from comprehensive monthly literature searches of PubMed, Ovid, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Citations were also received from researchers in the eld, and table-of- content searches were conducted for topic-specic journals. In addition to the computer-assisted searches, bibliographies of previous publications on the topic were screened for relevant articles. When required, authors were contacted to clarify details regarding their study methods or blood sampling protocols. Articles were included if they (1) used an RCT design, (2) administered mindfulness meditation as the main intervention element, (3) objectively assessed a biomarker of immune-related activity, and (4) were published in English. Description of the eld of work Included studies A total of 20 RCT studies met the inclusion criteria mentioned above and were thus included (Table 1). Two studies resulted in multiple publications, but these data were only counted once (Table 1; Study column). The mean sample size of these 20 studies was n=80 (range: 21-201), and a total of 1602 participants were included in the analysis. Comparison conditions Less than half of the studies ( n=8; 40%) admin- istered a comparison condition that accounted for the nonspecic effects of the intervention protocol, including time, attention, and group 2 Ann.

Active comparator programs included exer- cise, sleep hygiene, group therapies, mind-body medicine, health education courses, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Half of the studies used a wait- ing list or usual care group for comparison to mind- fulness meditation ( n=10; 50%), which did not account for nonspecic effects. Other nonequiv- alent comparator groups included less intensive single-day educational courses, access to resource services, and short-term respite care for caregivers (n=2; 10%). Sample selection Females were oversampled, as 14 of the 20 stud- ies examined (70%) had samples that were 60% or more female. This is partly due to disease- specic recruitment of breast cancer patients, but may also indicate possible participation bias favor- ing females due to sex differences in motivation to practice mindfulness meditation or participation in research studies focused on health and wellness. Supporting this last possibility, studies sampling the general community, university staff, and corpo- rate employees also showed proportionately greater female participation. T en studies (50%) selected samples on the basis of disease inclusion criteria (e.g., breast cancer, HIV positive, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis), and ve studies (25%) recruited participants on the basis of a proposed risk factor (e.g., aging, poor sleep, loneliness, over- weight/obesity, cardiovascular disease). Finally, ve studies (25%) recruited healthy volunteers (e.g., cor- porate employees, older adults, meditators, or com- munity residents). Intervention dosage All but three studies included in this review admin- istered an MBSR or MBSR-derived program (i.e., MBSR with cognitive therapy or additional psy- choeducational content), indicating high similarity in intervention type across studies. Of the remaining interventions, two studies reported on the use of a standardized Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs) course, and one study broadly dened their pro- gram as mindfulness, compassion, and equanim- ity meditations led by a senior meditation teacher. Of note, MAPs and the generalized mindfulness program appeared to be conceptually the same as MBSR and differed only in program dosage and degree of documented standardization. All classes were administered in weekly group-based sessionsspanning 6-10 weeks. Eight of the studies (40%) held an additional single-day intensive meditation retreat per conventional MBSR administration. Par- ticipants in one study lived at the retreat location for 3 months and practiced daily meditation. Collection of biological specimens Eighteen studies (90%) collected peripheral blood via venipuncture for processing of the target blood specimen or cell type. The most commonly reported processing protocol was the extraction of periph- eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using coll for immune bioassay. This method is used to iso- late leukocytes (white blood cells consisting of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells) from other more pre- dominant immune cells (i.e., granulocytes, includ- ing neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils). Nasal mucous was collected in one study using a nasal wash approach during participant acute respiratory infection episodes.24Another study induced skin blisters using a vacuum-pressurized blister template and subsequently collected blister fluid.25 Excluded studies Six studies tested the effect of a mindfulness meditation intervention on at least one immune parameter,26-33but were excluded because they lacked an RCT design. In brief, these quasi- experimental studies used nonrandomized matched control and single-group cohort designs. The median sample size of these six studies was n=51 (range: 34-66), with samples consisting of breast cancer and prostate cancer patients, experienced meditators, HIV-diagnosed individuals, and women with a trauma history. Blood was collected in ve studies (83%), and saliva was collected in one study. All interventions were MBSR or MBSR- derived programs. Signicant changes in immune measures were observed for levels, count, activity, or expression of interleukins (IL)-4, T cell expressed and presumably secreted to stromal-derived factor ratio (RANTES/SDF-1); and telomere length. Findings from these studies may suggest potential biomarker targets for future investigation, but the results are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution. 5 Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Table 1 pro- vides descriptions and the results of the 20 studies included in this review. Circulating and stimulated inflammatory proteins Inflammatory proteins are produced by immune cells and serve as extracellular communicators dur- ing immune system activity. When circulating, these proteins propagate proinflammatory (e.g., liver-derived IL-10 cytokine) effects. These proteins are essential for systemic preservation (i.e., protection against autoimmu- nity and septic shock) and immune cell differen- tiation; however, dysregulated and chronically ele- vated levels of proinflammatory proteins increase risk for disease, poor healing, and mortality.34-36Of the 20 studies reviewed, nine measured inflamma- tory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IFN-I, CRP . Five studies quantied circulating levels,37-42 and one additional study reported on stimulated levels,42of IL-6 in blood. Of these studies, one study of female breast cancer patients engaging in a 6-week MAPs course (compared to a waiting-list control group) showed a relative reduction in post-intervention circulating levels of IL-6 that was dependent on the frequency of practice dosage.37 Three studies measured IL-8,24,25,39one of which showed a relative increase in IL-8 in nasal secretions in older community-dwelling adults after an 8-week MBSR course (compared to moderate-intensity exercise).24In addition, two studies measured IL-10 in blood,24,39one of which showed a relative increase in IL-10 in ulcerative colitis patients after MBSR (compared to a matched mind-body medicine pro- gram), specically among patients who experienced as y m p t o m a t i cfl a r eu p .39Four studies measured TNF- /H9251,25,37,41,43of which one study of healthy community volunteers showed reductions in TNF- /H9251in blister fluid following MBSR, with these effects being dependent on practice time,25and a second study of ulcerative colitis patients showed a trend effect for reductions in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated TNF- /H9251production following MBSR intervention.43Furthermore, three studies mea- sured IFN,37,44,45one of which showed a relative increase in IFN-I in female breast cancer patients after a 6-week MAPs intervention.37As e c o n ds t u d y showed that females recovering from breast cancer who received MBSR had an increased IFN- /H9253/IL-4 ratio. Finally, six studies measured CRP ,37-41,46of which three showed a reduction in CRP , with one study showing reduced CRP levels after MBSR among non-flared patients with ulcerative colitis,39 and two other studies showing a trend for reduced CRP levels after MBSR-type programs among non- diseased samples displaying an inflammatory risk factor.38,40 Cellular transcription factors and gene expression Transcription factors are intracellular molecules that, in immune cells, modulate the activity of immune response genes and their production of extracellular proteins.47For example, nuclear factor- /H9260B( N F - /H9260B) is a transcription factor that, when activated, translocates into the cell nucleus and binds to DNA at the promoter region, thus acti- vating genes for expression.48NF-/H9260B functions as a precursor to increased concentrations of proinflam- matory cytokines in peripheral blood and thus helps coordinate the inflammatory response.49,50Some psychoneuroimmunologic models propose that NF-/H9260B activity is a key intracellular pathway linking the central nervous system psychological threat cascade with neuroendocrine signal-mediated peripheral immune system dysregulation.51,52 Consistent with these models, acute psychological stress has been shown to activate NF- /H9260Bi n PBMCs.53-55 Of the studies reviewed, three measured NF- /H9260B in PBMCs37,38,56a n ds h o w e dar e d u c t i o ni nN F - /H9260B after the MBI. Two studies\u2014one in lonely older adults and the other in breast cancer patients\u2014 showed a relative reduction in the expression of NF-/H9260B after MBSR and MAPs (compared to waiting-list controls) using promoter-based bioinformatics measures of functional genomic activity.37,38A third study showed that MAPs pro- duced a reduction in activated NF- /H9260Bp 6 5i n older adults exhibiting sleep disturbances; however, NF-/H9260B was also signicantly decreased in the highly active sleep hygiene comparison condition.56 6 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. xxxx (2016) 1-12 C/circlecopyrt2016 New York Academy of Sciences.Black & Slavich Mindfulness meditation and the immune system Immune cell count When engaged by an immune challenge, immune cells are differentially activated, generated, and then deployed by the immune system to target regions to protect the body against infection and promote tissue recovery. As such, cell distribution or count is used as a diagnostic marker for various immune- compromising diseases. For example, a decline in CD4+T lymphocyte count is a standard immune cell signal of disease progression in HIV patients.57 Further, chronic stress and depression can inhibit immune cell activity and proliferation, and thus weaken defenses against tumorigenic surveillance and growth.58 Immune cell counts pertain to cells constituting the innate (neutrophils) and adaptive (T, B, and NK cells) subsets, and these counts were quanti- ed in ve studies.24,45,59-61In one of these stud- ies, there was no relative change in neutrophils (mucous from nasal wash) after an MBSR-derived intervention in older adults experiencing an acute respiratory illness.24Of the other four studies that enumerated lymphocytes in blood, all identied either an increase or a buffered decline in T lym- phocyte cell count (CD4+T, CD4+/CD8+ratio, T helper (Th)1/Th2) and/or activation (% activated T cells) after mindfulness meditation in samples of patients diagnosed with a disease (i.e., HIV or breast cancer) as compared to controls.45,59,61,62Three of these studies were restricted to people diagnosed with HIV .59,61,62Bl y m p h o c y t ea n dN Kc e l lc o u n t s did not show relative changes in a study of breast cancer patients after intervention.45 Immune cell aging Immune cell telomeres are protective DNA and protein complexes that function as caps to protect and stabilize the ends of eukaryotic chromo- somes, which truncate during cell division.63Short- ened telomeres are a marker of immune cell aging and vulnerability to apoptosis, and are associated with poorer clinical outcomes and premature death in various age-related diseases.64T elomere length is protected in part by the naturally occurring enzyme telomerase, which helps slow or reverse cell aging.63 Longer telomeres and higher telomerase activity are thus considered to be salutogenic immune system proles. Four studies measured telomere length and/or telomerase activity.65-68Of the two studies thatquantied telomere length,65,66one examining breast cancer survivors showed a trend for the MBSR-derived intervention to attenuate the telom- ere shortening observed in the control group;65 however, these effects were observed only when sam- ples from the mindfulness meditation and support- ive group therapy groups were combined to increase statistical power. Of the three studies that mea- sured telomerase activity, all showed an increase in telomerase activity after mindfulness medita- tion, at least at the trend level, among a diverse set of samples (e.g., meditation retreat partici- pants, overweight/obese women, and breast can- cer patients).66-68In one of these three studies, the increase was dependent on program attendance\u2014 specically, only high treatment-regiment adherers showed a trend for mindfulness meditation-related increases in telomerase activity.67 Antibody response Antibodies are immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE) or molecules secreted by immune cells (B lymphocytes) that identify and neutral- ize pathogens (via antigen flagging). Antibodies constitute humoral immunity and help immune cells inactivate toxic substances, attack viruses and bacteria, and assist in the function of other immune cells. Suboptimal antibody response is commonly found in immune-compromised indi- viduals (e.g., HIV disease progression),69persons experiencing chronic years tests demon- strate serologic immunity by quantifying the level of antibodies in blood, mucous, or other tissue samples. Antibodies were measured in three studies,44,72,73 two of which examined antibody response to influenza vaccination;44,73one revealed that MBSR led to a signicantly greater rise in hemagglutination-inhibition influenza antibody titers from the 4- to 8-week blood draw period (compared with controls in a sample of corpo- rate employees).73The second study did not show relative changes in serum influenza antibody or nasal IgA in older adults.44The antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin was administered in a third study of older adults, which showed a relatively greater increase in IgG immediately after MBSR intervention; additionally, a smaller increase in IgG was observed at the 24-week assessment.72 7 Ann.

Mindfulness meditation and immune system biomarkers. This systematic review of 20 randomized controlled trials, comprising more than 1600 participants, revealed replicated, yet tentative, evidence that mindfulness meditation is associated with changes in select immune system processes involved in inflammation, immunity, and biological aging. NF- /H9260B, nuclear factor- /H9260B; CRP , C-reactive protein. Summary of evidence and implications for future research The present review is the rst to interrogate the ndings of the RCTs that have been conducted to date on mindfulness meditation and the immune system. This comprehensive examination included data from 1602 participants and revealed tentative evidence that mindfulness meditation is associated with changes in select biomarkers of immune sys- tem activity. When using the criteria of three or more RCTs showing that mindfulness meditation has at least a trend-level or dosage-dependent effect on immune parameters, we identied mindfulness meditation-related effects for the following four parameters: reductions in the activity of the cellular transcription factor NF- /H9260B, reductions in circulat- ing levels of CRP , increases in CD4+Tc e l lc o u n t (in HIV-diagnosed individuals), and increases in telomerase activity (Fig. 1). In contrast, null nd- ings or a lack of replicated effects were found for antibodies (IgA, IgG, influenza), interleukins (IL- 1, IL-6, F - /H9251,a n dv a r i o u s measures of cell count. Considered together, these data point to promising areas of future investiga- tion, but we caution against exaggerating the posi- tive effects of mindfulness meditation on immune system dynamics until these effects are further repli- cated and additional studies are performed. With respect to the abovementioned prelimi- nary positive effects that replicated across studies,if robust and maintained over time, these types of shifts in immune system activity could potentially have benecial effects on health by influ- encing mechanisms that are known to affect biolog- ical aging and disease. For example, countering a dysregulated or hypersensitive immune system pro- le with mindfulness meditation could theoretically function to improve organism tness by enhancing immune defenses that protect against viral and bac- terial infection, as well as various age-related dis- ease conditions, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, frailty, and some cancers. T o test this possibility, future studies will need to examine associations between mind- fulness meditation, immune function, and disease symptomatology. Insights garnered from this review provide the basis for further theory building and empirical investigation into if, and if so, how, mindfulness meditation influences biological processes involved in aging and disease. For example, these ndings extend existing models of mindfulness meditation, which suggest that mindfulness meditation may downregulate the activity of major stress axes in the body, such as the sympathetic-adrenal- medullary and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes,21which are known to influence some of the immune system mechanisms identied in this review. T o fully realize the benets of this work for improving health, however, additional RCTs are needed that examine the robustness and 8 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. xxxx (2016) 1-12 C/circlecopyrt2016 New York Academy of Sciences.Black & Slavich Mindfulness meditation and the immune system generalizability of the present immune-related ndings, as well as their relevance for predicting changes in clinical outcomes over time. Looking forward, there are several points that should be considered when planning future stud- ies on mindfulness meditation and immune system dynamics. First, only 40% of the RCTs reviewed used control programs that could account for non- specic treatment effects. This leaves substantial room for improving study designs by using com- parator groups that are better than a waiting-list control condition. Indeed, a description of a stan- dardized active control condition that can be used alongside MBIs was recently made available for trial researchers.74Second, the effects of mindfulness meditation on immune system biomarkers were dosage dependent in some instances. As a result, beyond obtaining adequate sample sizes, future studies and interventions will benet from maxi- mizing treatment adherence. This also highlights a need for researchers to collect data on individuals' class attendance and/or home practice schedules, and to report on both the overall effects and dosage- dependent effects when publishing trial results. Third, in the studies reviewed, immune biomark- ers were often included as ancillary measures and, consequently, hypothesis tests were frequently underpowered. T o truly advance this area of study, future projects will need to power studies and cal- ibrate tests for changes in immune parameters as primary outcomes, ap r i o r i , to avoid false nega- tive results. It will also be important to provide clearer rationales for the immune biomarkers cho- sen for inclusion and better descriptions of how those biomarkers relate to the pathophysiologic process being studied. Fourth, almost all of the RCTs examined (19/20 studies) employed periph- eral blood as the main human specimen with which to quantify immune function. This is a notable and consistent strength across studies, but it also high- lights an opportunity for future studies to inves- tigate other less invasive specimens (e.g., mucous, saliva, urine, hair) that could be validated against blood and potentially used as biomarkers of mind- fulness meditation-related changes in immune sys- tem dynamics. Finally, the specimen collection and processing procedure employed by several studies was not well described, thus highlighting an oppor- tunity to improve the reporting of study procedures to enhance researchers' ability to replicate studyprotocols, especially with respect to the timing of specimen collection, steps taken for sample pro- cessing and storage, and procedures used for assay quantication. In conclusion, across 20 RCTs and more than 1600 participants, we found tentative evidence that mind- fulness meditation modulates some select immune parameters in a manner that suggests a more salu- togenic immune prole. Specically, mindfulness meditation appears to be associated with reduc- tions in proinflammatory processes, increases in cell-mediated defense parameters, and increases in enzyme activity that guards against cell aging. Although these ndings replicated and are based on well-designed RCTs, they are restricted to particular populations, subgroup analyses, and disease types. Consequently, additional research is needed to test the effects of mindfulness meditation on immune system biomarkers to provide a clearer understand- ing of the robustness and generalizability of ndings, and to examine the relevance of these ndings for clinical symptoms and overall health.
