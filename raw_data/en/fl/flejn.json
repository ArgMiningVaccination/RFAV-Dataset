With 1.8GW, Picore is one of the most powerful Picosecond Lasers in the market which has shown both prodigious clinical results and great stability for pigment and skin rejuvenation. The Picore: Picosecond Nd:YAG laser treats: - Pigmented lesions - Melasma - Acne scars - Surgical Scars Unlike other lasers, the Picore treats and is safe for ALL skin types (I-IV) - Type I - pale/freckles - Type II - light colored but darker than fair - Type III - golden honey or olive - Type IV - moderate brown Q: How does it work? A: The Bluecore Picore is the Lamborghini of Picosecond devices. Compared to conventional lasers, the pulse width is much shorter, which allows the system to shatter pigment particles within the skin with much more accuracy and effect. What this also means, is fewer skin side effects from residual heat around the laser target and better reactions to small pigment particles for the best clinical outcomes. The Picore also offers multi-methods of Pico Fractional treatments, i.e. BlueFx. Unlike other Picosecond systems, the BlueFx treatment protocol on the Picore uses both Laser-induced Optical Breakdown (LIOB) and Laser-induced Thermal Breakdown (LITB) simultaneously, which leads to exceptional facial rejuvenation and pigment removal through fractional delivery of ultrashort pulses. Q: Is it safe? A:The system is very safe and is FDA approved for use in the United States. Q: Side Effects? A: Adverse effects can include discomfort, redness, swelling, pinpoint bleeding, blistering, scabbing, crusting and bruising, which usually resolve without intervention. Possible, but not likely, adverse effects may also include pustules, skin burns, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, scarring, infection and allergic reaction. Most of these are transient and resolve over time. Q: Is it Comfortable? A: Unlike other laser treatments, the Picore is less painful per pulse and very tolerable for patients who have had treatments with the V-Beam and CO2 V-Beam Perfecta: Pulse Dye Laser treats: - Rosacea - Facial veins - Scars - Hemangiomas/Port wine stains |Q: | A: |How does it work? | An intense but gentle burst of yellow light is delivered to the skin. The light is specifically absorbed by the blood vessels in the dermis (inner layer of cells that makes up skin). These blood vessels congeal (thicken/harden) and shrink. They are then reabsorbed by the body during the natural healing process. |Q: | A: |Is it safe and comfortable? | The laser we use includes a dynamic cooling mechanism that sprays a cooling mist onto the skin before each laser pulse to not only protect the epidermis (outer layer of the skin) but also to make the patient more comfortable. Patients describe the treatment as feels like a snapping of a fine rubber band on the skin but this is mitigated by the cooling mist emitted prior to each laser pulse. Topical anesthetic can also be used pre-treatment for an added layer of pain relief. |Q: | A: |Side Effects? | Minimal. Some redness, slight bruising or swelling in the area that typically resolves within a few days. |Q: | A: |Is the treatment painful? | Feels like a snapping of a fine rubber bad on the skin but this is mitigated by the cooling mist emitted prior to each laser pulse. Topical anesthetic can also be used pre-treatment for an added layer of pain relief. CO2 Laser (Syneron) Fractional Resurfacing treats: - Skin tone and texture - Sun-damaged skin - Age spots |Q: | A: |How does it work? | CO2RE is an effective way of treating both superficial and deep skin layers simultaneously with precision control over the intensity, pattern and depth of removal of the damaged skin (ablation). |Q: | A: |Why is it better than the traditional CO2? | While both are effective, CO2RE is a lighter, faster and a more versatile solution for skin resurfacing, traditional ablation and minor dermal excisions. It can provide a shorter recovery time than traditional CO2 laser treatments. GentleMax This is a combination laser of the Alexandrite for hair removal and the Gentle Yag laser for removal of leg and facial veins and vascular treatments of all skin types! Alexandrite for Hair Removal - This is the fastest and most widely used of the laser types available and is particularly good for treating large body areas for patients with light-olive complexion. - Studies show that these laser systems can achieve a significant delay in hair regrowth |Q: | A: |How does it work? | The Alexandrite laser is considered by many in the field of laser hair removal to be the gold standard for those with a lighter skin type. The Alexandrite laser uses a longer wavelength for penetration to the hair follicle and energy that is particularly attracted to melanin - the target for hair removal. This is not effective for patients with white or light blonde hair simply because the laser is solely attracted to the darkness of the hair! |Q: | A: |How many sessions will I need? | Factors such as area of the body to be treated, the color of the skin, hair coarseness and gender play an important role to determine how many hair removal sessions should be performed. Hair follicles may sometimes enter their growth cycle after the procedure; therefore, some patients require repeat treatments to get optimum results. "}
