Personal Statement My lab focuses on signaling events that regulate cell -cell adhesion or cell migration/invasion and transformed cell growth. We recently reported that PLEKHA7, an adhesion- related protein with a limited distribution at the apical cell -cell junctions, recrui ts the RNAi machinery to the junctions to regulate the expression and function of select miRNAs and to inhibit epithelial cell growth. We also showed that PLEKHA7 is misregulated in human cancer and that restoring the levels of affected miRNAs reverses the malignant growth of cultured colon cancer cells. In recent work using primary cell lines and conditional knockout mice we are exploring the role of PLEKHA7 in the progression from an adenoma to a malignant carcinoma. Additionally, my lab has identified a key role for Syx, a RhoA -specific GEF, in and of VEGF- A, as well as front -rear polarity and directed migration of malignant gliomas. Recent studies focus on the role of Syx in gliom a cell mitosis, crystallization of the Syx/RhoA complex, and generation of specific Syx inhibitors for the treatment of gliomas. In addition to classic cell biological techniques to study cell adhesion, migration, and mitosis signaling events, my lab uses organotypic 3D cultures, integrated genomics, proteomics and antibody -based methodologies including Elisa, Luminex -based high- throughput assays, phospho- proteomics, and bioinformatics as a means of pathways that are activated in indiv idual patient's tumors and can be targeted for therapy on an individualized basis with available therapeutics. In collaboration with the Center for Individualized Medicine we have launched the Ex Vivo clinical project in multiple cancer types, including lung cancer, and across Mayo Clinic sites. I have served as a Tumor Progression and Metastasis NIH study section member, as Chair of the Neural regulation of cancer NIH special emphasis panel, and ad hoc member of the R35 MIRA study section at NIGMS. I also serve as the deputy director of Education and the co -director of the Cell Biology Program within the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, and I am an executive committee member for the Mayo Clinic Center for Biomedical Discovery.

Characterized p120 catenin function in the cadherin complex: My early publications in the fields of cell adhesion and cancer centered on the function of p120 catenin (p120), a key mediator of E -cadherin function whose role was unclear at the time. In a number of seminal papers, we fine- mapped the p120 binding site o f E-cadherin and showed that uncoupling p120 disrupts strong cell identified tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation sites on p120, and reported a novel p120 role in promoting E -cadherin stability and function. These publications highlighted the importance of p120 in E -cadherin function and opened up new fields of scientific investigation. I served as the primary investigator or co -investigator in all of these studies. a. Anastasiadis PZ, Moon SY, Thoreson MA, Mariner DJ, RhoA catenin. Nature complex roles Wang J, and Reynolds AB: Identification of Src phosphorylation sites and -tumorigenic roles of p120 catenin: Continuing work on p120 and Rho GTPases as an independent investigator, I uncovered a novel interaction of p120 with microtubules, characterized the p120's role in vertebrate development and synapse formation, examined p120 isoform function in breast cance r and renal cancer, and showed tumor cells expressing mesenchymal cadherins require p120 for growth and migration. These publications established p120's dual function in human cancer. a. Yanagisawa M, Kaverina IN, Wang A, Fujita Y, Reynolds AB, Anastasiadis PZ: A novel interaction between kinesin and p120 JA and Anastasiadis PZ: A p120 isoform switch affects Rho activity, induces tumor cell invasion and predicts metas tatic disease. J Biol Chem PZ : p120 catenin induces opposing effects on tumor cell growth depending on E -cadherin expression. J Cell Biol 2008; 183(4):737 - 749. PMCID: PMC2582886. 3. Elucidated the composition and function of pro- and anti -tumorigenic cadherin complexes and their crosstalk with the RNAi machinery: Based on our findings that both p120 and E -cadherin can act as tumor suppressors or promoters depending on cellular context, we identified a miRNA -mediated mechanism whereby apical E -cadherin- p120 complexes at the zonula adherens recruit PLEKHA7 and the R ISC to suppress epithelial cell growth induced by basolateral E -cadherin- p120 complexes lacking PLEKHA7. The work established p120 as a key mediator of tumor progression, PLEKHA7 as a tumor suppressor, identified pathways affected by the junctional RISC, and suggested ways to reprogram cancer cells to a less malignant state. a.

Examined deregulated pathways and therapeutic targets in GBM: We have examined the role of cadherins and p120 catenin in human Src family kinase (SFK) activity as markers of aggressiveness in GBM, and characterized the role of indiv idual SFKs in GBM. The work resulted in two clinical trials testing the efficacy of dasatinib in the treatment of gliomas, and suggested that the relative expression of Yes and Lyn may predict response to dasatinib treatment. We have also optimized 3 -dimensional culture models for GBM growth ex vivo, for use in combination with integrated genomics in precision medicine. a.

Three- Dimensional Microscale Hanging Drop Arrays with Geometric Control for Drug Screening and Live Tissue Imaging: Science Adv. 2021 the role of junctional RhoGEFs and polarity complexes in cell adhesion and migration: We systematically explored the function of RhoGEFs and polarity complexes in endothelial monolayer function and leakiness, directed cell migration, as well as glioma cell invasion and aggressiveness. We identified the RhoGEF Syx as essential in mediating VEGF and Ang1 responses RhoA downstream Dia1 mediates Syx effects. Our leading to increased vascular leakiness, identified Syx as a novel member of the Crumbs polarity complex, and indicated a crucial function for Syx in increased directed migratory potential of glioma tumor cells. a.

Contribution to Science 1. Mesenchymal stem cell function, senescence, and senolytics in individuals with DKD Regenerative, cell-based promise for altering DKD trajectory . While MSC are promising therapeutic treatments, the effectiveness of autologous (over allogeneic) cellular -based therapy for DKD may be limited from a \"seed\" and \"soil\" perspective. We described these challenges and opportunities for cell - based therapy in CKD. Our K23 studies compared, for the first time, human DKD -MSC function to that of age-matched controls and identified mostly preserved paracrine functionality but some deficiencies in cell function. To optimize an autologous MSC therapy approach, our ongoing Phase I trial is testing the safety and efficacy of senolytics, dasa tanib and quercetin, to reduce senescent cell abundance, improve DKD and stem cell function. Our initial report revealed for the first time, that senolytics reduce senescent cell burden in humans. Moreover, senolytics improved stem cell proliferation capacity in vitro . Finally, we determined that activin A, a marker of senescence and pro -fibrotic kidney injury was increased in DKD subjects. These studies and others will inform additional trial design, preconditioning strategies, and endpoint assessment for MSC therapy in DKD. a. Hickson LJ , et al.

Safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell therapy in kidney disease Clinical trials applying MSC for kidney disease are rare in the U.S. Our investigator -initiated, NIH -funded clinical trial applying MSC for renovascular disease at Mayo Clini c demonstrat ed safety with increased cortical perfusion and preserved kidney function. I then obtained funding and FDA approvals to conduct the first DKD U.S. clinicals trials applying autologous (Regenerative Medicine Minnesota) and allogeneic (Mayo Florida Center for Regenerative Medicine) MSC .

Biomarkers of survival and renal outcomes in kidney transplantation and hypertension My early publications studied the association of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) with survival in kidney transplant waiting list candi dates . cTnT is a sensitive and specific biomarker for myocyte injury . cTnT levels increase with progressive kidney failure and were previously thought to be of no clinical significance in end -stage renal disease (ESRD). Our studies helped inform this misconception and establish the prognostic importance of troponin in ESRD both before and after kidney transplantation. With this evidence, the clinical practice was changed at Mayo Clinic through the development of a clinical risk score for risk -stratification of individuals at low and high risk for death within 1 -year post -transplant, still used today during kidney transplant candidacy evaluations. The educational importance of this work and my study of recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ha ve been highlighted in a quarterly issue of the Nephrology Self -Assessment Program (NephSAP), which is distributed by the American Society of Nephrology. Inspired by the success of our work in transplant, I then stud ied troponin in community -dwelling indiv iduals with hypertension. We are the first group to describe the prognostic capacity of troponin to identify individuals at high risk for ESRD. a.

Patient -important outcomes and healthcare utilization among incident hemodialysis patients In addition to the contributions described above, the compilation of my incident hemodialysis research database continues to aid us in better understanding of outcomes in this cohort. With collaborators, we examined the pr evalence of structural heart disease in incident dialysis patients and the association of these conditions with survival. Papers below were often highlighted by accompanying editorials discussing their impact on the field. We also examined the rate of and factors associated with renal recovery among incident dialysis patients. This work was prompted to help address challenges faced by nephrologists (at that time) given reimbursement restrictions for \"Acute\" versus \"ESRD\" incident dialysis outpatient treatments. Our work provided a resource to inform both patients and providers on the odds of renal recovery or non -recovery based on baseline kidney function and comorbidities at the time of dialysis initiation. In other studies, we characterized the association between depression and health care use in young patients and most recently described the end of life and withdrawal in maintenance dialysis patients. a.

Contribution to Science 1. Mesenchymal stem cell function, senescence, and senolytics in individuals with DKD Regenerative, cell-based promise for altering DKD trajectory . While MSC are promising therapeutic treatments, the effectiveness of autologous (over allogeneic) cellular -based therapy for DKD may be limited from a \"seed\" and \"soil\" perspective. We described these challenges and opportunities for cell - based therapy in CKD. Our K23 studies compared, for the first time, human DKD -MSC function to that of age-matched controls and identified mostly preserved paracrine functionality but some deficiencies in cell function. To optimize an autologous MSC therapy approach, our ongoing Phase I trial is testing the safety and efficacy of senolytics, dasa tanib and quercetin, to reduce senescent cell abundance, improve DKD and stem cell function. Our initial report revealed for the first time, that senolytics reduce senescent cell burden in humans. Moreover, senolytics improved stem cell proliferation capacity in vitro . Finally, we determined that activin A, a marker of senescence and pro -fibrotic kidney injury was increased in DKD subjects. These studies and others will inform additional trial design, preconditioning strategies, and endpoint assessment for MSC therapy in DKD. a. Hickson LJ , et al.

Safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell therapy in kidney disease Clinical trials applying MSC for kidney disease are rare in the U.S. Our investigator -initiated, NIH -funded clinical trial applying MSC for renovascular disease at Mayo Clini c demonstrat ed safety with increased cortical perfusion and preserved kidney function. I then obtained funding and FDA approvals to conduct the first DKD U.S. clinicals trials applying autologous (Regenerative Medicine Minnesota) and allogeneic (Mayo Florida Center for Regenerative Medicine) MSC .

Biomarkers of survival and renal outcomes in kidney transplantation and hypertension My early publications studied the association of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) with survival in kidney transplant waiting list candi dates . cTnT is a sensitive and specific biomarker for myocyte injury . cTnT levels increase with progressive kidney failure and were previously thought to be of no clinical significance in end -stage renal disease (ESRD). Our studies helped inform this misconception and establish the prognostic importance of troponin in ESRD both before and after kidney transplantation. With this evidence, the clinical practice was changed at Mayo Clinic through the development of a clinical risk score for risk -stratification of individuals at low and high risk for death within 1 -year post -transplant, still used today during kidney transplant candidacy evaluations. The educational importance of this work and my study of recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ha ve been highlighted in a quarterly issue of the Nephrology Self -Assessment Program (NephSAP), which is distributed by the American Society of Nephrology. Inspired by the success of our work in transplant, I then stud ied troponin in community -dwelling indiv iduals with hypertension. We are the first group to describe the prognostic capacity of troponin to identify individuals at high risk for ESRD. a.

Patient -important outcomes and healthcare utilization among incident hemodialysis patients In addition to the contributions described above, the compilation of my incident hemodialysis research database continues to aid us in better understanding of outcomes in this cohort. With collaborators, we examined the pr evalence of structural heart disease in incident dialysis patients and the association of these conditions with survival. Papers below were often highlighted by accompanying editorials discussing their impact on the field. We also examined the rate of and factors associated with renal recovery among incident dialysis patients. This work was prompted to help address challenges faced by nephrologists (at that time) given reimbursement restrictions for \"Acute\" versus \"ESRD\" incident dialysis outpatient treatments. Our work provided a resource to inform both patients and providers on the odds of renal recovery or non -recovery based on baseline kidney function and comorbidities at the time of dialysis initiation. In other studies, we characterized the association between depression and health care use in young patients and most recently described the end of life and withdrawal in maintenance dialysis patients. a.

Personal Statement I currently lead the Biomedical Informatics group at Mayo Clinic. My formal training was in biomedical and clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) with twenty years' experience exploring both expert -based and statistical approaches for various NLP tasks. In addition, I have extensive collaborative research experience in ontology, software engineering, bioinformatics, and biomedical and basic science fields. I have published extensively with over 300 papers. My current research missions are to facilitate secondary use of Electronic Health Records (EH Rs) for clinical and translational science research and health care delivery i mprovement through clinical NLP and to deliver open- source NLP for high- throughput phenotyping through community -wide collab orative projects. I am very interested in bringing informatics solutions to solve real -world challenges faced by researchers . My research has translated to multiple institutional projects at Mayo Clinic for providing enterprise data and informatics infrastructure for clinical and translational research and practice. Nationally and internationally, I focus on the development of open source NLP solutions for text mining and secondary use of EHRs. I have led the community -wide project, Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP; http://www.ohnlp.org), which promotes the release of open source NLP tools for clinical and translational research. The tools released by OHNLP include Apache cTAKES, MedEx, and MedTagger suites, etc. As a leader of AMIA NLP -WG, I organized a webinar series on the interoperability of clinical NLP systems in 2014 and AMIA NLP -WG pre - symposium since 2014.

C. Contribution to Science 1. Secondary use of EMRs for clinic al and translational research (2011- present) I led the data normalization program in Mayo Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) Program Area 4 Consortium (SHARPn), the core technology base for SHARPn. SHARPn aims to enable the use of the electronic health record (EHR) for secondary purposes, such as quality measurement, comparative effectiveness research, translational research, high throughput phenotyping, and outcomes research. Clinical data in EHRs must be normalized to make practical and scalable the myriad of secondary use cases of EHR data. A unified data normalization framework based on big- data processing technology, which has been released open source, has been developed and can be used to implement pipelines for the generation of normalized EHR data from both structured and unstructured data sources. a.

Developing clinical NLP applications and implementing them for clinical decision support and epidemiological/population health research (2011 -present) I have been leading Mayo Clinic's clinical NLP program since 2011 with the mission of providing development and support for the access of clinical information stored in unstructured text for research and practice. The Mayo NLP program has developed, releas ed, and maintained a suite of open -source NLP systems including cTAKES, MedCoRef (a co -reference resolution tool), MedTime (a tool for recognizing time expressions in clinical text), MedTagger (a tool for machine learning- based named entity recognition), icTAKES (an integrated version of cTAKES for indexing clinical data warehouse), MedQA (a question answering system for information needs at point of care) and MedXN (a tool for extraction and normalization of clinical drugs). Some of those systems are among the top -ranked systems evaluated through NLP challenges such as I2B2 NLP or SHARE/CLEF. My group has demonstrated the utilities of NLP applications in clinical decision support and epidemiological/population health research with over 80 publications in the field. a.

Decision support for precision medicine through advanced healthcare analytics and advanced text mining (2013- present) The promise of precision medicine is to enable medical practitioners to make better clinical decisions through incorporating patients' clinical, genetic and/or genomic information. The anticipation of preci sion medicine is to increase prevention and prediction of disease, enable earlier disease intervention, improve targeted therapies, reduce side effects, and therefore reduce healthcare costs with better patient outcomes. Rapid advances in technology and decreasing cost combined have brought precision medicine closer to the clinical practice. We identify two challenges when bringing precision medicine into practice: i) given medical history of a patient, how to efficiently retrieve a list of genetic tests to be recommended, and ii) given genetic or genomic information of a patient, how to retrieve their clinical implication information and summarize it for physicians and counselors? We are investigating clinical decision support and automated methods to mitigate the knowledge gap in delivering precision medicine. a.

Biomedical text mining (1998- present) With the widespread use of computers in the biomedical domain, a vast, rich range of biomedical data, including coded data, as well as free -text data has been stored in digital format. Computer applicat ions can interpret coded data automatically while free- text data pose challenges to system developers. To enable access to free text in the biomedical domain, natural language processing (NLP) systems have been developed that facilitate information retri eval (IR), information extraction (IE), and text mining on free text. However, all NLP systems require identification of terms (a term can be a single word or a multi -word phrase) in free text with entries in a lexical table. However, terms in free text can be ambiguous and may have multiple unrelated senses in the lexical table. Additionally, the lexical table can be incomprehensive where some terms or senses are not included in the table. My research in this area focuses on i) word sense disambiguation in t he biomedical domain including the use of conceptual relatives in the Unified Medical Language Systems (UMLS) and machine learning to build word sense disambiguation systems, ii) sense inventory for gene/protein terms, and iii) constructing practical text mining applications for systems biology. My research outcome has been disseminated online. For example, BioThesaurus, a collection of gene/protein names for all protein records, as well as its web- based version, has been used extensively by biomedical and bioinformatics researchers with over one million hits over the past six years. Over 20 research teams (e.g., Merck or University of Colorado) have used BioThesaurus for building their text mining systems. a. Liu H , Johnson SB, Friedman C.

Personal Statement The long- term goal of my research is to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of liver fibrosis, with the end goal of developing novel therapeutic strategies that promote fibrosis regression. Liver fibrosis is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition which leads to scarring and altered liver architecture. Hepatic Stellate cells (HSCs) are primarily responsible for ECM production and secretion. T argeting HSCs for apoptosis is an attractive therapeutic strategy but has yielded little suc cess in the clinic. My lab is focused on understanding the mechanisms of fibrogenesis, including HSC activation, trafficking of matrix proteins, and how HSCs accommodate excess matrix production and secretion. We previously identified a critical role for t he Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) protein TANGO1 in facilitating procollagen I export from the ER and subsequent secretion. B uilding upon this work , we sought to elucidate other key mechanisms that regulate procollagen I trafficking and secretion using an siRN A screen. This screen revealed 9 genes that promoted procollagen I retention. Functional studies revealed a critical and targetable role for one of the top targets, the serine/threonine kinase TNIK, in fibrogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Currently proj ects in this space include investigating the other targets identified in the siRNA screen, as well as taking insight from Osteogenic genes. Genomics analysis revealed an association between the ER -localized ion channel TMEM38B and both osteogenesis and fibrogenesis . We are currently investigating the mechanisms through with TMEM38B drives fibrogenesis in HSCs, supported by an R03 grant awarded by the Illuminating the Druggable Genome program sponsored by the NIH. The second theme of my research is underst anding the role of ER stress in HSC activation and fibrogenesis. Excess protein production puts stress on the ER due to excess unfolded proteins that require processing. Maintaining ER function and integrity despite ER stress is crucial for secretory cell survival. A key pathway involved in accommodating ER stress is the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The UPR is crucial for accommodating the increased production and secretion of ECM proteins and implicated in fibrogenesis; however, the mechanisms underlyi ng this role are unknown. Finally, if ER stress is unresolved, the UPR initiates pro-apoptotic signaling, which would be favorable for fibrosis regression. Thus, my research into the UPR and HSC activation has t wo major focuses: 1) understanding how the UP R transcriptionally regulates fibrogenesis and regulates ER integrity and turnover to facilitate fibgogenic protein secretion, and 2 ) identifying potential therapeutic targets to disrupt procollagen I processing within the ER and promote apoptosis of HSCs as an intervention for patients with liver critical regulator of procollagen I trafficking and fibrogenesis in mice.

Midwest DDRCC Alliance Meeting Cincinnati, Ohio 02/26/2017 - 02/28/2017 C. Contributions to Science: Elucidated the mechanistic contribution of the Unfolded Protein Response to fibrogenesis in Hepatic Stellate Cells. Hepatic stellate cells produce and secrete vast amounts of matrix proteins during fibrogenesis. These proteins are translated into the ER where they must undergo proper folding and processing prior to secretion. Excess proteins in the ER lumen that require folding causes ER stress, which in turn activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR ). The UPR promotes expression of chaperones and trafficking proteins, limits non- essential translation, and promotes degradation of misfolded proteins, all aimed at resolving ER stress. My group showed that adaptive UPR signaling is critical for fibrogenesis. The UPR sensor IRE1 is critical for HSC activation and fibrogenesis in vitro through upregulation of trafficking proteins such as TANGO1, as well as initiating pro -fibrotic transcription through phosphorylation of the transcription factor c/EBP. This work served as a major part of Aim 2 of my funded K01 award. As my research evolved, we also identified a critical role for a second ER stress sensor and UPR effector: ATF6. ATF6 activity as a transcription factor is critical for HSC activation and fibrogenesis both in vitro and in vivo , and we are currently discerning the mechanisms that underlie ATF6 regulation, as well as critical processed downstream of ATF6 activity including ERphagy. Understanding the transcriptional regulation of fibrogenesis downstream of ATF6 and IRE1 will be a major focus of my initial R01 grant application in February 2022. a.

Provided mechanistic insight into procollagen in hepatic stellate cell s during fibrogenesis. My postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Shah began in January 2014. I was d rawn to Dr. Shah's lab though his passion and excitement for liver research. His background as both clinician and investigator has provided me a unique environment to grow as a scientist. At Mayo Clinic, I used my developed biochemistry and cellular biology skills as well as new skills utilizing animal models and patient samples to the study cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver fibrosis. During my postdoctoral studies, I identified a critical moderator of liver fibrosis: TANGO1 facilitates col lagen from hepatic stellate cells, directly contributing to fibrogenesis and liver disease which led to a first author publication, external funding from the American Liver Foundation, and internal funding from the Center for Cell Signaling in Gastroenterology and Hepatology and the Center for Biomedical Discovery at Mayo Clinic. Importantly, my research led to a K01 Mentored Career Development Award from the NIDDK, through which I am building my independent research program. Through my K01 awar d, my lab completed an siRNA screen to identify novel proteins involved in procollagen I trafficking. We identified 8 proteins whose knockout disrupted procollagen I intracellular trafficking. One of the top targets is TNIK (Traf2 and Nck Interacting Kinas e) has shown promise for therapeutic targeting in liver fibrosis. We are currently elucidating the function of TNIK and other top targets in procollagen I trafficking and fibrogenesis, providing insight into targetable mechanisms that facilitate a critical regulator of procollagen I trafficking and fibrogenesis in mice.

Identified a functional link between tight junctions and adherens junc tions in epithelial cells. I pursued post - graduate training at the University of Iowa in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Ph.D. program. At Iowa, I trained with Dr. Kris DeMali, studying the regulation of epithelial tight junctions. Tight junctions are c ritical for mediating tissue permeability by limiting the transport of ions, molecules, and even inflammatory cells across epithelial cell monolayers. Thus, the proper assembly and regulation of tight junctions is critical to understand. Immediately basal in location to tight junctions lay the adherens junctions. The assembly of adherens junctions is required for subsequent tight junction formation, but the mechanisms that link tight junctions to adherens junctions were not understood. I identified a critic al interaction between the adherens junction protein -catenin and the tight junction protein ZO -1 that is required for the assembly of epithelial tight junctions. In addition to being required for tight junction assembly, we identified a role for adherens junctions in transmitting force signals to tight junctions. This role is dependent on ZO -1 recruitment to cell -cell junctions by -catenin in response to shear stress. Together, the research completed during my Ph.D. training identified key mechanisms in the regulation of epithelial cell-cell junctions and provided me invaluable expertise in molecular and cellular biology that will aid me in my career as a scientist . a.

With my arrival, I was able to coordinate care of neuro- oncologic patients, specifically patients with tumors of the brain and spine, both benign and malignant as well as providing a coordinated home for patients with neurologic complications from their systemic cancers and or treatment. I began our multidisciplinary tumor board and created a monthly neuro oncology case conference for resident education. I served as site PI on multiple clinical trials and developed my own nationally enrolling trial regarding quality of life for patients with high grade glioma, an effort that raised national attention to Mayo Clinic in Arizona and care for brain tumor patients. I have served as content expert for 7 Ask Mayo Expert neuro oncologic topics and have contributed to the revamping of our mayoclinic.org website to be more patient friendly. Alyx B Porter Umphrey, MD, FAAN Page 16 of 23 RE-AIMS 6/29/2021 3:25:26 PM Research Interests and Accomplishments My clinical research interests are focused on improving the quality of life of patients who have been impacted with brain cancers includes identifying improved treatment options, reducing fatigue, maintaining independence and autonomy, and improving access of utilization of known resources among others. On a National level, I am the PI of largest neuro- cognitive study to evaluate stimulant medication to abrogate cognitive fatigue in brain tumor patients (Alliance study # A221101 projected to complete accrual in December 2018). I am PI of a local MCA trial looking at Fitness to Drive in Patients with Brain Metastases that completed enrollment earlier this year. Under my mentorship, Dr. Valencia Sanchez was awarded outstanding presentation at the Mayo Clinic Young Investigators Research Symposium earlier this year. The manuscript is pending with anticipated su bmission in November 2018. Enrollment is ongoing on an additional trial which I have initiated, a local Pilot study of early integration of palliative care using the BEACON PROQOL (a novel quality of life survey system) in patients with high grade glioma a nd their caregivers. In addition to the protocols mentioned, I am also PI on several retrospective studies aimed at furthering our understanding of the spectrum of radiographic and clinical changes that occur in patients with brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery with various primary malignancies as well as patients with glioma treated with proton therapy. These studies are critical to the work we do and may have practice changing implications regarding how we counsel in regards to risk an d how we proceed when concerned about disease progression. My translational work has been as clinical collaborator for the Precision Neurotherapeutics Laboratory, run by Drs. Kristin Swanson and Bernard Bendok. I am working with Dr. Swanson in her mathema tical neuro - oncology (MNO) lab to validate a novel MNO -developed response metric, known as \"Days Gained\", in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from Mayo Clinic in Arizona and beyond. Furthering our understanding into which patients respond to therapy, the period of their response, and the extent of their response will be essential to push our field toward individualized, precision medicine. Days Gained was previously validated for prognosis of progression- free and overall survival in GBM patients receiving standard - of-care treatment. In our current project, we are testing this metric across a variety of clinical settings under the hypothesis that Days Gained will provide an early and accurate prediction of treatment success (or failure) in this cha llenging population of patients. The larger project is an enterprise wide collaboration also involving Arizona State University that is funded primarily through the Ivy Foundation and supplemented by intramural Marley Funds.
