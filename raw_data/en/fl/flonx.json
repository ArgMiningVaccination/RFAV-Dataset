Content: This chapter contains the following broad groups:-- 140-195 Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be primary, of specified sites, except of lymphatic an d hematopoietic tissue 196-198 Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be secondary, of specified sites 199 Malignant neoplasms without specification of site 200-208 Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be primary, of lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue 210-229 Benign neoplasms 230-234 in behavior [see Note, page 140] 239 Neoplasms of unspecified nature 2. Functional activity All neoplasms are classified in this chapter, whether or not functionally active. 3. Malignant neoplasms overlapping site boundaries Categories 140-195 are for the cl assification of primary malignant neoplasms according to their poi nt of origin. A malignant neoplasm that overlaps two or more sub categories within a three-digit rubric and whose point of origin cannot be determined should be classified to the subcategory .8 \"Other.\" Fo r example: \"carcinoma involving tip and ventral surface of tongue\" shoul d be assigned to 141.8. On the other hand, \"carcinoma of tip of t ongue extending to involve the ventral surface\" should be coded to 141.2 as the point of origin, the tip, is known. Three subcategories (149.8, 159.8, 165.8) have been provided for malignant neoplasms that overlap the boundaries of three-digit rubrics within certain systems. Overlapping malignant neoplasms that cannot be classifi ed as indicated above s hould be assigned to the appropriate subdivision of cat egory 195 (Malignant neoplasm of other and ill-defined sites).

MENTAL DISORDERS This section of the Classification differ s from the others in that it includes a glossary, prepared after consultatio n with experts from many different countries, defining the contents of the rubrics. This difference is considered to be justified because of the special problems posed for psychiatrists by the relative lack of independent laboratory information upon which to base their diagnoses. The diagnosis of many of the most important mental disorders still relies largely up on descriptions of abnormal experience and behavior, and without some guidance in the form of a glossary that can serve as a common frame of reference, ps ychiatric communications easily become unsatisfactory at both clini cal and statistical levels. Many well-known terms have different meanings in current use. It is important for the user to use the glossary desc riptions and not merely the category titles when searching for the best fit fo r the condition he is trying to code. This is particularly important if a se parate national glossary also exists. The instructions \"Use additional code to identify...\" are important because of the nature of many psyc hiatric conditions in whic h two or more codes are necessary to describe the condition a nd the associated or causal factors. It should be used whenever possible. PSYCHOSES (290-299) Mental disorders in which impairment of mental function has developed to a degree that interferes grossly with in sight, ability to meet some ordinary demands of life or to maintain adequate contact with reality. It is not an exact or well defined term. Mental retardation is excluded. ORGANIC PSYCHOTIC CONDITIONS (290-294) Syndromes in which there is impairment of orientation, memory, comprehension, calculation, learning capac ity and judgement. Th ese are the essential features but there may also be shallown ess or lability of affect, or a more persistent disturbance of mood, lowering of ethical standards and exaggeration or emergence of personality traits, and diminished capacity for independent decision. Psychoses of the types classifiable to 295-298 and without the above features are excluded even though they may be associated with organic conditions. The term \"dementia\" in this glossary includes organic psychoses as just ICD9 Cause of Death list 166 of 609 specified, of a chronic or progressive nature, which if untreated are usually irreversible and terminal. The term \"delirium\" in this glossary includes organic psychoses with a short course in which the abov e features are overshadowed by clouded consciousness, confusion, disorientation, delusi ons, illusions and often vivid hallucinations. Includes: psychotic organic brain syndrome Excludes: nonpsychotic syndrom etiology (see 310.-) psychoses classifiable to 295-298 and without the above features but associated with physical disease, injury, or condition affecting the brain [e.g., following childbirth] code to 295-298 and use additional code to identify the associated physical condition. 290 Senile and presenile organic psychotic conditions Excludes: psychoses classifiable to 295-298.8 occurring in the senium without dementia or delirium (295.0-298.8) transient organic psychotic conditions (293.-) dementia senile, presenile, or arterio- sclerotic (294.1) 290.0 Senile dementia, simple type Dementia occurring usually after the age of 65 in wh ich any cerebral pathology other than that of senile atrophi c change can be reasonably excluded. Excludes: mild memory disturbances , not amounting to dementia, associated with senile brain disease (310.1) senile dementia: depressed or para noid type (290.2) with confusion and/or delirium (290.3) 290.1 Presenile dementia Dementia occurring usually before th e age of 65 in patients with the relatively rare forms of diffuse or lobar cerebral atr ophy. Use additional code to identify the associated ne urological condition. Brain syndrome with presenile brain disease Circumscribed atrophy of the brain Dementia in: Alzheimer's disease ICD9 Cause of Death list 167 of 609 Pick's disease of the brain Excludes: arterioscl erotic dementia (290.4) dementia associat ed with other cerebral conditions (294.1) 290.2 Senile dementia, depressed or paranoid type A type of senile dementia characterized by development of advanced old age, progressive in nature, in which a variet y of delusions and hallucinations of a persecutory, depressive and somatic conten t are also present. Disturbance of the sleep/waking cycle and preoccupa tion with dead people are often particularly prominent. Senile psychosis NOS Excludes: senile dementia: NOS (290.0) with delirium and/or confusion (290.3) 290.3 Senile dementia with acute confusional state Senile dementia with a superimposed re versible episode of acute confusional state Excludes: senile: dementia NOS (290.0) psychosis NOS (290.2) 290.4 Arteriosclerotic dementia Dementia attributable, because of ph ysical signs [on examination of the central nervous system] to degenerati ve arterial disease of the brain. Symptoms suggesting a focal lesion in the brain are common. There may be a fluctuating or patchy intellectual defect with insight, and an intermittent course is common. Clinical differentiati on from senile or presenile dementia, which may coexist with it, may be very difficult or impossible. Use additional code to identify cerebral atherosclerosis (437.0). Excludes: suspected cases with no clear evidence of osclerosis (290.9) 290.8 Other 290.9 Unspecified 291 Alcoholic psychoses Organic psychotic states due mainly to excessive consumption of alcohol; ICD9 Cause of Death list 168 of 609 defects of nutrition are taught to play an important role. In some of these states, withdrawal of alcohol can be of aetiological significance. Excludes: alcoholism without psychosis (303) 291.0 Delirium tremens Acute or subacute organic psychotic st ates in alcoholics, characterized by clouded consciousness, disorientatio n, fear, illusions, delusions, hallucinations of any kind, notably visu al and tactile, and restlessness, tremor and sometimes fever. Alcoholic delirium 291.1 Korsakoff's psychosis, alcoholic A syndrome of prominent and lasting reduction of memory span, including striking loss of recent memory, di sordered time appreciation and confabulation, occurring in alcoholics as the sequel to an acute alcoholic psychosis [especially delirium tremens] or, more rarely, in the course of chronic alcoholism. It is usually acc ompanied by peripheral neuritis and may be associated with Nonhallucinatory dementias occurring in association with alcoholism but not characterized by the features of eith er delirium tremens or Korsakov's psychosis. Alcoholic dementia NOS Chronic alcoholic brain syndrome 291.3 Other alcoholic hallucinosis A psychosis usually of less than six months' duration, with slight or no clouding of consciousness and much anxi ous restlessness in which auditory hallucinations, mostly of voices utteri ng insults and threats, predominate. Excludes: schizophrenia (295.-) and paranoid states (297.-) taking the form of chronic hallucinosis with clear consciousness in ICD9 Cause of Death list 169 of 609 an alcoholic 291.4 Pathological drunkenness Acute psychotic episodes induced by relatively small amounts of alcohol. These are regarded as in dividual idiosyncratic reac tions to alcohol, not due to excessive consumption and without conspicuous neurological signs of intoxication. Excludes: simple drunkenness (305.0) 291.5 Alcoholic jealousy Chronic paranoid psychosis characterize d by delusional jealousy and associated with alcoholism. Alcoholic paranoia Excludes: nonalcoholic paranoid states (297.-) schizophrenia, paranoid type delirium tremens (291.0) 291.9 Unspecified Alcoholic: Alcoholism (chronic) with psychosis mania NOS psychosis NOS 292 Drug psychoses Syndromes that do not fit the desc riptions given in 295-298 (nonorganic psychoses) and which are due to consumption of [notably amphetamines, barbiturates and the opiate and LSD groups] and solvents. Some of the syndromes in this group ar e not as severe as most conditions labeled \"psychotic\" but they are in cluded here for practical reasons. Use additional E code to identify the drug and also code drug dependence (304.-) if present. 292.0 Drug withdrawal syndrome States associated with drug withdraw al ranging from severe, as specified ICD9 Cause of Death list 170 of 609 for alcohol under 291.0 (delirium trem ens) to less severe states characterized by one or more symp toms such as convulsions, tremor, anxiety, restlessness, ga strointestinal and muscular complaints, and mild disorientation and memory disturbance. 292.1 Paranoid and/or hallucina tory states induced by drugs States or more than a few days but not usually of more than a few months duration, associated with large or pr olonged intake of drugs, notably of the amphetamine and LSD groups. A uditory hallucinations usually predominate, and there maybe anxiety and restlessness. Excludes: the described conditions with confusion or delirium (293.-) states following LS D or other hallucinogens, lasting only a few days or less [\"bad trips\"] (305.3) 292.2 Pathological drug intoxication Individual idiosyncratic reactions to comparatively small quantities of a drug, which take the form of acute , brief psychotic states of any type. Excludes: expected brief ps ychotic reactions to hallucinogens Other 292.9 Unspecified 293 Transient organic psychotic conditions States characterized by clouded consci ousness, confusion, disorientation, illusions and often vivid hallucinations. They are usually due to some intra- or extracerebral toxic, in fectious, metabolic or other systemic disturbance and are generally reversible. Depressi ve and paranoid symptoms may also be present but are not the main feature. Use additional code to identify the associated physical or neurological condition. Excludes: confusional state or de lirium superimposed on senile dementia due to: alcohol (291.-) arteriosclerosis (290.4) senility (290.0) ICD9 Cause list 171 of 609 293.0 Acute delirium Short-lived states, lasting hours or days, of the above type.

Subacute: Subacute: delirium psycho-organic syndrome infective psychosis psychosis associated with or organic reaction metabolic disorder post-traumatic organic psychosis 293.8 Other 293.9 Unspecified 294 Other organic psyc hotic conditions (chronic) 294.0 Korsakoff's psychosis or syndrome (nonalcoholic) Syndromes as described under 291.1 but not due to alcohol. 294.8 Other States that fulfill the criteria of an organic psychosis but do not take the form of a confusional state (293.-), a nonalcoholic Korsakov's psychosis (294.0) or a dementia (294.1). Epileptic psychosis NOS Mixed paranoid a nd affective organic (code also 345.-) psychotic states Excludes: mild memory disturbanc es, not amounting to dementia (310.1) 294.9 Unspecified ICD9 Cause of Death list 172 of 609 OTHER PSYCHOSES (295-299) 295 Schizophrenic disorders A group of psychoses in which there is a fundamental disturbance of personality, a characteristic distortion of thinking, often a sense of being controlled by alien forces, delusion s which may be bizarre, disturbed perception, abnormal affect out of k eeping with the re al situation, and autism. Nevertheless, clear consci ousness and intellectual capacity are usually maintained. The disturbance of personality involves its most basic functions which give the normal pe rson his feeling of individuality, uniqueness and self-direction. The most intimate thoughts, feelings and acts are often felt to be known to or shar ed by others and explanatory delusions may develop, to the effect that natural or supernatural forces are at work to influence the schizophrenic person's t houghts and actions in ways that are often bizarre. He may see himself as the pivot of a ll that happens. Hallucinations, especially of hearing, are common and may comment on the patient or address him. Perception is frequently distur bed in other ways; there may be perplexity, irrelevant f eatures may become all-important and, accompanied by passivity feelings, may lead the patient to believe that everyday objects and situations possess a special, usually sinister, meaning intended for him. In the characteri stic schizophrenic disturbance of thinking, peripheral and irrelevant feat ures of a total concept, which are inhibited in normal directed mental ac tivity, are brought to the forefront and utilized in place of the el ements relevant and appropriate to the situation. Thus thinking becomes vague, elliptical and obscure, and its expression in speech sometimes incomprehensible. Break s and interpolations in the flow of consecutive thought are fre quent, and the patient may be convinced that his thoughts are being withdrawn by some outsi de agency. Mood may be shallow, capricious or incongruous. Ambivalence and disturbance of volition may appear as inertia, negativism or stupor. Cata tonia may be present. The diagnosis \"schizophrenia\" should not be made unle ss there is, or has been evident during the same illness, characteristic dist urbance of thought, perception, mood, conduct, or personality--preferably in at least two of these areas. The diagnosis should not be restricted to conditions running a protracted, deteriorating, or chronic course. In addition to making the diagnosis on the criteria just given, effort should be made to specify one of the following subdivisions of schizophrenia, accord ing to the predominant symptoms. Includes: schizophrenia of th e types described in 295.0-295.9 occurring in children Excludes: childhood ty pe schizophrenia (299.9) infantile autism (299.0) ICD9 Cause of Death list 173 of 609 295.0 Simple type A psychosis in which ther e is insidious development of oddities of conduct, inability to meet the demands of soci ety, and decline in total performance. Delusions and hallucinations are not in evidence and the condition is less obviously psychotic than ar e the hebephrenic, catatoni c and paranoid types of schizophrenia. With increasing social impoverishment vagrancy may ensue and the patient becomes self-absorbed, idle and aimless. Because the schizophrenic symptoms are not clear-cu t, diagnosis of this form should be made sparingly, if at all. Schizophrenia simplex Excludes: latent schizophrenia (295.5) 295.1 Hebephrenic type A form of schizophrenia in which aff ective changes are prominent, delusions and hallucinations fleeting and fragme ntary, behavior irresponsible and unpredictable and mannerisms common. Th e mood is shallow and inappropriate, accompanied by giggling or self-satis fied, self-absorbed smiling, or by a lofty manner, grimaces, mannerisms, pr anks, hypochondriacal complaints and reiterated phrases. Thought is disorg anized. There is a tendency to remain solitary, and behavior seems empty of purpose and feeling. This form of schizophrenia usually starts between the ages of 15 and 25 years. Hebephrenia 295.2 Catatonic type Includes as an essential feature prom inent psychomotor disturbances often alternating between extremes such as hyperkinesis and stupor, or automatic obedience and negativism. Constrained attitudes may be maintained for long periods: if the patient's limbs are put in some unnatural position they may be held there for some time after the ex ternal force has been removed. Severe excitement may be a striking featur e of the condition. Depressive or hypomanic concomitants ICD9 Cause of Death list 174 of 609 The form of schizophrenia in which rela tively stable delusions, which may be accompanied by hallucinations, dominate the clinical picture. The delusions are frequently of persecution but ma y take other forms [for example of jealousy, exalted birth, Messianic mission, or bodily change]. Hallucinations and erratic behavior may occur; in so me cases conduct is seriously disturbed from the outset, thought disorder may be gross, and affective flattening with fragmentary delusions and hallucinations may develop. Paraphrenic schizophrenia Excludes: paraphrenia, i nvolutional paranoid state (297.2) paranoia (297.1) 295.4 Acute schizophrenic episode Schizophrenic disorders, other than those listed a bove, in which there is a dream-like state with slight cloudin g of consciousness and perplexity. External things, people and events may become charged with personal significance for the patient. There may be ideas of reference and emotional turmoil. In many such cases remission occurs within a few weeks or months, even without treatment. Oneirophrenia Schizophreniform: attack psychosis, confusional type Excludes: acute catatonic type (295.1) paranoid type (295.3) simple type (295.0) 295.5 Latent schizophrenia It has not been possible to produce a generally acceptable description for this condition. It is no t recommended for general use, but a description is provided for those who believe it to be useful: a condition of eccentric or inconsequent behavior and anomalies of affect which give the impression of schizophrenia though no definite and char acteristic schizophrenic anomalies, present or past, have been manifest. The inclusion terms indicate that this is the best place to classify some other poorly defined varieties of schizophrenia. Latent schizophrenic reaction Schizophrenia: ICD9 Cause of Death list 175 of 609 prodromal pseudoneurotic pseudopsychopathic Excludes: schizoid personality (301.2) 295.6 Residual schizophrenia A chronic form of schizophrenia in whic h the symptoms that persist from the acute phase have mostly lost their sh arpness. Emotional response is blunted and thought disorder, even when gross, does not prevent the accomplishment of routine work. Chronic undifferentiated Restzustand (schizophrenic) schizophrenia Schizophrenic residual state 295.7 Schizo-affective type A psychosis in which pronounced manic or depressive features are intermingled with schizophrenic features and which tends towards remission without permanent defect, but which is prone to recur. The diagnosis should be made only when both the affective and sc hizophrenic symptoms are pronounced. Cyclic schizophrenia Schizo-affective psychosis Mixed schizophrenic and Schizophreniform psychosis, affective type affective psychosis 295.8 Other Schizophrenia of t ypes not classifiable under 259.0-295.7. Acute (undifferentiated) schizophrenia Excludes: infantile autism (299.0) 295.9 Unspecified To be used only as a last resort. Schizophrenia NOS Schizophreniform psychosis NOS Schizophrenic reaction NOS 296 Affective psychoses ICD9 Cause of Death list 176 of 609 Mental disorders, usually recurrent, in which there is a severe disturbance of mood [mostly compounded of depression a nd anxiety but also manifested as elation and excitement] which is accompan ied by one or more of the following: delusions, perplexity, disturbed attitude to self, disorder of perception and behavior; these are all in keeping with the patient's prevailing mood [as are hallucinations when they occur]. There is a strong tendency to suicide. For practical reasons, mild disorders of m ood may also be included here if the symptoms match closely the descriptions given; this applies particularly to mild hypomania. Excludes: 296.0 Manic-depressive psychosis, manic type Mental disorders characterized by states of elation or excitement out of keeping with the patient's circumstances and varying from enhanced liveliness [hypomania] to violent, almost uncont rollable excitement. Aggression and anger, flight of ideas, distractibili ty, impaired judgement, and grandiose ideas are common. Hypomania NOS Manic psychosis Hypomanic psychosis Manic-depressive psychosis or reaction: Mania (monopolar) NOS hypomanic Manic disorder manic Excludes: circular t ype, if there was a previo us attack of depression (296.4) 296.1 Manic-depressive ps ychosis, depressed type An affective psychosis in which there is a widespread depressed mood of gloom and wretchedness with some degree of a nxiety. There is often reduced activity but there may be restlessness and agitat ion. There is a marked tendency to recurrence; in a few cases this may be at regular intervals. Depressive psychosis Manic-depressive psychosis or reaction Endogenous depression Monopolar depression Involutional melancholia Psychotic depression Excludes: circular t ype, if previous attack was of manic type (296.3) depression NOS (311) 296.2 Manic-depressive psychosis, ci rcular type but currently manic ICD9 Cause of Death list 177 of 609 An affective psychosis which has appeared in both the depressive and the manic form, either alternating or separated by an interval of normality, but in which the manic form is currently present. [The manic phase is far less frequent than the depressive.] Bipolar disorder, now manic Excludes: brief compensatory or rebound mood swings (296.8) 296.3 Manic-depressive psychosis, circ ular type but cu rrently Circular type (see 296.2) in which the de pressive form is currently present.

The delusions are of a fairly fixed, elaborate and systematized kind. 297.1 Paranoia A rare chronic psychosis in which logical ly constructed systematized delusions have developed gradually without concomitant hallucinations or the schizophrenic type of disordered th inking. The delusions are mostly of grandeur [the paranoiac prophet or inventor], 297.2 Paraphrenia Paranoid psychosis in which there are conspicuous hallucinations, often in several modalities. Affective symptoms and disordered thinking, if present, do not dominate the clinical picture a nd the personality is well preserved. Involutional paranoid state Late paraphrenia 297.3 Induced psychosis Mainly delusions psychosis, usually chr onic and often without florid features, which appears to have developed as a result of a close, if not dependent, relationship with another person who already has an established similar psychosis.

There may be less diurnal variation of symptoms than in 296.1, and the delusions are more often understandable in the context of the life experiences. There is usually a seriou s disturbance of behavior, e.g., major suicidal attempt.

Responses to auditory and so metimes to visual stimuli are abnormal and there are usually severe problems in the understanding of spoken language. Speech is delayed and, if it develops , is characterized by echolalia, the reversal of pronouns, immature grammati cal structure and inability to use abstract terms. There is generally an impairment in the social use of both verbal and gestural lang uage. Problems in social relationships are most severe before the age of five year s and include an impairment in the development of eye-to-eye gaze, social attachments, and cooperative play. Ritualistic behavior is usual and may in clude abnormal routines, resistance to change, attachment to odd objects and st ereotyped patterns of play. The capacity for abstract or symbolic th ought and for imaginative play is diminished. Intelligence ranges from severely subnormal to normal or above. Performance is usually better on tasks i nvolving rote memory or visuospatial skills than on those requiring symbolic or linguistic skills. Childhood autism Kanner's syndrome Infantile psychosis Excludes: disinteg rative psychosis childhood (299.9) 299.1 Disintegrative psychosis A disorder in which normal or near-nor mal development for the first few years is followed by a loss of social skills and of speech, together with a severe disorder of emotions, behavior and rela tionships. Usually this loss of speech and of social competence takes place ove r a period of a few months and is accompanied by the emergence of overactiv ity and of stereotypies. In most cases there is intellectual impairment, but this is not a necessary part of the disorder. The condition may follow overt brain disease--such as measles encephalitis--but it may also occur in the absence of any known organic brain disease or damage. Use additional code to identify any associated neurological disorder. Heller's syndrome Excludes: infantile autism (299.0) schizophrenic syndrome of childhood (299.9) 299.8 Other ICD9 Cause of Death list 182 of 609 A variety of atypical infantile psychoses which may show some, but not all, of the features of infantile autism. Symptoms may include stereotyped repetitive movements, hyperkinesis, self-injury, re tarded speech development, echolalia and impaired social relationships. Such disorders may occur in children of any level of intelligence but are particularly common in those with mental retardation.

However, it has been retained in view of its wide use. Neurotic disorders are mental disorders without any demonstrable organic basis in which the patient may have considerable insight and has unimpaired reality testing, in that he usually does not confuse his morbid subjective experiences and fantasies with external reality. Behavior may be greatly affected although usually remaining within social ly acceptable limits, but personality is not disorganized. The principal ma nifestations include excessive anxiety, hysterical symptoms, phobias, obsessiona l and compulsive symptoms, and depression. 300.0 Anxiety states Various combinations of physical and me ntal manifestations of anxiety, not attributable to real danger and occurring either in attacks or as a persisting state. The anxiety is usually diffu se and may extend to panic. Other neurotic features such as obsessional or hysterical symptoms may be present but do not dominate th e clinical picture. ICD9 Cause of Death list 183 of 609 Anxiety: Panic: neurosis attack reaction disorder (300.5) psychophysiologic disorders (306.-) 300.1 Hysteria Mental disorders in which motives, of which the patient seems unaware, produce either a restriction of the field of c onsciousness or disturbances of motor or sensory function which may seem to have psychological advantage or symbolic value. It may be characterized by conversion phenomena or dissociative phenomena. In the conversion form th e chief or only symptoms consist of psychogenic disturbance of function in some part of the body, e.g., paralysis, tremor, blindness, deafness, seizures. In the dissociative variety, the most prominent feature is a narrowing of the field of consciousness which seems to serve an unconscious purpose and is commonly accompanied or followed by a selective amnesia. There may be drama tic but essentially superficial changes of personality sometimes taking the form of a fugue [wandering state]. Behavior may mimic psychosis or, rath er, the patient's idea of psychosis. Astasia-abasia, hysterical Dissociative reaction of state Compensation neurosis Ganser's syndrome, hysterical Conversion hysteria Hysteria NOS Conversion reaction Multiple personality Excludes: adjustment reaction (309.-) anorexia nervosa (307.1) gross states with abnormally intens e dread of certain objects or specific situations which would not normally have that effect. If th e anxiety tends to spread from a specified situation or obj ect to a wider range of circumstances, it becomes akin to or identical with a nxiety state, and s hould be classified as such (300.0) Agoraphobia Claustrophobia ICD9 Cause of Death list 184 of 609 Animal phobias Phobia NOS Anxiety-hysteria Excludes: a nxiety state (300.0) obsessional phobias States in which the outstanding sy mptom is a feeling of subjective compulsion--which must be resisted--to carry out some action, to dwell on an idea, to recall an experience, or to rumi nate on an abstract topic. Unwanted thoughts which intrude, the insistency of words or ideas, ruminations or trains of thought are perceived by th e patient to be inappropriate or nonsensical. The obsessional urge or id ea is recognized as alien to the personality but as coming from within the self. Obsessional actions may be quasi-ritual performances designed to relieve anxiety, e.g., washing the hands to cope with contamination. Attempts to dispel the unwelcome thoughts or urges may lead to a severe inner struggle, with intense anxiety. Anankastic neurosis Compulsive (e.g., encephalitis) 300.4 Neurotic depression A neurotic disorder characterized by disproportionate depression which has usually recognizably ensued on a distre ssing experience; it does not include among its features delusions or ha llucinations, and there is often preoccupation with the psychic trauma which preceded the illness, e.g., loss of a cherished person or possession. Anxi ety is also frequently present and mixed states of anxiety and depres sion should be included here. The distinction between depressive neurosis and psychosis should be made not only upon the degree of depression but also on the presence or absence of other neurotic and psychotic characteristic s and upon the degree of disturbance of the patient's behavior. Anxiety depression Reactive depression Depressive reaction Neurotic depressive state Excludes: adjustment reaction with depressive symptoms (309.0) depression NOS (311) manic-depres sive psychosis, depressed type (296.1) ICD9 Cause of Death list 185 of 609 reactive depressive psychosis (298.0) 300.5 Neurasthenia A neurotic disorder characterized by fatigue, irritability, headache, depression, insomnia, difficulty in co ncentration, and lack of capacity for enjoyment [anhedonia]. It may follow or accompany an infection or exhaustion, or arise from continued emotional stress. If neurasthenia is associated with a physical disorder, the la tter should also be coded. Nervous debility Excludes: organic brain damage (310.-) 300.6 Depersonalization syndrome A neurotic disorder with an unpleasant state of disturbed perception in which external objects or parts of one's ow n body are experienced as changed in their quality, unreal, remote or automa tized. The patient is aware of the subjective nature of the change he e xperiences. Depersonalization may occur as a feature of several mental diso rders including depression, obsessional neurosis, anxiety and schizophrenia; in that case the condition should not be classified here but in th e corresponding major category. Derealization (neurotic) 300.7 Hypochondriasis A neurotic disorder in which the cons picuous features ar e excessive concern with one's health in general or the in tegrity and functioning of some part of one's body, or, less frequently, one's mind. It is usually associated with anxiety and depression. It may occur as a feature of severe mental disorder and in that case should not be classified here but in the corresponding major category. Excludes: hysteria (300.1) manic-depres ICD9 Cause of Death list 186 of 609 Neurotic disorders not classified el sewhere, e.g., occupational neurosis. Patients with mixed neuroses should not be classified in this category but according to the most prominent symptoms they display. Briquet's disorder Psychasthenia Occupational neurosis, Psychasthenic neurosis including writer's cramp 300.9 Unspecified To be used only as a last resort. Neurosis NOS Psychoneurosis NOS 301 Personality disorders Deeply ingrained maladaptive patterns of behavior generally recognizable by the time of adolescence or earlier and continuing throughout most of adult life, although often becoming less obvi ous in middle or old age. The personality is abnormal either in the ba lance of components, their quality and expression or in its total aspect. Becau se of this deviation or psychopathy the patient suffers or others have to suffer and there is an adverse effect upon the individual or on society. It includes what is sometimes called psychopathic personality, but if th is is determined primarily by malfunctioning of the brain, it should not be classified here but as one of the nonpsychotic organic brain syndromes ( 310). When the patient exhibits an anomaly of personality directly relate d to his neurosis or psychosis, e.g., schizoid personality and schizophrenia or anankastic persona lity and obsessive compulsive neurosis, the relevant neuros is or psychosis which is in evidence should be diagnosed in addition. Character neurosis 301.0 Paranoid personality disorder Personality disorder in which there is excessive sensitiveness to setbacks or to what are taken to be humiliations and rebuffs, a tendency to distort experience by misconstruing the neutral or friendly actions of others as hostile or contemptuous, and a combativ e and tenacious sense of personal rights. There may be a proneness to j ealousy or excessive self-importance. Such persons may feel helplessly humiliated and put upon; others, likewise excessively sensitive, are aggressive a nd insistent. In all cases there is excessive self-reference. Fanatic personality Paranoid traits ICD9 Cause of Death list 187 of 609 Paranoid personality (disorder) Excludes: acute pa ranoid reaction (298.3) alcoholic paranoia (291.5) paranoid schizophrenia (295.3) paranoid states (297.-) 301.1 Affective personality disorder Personality disorder characterized by lifelong predominance of a pronounced mood which may be persistently depressive , persistently elated, or alternately one then the other. During periods of elation there is unshakeable optimism and an enhanced zest for life and activ ity, whereas periods of depression are marked by worry, pessimism, low output of energy and a sense of futility. Cycloid personality Depressive disorder Personality disorder in whic h there is withdrawal from affectional, social and ot her contacts with autistic preference for fantasy and intros pective reserve. Behavior may be slightly eccentric or indicate avoidance of competitive situations. Apparent coolness and detachment may mask an incapacity to express feeling. Excludes: schizophrenia (295.-) 301.3 Explosive personality disorder Personality disorder characterized by instability of mood with liability to intemperate outbursts of anger, hate, vi olence or affection. Aggression may be expressed in words or in physical violence. The outbursts cannot readily be controlled by the affected persons , who are not otherwise prone to antisocial behavior. Aggressive: Emotional instability personality (excessive) reaction Pathological emotionality Aggressiveness Quarrelsomeness ICD9 Cause of Death list personality (301.7) hysterical neurosis (300.1) 301.4 Anankastic personality disorder Personality disorder characterized by feelings of persona l insecurity, doubt and incompleteness leading to exces sive conscientiousness, checking, stubbornness and caution. There may be insistent and unwelcome thoughts or impulses which do not attain the severity of an obsessional neurosis. There is perfectionism and meticulous accuracy and a need to check repeatedly in an attempt to ensure this. Rigidity an d excessive doubt may be conspicuous. Compulsive personality Obsessional personality Excludes: obsessive-c ompulsive disorder (300.3) phobic state (300.2) disorder Personality disorder characterized by shallow, labile affectivity, dependence on others, craving for appreciation and attention, suggestibility and theatricality. There is often sexual immaturity, e.g., frigidity and over- responsiveness to stimuli. Under stress hysterical symptoms [neurosis] may develop. Psychoinfantile (300.1) 301.6 Asthenic personality disorder Personality disorder characterized by passive compliance with the wishes of elders and others and a weak inadequate response to the demands of daily life. Lack of vigor may show itself in the in tellectual or emotional spheres; there is little capacity for enjoyment. Dependent personality Passive personality Inadequate personality Excludes: neurasthenia (300.5) 301.7 Personality disorder with pr edominantly sociopathic or asocial manifestation Personality disorder characterized by disregard for social obligations, lack ICD9 Cause of Death list 189 of 609 of feeling for others, and impetuous vi olence or callous unconcern. There is a gross disparity between behavior and the prevaili ng social norms. Behavior is not readily modifiable by experience, including punishment. People with this personality are often affectively cold and may be abnormally aggressive or irresponsible. Their to lerance to frustration is low; they blame others or offer plausible ratio nalizations for the behavior which brings them into conf lict with society. Amoral personality Asocial personality Antisocial personality Excludes: disturbance of conduct w ithout specifiable personality disorder (312.-) explosive personality (301.3) 301.8 NOS Psychopathic: Personality disorder NOS constitutional state personality (disorder) 302 Sexual deviations and disorders Abnormal sexual inclinations or behavi or which are part of a referral problem. The limits and features of no rmal sexual inclination and behavior have not been stated absolutely in different societies and cultures but are broadly such as serve approved social and biological purposes. The sexual activity of affected persons is direct ed primarily either towards people not of the opposite sex, or towards sexua l acts not associated with coitus normally, or towards coitus performed under abnormal circumstances. If the anomalous behavior becomes manifest only during psychosis or other mental illness the condition should be classifi ed under the major illness. It is common for more than one anomaly to occu r together in the same individual; in that case the predominant deviation is classified. It is preferable not to ICD9 Cause of Death list 190 of 609 include in this category individuals who perform de viant sexual acts when normal sexual outlets are not available to them. 302.0 Homosexuality Exclusive or predominant sexual attraction for persons of the same sex with or without physical relationship.

Excludes: trans-sexualism (302.5) 302.4 Exhibitionism Sexual deviation in which the main sexual pleasure and gratification is derived from exposure of the genitals to a person of the opposite sex. 302.5 Trans-sexualism Sexual deviation centered around fixed be liefs that the overt bodily sex is wrong. The resulting behavior is direct ed towards either changing the sexual organs by operation or completely c oncealing the bodily sex by adopting both the dress and behavior of the opposite sex. Excludes: transvestism (302.3) 302.6 Disorders of psychosexual identity ICD9 Cause of Death list 191 of 609 Behavior occurring in prea dolescents of immature psychosexuality which is similar to that shown in the sexual de viations described under transvestism (302.3) and trans-sexualism (302.5). Cr oss-dressing is intermittent, although it may be frequent, and identification w ith the behavior and appearance of the opposite sex is not yet fixed. The commonest form is feminism in or aversi on to sexual intercourse, of psychological origin, of suffici ent intensity to lead, if not to active avoidance, to mark ed anxiety, discomfort or pain when normal sexual intercourse takes place. Less severe degrees of this disorder that also give rise to consultation should also be coded here.

Excludes: neuroses, personality diso rders, or other nonpsychotic conditions occurring in a form similar to that seen with functional disorders but in association with a physical condition; code to 300.-, 300.-, etc., and use additional code to identify the physical condition 310.0 Frontal lobe syndrome Changes in behavior following damage to the frontal areas of the brain or following interference with the connections of those areas. There is a general diminution of self-control, foresight, creativity and spontaneity, which may be manifest as increased irritabilit y, selfishness, restlessness and lack of concern for others. Conscientiousness and powers of concentration are often diminished, but measurable deterioration of intellect or memory is not necessarily present. The overall pictur e is often one of emotional dullness, lack of drive and slowness; but, partic ularly in persons previously with energetic, restless or aggressive ch aracteristics, there may be a change towards impulsiveness, boastfulness, te mper outbursts, silly fatuous humour, and the development of unrealistic amb itions; the direction of change usually depends upon the previous pe rsonality. A considerable degree of recovery is possible and continue over th e course of several years. Lobotomy syndrome Postleucotomy syndrome [state] ICD9 Cause of Death list 203 of 609 Excludes: postcontusional syndrome (310.2) 310.1 Cognitive or personality change of other type Chronic, mild states of memory dist urbance and intellectual deterioration, often accompanied by increased irritabi lity, querulousness, lassitude and complaints of physical weakness. These states are often associated with old age, and may precede more severe states due to brain damage classifiable under dementia of any type (290.-,and 294.-) or any condition in 293.-(Transient organic psychotic conditions). Mild memory disturbance Organic psychosyndrome of nonpsychotic severity 310.2 Postconcussional syndrome States occurring after generalized co ntusion of the brain, in which the symptom picture may resemble that of th e frontal lobe syndro me (310.0) or that of any of the neurotic disorders (300.0-300.9), but in which in addition, headache, giddiness, fatigue, insomnia and a subjective feeling of impaired intellectual ability are usually promin ent. Mood may fluctuate, and quite ordinary stress may produce exaggerated fear and apprehension. There may be marked intolerance of mental and physical exertion, undue sensitivity to noise, and hypochondriacal preoccupation. The symptoms are more common in persons who have previously suffered from neurotic or personality disorders or when there is a possibility of compen sation. This syndrome is particularly associated with the closed type of head injury when signs of localized brain damage are slight or absent, but it may also occur in other conditions. Postcontusional syndrome (encephalopathy) Post-traumatic brain (310.0) postencephalitic (310.8) psychotic conditions following head injury (290.- to 294.0) 310.8 Other Include here disorders resembling the postcontusional syndrome(310.2), associated with infective or other diseases of the brain or surrounding tissues.

It should be used for abnormal behavior, in individuals of any age, which gives ri se to social disapproval but which is not part of any other psychiatric cond ition. Minor emotional disturbances may also be present. To be included, th e behavior--as judged by its frequency, severity and type of associations with other symptoms--must be abnormal in its context. Disturbances of conduct ar e distinguished from an adjustment reaction by a longer duration and by a lack of close relationship in time and content to some stress. They diffe r from a personality disorder by the absence of deeply ingrained maladaptiv e patterns of behavior present from adolescence or earlier. Excludes: adjustment reacti on with disturbance of conduct (309.3) drug dependence (304.-) personality diso rder with predominantly (302.-) 312.0 Unsocialized disturbance of conduct ICD9 Cause of Death list 205 of 609 Disorders characterized by behaviors such as defiance, disobedience, quarrelsomeness, aggression, destructive behavior, tantrums, solitary stealing, lying, teasing, bu llying and disturbed rela tionships with others. The defiance may sometimes take the form of sexual misconduct. Unsocialized aggressive disorder 312.1 Socialized disturbance of conduct Disorders in individuals who have acquired the values or behavior of a delinquent peer group to whom they are loyal and with whom they characteristically steal, play truant, and stay out late at night. There may also be promiscuity. Group delinquency 312.2 Compulsive conduct disorder Disorder of conduct or delinquent act which is specifically compulsive in origin. Kleptomania 312.3 Mixed disturbance of conduct and emotions Disorders involving behaviors listed for 312.0 and 312.1 but in which there is also considerable emotional distur bance as shown for example by anxiety, misery or obsessive manifestations. Neurotic delinquency Excludes: compulsive conduct disorder (312.2) 312.8 Other 312.9 Unspecified 313 Disturbance of emotions specific to childhood and adolescence Less well differentiated emotional diso rders characteristic of the childhood period. Where the emotional disorder ta kes the form of a neurotic disorder described under 300.-, the appropriate 300.- coding should be made. This category differs from category 308.- in terms of longer duration and by the lack of close relationship in tim e and content to some stress. Excludes: adjustment reaction (309.-) ICD9 Cause of Death list 206 of 609 masturbation, nail- biting, thumb-sucking, and other isolated symptoms (307.-) anxiety and fearfulness Ill-defined emotional disorders characte ristic of childhood in which the main symptoms involve anxiety and fearfulne ss.

Sibling jealousy Excludes: relationship problems asso ciated with aggression, destruction, or other forms of conduct disturbance (312.-) 313.8 Other or mixed ICD9 Cause of Death list 207 of 609 Many emotional disorders of childhood in clude several elements but whenever possible a specific coding under .0, .1, .2 or .3 should be made according to the preponderant type of disturbance. The category of mixed disorders should only be used when there is such an admixture that this cannot be done. 313.9 Unspecified 314 Hyperkinetic syndrome of childhood Disorders in which the essential feat ures are short attention-span and distractibility. In early childhood the most striking symptom is disinhibited, poorly organized and poorly regulated extreme overactivity but in adolescence this may be replaced by underactivity. Impulsiveness, marked mood fluctua- tions and aggression are also common symp toms. Delays in the development of specific skills are often present a nd disturbed, poor relationships are common. If the hyperkinesis is symptomatic of an underlying disorder, code the underlying disorder instead. 314.0 Simple disturbance of activity and attention Cases in which short attention span, di stractibility, and ove ractivity are the main manifestations with out significant disturban ce of conduct or delay in specific skills. Overactivity NOS 314.1 Hyperkinesis with developmental delay Cases in which the hyperkinetic syndrome is associated with speech delay, clumsiness, reading difficulties or other delays in specific skills. Developmental disorder of hyperkinesis Use additional code to identify a ny associated neurological disorder 314.2 Hyperkinetic conduct disorder Cases in which the hyperkinetic syndrome is associated with marked conduct disturbance but not developmental delay. Hyperkinetic conduct disorder Excludes: hyperkinesis with signif icant delays in specific skills (314.1) 314.8 Other ICD9 Cause of Death list 208 of 609 314.9 Unspecified Hyperkinetic reaction of childhood or adolescence NOS Hyperkinetic syndrome NOS 315 Specific delays in development A group of disorders in which a specific delay in development is the main feature. In each case development is related to biological maturation but it is also influenced by nonbiological factors and the coding carries no aetiological implications. Excludes: when due to a neurological disorder (320-389) 315.0 Specific reading retardation Disorders in which the main feature is a serious impairment in the development of reading or spelling skills which is not explicable in terms of general intellectual retardation or of inadequate schooling. Speech or language difficulties, impaired right-left diffe rentiation, perceptuo-motor problems, and coding difficulties are frequently associated. Similar problems are often present in other members of the famil y. Adverse psychosocial factors may be present. Developmental dyslexia Specific spelling difficulty 315.1 Specific arithmetical retardation Disorders in which the main feature is a serious impairment in the development of arithmetical skills which is not explicable in terms of general intellectual retardation or of inadequate schooling. Dyscalculia 315.2 Other specific learning difficulties Disorders in which the main feature is a serious impairment in the development of other learning skills which are not explicable in terms of general intellectual retardation or of inadequate schooling. Excludes: specific arith metical retardation (315.1) specif ic reading retardation (315.0) 315.3 Developmental speech or language disorder Disorders in which the main feature is a serious impairment in the development ICD9 Cause of Death list 209 of 609 of speech or language [syntax or semantic s] which is not explicable in terms of general intellectual retardation. Mo st commonly there is a delay in the development of normal word-sound pr oduction resulting in defects of articulation. Omissions or substituti ons of consonants are most frequent. There may also be a delay in the prod uction of spoken language. Rarely, there is also a developmental delay in the comprehension of sounds. Includes cases in which delay is largely due to environmental privation. Developmental Specific motor retardation Disorders in which the main feature is a serious impairment in the development of motor coordination which is not explicable in terms of general intellectual retardation. The clumsiness is comm only associated with perceptual difficulties. Clumsiness syndrome Dyspraxia syndrome 315.5 Mixed development disorder A delay in the development of one sp ecific skill [e.g., reading, arithmetic, speech or coordination] is frequently a ssociated with lesser delays in other skills. When this occurs the coding should be made according to the skill most seriously impaired. The mixed cat egory should be used only where the mixture of delayed skills is such that no one skill is preponderantly affected. 315.8 Other 315.9 Unspecified Developmental disorder NOS 316 Psychic factors associated with diseases classified elsewhere Mental disturbances or ps ychic factors of any type thought to have played a major part in the aetiology of physical conditions, usually involving tissue damage, classified elsewhere. The me ntal disturbance is usually mild and nonspecific and psychic factors [worry, fear, conflict, etc.] may be present without any overt psychiatric disorder. Use an additional code to identify the ICD9 Cause of Death list 210 of 609 physical condition. In the rare instance that an overt psychiatric disorder is thought to have caused a physical condition, use a second additional code to record the psychiatric diagnosis. Examples of the use of this category are: psychogenic: asthma (316 and 493.9) dermatitis (316 531.-) mucous colitis (316 and 564.1) ulcerative (316 and (316 and 708.-) dwarfism (316 and 259.4) Excludes: physical symptoms and physiological malfunctions, not involving tissue damage, of mental origin (306.-) MENTAL RETARDATION (317-319) A condition of arrested or incomplete de velopment of mind which is especially characterized by subnormality of intellig ence. The coding should be made on the individual's current level of functi oning without regard to its nature or causation such as psychosis, cultural deprivation, Down's syndrome etc. Where there is a specific cognitive handicap, such as in speech, the four-digit coding should be based on a ssessments of cognition outside the area of specific handicap. The assessment of intellectual level should be based on whatever information is available, including clinical evidence, adaptive behavior and psychometric fi ndings. The IQ levels given are based on a test with a mean of 100 and a standard deviat ion of 15-such as the Wechsler scales. They are provided only as a guide and should not be applied rigidly. Mental retardation often involves psychiatric di sturbances and may often develop as a result of some physical disease or inju ry. In these cases, an additional code or codes should be used to identify any associated condi tion, psychiatric or physical. The Impairment and Handicap codes should also be consulted. 317 Mild mental retardation Feeble-minded Mild mental subnormality High-grade defect Moron IQ 50-70 318 Other specified mental retardation ICD9 Cause of Death list 211 of 609 318.0 Moderate mental retardation Imbecile IQ 35-49 Moderate mental subnormality 318.1 Severe mental retardation IQ 20-34 Severe mental subnormality 318.2 Profound mental retardation Idiocy Profound mental subnormality IQ under 20 319 Unspecified mental retardation Mental deficiency NOS Mental subnormality NOS ICD9 Cause of Death list 212 of 609 VI.

Cause of Death list 510 of 609 SUPPLEMENTARY CLASSIFICATION OF EXTERNAL CAUSES OF INJURY AND POISONING This section is provided to pe rmit the classification of environmental events, circumstances and conditions as the cause of injury, poisoning and other adverse effects. Where a code fr om this section is applicable, it is intended that it shall be used in addi tion to a code from one of the main chapters of the International Classifica tion of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, indicating the nature of the condition. Most often, the nature of the condition will be classifiable to Chapter XVII, Injuries, Poisoning and Violence, and for the classification of the underlying cause of death these will always require an \"E\" code in addition. Causes of death should preferably be tabulated according to both the Chapter XVII and the \"E\" codes, but if only one code is tabulated th en the \"E\" code should be used in preference to the Chapter XVII code. Certain other conditions which may be stated to be due to external causes are classified in Chapters I to XVI of ICD, and for these the \"E\" code cl assification should be used as an additional code for multiple-condition analysis only. Machinery accidents [other than conn ected with transport] are classifiable to category E919, in which the fourth di git allows a broad classification of the type of machinery involved. If a mo re detailed classification of type of machinery is required, it is suggested that the \"Classification of Industrial Accidents according to Agency,\" prepared by the International Labor Office, be used in addition. Categories for \"late effects\" of accidents and other external causes are to be found at E929, E959, E969, E977, E989, and E999. Definitions and examples rela ted to transport accidents (a) A transport accident (E800-E848) is any accident involving a device designed primarily for, or being used at the time primarily for, conveying persons or goods from one place to another.

Accidents involving agricultu ral and construction machines, such as tractors, cranes and bulldozers, are regarded as transport accidents only when these ICD9 Cause of Death list 511 of 609 vehicles are under their own power on a highway [otherwise the vehicles are regarded as machinery]. Vehicles whic h can travel on land or water, such as hovercraft and other amphibious vehicles, are regarded as watercraft when on the water, as motor vehicles when on the highway, and as off-road motor vehicles when on land, but off the highway. Excludes: accidents: in sports which involve the use of transport but where the transport vehicle itself is not involved in the accident involving vehi cles which are part of industrial equipment used entirely on industrial premises occurring dur ing transportation but unrelated to the hazards a ssociated with the means of transportation [e.g., inju ries received in a fight on board ship; transport vehi cle involved in a cataclysm such as an earthquake] to persons enga ged in the maintenance or repair of transport e quipment or vehicle not in motion, unless injured by another vehicle in motion (b) A railway accident is a transport accident involving a railway train or other railway vehicle operated on rails, whether in motion or not.

(e) A motor vehicle accident is a tr ansport accident involving a motor vehicle. It is defined as a motor ve hicle traffic accident or as a motor vehicle nontraffic accident according to whether the accident occurs on a public highway or elsewhere. Excludes: injury or damage due to cataclysm injury or damage while a motor vehicle, not under its own power, is being loaded on, or unloaded from, another conveyance (f) A motor vehicle traf fic accident is any motor vehicle accident occurring on a public highway [i.e., originatin g, terminating or involving vehicle partially on the highway]. A motor ve hicle accident is assumed to have occurred on the highway unless another pl ace is specified, except in the case of accidents involving only off-road moto r vehicles, which are classified as nontraffic accidents unless the contrary is stated. (g) A motor vehicle nontraffic accident is any motor vehicle accident which occurs entirely in any place other than a public highway. (h) A public highway [trafficway] or street is the enti re width between property lines [or other boundary lines] of every way or place, of which any part is open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular traffic as a matter of right or custom. A roadway is that part of the public highway designed, improved and ordinarily used, for vehicular travel.

Includes: motorized: bicycle scooter tricycle (k) An off-road motor vehicle is a mo tor vehicle of special design, to enable it to negotiate rough or soft terrain or snow. Examples of special design are high construction, special wheels and tir es, drive by tracks, or support on a cushion of air. Includes: army tank hovercraft, on land or swamp snowmobile (l) A driver of a motor vehicle is the occupant of the motor vehicle operating it or intending to operate it. A motorcyclist is the driver of a motor cycle. Other authorized occupants of a motor vehicle are passengers.
