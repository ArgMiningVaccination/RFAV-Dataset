They're in Great Britain, South Africa, New York, and Silicon Valley. Their reach extends as far as Japan, Thailand, Mexico, and Portugal. They are leading a new wave of wisely planned dot.coms, solving the emergency response challenges of society, and are studying how the purest levels of democracy can be effectively applied. They are stretching the boundaries of art with Sundance- bound films, and are developing next-generation technologies.

But one thing ties the 181 alumni of the Hinman CEOs Program together\u2014an insatiable desire to make their mark. \"There is so much energy with these students,\" said Karen Thornton, program director for Hinman CEOs. \"The common thread I've seen in all of our students is that they want to be empowered and use that power to change the world around them. They want to create value in everything they do, and they do so from many different references and academic disciplines.\" That potential is what alumnus Brian Hinman, ('82, electrical engineering) a successful entrepreneur, envisioned when he commissioned the program with a $2.5 million gift in in 1999. \"To some extent, the program is self-selecting that way,\" said Hinman. \"It attracts the Type-A personality, those with the 'world is my oyster' attitude eager to make their mark in the world.\" The magic of the program, according to several alumni, lies in living with 100 or so students who have the same ambitions. Teams and lifelong friendships are formed. \"The Hinman program was fantastic,\" said alumnus Nick Adasi. \"It surrounded me with highly motivated, hungry, young entrepreneurs\u2014the guys on campus bouncing ideas off each other at 3 a.m. It taught me how to think out of the box, and that entrepreneurship isn't something that happens overnight. Over time you develop ideas through experiences.\" Alumna Sarah Vogel worked with alumnus Lee Finkel to launch the Web site for her product. Jason Volk and Blake Robertson are partners at Alertus. Across the board, students stay in touch\u2014sharing dreams and ideas, and making plans. \"When you connect with people who share your vision and enthusiasm, the relationships can run pretty deep,\" said Hinman. \"It's a very powerful experience. Although graduates of the program might not start companies right out of school, they've already formed long-lasting or lifetime relationships. They'll reconnect.\" They do. \"We still keep in touch and share career ideas and topics and talk about how and when we're going to become entrepreneurs, and what investment opportunities there are,\" said Adasi. \"At some point in our lives, I'm sure we're going to help each other in a million ways.\" Left to right, top row: Marc Anolik, David Marquart, Anar Mikailov, Samuel Arumala, Jessie Leikin, Cindy Gilbert Left to right, bottom row: Diana Bernstein, Pamela Kalmus, Lindsey Bernstein, Rebekah Finch, Diana Bernstein, Erika Borna CEOs Hinman Campus Entrepreneurship OpportunitiesA.

Little did he know he'd be so successful that five short years after graduating, he'd help raise $60 million for a new television broadcast network that could be the first to span the entire continent of Africa. It starts with tenacity. The 2001 finance alumnus worked at five major investment banks before he graduated: Prudential, Fannie Mae, Legg Mason, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs. \"Any time I was out of school I tried to work at a bank because I knew it was tough to get into a top-tier Wall Street investment bank,\" said Adasi. After graduating he joined Goldman Sachs, where he spent 16 months in New York before transferring to London to do consumer retail, healthcare, and investment banking. \"I wanted to go to Europe because investment banking is considered a career there,\" said Adasi. \"In the U.S., they expect you to go back to business school to advance.\" Accordingly, Adasi was promoted to Associate at Goldman and transferred to South Africa for one year.\"One of the reasons I wanted to move to Africa was I'd get to work with a top-tier investment bank in an emerging market,\" said Adasi, whose parents are Nigerian. \"In four years I've lived on three different continents, working on mergers and acquisitions of large, multi-national companies,\" said Adasi. \"This was a great way to learn business from a global perspective, which is something a lot of people don't have an opportunity to do right out of college. Many people stay focused on the U.S. \"Every time I traveled, I found that in America things are built up and developed. When you go to places like Eastern Europe and Africa and the Middle East, you see the potential of simple technologies and ideas coming to that market. It helps me keep my global glasses on, applying the American mindset to global markets.\" Being in South Africa helped Adasi raise money for his family's new company, Foisi Broadcasting Network Inc. ( www.fbnafrica.com ), a pan-African commercial broadcasting and production corporation that plans to organize and broadcast Africa's premier intercontinental radio, television, and Internet signals in and out of all 53 African countries\u2014promoting peace, unity, and prosperity across the continent.

Squarespace ( www.squarespace.com ), a publishing system for managing websites and blogs Casalena launched while in college, started that way. Squarespace now has over 100,000 trial registrations and over 50 million monthly page views. Mentioned in the same breath by the media as Google's Blogger, Squarespace evolved simply: \"I didn't like making a web site, so I made my own product,\" Casalena explained. \"People sometimes invent businesses based on some very elaborate connections between markets,\" said Casalena. \"There are people producing video content for mobile phones.

Here you go. It's hard to build a web site. Squarespace makes it easy.\" Casalena doesn't like online chat programs, so he's working on one of those as well. After that, he may build personal information products. That's not to say Squarespace is stagnating. Ten minutes at www.casalena.org makes you wonder if he sleeps. Casalena is constantly and thoughtfully adding new features and improving his system. Squarespace has attracted the interest of major investors, including some major west coast VCs, which flew Casalena to Silicon Valley to talk. \"It was a great experience,\" said Casalena. \"It [Squarespace] just doesn't fit the model of all firms. Squarespace isn't like YouTube in that it won't experience escalated growth.

I love coming out to work and it puts a really good spin on things (as opposed to being in a dorm room). Being in the same place all the time puts a drain on you. Tribeca is a phenomenal area. It's a landmark itself. There are lots of people in New York just trying to get started. It's tough, but there's lots of enthusiasm.

If you're someone looking to start a company, Hinman will be very good for you. The Program can connect you with people you need to meet. It fosters a more professional way of thinking about a business, exposes you to things you wouldn't see otherwise, such as venture capitalists or evaluating business plans. It's valuable for you to see how all these things work in the real world.\" Advice for Current Hinman Students \"Fix problems. People will pay you to have their problems fixed. Don't let investors discourage you from developing a good idea. Imagine you have the best idea in the world for a product\u2014but no traction. As a new entrepreneur, you definitely won't be able to get funding for that idea. That doesn't mean the idea\u2014along with your execution\u2014won't get funding in six months after you prove that it works. Investors are evaluating an opportunity, rather than simply your ideas.

She's outgoing, inquisitive, and rarely sits still.

We are the glue that sticks all these elements together. \"Google is really great about making sure employees are happy,\" Khurana added. \"Happy employees do a great job.\" How Did the Hinman Program Help You? \"When I came into the Hinman Program, I was a CS major and knew that if you code, you get results. Hinman trained me to think of a world beyond just coding. During speaker sessions someone would talk about patents and intellectual property; I had never been exposed to them.

Anik was a senior in the Hinman CEOs Program. Two short years later, 70,000 people subscribe to AC's affiliate marketing newsletter. Over 12,000 people have completed AC's affiliate marketing training program. The company has grown to seven employees. They've released an entire boxed course on affiliate marketing, with two DVDs, 12 CDs of audio interviews, a workbook split into ten modules, eight checklists, and a CD with six templates an affiliate manager would need to use. The company's monthly Affiliate Classroom magazine, now over two years old, also has a 70,000-person subscriber base. The company ranks first on Yahoo! when searching for \"affiliate marketing,\" and consistently ranks in the top three on Google. Singal recently met with eBay's director of affiliate marketing to discuss contributing content to AC's magazine. \"If I look back to when I first started this two years ago, I'm mesmerized by the growth of the company,\" said Singal. \"This was not supposed to be a big company. Now that I have the big picture and know what the company is capable of doing, though, I am not as surprised.\" After graduating in May 2005, Singal was working Hinman CEOs alumnus Anik Singalfrom home and realized AC was growing too fast. He called Karen Thornton and James Green for advice.

He taught me how a big business gets built. He's traveled coast-to-coast with me and introduced me to everyone I need to know. We just got back from San Fransisco, where we met Brian Hinman. During the same trip, we had coffee with the director of eBay's affiliate program in Palo Alto.\" More than anything, Singal said, VA helped him refine AC's business model. \"We know exactly what we want to go after,\" Singal explained. \"We've solidified our process for approaching the market.

Bookman visited Mexico's Federal Institute for Access to Public Information last march through a small grant from the Kennedy School. There he forged relationships, garnering support from the commissioner of the agency. \"Mexico is an exciting and tumultuous place, and of strategic importance to the U.S. in ways we don't recognize,\" said Bookman. \"This issue is of central importance to Mexico right now.

But getting babies that exposure in today's world can be difficult. Sarah Vogel ('04, business major) thinks she has the answer. Vogel's company, Babyfones, is launching a belt made especially for pregnant women, with built-in speakers to project sound into the womb from an mp3 player. Babyfones will be sold on Amazon and directly through the company's web site, at www.babyfones. com. \"Babyfones is designed for busy, modern-day women who are constantly 'on-the-go' and want to play music to their babies,\" said Vogel. \"Research has shown that listening to rhythmic music helps children develop linguistic skills even before they're born!\" Vogel wrote a business plan for Babyfones while she was in the Hinman Program. She realized the market potential when she witnessed pregnant women placing uncomfortable headphones onto their abdomens to play music for their babies. Current products are limited in both form and function, according to Vogel. \"While there are products that can play CDs, there are currently no products available that can accommodate your own music from an mp3 player,\" she said.

In 2002, Volk started Alertus Technologies ( www. alertustech.com ), a company that has since developed an all-hazards emergency alert system. Alertus's system enables safety leaders to disseminate localized, custom text alerts to wall- mounted beacons. Similar to a fire alarm, each beacon contains strobe lights and a siren, but also contains a text LCD display. Alerts are transmitted in seconds to all beacons or specific areas, buildings or rooms using a reliable radio frequency communication. For approximately the cost of conventional siren towers, the Alertus solution offers audible and visual signaling, coupled with text information, empowering everyone to respond during any emergency. The Alertus system has a low cost of ownership with no recurring service fees. With customers such as college campuses and school systems, Alertus is already making educational institutions safer places to be.

MARYLAND TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE www. MTECH .UMD .EDU \u00180 Brian Hinman: The Original CEO \"I never regarded myself as an entrepreneur,\" Brian Hinman says, even after starting three companies. \"In the last couple of years I think I'm finally coming to the conclusion that that's what I am.\" But even in his undergraduate days at Maryland he knew that he wanted to own his own technology company. On his graduate school application, he wrote that the reason he hoped to attend MIT was to find some other people who would eventually want to start a business with him (a goal achieved). So when Bill Destler, former dean of the A. James Clark School of Engineering and now senior vice president for academic affairs and provost, first approached Hinman with an \"out-of-the-box\" notion to encourage students with entrepreneurial aspirations, he found another idea he could run with. The Hinman CEOs Program was created through a generous $2.5 million commitment, establishing the nation's first living-learning entrepreneurship program at the University of Maryland. Hinman expected the Hinman CEOs Program to attract students with a \"world is my oyster\" attitude, creating a sense of community and cooperation among like-minded people. These students have a unique opportunity to share the experience of finishing their undergraduate educations within the program that will impact the way they think about their careers and destinies and encourage them to pursue entrepreneurial careers. Hinman hopes that the Washington, D.C., area will become a more fertile ground for high-tech growth companies as a result of the program. He had always felt that the university should be a catalyst for change in the area, encouraging the growth of industrial and consumer tech companies. In fact, before moving to Silicon Valley in January 1991, Hinman, who was raised in Wheaton, Md., looked at returning to the Washington area, which he considers home. But he didn't see the infrastructure in the region to support the types of high- tech products he planned to market to businesses and consumers. \"The ultimate measure of the program's success will be the start of new companies that create a substantial number of jobs in the D.C. area,\" Hinman said. Biography Brian L. Hinman joined Oak Investment Partners as a Venture Partner in 2006. Hinman is the co-founder, and formerly the President and CEO, of 2Wire, a provider of broadband service platforms for the DSL market. He is also the co-founder, and formerly the CEO, of Polycom, Inc., (NASDAQ: PLCM) the world's leading teleconferencing company. the co-founder of PictureTel Corporation (formerly NASDAQ: PCTL) at the age of 22, pioneering the video compression technology that has endured into the standards of today.

The four-year Hillman Entrepreneurs Program is offered to students who want to start a business, but might not be able to pursue a college career without assistance. \"We have two visions for the program,\" said Hillman. \"First, we started in PG County. We feel a strong obligation to support the community. Second, we believe entrepreneurial thinking is one way to influence the future of PG County, Maryland and our region in a positive way.\"That's the way we run our business [Southern Management Corporation]. We're a learning company that offers goal- oriented technical training, as well as professional and management development experiences to our employees. We teach people to think entrepreneurially, and to crave and thrive on responsibility. People respond to the way they're treated. If you give them the tools to excel, they will excel.\" Students in the Hillman Entrepreneur Program may pursue any course of study except pre-law. Hillman Entrepreneurs receive special coursework and programs to nurture their entrepreneurial skills and spirit; intensive mentoring; business internship opportunities; merit scholarships of $500 at PGCC and $1,000 at Maryland; and need-based scholarships to cover up to 100 percent of the annual cost for tuition and books. Twenty second-year Prince George's Community College students entered the program this fall; new first-year students will also be selected in spring 2007 for the next cohort. The first class will transfer to Maryland in fall 2007. During the subsequent three years of the pilot program, up to 30 students will enter the Hillman Entrepreneurs Program each fall as first-year PGCC students. These students will be selected from a pool of highly qualified students accepted for enrollment at Prince George's Community College. \"This new program means a lot to me,\" said Hillman Entrepreneurs student Chae Clark, who is a member of Hillman Entrepreneurs student Trevor Young.A.

MTECH .UMD .EDU \u00180 DataStream Content Solutions Grows from TAP Company is Second to Join MTECH Technology Ventures Building When DataStream Content Solutions LLC joined the Technology Advancement Program in 2000, few imagined it would increase its revenue more than ten fold in five years, as well as create 20 new high-tech jobs. That growth has driven the company to acquire new office space in the MTECH Technology Ventures Building, the first corporate space offered in the University of Maryland's M Square research park. \"This is fantastic, permanent space with room for us to double our staff again,\" said DataStream President Mark Anstey. \"The research park is a perfect location\u2014with excellent access to road and rail transportation, as well as its proximity to the University for technology and staffing purposes.\" The new offices, occupying the entire top floor of the Technology Ventures Building, feature a capacious 5,500 square feet of meeting rooms, workspaces, and administrative offices, replete with panoramic views of the historic College Park Airport. DataStream specializes in applying eXtensible Markup Language, or XML, to many types of data, helping manage or repurpose that data for Web publishing, hard copy distribution, report generation, or for populating databases. XML tagging makes data accessible across a wide range of machine platforms, according to Anstey. DataStream's success stems from the company's ability to deliver critical information quickly and accurately. Over the past five years, the company has played an important role in building advanced legislative data systems for the both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. DataStream has won more XML-based contracts with the legislative branch than any other company in the Washington area, according to Anstey. DataStream's customers also include Lexis-Nexis, GuideStar, and Congressional Quarterly. In 2004, DataStream acquired Potomac Publishing, enabling the parent company to become an electronic publisher in its own right. DataStream then took Potomac Publishing's original asset, an electronic database of federal statutes dating back to the first U.S. Congress in 1789, and expanded it into an online service with expansive additional content, including a groundbreaking legislative impact tool that offers real-time analysis of how proposed federal legislation impacts existing law. Congressional Quarterly, one of the country's oldest news organizations specializing in covering federal legislation, licensed Potomac Publishing's legislative impact product and launched it on CQ.com in July, 2006. \"2007 is shaping up to be an exciting year,\" said Anstey.

Joins TAP Company's Technology Enables Smart Vision in Mobile Devices By Lindsay Mize Applied Media Analysis Inc., a company developing advanced mobile vision technologies for handheld devices, joined the Technology Advancement Program (TAP), a leading venture incubator partnering with entrepreneurs to build early-stage companies, this fall. \"TAP has an excellent track record of assisting companies with business development and fund- raising,\" said Dr. David Doermann, co-founder and president of AMA, and co-director of the Laboratory for Language and Media Processing in the University of Maryland's Institute for Advanced Computer Studies. \"We look forward to growing our business along with TAP's talented team.\" AMA's patent-pending technology gives camera- enabled handheld devices smart vision\u2014enabling them to translate documents, enlarge text for the visually impaired, read and translate signs, scan business cards, read and process bar codes, and both read and interpret medication instructions. \"People have traditionally used camera phones to snap low-quality pictures and e-mail them to friends,\" said Scott Laughlin, director of the university's VentureAccelerator Program. \"With AMA's applications, you can now use your camera-enabled phone or PDA to do new and useful things, such as reading barcodes and translating foreign text. The company is opening a new realm for inexpensive, consumer mobile devices.\" When images need to be analyzed or used, they are typically sent to a computer to do the processing, according to Laughlin. AMA's software makes this possible on resource-limited devices. \"It's very easy to perform computer vision if you have substantial processing power, consistent light for imaging, and a known symbology,\" said Laughlin. \"AMA is working on the very hard end of the spectrum\u2014using both low processor power and a camera functioning without a consistent light beam. An AMA-enabled mobile device can interpret anything it's looking at, as long as you tell it what it's looking for.\" AMA has received $1.5 million in grant and research funding to move its technology forward. Funding agencies, through Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program grants, include the U.S. Army, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, National Science Foundation, Department of Education, and National Institutes of Health. AMA recently unveiled its new V-Code (video code) product. V-Code enables both businesses and consumers to use camera-enabled mobile devices for rapidly extracting and viewing information from two-dimensional product barcodes\u2014including reviews, coupons, prices and sales information. Video 2D barcodes also give commercial vendors the ability to pack more information into a product's barcode. The second product AMA plans to launch is a commercial language translator, which will instantly translate the text of anything photographed by a mobile device. The product is slated for a mid-January release. AMA entered the university's VentureAccelerator Program, which offers faculty and student inventors intense, hands-on business assistance, last year. The company recently graduated into TAP. \"TAP is committed to helping AMA execute its business plan,\" said Sarah Djamshidi, associate director for TAP. \"Our goals are to specifically focus on incremental fund-raising and augmenting the company's management team.\" www.appliedmediaanalysis.com Rendering of AMA's V-Code technology for camera-enabled devices Leading venture incubator for early-stage technology companies MTECH Ventures TAP Technology Advancement ProgramMARYLAND TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE www.

Once a firefighter bursts through the charred frame of a burning building, each second spent looking for victims could be deadly. With the help of TRX Systems' Fire Sentinel System, fellow fighters from the outside can monitor the position and movement of their embedded co-workers. \"The TRX Sentinel Base Station can see not only where firefighters are, but also their physical status, including whether they've been hit by something, or have fallen through a floor and are lying on their back,\" said Ben Funk, vice president of development for TRX Systems. TAP will give the emerging company the space and mentorship needed to evolve into a successful venture. \"Our due diligence indicates their technology exceeds any product currently offered on the market,\" said Sarah Djamshidi, associate director of TAP. \"Our initial focus will be to help TRX Systems raise capital and expand its business development team\u2014both with the goal of enabling the company to rapidly bring its product to market.\" Approximately 100 firefighters die each year in the line of duty, according to the U.S. Fire Administration. The terrorist attacks of September 11, which claimed the lives of 343 paramedics and firefighters, spurred the Department of Homeland Security to request devices that track rescue professionals indoors. Accurate indoor tracking makes the TRX Fire Sentinel unique. The system combines GPS\u2014which only works outdoors\u2014with an inertial navigation unit\u2014which works indoors and outdoors\u2014to create an integrated tracking system for all environments. \"Inertial navigation was originally used on missiles and airplanes, but with the help of MEMS technology we are able to compact it into the size of a pager,\" said Gilmer Blankenship, chairman of TRX Systems and a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. When the TRX Fire Sentinel base station detects that a firefighter is about to walk into a dangerous area, it can send an evacuation signal. Firefighters can also send alarms when they get into trouble. \"We have developed technology to directly communicate with the firefighters, but our top priorities are tracking and locating,\" said Blankenship. TRX Systems has received contracts from the National Security Agency, the National Science Foundation, TEDCO, and Techno-Sciences, Inc. for a total sum of more than $700,000. \"Working with TAP establishes us as a legitimate start-up company, so we don't look like guys working out of a garage to potential investors,\" said Blankenship. \"A lot of people are anxious to acquire this life saving technology; I have had calls from Singapore and the UK requesting it.\" TRX's management team also includes President Neil Goldsman, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Vice President Carole Teolis. www.trxsystems.com A.

It was 1993. Though the Internet was known to researchers, no AOL disks had yet slipped their way into households. PCs and the Internet had yet to be married. But Germantown-based Hughes Network Systems contributed $20,000 in cash to a $43,000 project with Baras, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Institute for Systems Research, which would one day make broadband-over- satellite Internet possible. \"No one thought the Internet would work over satellite,\" said Baras. The protocols just weren't made for that medium. Four short years later, in 1997, Hughes launched DirecPC (now called HughesNet), the first consumer product/service to offer Internet access via satellite. Fast forward to 2006. Internet-by-satellite is now an industry unto itself. Over 2 million broadband over satellite terminals are installed worldwide, according to John Kenyon, Senior Vice President for Engineering at Hughes. The protocols developed by Baras and Hughes are now called TIA-1008, a standard adopted intact by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. \"More terminals operate under this standard than any other,\" said Kenyon. \"We've shipped over one million terminals under those protocols. Our business represents about 55 percent of the total worldwide business in broadband satellite terminals. \"MIPS helped develop not just a new product, but a new industry,\" said Kenyon. \"Ten years ago a satellite terminal was $5,000. Today we're below $1,000. We're on the road to $500.\" That's not to mention Hughes' growth. \"Over time, we've probably generated within the state of Maryland, a large share of our revenue\" said Kenyon. Several billion of that can be directly credited to the work done through MIPS. We employ 1,500 people here in the state. Many of them are working on businesses related to this technology. \"If Annapolis looks at the value of the MIPS program to Maryland companies and the Maryland economy, they've done a lot,\" said Kenyon. But economic impact isn't the whole story, said Baras. \"Vincent Cerf was just here [at the University] talking about the Internet covering the planet. That's what we were doing. Satellites are the key. \"MIPS helped develop not just a new product, but a new industry.\" \u2014John Kenyon, senior vice president for engineering, Hughes Netwoork Systems A.

Hughes is also rolling out broadband Internet access in 800 schools in Brazil. Former electrical engineering graduate student Aaron Falk worked with Baras and Hughes' Doug Dillon to turn conventional wisdom on its head and develop asymmetric Internet protocols\u2014which send data to the satellite at one speed, and down to a modem at another\u2014for use over satellite. Prevailing theory at the time held that long latency would make this impossible. \"In one sense you could say that the breakthrough on the protocols basically created this whole industry,\" said Kenyon. \"We opened up Internet over satellite,\" said Baras. \"It was pioneering at the time. People were thinking of satellites for long-haul voice calls and television. We basically used the satellites as a node over the Internet.\" The work also gave Baras the chance to work on something that went straight into a commercial product. \"It was tremendous to work with Hughes because we could take our theories and implement and test them right away,\" said Baras. \"We got to innovate and go straight to industry. \"The project gave us the traditional academic rewards of papers and research, but we were solving a problem people thought could not be done.\"Over 30 papers were published as a result of the MIPS work with Hughes, according to Baras. Hughes has conducted 15 total MIPS projects with the university. Falk now chairs the Internet Research Task Force, which promotes research of importance to the evolution of the future Internet. He has chaired the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)'s working groups on TCP over Satellite, Performance Implications of Link Characteristics, and Datagram Congestion Control Protocol. www.hns.com Other Successful Products MIPS Projects Have Contributed To Company ProductRevenue/ Sales Martek BiosciencesDHA and ARA nutritional oils$784.5 million MedImmune Synagis\u00ae$6 billion Black & Decker Bullet\u00ae Speed Tip Masonry Drill Bit$21 billion (total 2001-2005 Power Tools and Accessories sales) Professor John Baras Faculty-led research projects to help Maryland companies develop technology-based products MTECH Partnerships MIPS Maryland Industrial PartnershipsMARYLAND TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE www.

Companies, Faculty Could Benefit Annually The state of Maryland backed a high- yield economic development initiative, the Maryland Industrial Partnerships (MIPS) program, in 2006 with a $1 million funding increase. The increase extends the reach of a program with a $12.1 billion economic impact on the Maryland economy by almost twofold. MIPS selects about 32 research projects each year teaming university faculty with Maryland companies to develop commercial products. The approved increase nearly doubles the program's $1.3 million annual budget, enabling the support of up to 22 additional projects yearly. MIPS has a successful track record of leveraging university expertise to help Maryland companies innovate and bring technologies to market. Martek Biosciences, Hughes Network Systems, MedImmune Inc., and Black & Decker\u2014 each have products that benefited from MIPS projects with Maryland faculty. MIPS supported Martek during its early stages, before the company generated over $500 million in revenue from its patented Omega-3 oils, which appear in nearly every major infant formula product in the U.S. \"When we were developing the organism that made our primary product, we didn't know anything about fermentation, and we didn't have the necessary equipment,\" said Henry Linsert Jr., Martek's former chairman and chief executive officer. \"Through MIPS, we were able to work with the university's Bioprocess Scale-Up Facility and develop the early, small-scale fermentation that we later scaled up for making hundreds and millions of dollars of this stuff.\" MIPS-developed technologies have contributed to products generating over $9.8 billion in revenue, including Hughes' and Martek's products, MedImmune's Synagis, a line of Black & Decker's masonry drill bits, and Navmar Applied Sciences' unmanned aerial vehicles. Annapolis-based Quantum Sail Design Group, the number two sail maker in the world, uses MIPS- developed technologies in nearly all of its sails. MIPS has supported 512 different research projects teaming faculty with 345 different Maryland companies since 1987. The program has funded just under half of all proposals submitted. MIPS' $26 million in funding over that time period was matched by $110 million in cash and in-kind contributions from Maryland companies\u2014leveraging the program's resources by a 5.2:1 ratio.

You Just Can't See It UM, Pharad Developing System to Detect Weapons in Open Spaces Through MIPS By Megan Hartley Sick of leaving four hours before your flight departs just to stand in a single-file security line? Pharad LLC is teaming with Clark School researchers in a MIPS project to further develop its weapons detection system, which scans people for weapons in open spaces\u2014such as airport, train, or subway terminals\u2014as they walk by. \"It is analogous to a video camera in the sense that it constantly sees and monitors a scene,\" said Pharad President Austin Farnham. \"Except its eyes are wide-band, millimeter wave signals.\" The system employs ceiling or wall-mounted sensors that send out radio-wave-like signals to analyze their surroundings. The sensors send data to a computer system, which uses algorithms to detect weapon \"fingerprints\" on the signals. When guns, knives\u2014or eventually bombs and explosives\u2014are detected, the system sends an alert and a video feed to security. Dr. K. J. Ray Liu, professor and associate chair of graduate studies and research in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Institute for Systems Research, is working with Pharad to develop the algorithm. \"This is a state-of-the-art signal processing algorithm that first detects if a weapon is present, then classifies what kind of weapon it is,\" said Liu. Each weapon has a unique signature defined by a set of electromagnetic resonances that reflect differently depending on its physical makeup. Pharad is testing various weapons to develop a signature library. \"Right now we are still in the development phases; we still have more than a year of development work before it will be on the market,\" said Farnham. While the initial system will detect concealed weapons, Pharad plans to add signatures to find disguised weapons, as well as bombs and explosives. \"We could even detect something like a gun in the shape of a cell phone,\" said Dr. Dalma Novak, vice-president of Pharad. The concealed weapons detection equipment market will be nearly $10 billion by 2010, according to the Homeland Security Research Corp. The Department of Homeland Security recently gave the company a $750,000 Phase Two Small Business Innovation Research Grant. BusinessWeek reports that there are 300,000 to 400,000 travel gateways in the U.S. and Europe alone, a number that could double by 2010. Pharad hopes to install its system in venues such as train, airport and bus stations, as well as convenience stores and malls. Founded in 2003, Pharad sells various wireless sensors, communications, and antenna products. www.pharad.com Screen capture of Pharad's weapon detection softwareMARYLAND TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE www.

Smoke smolders and a fire erupts under the brushstrokes of Monet and Manet. Before the smoke can reach the vaulted ceiling to signal the smoke detectors, countless sensitive, irreplaceable works are destroyed. This is the fate of many buildings where smoke detectors fail to sense a fire and notify the fire department before significant damage occurs. axonX LLC, a Sparks, Md.-based company, plans to put an end to ravaging fires by teaming with the University of Maryland to validate its intelligent video-camera system, which can spot a small fire in less than five seconds. axonX's SigniFire system can detect fire, smoke and intrusion in structures such as warehouses, energy plants, art galleries and homes. The camera assesses minute pixel changes within its three dimensional field of view-occasionally using reflections to get around large objects blocking the line of sight-to detect fire faster and more accurately than any currently available commercial product. \"It's the only video detection system that recognizes the big three dangers: smoke, fire and intrusion,\" said George Privalov, chief technology officer and founder. \"It eliminates most nuisance alarms because it actually sees the fireball and corona of a blaze. The camera knows it's a fire rather than a light or hot surface.\" The company came to the University of Maryland to work with Jim Milke, associate chair and professor of the department of fire protection engineering, through a Maryland Industrial Partnerships (MIPS) project. This collaboration will help axonX get classified as a life-saving device by Underwriters Laboratories, as well as by Factory Mutual, an insurance company that tests fire protection equipment. Milke will prove the camera system's versatility and precise algorithms through tests in simulated dorm rooms, as well as a possible test in Cole Field House, which seats 12,125. \"This is a leading edge technology and a significant advancement in fire detection,\" said Milke. \"They developed the device, and we will help them prove its capabilities.\" The camera's feeds can be sent to any remote location that has installed axonX's SpyderGuard software, most likely a security company such as ADT, who--when a fire occurs--will get a notification of the fire as well as a structural plan of the building. The National Fire Protection Association recently approved video surveillance systems as an effective way to detect fire, marking a significant change to its detector code. Although axonX has yet to be approved by UL and FM, various customers are already installing SigniFire's general eight-camera system, which costs around $20,000-half as much as some of their competitors. The system is scalable to fit any size and/ axonX's SigniFireTM camera for its video-based smoke, flame, and motion detection systemA.

The U.S. Navy tested SigniFire with other video image and spot- type detection systems, and found that axonX's technology was far more accurate. According to the concluding report from the Naval Research Laboratory's Advanced Damage Countermeasures Volume Sensor Project, SigniFire responded faster and to more fires than all of the other video or spot-type detection systems. \"We hope the U.S. Navy installs SigniFire on its new Destroyers, and Great Britain's Royal Navy is testing our product right now,\" said Lynch. axonX is also collaborating with: Cameco, a uranium processing plant; a Family Fun Center in Aberdeen, Md.; the Maryland Golf and Country Club; and Chicago's Children's Hospital. The company has received funding from Johnson Controls, TEDCO, and angel investors. AxonX received the Wall Street Journal 2006 Technology Innovation Award for Security (Facilities) in September. The company was selected from among 600 award applications. Winners were judged based on whether the technology truly represents a breakthrough from conventional methods, rather than just an incremental improvement. The A. James Clark School of Engineering's Department of Fire Protection Engineering is the only accredited undergraduate program, and one of only two graduate programs of its kind in the country. The department celebrated its 50th anniversary in October. www.axonx.com Associate Professor and Associate Chair of Fire Protection Engineering Jim MilkeHighlighted Current MIPS Projects Face Recognition Frederick-based ACAGI Inc. and Rama Chellappa , a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and director of the Center for Automation Research, are building a portable video camera system with real-time face recognition, as well as live marking and indexing for immediate archival.

MTECH .UMD .EDU \u0018\u0018 Joint MTES/State Program wins National Pollution Prevention Award MTES and the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) reveived a Most Valuable Pollution Prevention (MVP2) Project/Program Award from the National Pollution Prevention Roundtable in September. The award recognizes the two entities' joint Environmental Management System (EMS) Implementation Assistance Program, which has assisted 30 Maryland companies in adopting EMS programs. Criteria for the award included program innovation, measurable results, transferability, commitment, and optimization of available project resources. The National Pollution Prevention Roundtable presented the award as part of National Pollution Prevention Week. The MDE/MTES program, subsidized by grant funds from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, takes groups of 3-5 businesses at a time through EMS implementation, from start to finish, in six months or less. While such a service costs companies $15,000 or more through the private sector, the MDE/MTES program is free. \"Maryland's program was a tremendous help for us,\" said Reggie Prime, director of environmental affairs at Coca Cola Enterprises. \"We're now in a position to prepare an EMS template for our other bottling facilities, and we couldn't have done it without this program. I encourage other Maryland businesses to take advantage of this valuable service.\" An EMS program offers a systematic approach for organizations to bring environmental considerations into decision-making and day-to-day operations. It also establishes a framework for tracking, evaluating and communicating environmental performance, as well as helping to ensure that major environmental risks and liabilities are identified, minimized and managed. The MDE/MTES program works with each group of companies through four workshops, meeting with companies on-site 8-12 times, and offering technical assistance ranging from identifying environmental aspects and pollution prevention opportunities to establishing reliable means of monitoring and measurement. At the conclusion, the facility is offered a free, informal EMS audit. The MDE/MTES program spends an average of 150 hours on site with each participating company. Many companies completing the MDE/MTES program elect to apply for ISO 14001 certification, a standard that helps organizations minimize how their operations negatively affect the environment and comply with various environmental requirements. Five companies participating in the program have since won Businesses for the Bay Awards, given to companies in the Chesapeake Bay watershed achieving pollution prevention success.

P2 offers a proactive approach to environmental management, where waste is reduced or eliminated at the source\u2014rather than through control and treatment technology. For instance, companies with EMSs must have environmental policy statements that include a commitment to preventing pollution. Companies are also required to identify all environmental impacts, both regulated and non- regulated, and identify projects that address these impacts. The EMS program involves workshops, on-site meetings and technical assistance. At the conclusion of this six-month program, an audit team is available to help assess the company's EMS. There is no cost to participate in this valuable program.

Instead, each of these companies employs a vigorous business model to stimulate constant innovation. The University of Maryland aims to bring these types of models to small and mid-sized Maryland manufacturers through a new program announced this summer. The Continuous Innovation Initiative, part of the A. James Clark School of Engineering's Maryland Technology Extension Service, guides companies in establishing robust, in-house processes to generate perpetual innovation. \"A company's success in today's market hinges on its ability to innovate,\" said Dr. Herbert Rabin, associate dean of the Clark School and director of the Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute. \"Point innovation is not enough. Highly competitive businesses integrate processes for creating ideas\u2014to deliver new products, enter new markets, add value for customers, forge new partnerships, or increase productivity.\" Meeting a Need With nearly 40,000 Maryland manufacturing jobs lost since 2000, according to the National Association of Manufacturers\u2014to international competition, high costs, productivity improvements, and the recent recession\u2014many of the 4,300 manufacturing companies in the state should turn to innovation for a competitive edge, according to Al Etheridge, manager of the Continuous Innovation Initiative. \"If you are competing on cost, there's a good chance you'll lose the battle to overseas manufacturing,\" said Etheridge. \"American companies must innovate to stay ahead.\" Nearly 70 percent of companies cite globalization as a major reason for their approach to innovation, according to a Boston Consulting Group poll released in a recent issue of BusinessWeek. The same percentage of companies named innovation as one of their top three priorities for this year. \"Our nation cannot afford to lose its manufacturing Knowledge-based engineering, technical and management solutions for manufacturers MTECH Partnerships MTES Maryland Technology Extension ServiceA. J AMES CLAR k SCHOOL Of ENGINEERING U NIvERSITY Of MARYLAND \u0018\u0018 innovation edge and the wealth that it generates throughout our economy,\" said Jerry Jasinowski, president of The Manufacturing Institute, the research and education arm of the National Association of Manufacturers. \"We need programs like this to develop human capital, revitalize fundamental research and encourage productivity-enhancing investments in order to maintain a critical mass of production and a viable innovation process in this country,\" he concluded. How the Program works CII works with several companies at a time, for 3-6 months, leading them through a four-step model of assessing current innovation practices, aligning resources, executing, and instilling a permanent culture of innovation into their business environments. \"Being in a university, we're uniquely positioned to spread knowledge about establishing innovation processes,\" said Etheridge. \"We're not guarding the secret sauce. We'll work diligently to share it with every company we can.\" Over the past five years, companies citing commitment to innovation have increased revenues by an average of almost 350 percent, according to a recent survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers. That same bottom line, Etheridge said, is the focus of CII: results. www.mtes.org/innovation \"If you are competing on cost, there's a good chance you'll lose the battle to overseas manufacturing.

The Chestertown-based company provides fulfillment services to national clients such as consumer goods manufacturers, cosmetic manufacturers, and other businesses or associations that sell products using USA Fulfillment as a \"silent partner.\" Those services include fulfilling catalog and web-based orders, as well as premiums and rebates. USA Fulfillment's customers include, among others, Este\u00e8 Lauder, Affinion Group, American Wellness, Convergence, and National Safe Kids. With 80 full-time and ten part-time employees, family-owned USA Fulfillment shipped between 4-5 million products for its customers in 2006. The company completed MTES' 18-month ISO 9001 Consortium program, a series of monthly trainings, events, and on-site consultations designed to help companies prepare for ISO certification. Stan Sanders, USA Fulfillment's Quality Coordinator, led the effort for the company. Sanders also manages both security and disaster recovery functions for the company. ISO 9000 is a family of standards created by the 91-nation International Organization of Standardization (ISO), which establishes requirements for quality management systems. Companies conforming to these standards qualify for ISO 9000 certification. Being ISO 9000 certified means a company follows a well- defined, process-based management system to ensure the delivery of quality products and services to its customers. MTES' ISO Consortium program provided USA Fulfillment with documentation templates for the company's quality manual. Ritz also assisted USA Fulfillment with on-site support for documentation reviews, internal auditing training, and ISO requirements interpretation. However, Sanders and the entire USA Fulfillment organization did the real work, according to Ritz. \"Helping USA Fulfillment reach their goal of ISO certification was a rewarding experience for me personally. I can't say enough about the leadership of Sanders and his enthusiasm and commitment to the ISO effort.\" \"He helped us understand what the big scope was for working on our quality management system and getting that into a quality manual,\" said Sanders. \"He helped us refine things that are more obscure. With his background, he helped us understand what was behind the standard and what we were trying to achieve through it.\" USA Fulfillment leveraged its quality management system to advance in many areas. \"There are internal and external components,\" said Sanders. The obvious external component is that because ISO 9000 is recognized worldwide, it's a selling point with clients. Since we're an outsourcing agent, they can maintain their own quality standards because they're hiring a partner that is qualified and focused on quality. They don't have to audit us because it's already built into our own certification. It's a big benefit to those companies. \"Internally, it gives us discipline in following up so that when we make a mistake, we can correct not only the mistake, but also address its root causes. One of the watchwords we have is that we want mistakes never to happen again. But we didn't have a USA Fulfillment's warehouse Knowledge-based engineering, technical and management solutions for manufacturers MTECH Partnerships MTES Maryland Technology Extension ServiceA. J AMES CLAR k SCHOOL Of ENGINEERING U NIvERSITY Of MARYLAND \u0018\u0018 formal framework to do that until we adopted the ISO 9000 standards\u2014things such as regularly scheduled management reviews and internal auditing. Now, when we do research on issues that come up, we have preventive or corrective action plans in place. There's a process to follow, plus a review process as part of our own internal auditing.\" On December 8, 2005, QMI, North America's leading management systems registrar, recommended USA Fulfillment to be registered for the ISO 9001:2000 standard for quality. \"Every department in the company made this prestigious accomplishment possible,\" said Sanders. \"Company president and CEO Shirley Moore has long had a dream that we would move into our new home [a facility the company moved to in August, 2006] with an ISO 9000 banner flying proudly over the building.\" USA Fulfillment's Quality Management System was officially certified to ISO 9001:2000 in January, 2006. \"ISO 9000 is the world's most popular and widely used standard for quality,\" said Sanders. \"The certification covers all of our business functions and reflects our deep commitment to quality.\" One of the many positive aspects of USA Fulfillment's Quality Management System listed in QMI's Certification Audit Report was \"Efforts at continual improvement of services and facilities is noteworthy.\" \"Our challenge now is to build on our quality foundation by making many more improvements in the future,\" said Sanders. USA Fulfillment's quality system policy is to: Deliver fulfillment services that exceed the expectations of its clients Provide the right products to the right customers at the right time Produce a positive and profitable fulfillment experience for all parties by working together Manage business functions as processes and continually improve our Quality Management System In a 2005 report, USA Fulfillment cited a $100,000 increase in sales and $150,000 in retained sales, in part thanks to acquiring ISO certification. The company also cited a $230,000 increase in investment. The bottom line of ISO 9000 certification is meeting your customers' needs and managing your own business more effectively, according to Ritz. \"Many companies have no formal management system at all,\" said Ritz. \"ISO requires you to have a system to monitor and measure your organization's effectiveness and performance and find ways to improve. You even have to show improvement to maintain your ISO certification\u2014so you're continually improving to serve your customers and grow your business.\" www.usafill.com USA Fulfillment President and CEO Shirley Moore USA Fulfillment warehouse, upper-left corner, and new facility in Chestertown Knowledge-based engineering, technical and management solutions for manufacturers MTECH Partnerships MTES Maryland Technology Extension ServiceMARYLAND TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE www.

Previously, government, university laboratory, and pharmaceutical customers were limited to a single array processing tube that required many tedious steps. SuperArray contacted the Maryland Technology Extension Service (MTES)\u2014which previously helped the company expand its manufacturing facility and double in size\u2014for assistance. MTES' Gene Taylor worked with SuperArray Vice President Dr. Sean Yu, Senior Scientist Ray Blanchard, and Dan Alper of Strauss Co., to create the GEArray Express Hybplate\u2014a compartment-sealed chamber enabling eight, simple, speedy, simultaneous array tests. \"We took it as a challenge,\" said Taylor. \"When you first look at it you think 'well that's simple,' but when you get into it and see all the variables it's anything but simple.\" Taylor and Alper worked with company scientists on the design of the Hybplate and plate seal, attempting to create a product solution that was technologically sound, easy to use and relatively cheap. Yu and Blanchard helped with the biological aspects of the prototypes, providing knowledge as to how reagents and solutions would react with different materials. After a period of 2-3 months and the evaluation of various prototypes, the team settled on an eight- compartment, foil-sealed chamber. One of the most important parts of the new device is the user-friendly seal. It has three layers\u2014backing, adhesive and foil\u2014that consolidate into one material. It is effortlessly peeled from the backing paper and placed on a rectangular box with eight different sections. The adhesive molds around the outer edge of each section preventing reactions from contaminating one another. Different reagents and solutions can be added through pipette penetration of the foil, a process considerably easier than the opening/closing a screw cap required by the older tubes. The seals developed by Taylor weren't just effective, but they were also cost-efficient\u2014requiring less than one dollar per unit\u2014not including the cost of tooling. \"We came up with some great ideas but if you're going to pay five dollars a piece for it, it just doesn't make sense,\" said Taylor. Customers can purchase a chamber specific to their area of study for $60 to $300 per array. The HybPlate's are equipped for gene testing in humans, SuperArray's facility in Frederick Knowledge-based engineering, technical and management solutions for manufacturers MTECH Partnerships MTES Maryland Technology Extension ServiceA.

The Rockville-based company is collaborating with Fort Detrick in the laboratories of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, in hopes of commercializing a product within four years. BioFactura will use the BSF to find the best way to manufacture the drug at a large scale. \"The BSF has state-of-the-art equipment,\" said BioFactura's president and CEO Darryl Sampey. \"The value for price is unsurpassed, which is critically important for a small company with limited funds.\" Smallpox, characterized by a rash of lesions, killed an estimated 300 million people in the twentieth century alone before it was declared globally eradicated in 1980. The government has labeled the disease a \"Category A\" agent\u2014presenting the \"greatest potential threat for harming public health,\" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus, transmitted by contact or through the air, can survive in dust, bedding and clothing, even traveling through air ducts. \"Although anthrax proved to be a deadly bioterror agent, a smallpox attack could be devastating,\" said Sampey. Since routine vaccinations for children were discontinued in 1972 and studies have shown the vaccine is less effective after five years, the American population is highly vulnerable to the virus. The threat of this agent in the hands of terrorists has caused the government to pour funds into developing new, safer vaccines. An effective therapy would be of greater benefit. BioFactura was awarded $730,000 in Phase II funding in July from the U.S. Department of Defense through its SBIR program, to support pre-clinical efficacy studies of BioFactura's smallpox therapeutic. The challenge studies will demonstrate prophylactic and therapeutic effectiveness of this biodefense countermeasure and will lead to Phase I clinical safety trials. The pre-clinical studies will be performed at the biocontainment laboratories at Ft. Detrick, Md., in collaboration with a team of scientists from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID). \"This significant follow-on award highlights the U.S. Government support of BioFactura's smallpox biodefense program. The funding will allow BioFactura to make a major step towards its goal to provide a smallpox therapeutic for both military and civilian defense,\" said Sampey. www.biofactura.com Bioprocess scale-up and research, downstream processing, courses and workforce training MTECH Partnerships BREP Bioprocessing Research and Education Program \"The BS f has state-of-the- art equipment,\" said Bio factura's president and CEO Darryl Sampey. \"The value for price is unsurpassed, which is critically important for a small company with limited funds. \" \u2014Darryl Sampey, President and CEO, BioFacturaA.

Company's Technology May Hold Key to Economically Efficient Ethanol Production Zymetis Inc., a company whose technology may make inexpensive ethanol production a reality, is scaling up its product through the Bioprocess Scale-Up Facility. Founded by Steve Hutcheson, a professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, Zymetis is developing enzymes and enzyme products that break down plant material into its constituent sugars\u2014which, in turn, can easily be converted into fuel-grade ethanol. \"The BSF is helping us establish initial growth parameters for our bacterium, as well as optimize the production of our enzymes,\" said Hutcheson. The BSF specializes in preparing bench-top or lab- produced biologicals for mass production. A biological product's commercial potential can hinge\u2014both technically and economically\u2014on the abillity to accurately and efficiently manufacture it at at large scale. \"Our goal is to prepare Zymetis for a smooth transition to a large-scale production facility,\" said Ben Woodard, director of the BSF. \"This, like many of our projects, requires alterations or modifications that prove principle and concept while increasing product yields and efficiencies. Expenses for entering production can exceed $100,000 per day, so it is critical for us to optimize Zymetis's processes while the company is still here.\" If Zymetis is successful, it could revolutionize the fuel industry with a compelling alternative to corn ethanol. The company's initial product, Ethazyme, is a proprietary mixture of enzymes that breaks cellulose and other cell polymers found in plants into glucose and other fermentable sugars. Zymetis is targetting the \"biomass\" market as a potential source for ethanol. Biomass broadly encompasses the vast supply of plant material found in grasses, forestry products, and agricultural waste products such as corn stover. Sugar fermented from biomass sources is known as BioEthanol. BioEthanol is highly desirable not only because of its energy content, but also because it is considered the only carbon-neutral form of transporation fuel on the horizon. Zymetis projects that top sources of biomass could yield enough BioEthanol to meet 100 percent of current U.S. fuel needs. The company's unique intellectual property was developed at the University of Maryland through the efforts of Hutcheson and Ron Weiner, professor emeritus in the College of Life Sciences, and is licensed exclusively to Zymetis. Zymetis recently joined MTECH's VentureAccelerator Program, which is working with Hutcheson to define business processes that will guide the company towards successful commercialization. www.zymetis.comBioprocess Scale-Up Facility Director Ben Woodard, left, and Dr. Steve Hutcheson, founder of Zymetis and professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics.

J AMES CLAR k SCHOOL Of ENGINEERING U NIvERSITY Of MARYLAND \u0018\u0018Life-Saving Technology Company Joins MTECH's Technology ventures Building By Megan Hartley A company with the technology to save 1/4 million lives a year is the first to join the Maryland Technology Ventures Building (TVB), part of M Square, the university's research park for science and technology companies. MXF Technologies, which moved into the building in January, has developed a multi-energy X-ray that improves contrast significantly. The core technology is an inexpensive filter that can be applied to current X- ray machines and penetrates the different tissues in a woman's breast simultaneously with lower radiation. \"This is a next-generation medical technology,\" said Dr. Yong Cho, chief executive officer of MXF Technologies. \"Today's technology can be compared to a flashlight, now we are using a lighthouse.\" The name of the company stems from the single- wavelength Monochromatic x-rays produced by the filter, like an x-ray laser. This strong yet less harmful x-ray is ideal for the dense tissue of younger women, and the energy level can be selected to match breast density. \"The filter is similar to a crystal that's exposed to white light, it separates out the different colors, just like the energy levels in the X-ray. These KeV levels have different tissue specificities,\" said Michael Champ, executive vice president. Current mammograms work only 40-50 percent of the time because they are unable to penetrate the dense breast tissue of women with lean breasts, including most women under 50. In 2003 the American Cancer Society lowered its age recommendation to 40 for women to begin annual mammograms. \"Breast cancer in young women is more aggressive, because the cells divide faster,\" said Rose Bechtel, Chair of the Breast Cancer Action Nova Scotia. \"The older you are the better your chances of surviving.\" However, breast cancer is not the only application for the monochromatic x-ray. Eventually, it could replace all polychromatic x-rays, becoming the new industry standard. The University of Virginia Medical School and the Mayo Clinic are already using MXF's technology for medical research. MXF is currently designing and producing high X-ray energy level MXF Filters to produce spectral signatures of materials for the detection and identification of liquid and solid explosives at entry check points in hand carryon, bags, backpacks, luggage, etc. The TVB managed by the Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute, is the first commercial space to emerge in M Square. The 49,480-square foot office building, with two class-1,000 clean rooms, offers a key location for MXF Technologies. MXF is in discussion with Seoul National University Medical School to conduct pre-clinical trials for using multi-spectral X-ray imaging in medical applications. MXF also has OEM Demonstration Projects with: Imaging Science International in Pennsylvania (Orthodontal/Head CT); Bone Density in Massachusetts (Hologic, Inc.); NDT (QA/QC) for Electric Circuits in Korea (LG Electronics); and Multi- spectral Detectors (Hamamatsu) in New Jersey. www.mxftech.com MTECH Accelerating technology entrepreneurship and leveraging university resources for companieswww.mtech.umd.edu Pictured, top, a normal X-ray.
