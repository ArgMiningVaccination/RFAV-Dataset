If you are eligible for COVID -19 treatment you will usually be offered neutralising monoclonal antibodies (nMA Bs) such as so trovimab as a first treatment rather than antiviral medicines. A clinical study showed that sotrovimab decreased the risk of hospitalisation or death by 85% in patients with mild- to moderate disease and at least one risk factor for disease progression.
