Only with the help of a qualified healthcare professional with direct experience in inguinal hernia remediation should the following information be utilized. With that said, consider the fact that inguinal hernias often come with a very significant emotional component that is almost always overlooked by doctors and patients alike. Understanding this is important to understanding how hernias can, in fact, be treated without invasive surgery, in some cases. Also important is understanding every possible cause, cofactor, and trigger associated with the development of a hernia. Emotions, experiences, diet, lifestyle habits, type of work, and even spiritual beliefs all affect hernial development.

There is a lot that goes into the development of a hernia, though conventionally the condition is almost always blamed on lifting too much weight. This can be one factor in the equation, but it is certainly not a catch-all for hernial development. According to The Hernia Coach, low-grade constipation is one common root cause of inguinal hernia that is often overlooked. Many years of forcing bowel movements can set up the abdominal floor for a future disaster that perhaps manifests while lifting heavy things. Mechanical causes such as chronic constipation, too much heavy lifting, and not getting enough exercise are all factors in hernial development, as is chemical exposure, improper diet, emotional and spiritual problems, and electromagnetic pollution. The Hernia Coach offers a variety of solutions to these problems that will vary from person to person. All of them are \"subtle and refined, measured and gentle,\" as well as customized for each individual. \"Each hernia sufferer will inevitably create their own program which is attentive to the limitations and deficiencies, defects and imbalances of their own body,\" The Hernia Coach explains. \"In this manner each individual ought to be sensitive to the subtle causes and effects that will be experienced throughout this very personalized remediation process. Then, a refinement of the process will begin to take place so that the optimal set of 'things to do and things not to do' evolves naturally for each person.\" Among the healing approaches taken are: As for hernia \"mesh\" implants, The Hernia Coach addresses how many of the materials used can trigger allergies, intolerances, or sensitivities - as well as how to find truly biocompatible alternatives to these materials.
