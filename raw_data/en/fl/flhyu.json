Ingredients (3,429 milligrams per serving) Berberine (1,500 milligrams per serving) Berberine is a compound found in several plants, including a group of shrubs called Berberis. It has long been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat various ailments, including diarrhea, cholera, and other digestive disorders, as well as feelings of fatigue and infirmity. Research shows that supplementation with berberine . . . - Reduces intestinal inflammation, which eases discomfort and may enhance nutrient absorption [[9]](#ref-9) - Prevents infections and protect against medical conditions that cause diarrhea, such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) [[10]](#ref-10) [[11]](#ref-11) [[12]](#ref-12) - Improves blood glucose control, which can enhance energy levels, appetite control, and cognition, as well as reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart attack [[13]](#ref-13) [[14]](#ref-14) [[15]](#ref-15) - May enhance the function of healthful gut bacteria [[16]](#ref-16) [[17]](#ref-17) The clinically effective dose of berberine is between 900 and 1,500 milligrams. Artichoke Leaf Extract (1,800 milligrams per serving) Artichoke leaf extract is a substance derived from the ground-up leaves of the edible flower heads of the artichoke plant. It contains molecules known as caffeoylquinic acid and cynaropicrin, and research shows the former is an effective antioxidant, and the latter increases bile acid secretion from liver cells and relaxes the small intestine. [[18]](#ref-18) [[19]](#ref-19) [[20]](#ref-20) [[21]](#ref-21) This is why studies show that supplementation with artichoke leaf extract aids in the digestion of fatty acids and can alleviate dysfunctional dyspepsia in the small intestine. [[22]](#ref-22) Additionally, research shows that artichoke leaf extract can improve blood glucose control in people genetically predisposed to high blood glucose levels (people of Polynesian and Native American descent, for instance). [[23]](#ref-23) [[24]](#ref-24) [[25]](#ref-25) The clinically effective dose of artichoke leaf extract is 1,800 milligrams. Bromelain (150 GDU per serving) Bromelain is an enzyme found in pineapple that helps with the digestion of protein. [[26]](#ref-26) By improving your body's ability to digest protein, you can enhance the absorption of amino acids and reduce digestive distress and flatulence resulting from malabsorption. The clinically effective dose of bromelain is unknown, but the standard protocol is approximately 50 GDU (Gelatin Digesting Unit, which is a measure of enzyme potency) per meal. Balance contains 150 GDU of bromelain per serving, which is higher than the per-meal dose because we intend for people to take one serving of Balance per day spread evenly between at least three meals. Pepsin (500,000 FCC per serving) Pepsin is an enzyme found in the stomach that helps with the digestion of protein. [[27]](#ref-27) By improving your body's ability to digest protein, you can enhance the absorption of amino acids and reduce digestive distress and flatulence resulting from malabsorption. The clinically effective dose of pepsin is unknown, but the standard protocol is approximately 150,000 FCC (Food Chemical Codex, which is a measure of enzyme potency) per meal. Balance contains 500,000 FCC of pepsin per serving, which is higher than the per-meal dose because we intend for people to take one serving of Balance per day spread evenly between at least three meals. Papain (100,000 PU per serving) Papain is an enzyme found in papaya that also helps with the digestion of protein. [[28]](#ref-28) By improving your body's ability to digest protein, you can enhance the absorption of amino acids and reduce digestive distress and flatulence resulting from malabsorption. The clinically effective dose of papain is unknown, but the standard protocol is approximately 30,000 PU (Papain Unit, which is a measure of enzyme potency) per meal. Balance contains 100,000 PU of papain per serving, which is higher than the per-meal dose because we intend for people to take one serving of Balance per day spread evenly between at least three meals. No Artificial Food Dyes or Other Chemical Junk As with artificial sweeteners, studies show that artificial food dyes may cause negative effects in some people, including gastrointestinal toxicity and behavioral disorders. [[29]](#ref-29) [[30]](#ref-30) [[31]](#ref-31) [[32]](#ref-32) [[33]](#ref-33) That's why we use natural coloring derived from fruits and other foods, as well as natural flavoring.
