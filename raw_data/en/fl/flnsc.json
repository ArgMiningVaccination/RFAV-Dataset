Searching for MS Therapies Timeline of MS Research Progress Stimulating MS Research: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow Top Ten Events in the History of MS Improving Diagnosis MS History Facts Historic Survey of MS Research Progress In 1945, a small classi fied ad appeared in The New York Times : The ad was placed by Sylvia Lawry, whose brother Bernard had been diagnosed with MS , and whose family was frus- trated by the lack of treatment options. At that time, relativel y little was known about multiple sclerosis. MS was still being misdiagnosed as \"hysteria\" or \"chronic alcoholism\"; some docto rs mistakenly believed MS was contagious; there was no private or government agency charged with conducting research into multiple sclerosis. In answer to the ad, no one came forth with a treatment. But many came forth with the need and desire to do some- thing about this urgent proble m. In 1946 the National Multi- ple Sclerosis Society was estab lished, and in 1947 the Soci- ety sponsored its first th ree research projects. Today, the Society has invested a total of some $420 mil- lion in biomedical research to solve the puzzle of MS, and is the largest private sponsor of MS research in the world. Although Sylvia Lawry died in 2001, her spirit and mission live on in the millions of res earchers, health professionals, volunteers, donors and event pa rticipants we count on each year to contribute to our caus e: To end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis.

Will any- one recovered from it please communicate with patient. NMSS Research Highlights, Special Issue 2002 2 Even before Fr ench neurologist Jean- Martin Charcot first de scribed multiple scle- rosis as a distinct dise ase in 1868, physicians were attempting therap y based on contempo- rary beliefs about its cause. Recognizing the neurologic characteristics of the disease, Charcot tried the arsenal of remedies then used to \"treat\" such disorders: gold chloride, zinc favorable results.\" When MS was attributed to overexertion (1880s), attempted treatments included bedrest and electrical stimulation. When a poison, toxin or metabolic abnormality were blamed (early 1900s an d later), treatments in- cluded purgatives, cathartics, stimulants, various enzymes and even tonsillectomy. Infectious agen ts have been suspected over the years (1920s, t oday), giving rise to treatments including antisyphylis drugs, fe- ver therapy (by regular injections of typhoid vaccine), vaccines, antibiotics and blood transfusions. The preponderance of MS brain lesions near blood vessels led to speculations that MS was caused by poor circulation of blood in the brain and blood clots (1930s- 40s), thus anticoagulant s were prescribed. Allergy was though t to play a role in MS for two decades (1950s -70s); treatment cen- tered on antihistamines, vitamins and ster- oids. From the late 1970 s to the present, MS has been thought to be an autoimmune reac- tion (in which the immune system turns on the body's own tissues), possibly triggered by an infectious agent(s). Treatment now fo- cuses on curbing dest ructive immune re- sponses with steroids and immune-system regulators. Importance of Controlled Trials Multiple sclerosis is unusual in that its symptoms often abate spontaneously. So the task of determining whether a given treat- ment is responsible fo r a remission or im- provement has been difficult. That's why well controlled trials , usually involving hun- dreds of patients, in which neither the physi- cian nor the patient knows who is receiving which treatment (\"double blinded\"), are vital to identifying genuine therapies for multiple sclerosis. Looking Ahead As more and more is uncovered about the disease mechanisms at work in MS, treat- ments become more specialized, and we have a greater chance of treating the underlying cause of the disease. There are now more than 100 clinical trials of potential treatments in various stages of testing around the world. Therapies now being tested include: custom-designed molecules that can turn off only the specific destructive immune forces active in an individual's body by actu- ally blocking or providing decoy mecha- nisms for damaging immune events; Searching for MS Therapies MS History Fact 1965 - White blood cells that react against a protein in myelin, the insulating coat- ing on nerve fibers, were discovered in MS NMSS Research Highlights, Special Issue 2002 3 agents that can stop destructive immune cells from crossing the bl ood-brain barrier, in attempts to prevent inflammation and nerve tissue destruction before they start; drugs that can manipulate \"messenger\" sig- nals to actually turn aggressive immune cells into peacekeeping immune cells, halting the immune response in its tracks; agents that may stimulate the repair of brain and spinal cord tissue that has been damaged in MS, or procedures that infuse replacement cells, which could be given once the destructive process has been halted; and drugs to fight specific in fectious agents that may directly or indirectly trigger MS.

Timeline of MS Research Progress This timeline highlights a selection of major landmarks in research into multiple sclerosis, over a backdrop th at charts the National MS Society's total cumulative research investment of $420 million. These are only a few of thousands of advances in basic and clinical research which have laid the foundation for the rapid pr ogress we're seeing today. 1946 1946 National Multiple Sclerosis Society formed by Sylvia Lawry. 1947 Society sponsors first 3 resear ch projects. 1948 Elvin Kabat, first Soci- ety grantee, discovers \"oligoclonal bands\" in MS spinal fluid, leading to an important diagnostic test. 1950 Society convinces US Congress to create a new na- tional institute devoted to re- searching neurological dis- eases. 1950 Society funds first major survey of MS in the US and Canada. 1955 Dr. John Kurtzke de- velops first sc ale to catego- rize the severity of MS; a later version (EDSS) is still in use today. 1965 Society-convened panel of experts develops precise criteria for diagnos- ing MS. 1967 Multiple Sclerosis International Federation is formed. 1969 Society co-sponsors re- search of ACTH, which be- comes the first drug shown to speed recove ry from MS attacks. 1974 Society convinces US Congress to appoint commis- sion on MS; resulti ng report in- creases for MS research. 1960 NMSS launches epidemi- ology studies of MS in Austra- lia, Norway, Israel and Iceland; later grantees would explore \"Clusters\" of MS in the Faeroe and Orkney islands. 1960 $3.2 million 2000 Society launches The MS Lesion Project to correlate patterns of tissue loss with clini cal disease and MRI. 2000 Novantrone approved in US for worsening forms of MS. 1981 First MRI pictures of a brain affected by MS are produced, revolutionizing MS diagnosis. 1981 Society sponsors interna- tional conference establishing double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trials as gold standard for MS. 1987-88 Society launches re- search programs in health care delivery and health pol-icy, as well as patient manage- ment, rehabilitation, and psy- chosocial aspects of MS. 1992 Society supports first comprehensive search for the genes that make people susceptible to MS. 1993 Betaseron ap- proved by FDA as first drug to alter the under- lying course of relaps- ing-remitting MS. 1998 Society initiates targeted research into gender differences in MS and establishes the Sonya Slifka Longitu- dinal MS Study, a re- search-oriented nation- wide patient database. 2003 Over 150 MS clinical trials going on worldwide, including tests in primary- and secondary-progressive MS, trials of oral medica- tions, and combination therapies. $48.6 million 1980 2004 1996 Avonex and Copaxone approved by the FDA for relapsing- remitting MS.

What is now the Na- tional Institute of Neur ological Disorders and Stroke was born, becomi ng partners with the Society in supporting basic and clinical re- search into MS. Worldwide Network In 1967, Societ y founder Sylvia Lawry established what is now known as the the Multiple Sclerosis Intern ational Federation, a worldwide association of nearly 40 organiza- tions devoted to carrying on important MS research and services. In 2000, the Society committed substantial su pport to MSIF's Sylvia Lawry Centre in Munich. One goal of the Centre is to collect and analyze data from major natural history studies and clinical tri- als of treatments for MS to create \"virtual\" placebo groups - statisti cal portraits that re- searchers could use to more quickly evaluate new MS therapies. Attracting Top Minds To attract promising young investigators to the field of MS, in 1955 the Society devel- oped a postdoctoral research training pro- gram. This program has trained many of the country's leading MS investigators, and en- sures that top-notch minds will always be fo- cused on the problems of MS until a cure is found. Seed Money The National MS Society often plants re- search \"seeds\" from which great things grow. Long before pharmaceutical companies be- came interested, the Society was supporting clinical trials of drugs to treat MS. One of the earliest grants the Society gave, in 1950, was to conduct preliminary tests of the steroid ACTH in MS. This dr ug was proved (with Society funding) to be the first to speed re- covery from MS exacerbations. The Society was the first to fund a large- scale clinical trial of any type of interferon - alpha interferon - in th e early 1980s, spurring industry interest in this immune-system regu- lator. Ultimately, in 1993 Betaseron was ap- proved as the first drug to alter the underly- ing course of MS. Today there are five drugs approved in the U.S. for treating different forms of the disease. MS History Fact 1919 - Abnormalities in the spinal fluid were dis-covered in MS, but their significance remained puzzling for decades Stimulating MS Research: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow NMSS Research Highlights, Special Issue 2002 7 1. Disease described by Jean -Martin Charcot (1868). 2. Discovery of myelin's ro le in nerve conduction by Louis Ranvier (1878). Late r researchers discovered the cell that makes myelin (oligodendrocyte). 3. Detailed microscopic description of diseased brain tissue by James Dawson (1 916) revealed the basic processes at work in MS. 4. Development of an anim al disease resembling MS by Thomas Rivers (1935) , ultimately suggesting an autoimmune basis for the dise ase, with myelin in the central nervous system as the target. 5. National Multiple Scle rosis Society founded (1946). 6. Discovery of oligoclonal bands in the spinal fluid by Elvin Kabat and others (1948), providing a diag- nostic test suggestive of MS and further linking it to the immune system. 7. Definite criteria for the diagnosis of MS devel- oped by an expert committee gathered by the NMSS (1965). 8. ACTH proved to trea t MS exacerbations (1969- 70). This was the first careful, controlled trial of a successful treatment for MS, using standardized di- agnostic criteria and rating scales for evaluating MS patients. 9. MRI invented, with the fi rst images of an MS pa- tient (1981). MRI revolu tionized the diagnosis of MS and established the c oncept of MS as a con- stantly active disease rather than a relapsing one. 10. Interferon beta 1-b (B etaseronr) approved as the first drug to alter the c ourse of MS (1993). - by Loren A. Rolak, MD, neurologist and medical historian, Marshfield MS Center, The Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield, Wisconsin Cross-Fertilization MS involves diverse fields: basic and clinical immunology, neurophysiology, virology, ge- netics, rehabilitation, and many others. To facilitate cross- fertilization of ideas among re- searchers from different realms, the Society supports scientific workshops on topics relevant to MS. Over the years, many of these workshops have been springboards for crucial leaps forward in our a pproach to MS. In 2002, the Society launched a Collaborative MS Research Center program to further stimu- late interaction of researchers from diverse fields and to attract new scientists to MS research. Harvesting New Ideas Since 1987, the Society has used special pilot research grants to cultivate novel or high-risk re- search ideas and attract new in- vestigators to the field of MS. These low-cost, short-term awards allow quick determina- tions as to whether a new idea merits full-scale exploration. With a cumulative investment of some $350 million to fund and stimulate MS research, the Society has laid a foundation of basic and clinical knowledge upon which all advancements are built, and planted the seeds for tomorrow's breakthroughs. Top 10 Events: History of MS The National MS Society... One thin g people with MS can count on. Improving Diagnosis Over the years, hundreds of researchers have tried to identify a test that could deter- mine quickly whether or not a person has MS: In the 1920s, post -mortem tissue studies were the only reliable way of saying that a person had definite MS. In the 1930s came th e \"hot bath test,\" wherein someone suspected of having MS was placed into a hot bath and observed for symptom changes. In the late 1940s, Dr. Elvin Kabat and oth- ers called \"oligocl onal bands,\" in MS spinal fluid. Although not exclusive to MS, this finding became the basis of an important new diagnostic test. In 1981, diagnosis was changed forever with the introduction of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Althoug h it cannot be used alone to diagnose MS, MRI in combination with other tests has been invaluable in speed- ing the diagnosis of MS. In 2001, a National MS Society task force developed the first new diagnostic criteria for MS in 20 years, inco rporating MRI and other benchmarks to help speed diagnosis. People get answers much faster than they did even a decade ago, enabling th em to have access to disease-modifyin g drugs faster.
