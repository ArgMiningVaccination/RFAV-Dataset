It is not uncommon for individuals who are addicted to methamphetamine to relapse chronically because the cravings are so strong. Scientists are currently working on three formulations that they hope to be able to use in vaccine meant to treat methamphetamine addiction. Left untreated methamphetamine also referred to as crystal meth or simply crystal will lead to numerous health issues including cardiovascular damage and death. Thus far the vaccine has shown positive results when tested on mice. Hopefully the new vaccine will eventually help people to achieve long-term sobriety from the dangerous and potentially lethal drug. In the past, vaccines that were made to help individual's combat addiction to crystal meth were either ineffective or extremely expensive. The hope with this new vaccine is for it to be more helpful and more cost effective then past vaccines. Crystal meth used to be popular mainly in the mid-west part of the country but is now easily obtainable in most states across the nation. Not only is it a dangerous drug, but it can be manufactured relatively easily with products that can be purchased in most grocery stores and pharmacies. The places where people manufacture meth are referred to as meth labs. Now it is even common for people to us RV's as mobile meth labs to make it more difficult to be caught by law enforcement. Hopefully over time this new vaccine will be instrumental in helping people through their recovery from methamphetamine addiction. In the meantime it is important to know that many who have had past struggles with meth were able to get sober and stay sober with the help and guidance of an addiction treatment center along with the continuing support of twelve step programs.
