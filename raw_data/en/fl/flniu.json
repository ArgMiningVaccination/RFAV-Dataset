So don't be fooled by the infomercials, all the debri and gross colored water, which could also be from the corrosion of the device itself after some use. The actual reason for the waters change in color is the reaction of already present compounds in the tap water you put in the bath with the salt that you add. Now you're probably wondering what the point is then, and if it is actually effective. Even though you cannot necessarily diagnose a patient by the color of the water, that does not mean the ion bath is not benefiting you in anyway. When looking for the benefits of the ion bath you need to directly observe the body and not the water. The main benefit of these baths is to \"alkaline\" the body, meaning to push the pH levels to a base line. Scientific analysis have been done on the urine of patients before and after a 30 minute treatment. They concluded that the negative ions produced in the bath do significantly lower the pH levels in the body, and the results can be seen for up to 48 hours. An alkaline body is crucial to a person's health. Diseases thrive in an acidic environment. So basically, the less acidic your body is and the more alkaline, the less prone you are to contracting a disease.
