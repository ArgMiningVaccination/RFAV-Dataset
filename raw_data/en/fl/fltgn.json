I would address the reason why I am saying this later. But, top priority should be accorded to high-risk population groups like policemen, doctors, and marginalized workers among others. They should get the vaccine first to arrest the pandemic in India,\" he said at a virtual interaction at the Bengaluru Tech Summit 2020. Sadhguru added that the vaccine should also be given to vulnerable people who are at a greater risk of developing severe disease because of low immunity and comorbidity. When the vaccine is launched, it could lead to corruption. Hence, the government should fix suitable pricing for the vaccine for those who can afford, and use those funds to provide it free of cost to low-income groups, he said. He referred to his remarks that he would be the last person to get vaccinated in a conversation with Chief Scientist at [the World Health Organization](/topic/the-world-health-organization)Dr. Soumya Swaminathan in October 2019, where he had cautioned about the side-effects or negative impacts of vaccinations. \"The significance of vaccination against many debilitating diseases should not be played down. But at the same time, it is important it is not overdone, without taking into consideration the many side-effects or negative impacts of vaccinations,\" he said. Sadhguru had also said that the World Health Organization should tell parents about what vaccines are a must and what is a choice. \"I feel the World Health Organization should tell parents that \"this much is not needed - these vaccines are compulsory, and the rest are by choice. If it is made like that, I think there will be a more healthy proportion,\" he said. However, vaccines have brought power and well-being to people's lives, he had said. \"Most of us are sitting here because we were vaccinated. Otherwise, we would definitely not be here,\" he added.
