Vol 2, Issue 1, October 1996Most deaths related to influenza occur in people over 65, and those withunderlying chronic medical conditionsare at particularly high risk. Modern influenza vaccines are effectiveand free from serious side effects. Research evidence shows that annualinfluenza vaccination of all older peopleis a cost effective way of reducinginfluenza-related deaths and illness. All people over 65 should be consideredfor influenza vaccination. If supplies are insufficient to offervaccine to all people over 65, priorityshould be given to people in high riskgroups, hospitals, nursing homes andlong stay facilities. People should be offered vaccinationannually in October/early November toensure maximum protection. Local policies are needed to promote highrates of influenza vaccination for olderpeople and others at high risk.INFLUENZA VACCINATION AND OLDER PEOPLEFLU - THE FACTS Influenza is a common respiratory illness that may affect up to 20% of the population annually,1 although only a proportion consult a doctor forclinical symptoms. Individuals infected with thevirus may develop sudden fever, chills, headache,myalgia, sore throat and a non-productive cough.Serious respiratory complications can develop,including pneumonia, to which older people andall those with certain chronic medical conditionsare particularly susceptible. Significanthospitalisation and 3,000 to 4,000 deaths areattributed to influenza each year in the UK. 2More than 85% of these deaths are people over 65 years.In epidemic years the death toll is even higher,and in 1989/90 may have caused up to 30,000deaths in Britain. 3 Influenza A viruses change through a processknown as antigenic shift giving rise to newsubtypes at irregular intervals (approximatelyevery 10-20 years). This can result in pandemicsbecause there is no immunity to the new subtype.Lesser changes known as antigenic drift occur inboth influenza A and B and usually result inepidemics. People with the following underlying chronic conditions are at particularly high risk of seriousillness or death from influenza: chronicrespiratory disease including asthma andbronchitis; heart disease; mellitus; and immunosuppression due todisease or treatment. 4A UK study found that only 40% of these high risk individuals receivedvaccination annually. 5 EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INFLUENZA VACCINE The influenza vaccine has been shown to beeffective in reducing infection, associated illness,hospitalisation and mortality in older people whenthe infectious and vaccinestrains are closely related. Arecent randomised placebo-controlled trial establishedthat the vaccination of peopleover the age of 60 halved therisk of influenza infectionconfirmed by a blood test. 6 A number of observationalstudies on influenzavaccination in older people,judged by strict selectioncriteria to be of high quality,have been systematicallyreviewed. 7, 8These were predominantly based on institutionalised older people in the United States. The most comprehensive review,7based on a comparison of 8,000 people vaccinated with20,000 unvaccinated, indicates that the vaccine ishighly effective. Cases of respiratory illness,pneumonia, hospitalisations (resulting frominfluenza related illness) and mortality werereduced by over 50% in institutionalised elderlypeople (see table below). Recent observational studies, two from the UK, have shown that the vaccine is equally effective inreducing mortality in older people living in thecommunity and those not classed as medically athigh risk. 9-16 Annual vaccination is important for continuedprotection. Older people who are vaccinatedannually have a greater protection against deaththan those vaccinated for the first time prior to aninfluenza season. 9 ADVERSE EFFECTS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Modern influenza vaccines contain onlyinactivated viruses, which means that they cannotcause influenza. There are few side effects which are reliably attributed to the vaccine. Randomised placebo-controlled trials have established that systemicside effects (such as fever and headaches) occurwith the same frequency in those receiving aplacebo as they do in vaccinated groups. 17, 18Local side effects (soreness or swelling at the injectionsite) do occur in up to 20% of people, but thisdiscomfort is usually mild and normally subsideswithin 48 hours of vaccination. Serious adverse effects are rare; the onlycontraindication to vaccination beinghypersensitivity to hens' eggs. Outcome measure % of Cases Prevented 95% Confidence Interval Respiratory illness 49% 27 to 64% Pneumonia 59% 35 to 74%Hospitalisation 56% to 72%Death 69% 54 to 79%Summary of effectiveness *of the influenza vaccine *Pooled estimate of % of cases prevented by influenza vaccination when the vaccine and virulent strain are the same.7 Similar results are obtained when there are small differences between the virulent and vaccine strains.COST EFFECTIVENESS Economic evaluations in the USA based on studies comparing vaccinated and non-vaccinatedpopulations, have shown that influenzavaccination is a cost effective way of reducingmorbidity and saving lives in people over 65. 14, 15, 19 Although the financial cost to the NHS ofinfluenza-related illness may be lower than in theUSA, and the cost of vaccine about twice as high,extending vaccination to all the over 65s is stilllikely to be a highly cost effective intervention inthe UK. The cost of immunising all older peoplewill at least be met partly by reductions inexpenditure due to reduced treatment andhospitalisation for influenza-related illness. Theefficacy of flu vaccination, therefore, will dependon a number of factors such as the attack rate,hospital bed occupancy rate and length of stay. 20 IMPROVING VACCINATION RATES For vaccination to be effective the vaccine must beadministered prior to infection since it takes 1 - 2weeks to raise protective levels of antibodies.Because supply of the vaccine is slow to adjust toincreased demand, only by vaccinating early can apractitioner be sure that those who most need thevaccine will receive it. Strategies for increasing immunisation coverage should aim at improving: Public awareness of the need for, safety of, and methods of obtaining influenzavaccination. Systematic delivery of the vaccine bypractitioners. Immunisation rates can be improved by using a patient notification or reminder system. 21In 1991 less than 13% of elderly people were offeredinfluenza vaccine in this way. 5 Most general practices have policies for influenzaimmunisation, but these are frequently only oralagreements and targets are rarely defined. 22The introduction of formal policies and the use ofimplementation strategies such as remindersattached to the records of older patients couldimprove vaccination coverage rates. 23, 24 The sharing of responsibility for vaccination withother members of the primary care team, such asnurses and practice managers, is also important.POLICY ISSUES Research evidence supports a policy of influenzavaccination for all older people. The vaccination ofall older people has also been recommended inreseach reviews undertaken by the US and theCanadian Preventive Task Forces. 25, 26Unlike the USA, Canada, and many other European countries,who now have an age-related policy, theDepartments of Health promote vaccination ofindividuals at high medical risk. 4RecommendationsRecommendations All people over 65 should be considered for influenzavaccination. If supply of vaccine is insufficient to vaccinate allpeople over 65 priority shouldbe given to people at high riskof complications from influenzainfection due to chronicdisease, and those resident innursing homes and long stayfacilities. People should be vaccinated in October or early November inadvance of the influenza seasonand annually thereafter toensure maximum protection. Health authorities and practitioners should try toensure systems are in place tooffer influenza vaccine to allolder people. Vaccination coverage should be monitored through a process ofaudit. \u00a9 Hattie Young/Science Photo LibraryFURTHER INFORMATION If you health care.17. Govaert TME, Aretz K, Masurel N et al.
