Last month marked the end of the federal COVID-19 [public health emergency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SAP-H.R.-382-H.J.-Res.-7.pdf). This was encouraging news and a testament to the measures put in place to control the spread of the virus. We are proud UCOP has maintained an effective COVID-19 response program that has resulted in zero internal, on-site spread of COVID-19. Given this and guidance from public health officials, we are changing the following COVID-19 protocols for all UCOP locations, effective June 27, 2023: - UCOP Screen and UCDC Screen surveys still required, but streamlined: We are shortening our symptom screening survey ( [UCOP Screen](https://ucop.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3JAhjmSFliQmyq1)or [UCDC Screen](https://ucop.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_byd1CdbpSkFArYy)) for employees, contractors, and visitors to focus on any symptoms of illness that are not attributable to another known condition. Please remain vigilant and monitor yourself for symptoms before coming to work and stay home when you are ill (whether it is cold, flu or COVID). As always, please consult with your manager if you are ill and cannot work on-site. - Regular COVID-19 testing for employees and contractors will be optional: We are discontinuing mandatory COVID-19 testing, and testing will be optional going forward, which allows for greater flexibility for those who work on-site. If you would like, you can continue to test and request UCOP-supplied test kits. We strongly encourage you to keep a small test kit supply at home and test if you have symptoms or were exposed to someone with a confirmed positive case. This will continue to help us identify COVID-19 cases before coming on-site. - Daily testing required for large events/meetings with 20 or more people: Testing will still be required for events/meetings anticipated to have 20 or more attendees (including support staff). Attendees will continue to test on the first day of the event/meeting and each day thereafter. This will help ensure everyone attending is free of COVID-19 and reduce the risk of transmission. - Required reporting continues: Employees, contractors, and visitors are still [required to report an exposure or confirmed positive case](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/reporting/index.html#report-positive-case)to the UCOP Incident Report Team. As a reminder, positive case reports are tracked and can be found on the [COVID-19 positive case reporting dashboard](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=98584290d37348c6a2e34fb01fc089b7). - Pre-approvals no longer required for large events/meetings: UCOP-sponsored events with more than 20 people or held in the Oakland Broadway Conference Center no longer require prior approval to be scheduled. Please refer to the [Temporary UCOP-sponsored event and meeting COVID-19 protocols](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/events/index.html)for pre-entry requirements for attendees for meetings/events with 20 or more people. Supplies, including masks, hand sanitizer and wipes, will still be available at all locations. As a reminder, one-way masking using an N95, KN95, or approved surgical mask provides protection for you even when others are not masked. Also, if you'd like people to wear masks when they visit or meet with you, you may post this [mask request poster](https://ucop.box.com/s/7gzhk4j51jaxf9x7396i2ch76zaiiwia) outside your workspace. Everyone's health and well-being remain our highest priority. Should guidance change or UCOP case numbers rise, we will reassess and adjust our protocols if necessary. If you have questions, please email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). As always, thank you for your partnership, and please continue to take care of yourself. Sincerely,Thera Kalmijn Executive Director, UCOP Operations UCOP mask protocol changing to strongly recommended beginning Sept. 6 September 1, 2022 Dear UCOP colleagues, I am writing with an update on UCOP's COVID-19 mask protocol. Given that the counties in which we operate continue to be in the \"low\" community transmission category, and the number of positive cases within UCOP remains low, we are revising our masking requirements. Starting Tuesday, Sept. 6, masks will be strongly recommended, but no longer required in UCOP facilities in Livermore, Oakland, Riverside and Sacramento. Mask requirements may vary in our Washington, D.C. facility, so please follow [local coronavirus guidance on the UC Washington Center website](https://www.ucdc.edu/uc-washington-center-home). Masks will continue to be available at all locations, and it's important to remember that one-way masking using an N95, KN95, or approved surgical mask provides protection for you, even when others are not wearing masks. Also, if you'd like people to wear masks when they visit or meet with you, you may post this [mask request poster](https://ucop.box.com/s/7gzhk4j51jaxf9x7396i2ch76zaiiwia) outside your workspace. We will continue to use our symptom screening survey and maintain the current testing frequency as set by our [COVID-19 Testing Program](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/ucop-covid-19-testing-program.html), which helps identify COVID-19 cases before people come on-site. Everyone's health and well-being remain our highest priority. Should guidance change or UCOP case numbers rise, we will reassess and adjust our protocols if necessary. If you have questions, please email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). As always, thank you for your partnership, and please continue to take care of yourself. Sincerely,Thera Kalmijn Executive Director, UCOP Operations UCOP Oakland offices returning to \"get up, mask up\" protocol July 1, 2022 Dear Oakland-based colleagues, Last week, Alameda County lifted the requirement for mandatory masking for indoor spaces. Accordingly, effective immediately we will return to our previous \"get up, mask up\" masking protocol in our Franklin and Broadway offices, as follows: - Approved masks are required in all meeting rooms and common areas, such as elevators, pathways, offices with more than one person, kitchens, restrooms, etc. - Masks are not required, but are strongly recommended when you are in your personal office or workstation. Colleagues may use drop-in focus rooms or reserve an office or huddle room to close a door and take a break from masking. As a reminder, approved masks include KN95, N95, or approved surgical masks (cloth face coverings do not qualify), and masks will continue to be available in both buildings. Thank you for your continued flexibility and partnership, and please continue to take care of yourself. If you have questions, please email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). Sincerely,Thera Kalmijn Executive Director, UCOP Operations June 3, 2022 Alameda Co. reinstates mask mandate for indoor spaces, including Oakland Dear Oakland-based colleagues: Earlier today, Alameda County announced it is reinstating mandatory masking for indoor spaces. Accordingly, effective immediately masks will again be required in our Franklin and Broadway offices, and the requirement will remain in effect as long as the county requires it. Colleagues with offices are not required to wear a mask when alone in their office with the door closed. Colleagues in open workstations are required to mask at their workstations, and may use drop-in focus rooms or reserve an office or huddle room to close a door and take a break from masking. As a reminder, approved masks include KN95, N95, or approved surgical masks (cloth face coverings do not qualify), and masks will continue to be available in both buildings. Thank you for your continued flexibility and partnership, and please continue to take care of yourself. If you have questions, please email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). Sincerely, Thera Kalmijn Executive Director, UCOP Operations [UCOP to modify COVID-19 protocols beginning May 31st] May 26, 2022 Dear UCOP colleagues, As you may know, COVID-19 cases are on the rise across the country and more counties have moved to the medium community transmission category according to [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html). Given these developments, we have decided to modify some of our on-site COVID-19 protocols for all UCOP locations (UCDC protocols may vary), and also allow temporary hybrid schedule flexibility, effective Tuesday, May 31st: - Masks - Approved masks will be required in all meeting rooms and common areas, such as elevators, pathways, offices with more than one person, kitchens, restrooms, etc. Approved masks include KN95, N95, or approved surgical masks, not cloth face coverings. Masks are not required, but are strongly recommended when you are in your personal office or workstation. Masks will continue to be available at all locations. - Temporary option to adjust hybrid work days on-site - While our objective remains having everyone working their full future of work on-site schedule and staff are still permitted to do so, during this surge, we are temporarily allowing flexibility as follows for scheduled days on-site, as long as it is operationally feasible and receives manager/supervisor approval in advance: - Those working 3+ days on-site can temporarily flex their schedule to 2 days on-site. - Those working 2 days on-site can temporarily flex to 1 day on-site. - Those working 1 day on-site will remain at 1 day on-site. We are grateful for staff who continue to fulfill essential functions that must be on-site five days a week. Oakland employees will receive a separate communication regarding any changes to their parking program election. Due to administrative reasons, the parking enrollment period is also being extended. - COVID-19 Testing - Employees, contractors, vendors, and visitors who enter UCOP facilities will continue to test as part of our [COVID-19 Testing Program](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/ucop-covid-19-testing-program.html). We are adjusting our approach for fully vaccinated and boosted individuals as outlined below to help close the testing gap between days on- and off-site. This will help catch active infections that could potentially be brought to the office. - Always test on first day back in the office after any break from being on-site - Partially vaccinated or unvaccinated employees will continue to test every day they are In addition, please remember to adhere to the following existing protocols: - Screening - Complete [UCOP Screen](https://ucop.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3JAhjmSFliQmyq1)or [UCDC Screen](https://ucop.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_byd1CdbpSkFArYy)each day before entering UCOP facilities. - COVID-19 Vaccination, including Boosters - Be in compliance with the COVID-19 Vaccination policy, including boosters and tracking (See the [UCOP COVID-19 Vaccination Policy and Tracking webpage](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/vaccine-policy-implementation.html)). UC's policy requires that you are up to date with the vaccine series, meaning that you receive all boosters approved for your situation (e.g. by age, CDC underlying condition, etc.) when you are eligible. We strongly encourage you to get your booster(s) as soon as you're eligible. We are checking employee compliance with boosters in the UCOP COVID19 Vaccination Tracker. - Reporting - Follow UCOP protocols if you test positive for COVID-19 or are notified that you have been in close contact with someone who has a confirmed COVID-19 infection. (See the [UCOP Exposure Management webpage](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/ucop-exposure-management.html)for what to do for exposure and positive cases.) Everyone's health and well-being remains our highest priority, and we will continue to adjust our protocols as circumstances warrant. If you have questions, please email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). As always, thank you for your ongoing flexibility and partnership, and please continue to take care of yourself. Sincerely, Thera Kalmijn Executive Director, UCOP Operations [UCOP to relax COVID-19 protocols beginning May 2] April 27, 2022 Dear UCOP colleagues, I am writing with an update on UCOP's COVID-19 protocols. Given that the counties in which we operate are now in the \"low\" community transmission category, the fact that UCOP has a highly vaccinated employee population, and that our testing program identifies cases before people come on-site, we will now begin to relax some of our on-site COVID-19 protocols. Consistent with [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html), effective Monday, May 2, our COVID-19 protocols for all UCOP locations will be as follows: - Face coverings - Face coverings will no longer be required, but are strongly recommended for vaccinated and unvaccinated staff in all areas of UCOP facilities, and will continue to be available at all locations. If you would like face coverings to be worn when people come to your personal workspace, you may post this standard [face-covering request poster](https://ucop.box.com/s/7gzhk4j51jaxf9x7396i2ch76zaiiwia)at the entrance to your space. Also, it's important to remember that \"one-way\" masking using an N95 or KN95 mask provides protection for the wearer, even when others are not wearing masks. - Physical distancing - We have eliminated the requirement for physical distancing, and we now allow: - Full capacity in all common spaces, including elevators (Face coverings are available by the elevator doors to encourage use while in the elevators.). You can help reduce overcrowding in the elevators by: - Taking the stairs for short trips between floors - Avoiding peak arrival and departure times when elevators are crowded - Allowing time in your schedule to take the next elevator if you prefer - Full capacity in all conference rooms - Use of adjacent workstations for assignment and hoteling (For now, workplace assignments will remain spread-out wherever practical, but demand for new spaces will in some cases require us to return to full occupancy levels.) - Full capacity in all common spaces, including elevators (Face coverings are available by the elevator doors to encourage use while in the elevators.). You can help reduce overcrowding in the elevators by: - COVID-19 Testing - Employees, contractors, vendors, and visitors who enter UCOP facilities will continue to test as part of our [COVID-19 Testing Program](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/ucop-covid-19-testing-program.html). There are no changes to our current testing program. - Enhanced communal space air filtration - To supplement our high-filtration HVAC systems in UCOP-owned and operated buildings, we are, to the greatest extent possible, adding portable HEPA filters to conference rooms that hold five or more people. In addition, please remember to: - Be in compliance with the COVID-19 Vaccination policy, including boosters and tracking (See the [UCOP COVID-19 Vaccination Policy and Tracking webpage](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/vaccine-policy-implementation.html)) - Complete [UCOP Screen](https://ucop.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3JAhjmSFliQmyq1)or [UCDC Screen](https://ucop.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_byd1CdbpSkFArYy)each day before entering the workplace - Use UCOP-provided cleaning supplies to wipe down surfaces, touchpoints and equipment in personal workspaces and common areas before and after use - Follow UCOP protocols if you test positive for COVID-19 or are notified that you have been in close contact with someone who has a confirmed COVID-19 infection (See the [UCOP Exposure Management webpage](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/ucop-exposure-management.html)for what to do for exposure and positive cases) Although we are glad to be at a point where we can begin to relax our protocols, everyone's health and well-being remains our highest priority. Should UCOP case numbers rise or local community transmission move into a higher category, we will reassess and adjust our protocols if necessary. If you have questions, please email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). As always, thank you for your ongoing flexibility and partnership, and please continue to take care of yourself. Sincerely, Thera Kalmijn Executive Director, UCOP Operations [ACTION REQUIRED: UCOP Vaccine Tracker now available to upload booster information - Complete by March 15, 2022] March 1, 2022 Dear colleagues, First and foremost, I hope you and your loved ones are healthy, and that you are taking care of yourself. I'm pleased to announce that the [UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker](https://samlproxy.ucop.edu/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SSOService.php?spentityid=https://intake.sedgwick.com/) is now available for you to provide your booster information and documentation of proof. Per the [UCOP booster mandate](https://link.ucop.edu/2022/01/10/ucop-covid-19-booster-mandate-and-return-to-on-site-operations/), UCOP employees eligible for a booster vaccination should have obtained one by January 31, 2022. Employees who are not yet eligible (due to timing of original vaccine dose(s)) must get a booster shot within 30 days of eligibility, which is five months after the second dose for Pfizer and Moderna and two months after the Johnson & Johnson dose. What You Need to Do To provide your booster information and upload your proof, go to [UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker](https://samlproxy.ucop.edu/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SSOService.php?spentityid=https://intake.sedgwick.com/) and do the following: - Prepare by making sure you have the dates you received your booster(s) and your Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccination card handy (or foreign equivalent for those that received their vaccinations abroad - See the [COVID-19 vaccination policy FAQs](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus/employee-covid-vaccine-policy-faqs.pdf)for more information). - Select the I am reporting a booster button. (Note: If you are a new employee and have not yet uploaded your proof of vaccination into the UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker, select the I was vaccinated button and follow the instructions. Then return to the tracker and report your booster information.) - Your name, employee ID and UCOP email address will auto-populate. - Select your UCOP work location, which is the city where your usual UCOP office is located. - Select Yes that you are reporting a booster. If you select No, you will be asked to return to the tracker landing page and select another option or cancel the intake. - Select the vaccine manufacturer for your booster. - Select how many booster shots you have received. (If you have received more than one booster shot, you will need to go into the system and enter each booster separately.) - Enter the date of your latest booster. - Upload a picture of your vaccination card (the document issued by the CDC). - Attest that the information you provided is accurate and you understand that it will be shared with your employer. - Hit the Submit button. Important notes: - You must use Chrome or Firefox browsers \u2014 this link does not work on Internet Explorer. - If you entered your booster information prior to March 1, you will need to re-enter your information by following the steps above or your information will not be tracked correctly. If you have an existing COVID-19 vaccination or exception or deferral, it still applies with respect to boosters. As a reminder, those with approved exceptions or deferrals (or a pending request for one) will be required to observe non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including wearing a face covering and maintaining physical distancing while on-site, and participate in daily COVID-19 testing. If you were eligible for a booster on or before January 31, you have until March 15 to enter your booster information and upload proof in the vaccine tracker. If you were not eligible, you have 30 days from eligibility to get your booster and enter your booster information and upload proof. If you have not either provided proof of your original vaccination or submitted a request for exception or deferral, you will not be permitted access to UCOP facilities and your building access badge will be deactivated until you are in compliance. UCOP will continue to follow Appendix E: Employee Compliance in the [UC COVID-19 Vaccination policy](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000695/SARS-CoV-2_Covid-19). Questions about completing the online tracker can be directed to [UCOP-COVID19-Vaccine@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Vaccine@ucop.edu). Thank you for your partnership and prompt action, and as always, please stay safe. Sincerely, Nancy Pluzdrak, MBA, EdD Executive Director, UCOP Human Resources [UCOP face-covering requirements still in effect] February 15, 2022 Dear UCOP colleagues, I am writing to provide you an update on our UCOP-wide masking protocols. As you may know, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) last week announced [new guidance for the use of face masks](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx) that takes effect February 16. In addition, the Washington, D.C. Public Health department (DC Health) is [lifting its mask requirements](https://mayor.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mayormb/release_content/attachments/Situational-Update-Presentation_02-14-22.pdf) effective March 1. At this time, for everyone's well-being we are keeping our existing [face-covering protocols](https://ucop.app.box.com/file/910044432185?s=7a6mbij1urla39elh33m1md3dats0avj) in place for all UCOP-operated buildings in California and Washington, D.C. This means that all employees and visitors must wear a face covering when at a UCOP location. Since we are at the beginning of our phased return to on-site operations for most staff, we believe it is important for the well-being of all employees to continue to require face coverings and maintain other COVID-19 protocols during the transition. This will allow us to enroll all on-site staff in our COVID-19 testing program, verify mandated booster status, and assess other existing COVID-19 protocols. This approach was also used by UC campuses as they brought students and others back on-site and many of our campuses are also maintaining indoor masking requirements for the time being. As a reminder, the following additional COVID-19 protocols are in place to support everyone's health and are required to enter or work at any UCOP facility: - Physical distancing - Whenever possible, maintain six-foot physical distancing (unless close contact is for less than 15 minutes, such as riding in an elevator or passing in the corridor). We have made every effort to temporarily rearrange space assignments to allow physical distancing. Conference room capacity has also been temporarily reduced to allow for physical distancing. - Facilities - As a courtesy to all employees, we will continue to provide cleaning supplies. Please wipe down surfaces, touchpoints and equipment in personal workspaces and common areas before and after use. - UCOP Screen - Complete the UCOP Screen survey each day before entering the workplace and follow guidance if NOT APPROVED to enter the workplace. UCOP Screen now includes a summary of the COVID-19 testing protocols and a place for employees to attest that they are following them, in addition to attesting to flu vaccination status. - COVID-19 Testing - We are updating our testing program to include a test-to-return/test-to-stay approach by moving most testing to at-home testing before entering a UCOP facility. The updated COVID-19 testing program starts this week in Oakland and will continue to be mandatory. The UCOP COVID-19 Response Team is working with leadership for the Riverside and Sacramento locations to implement similar testing programs in the near future. Our Washington, D.C. testing program is also operational. Details on the new testing program can be found in the [testing article](https://link.ucop.edu/2022/02/14/updated-covid-19-testing-program-starts-this-week-in-oakland/)in this week's Link. - UCOP COVID-19 Vaccination Policy - Be in compliance with the policy, including boosters. Per the [UCOP booster mandate](https://link.ucop.edu/2022/01/10/ucop-covid-19-booster-mandate-and-return-to-on-site-operations/), UCOP employees eligible for a booster vaccination should have obtained one by January 31, 2022. Employees who are not yet eligible (due to timing of original vaccine dose(s)) must get a booster shot within 30 days of eligibility. The updated UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker to accept booster information is in development and will be available soon. - UCOP Isolation and Quarantine Guidance - Follow UCOP protocols when you test positive for COVID-19 or are notified that you have been a close contact. UCOP continues to meet CDPH, Cal/OSHA, and local county requirements to respond to COVID-19 incidents. The [UCOP Updated COVID-19 Protocols information sheet](https://ucop.box.com/s/7a6mbij1urla39elh33m1md3dats0avj)(Section IV) outlines what to do for both exposure and positive cases. When more of us are back on-site and we've had a chance to monitor testing, protocols, and other factors, we will reevaluate our mask requirements and provide an update. If you have questions, please email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). As always, thank you for your ongoing flexibility and partnership, and please continue to take care of yourself and be safe. Sincerely,Thera Kalmijn Executive Director, UCOP Operations [Town Hall recap about return to on-site work] January 27, 2022 Dear UCOP colleagues, I want to thank the many of you who attended this afternoon's town hall about our plans to begin to return to the office in the weeks ahead. If you were unable to attend the event, you may view the [recording and presentation](https://www.ucop.edu/future-of-work/resources.html). I hope those of you who participated found it informative and that it addressed some of your questions and concerns. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, after additional consultation with UCOP leadership and others, we decided to delay our January 31 start to allow everyone more time to prepare for their eventual return to the office. Although we are not formally returning this month, the overall structure of our phased return plan has not changed significantly, just the timing. Recent data show that the omicron surge appears to have peaked and cases are starting to drop. This is very good news. As a result, all of our campuses are returning to in-person instruction over the next couple of weeks. UCOP has learned a lot these last two years working remotely with limited staff on-site, and we're leveraging that experience by creating a hybrid, remote, on-site approach to work arrangements that provides staff with more flexibility while still allowing us to optimally support the entire UC system. Establishing this more flexible approach comes with both challenges and opportunities \u2014 and our first challenge is getting everyone who needs to be there back into their office spaces in a thoughtful, orderly and effective way. As we shared in today's town hall, below is the new timeline for our phased return, along with information about our updated COVID-19 protocols. Return to on-site operations timeline - We expect to formally begin our return to on-site operations starting March 1st using our slow-build approach. This communication serves as the 30-day notice for all staff to allow time to plan for personal accommodations. - Starting the week of February 7th, UCOP leadership will begin to hold some senior leadership meetings in the office. - During the month of February, we will begin our move-ins at all UCOP locations so that we can begin to get people back in the office for a day to get your workstations set up and ready to go. Managers will be working with the Operations team and all of you to determine a time when that will happen. We have tailored each UCOP location's plan to meet specific local operational needs. For some Oakland staff, department move-in dates will not be in February. Details by location are available in the presentation. - On a limited basis, those that want to work in the office will also be allowed to return voluntarily as we initiate our phased, slow-build process. - Everyone at UCOP should start making plans now that allow them to be fully engaged in starting the slow-build of their ongoing on-site, hybrid, or remote schedule in March. We expect to have our full future operations state in place by April 30, 2022. If you find you need additional time, please work with your manager. We know that this will be a time of readjustment for everyone, so if issues come up while you are getting ready for your return, let your manager know. - As planned, we will start with alternating on-site and remote workdays to limit the number of people in the building, achieve maximum physical distancing between workstations, and be sensitive to employees' needs to readjust their schedules and personal commitments. Updated COVID-19 protocols and testing program As we also mentioned at today's event, we have updated our COVID-19 protocols. Please review the [UCOP Updated COVID-19 Protocols information sheet](https://ucop.box.com/s/7a6mbij1urla39elh33m1md3dats0avj) for full information regarding changes. As we return to our office locations, we will continue to focus on the health and well-being of staff. All along, UC has followed the science, which has helped protect our community. With appropriate masking, ensuring our staff are vaccinated and boosted, regular testing and monitoring, and environmentally tuned buildings, we are confident our return will be successful. This will be a new way of working for all of us \u2014 and we are excited about the opportunities that come with these changes. We will all be learning as we go, and we will keep you informed as we make adjustments. If you have questions, please talk with your manager or email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu) As always, please continue to be safe and take care of yourself and your loved ones. Sincerely,Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer [Update on return to on-site operations, COVID-19 protocols and upcoming Town Hall] January 24, 2022 Dear UCOP colleagues, When I wrote to you earlier this month, I informed you that our phased (\"slow-build\") return to on-site operations would begin Jan. 31. After additional consultation with UCOP leadership and others, we have decided to delay our start by at least several weeks. Among other things, this will allow everyone more time to prepare for their eventual return to the office, and next month we will update everyone on our timing. We also will continue to be in touch regularly as the situation continues to be very dynamic. Additionally, we will be holding a town hall for UCOP staff this Thursday, January 27th, to share additional updates and answer questions. Details on the town hall, and information on how to register, are available below. Although we are pushing back our start date, the overall structure of our phased return plans has not changed significantly. We will start with alternating on-site and remote workdays to limit the number of people in the building, achieve maximum physical distancing between workstations, and be sensitive to employees' needs to readjust their schedules and personal commitments. As mentioned previously, we have tailored each UCOP location's plan to meet specific local operational needs. Updated COVID-19 Protocols We are also updating our COVID-19 protocols for face covering, testing, isolation, and quarantine requirements, in alignment with CDPH and Cal/OSHA workplace rules. As a reminder, all other COVID-19 protocols such as compliance with the UC COVID-19 Vaccine policy, use of UCOP Screen, hand hygiene, cleaning and high-grade building air filtration, are still in place. Please review the [UCOP Updated COVID-19 Protocols information sheet](https://ucop.box.com/s/7a6mbij1urla39elh33m1md3dats0avj) for full information regarding changes in COVID-19 protocols. At a high level, changes include: - Revised Face Covering Requirement: Effective immediately, anyone coming to a UCOP location must wear an approved face covering. Under the new Cal/OSHA workplace rules, a cloth face covering alone no longer meets the requirement and masks with higher filtration and better fit are required such as authentic N95 and KF94 respirators and KN95 and medical masks. Please consult the information sheet for details on approved mask types, proper fit, and caring for your masks. You may use your own face covering if it meets the updated face covering requirement, and UCOP has face coverings that meet the new requirement available at all locations for staff who do not have them. - COVID-19 Testing: - UCOP is adding a \"test to return\" requirement and moving most testing to at-home testing before arrival to the office. UCOP will provide test kits for employees working on-site. The Oakland and Washington, D.C., locations already have on-site testing and UCPath and Sacramento on-site programs are in progress. Additional information and instructions regarding the new process will be provided by location. - Testing frequency differs by vaccination status and days on-site. Please see the attached information sheet for specific testing requirements. - CDPH and Cal/OSHA Isolation and Quarantine Guidance: During our last town hall, some participants asked how we respond when someone working on site is exposed to or tests positive for COVID-19. UCOP continues to meet CDPH, Cal/OSHA, and local county requirements to respond to COVID-19 incidents. Section IV of the information sheet outlines what to do for both exposure and positive cases. - UCOP COVID-19 booster reminder: Per the [UCOP booster mandate](https://link.ucop.edu/2022/01/10/ucop-covid-19-booster-mandate-and-return-to-on-site-operations/), UCOP employees eligible for a booster vaccination must obtain one by January 31, 2022. Employees who are not yet eligible (due to timing of original vaccine dose(s)) must get a booster shot within 30 days of eligibility. We are updating the UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker to accept information about boosters, and we will notify everyone when the tracker is available to upload an updated copy of your vaccination card and booster information. - Opt in to CA Notify or DC CAN COVID-19 Exposure Notification System: Another way to protect yourself and your community from COVID-19 is to add your phone to [CA Notify](https://canotify.ca.gov/)or [DC CAN](https://coronavirus.dc.gov/dccan): It's easy, private, secure and 100% opt-in. From launch to Dec. 2021, approximately 15.5 million people activated CA Notify and approximately 620,000 users received exposure notifications. Save the Date - January Town Hall On Thursday, Jan. 27, from 1:00-2:15 p.m. PT, we will hold a second town hall for UCOP staff to discuss UCOP's Future of Work efforts, COVID-19 response and return to on-site operations plans. We heard your feedback on the December town hall and have extended our time together with a longer live Q&A period during which panelists will answer questions submitted by UCOP staff. I will lead the event, and be joined again by Executive Vice President, University of California Health, Dr. Carrie L. Byington, Executive Director, UCOP Operations, Thera Kalmijn, and members of the UCOP Future of Work and COVID-19 Response teams. [Register online here](https://UCOP.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_aEr8chFRSre1DlqPinc73w). Before the town hall, please take time to [review the recordings, presentations and Q&As from the previous town hall](https://www.ucop.edu/future-of-work/resources.html). Many of your questions may already be answered there. If you have questions, please talk with your manager or email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). As always, please continue to be safe and take care of yourself and your loved ones. Sincerely,Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer [UCOP COVID-19 Booster Mandate and return to on-site operations] January 5, 2022 Dear colleagues, Happy New Year! I hope you were able to rest and restore during the winter break. As we start 2022, I know that our future of work, return to on-site operations and COVID-19-related protocols are top of mind for many, and I am writing to share with you two important updates. COVID-19 booster mandate For the safety and well-being of the entire university community, UC's systemwide [COVID-19 Vaccination policy](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/07/ucs-covid-19-vaccine-policy.html) requires, with few exceptions, that all students, faculty and staff be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus, including getting booster shots. Consistent with this policy and [President Drake's recent message](https://link.ucop.edu/2021/12/19/a-message-from-president-michael-v-drake-on-covid-vaccine-boosters/), UCOP employees eligible for a booster vaccination must obtain one by January 31, 2022. Employees who are not yet eligible (due to timing of original vaccine dose(s)) must get a booster shot within 30 days of eligibility. Please consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for information on [who is eligible for booster shots and when](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html). Being vaccinated, including boosters, and wearing appropriate masks remains our best defense against the COVID-19 virus. Reporting your COVID-19 booster shot. We are updating the UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker to accept information about boosters, and we will notify everyone when the tracker is available to upload an updated copy of your vaccination card and booster information. **Please note that you will not be able to access a UCOP facility until your compliance with the new booster requirements is confirmed. Approved employee medical and religious exceptions also apply to boosters. Employees who choose not to be vaccinated, and have no approved exemption, accommodation or deferral, potentially put others' health at risk and may face disciplinary actions. Return to on-site operations The health and well-being of all staff remains our highest priority. We continue to monitor the pandemic situation closely, and will follow guidance from the CDC, local public health officials, our own UC infectious disease experts, and other scientific sources. As planned, we expect to begin our slow-build approach to returning to on-site operations on Jan. 31. However, we will provide more flexibility in the beginning to allow us to ensure our phased return is appropriately calibrated with how COVID infection rates are trending. This includes adjusting our office population density as circumstances warrant. The UCOP Operations team is working with leadership at each UCOP location on specific return plans and COVID-19 protocols. Each UCOP location's return process will be slightly different depending on the location's operational and program needs. We will share more specifics about those plans in the coming weeks. If you have questions, please talk with your manager or email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). As always, please continue to take care of yourself and your loved ones and be safe. Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer [UCOP COVID-19 Testing Program update, Oakland interim testing program to begin Dec. 15] December 14, 2021 Dear colleagues, As more staff return to working on-site, and as we prepare for UCOP's phased return to on-site operations beginning in late January, the health and well-being of all staff remains our and leadership's highest priority. The UCOP COVID-19 Response Team continues to monitor the pandemic situation closely, including information and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), local public health officials, our own UC infectious disease experts, and other scientific sources. Regular COVID-19 testing is essential to supporting everyone's well-being, now and as we prepare for more staff to return next year. We're writing to update you on current, new and future testing protocols for UCOP locations. Current and future testing requirements The following outlines the testing requirements for staff in the following categories: - Staff scheduled to return starting late January 2022 - Staff currently in Sacramento, Washington, D.C. and Riverside offices - Staff currently in Oakland - New interim testing program launching Dec. 15 (see details below) Staff scheduled to return starting late January 2022: We are working with a third-party testing company to develop an on-site testing program for all UCOP locations to support our return to on-site operations beginning in late January. The program will include testing of vaccinated staff, and increased testing of unvaccinated staff who are in compliance with the UC COVID-19 vaccination policy. We may adjust this program as circumstances warrant. Staff in Sacramento, Washington, D.C. and Riverside offices: Staff in these locations should continue to follow the testing program for their location, as follows: - UCPath - Staff should continue to test weekly at the Curative testing site. - UCDC - Staff have access to free local county testing locations. Information about these testing sites has been provided to staff by UCDC. - Sacramento - Staff are not currently on-site due to the ongoing work to earthquake retrofit the building. We are exploring interim on-site testing programs for these offices and will provide updates when we have more information. Oakland Staff currently working on-site: Due to an increased on-site presence in Oakland, we are launching an interim testing program for Oakland staff working on-site to bridge the gap between now and when the third-party testing program is in place at the end of January. The interim testing program launches Wednesday, December 15, and will be mandatory and monitored for compliance starting Monday, December 20. The interim program uses rapid COVID-19 tests and provides a convenient and consistent approach. It will require: - All on-site staff who are in the office for more than one hour weekly to conduct a rapid test at least twice weekly (staff stopping in for less than an hour a week to pick up items, etc. are not required to test) - Staff who are unvaccinated and in compliance with the UC COVID-19 Vaccination policy to conduct a rapid test three times weekly - Staff to document their results and show proof of testing and test results if requested - Staff currently enrolled in the UC Berkeley testing program to switch to the interim on-site program instead. UCOP's participation in the UCB program is being discontinued. Following is a summary of how the interim Oakland testing program works. More detailed program guidelines and instructions are available in the [UCOP Interim COVID-19 Testing Guidelines - Oakland](https://ucop.app.box.com/file/895747777129?s=gwjg23hu8mvh9sivv0t3ekufdrlv2ejh). - The testing program will be available Monday - Thursday from 8:30-10:30 a.m. and 1:30-3:30 p.m. and Friday from 8:30-10:30 a.m. Please note that the Lobby 2 Business Center will be closed during those times to accommodate testing. - Fill out the testing program Smartsheet either at home on your laptop or cell phone or on the laptop in the Franklin building Lobby to obtain a test kit. - Obtain a COVID-19 rapid test kit from the Work Management Center. - Self-administer the test in a designated testing station and wait 15 minutes for the result. Several testing stations have been set up in the Lobby 2 conference room with plexiglass dividers and sanitation supplies at each station. - If the test result is negative, date and photograph the results, share if asked, and proceed to your workspace. - If the test result is positive, date and photograph the results, then leave immediately and follow the required notification steps and instructions provided. Current COVID-19 protocols As a reminder, testing is only one component of our COVID-19 protocols. We continue to follow the recommendations and guidance of public health authorities regarding effective transmission mitigation strategies. Our current COVID-19 protocols require vaccination, screening, masking, physical distancing and strong hygiene practices. Our current space use plan, which spreads staff throughout a larger than usual area as much as possible, allows for effective physical distancing. If you have questions, please email [UCOP-COVID19-Testing@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Testing@ucop.edu). As always, please continue to take care of yourself and stay safe. COVID-19 Response Team [Update on UCOP's planned timeframe and approach for returning on-site] November 18, 2021 Dear UCOP colleagues, In August, we postponed our return to on-site operations to January 2022 and promised to review the return date in mid-November. After discussions with President Drake and UCOP leadership, we have decided to move forward with a modified approach that takes into account the possibility of a winter spike in COVID-19 cases, allows flexibility and an adjustment period in returning to on-site operations, and lowers the density in our buildings. Our updated plan is: - We will postpone the planned return scheduled for the first week of January. - We will use a \"slow build\" approach for all locations with move-ins and on-site work starting the week of January 31 and building through April 2022. This helps keep our office population lower during the winter months and allows those who will have an on-site or hybrid work arrangement to work with their managers to gradually adjust to their full required on-site schedule. For example, someone who will work 3+ days on-site could transition (with the approval of their manager) from one day per week on-site early in the process to 3+ days by mid-April 2022. - We expect to have our full future operations state - on-site, hybrid and remote - in place by April 30, 2022. Plans will vary by location based on business needs and circumstances. For instance, Oakland will take the office consolidation work into consideration, with department move-in dates communicated mid-December. Our UCDC location is already operating on-site, and seismic work will affect the plan for our Sacramento office. UCPath's leadership team is preparing a return to on-site plan in alignment with the phased approach. The return to on-site plans will also be informed by the final outcome of our [Future of Work process](https://www.ucop.edu/future-of-work/announcements.html#oct18). The first steps - position eligibility assessment and employee preference selection - are complete, and HR is conducting a UCOP-wide position eligibility equity review to ensure overall consistency and equity across UCOP. Over the next few weeks, division leaders will approve work arrangements for their divisions, and BASC will complete their work on preliminary space planning. Employees will be notified in mid-December of their approved work arrangements. Managers and supervisors will work with employees to support them during the transition and provide them notice of at least 30 days to prepare and make arrangements for family care or other personal matters. We are planning a town hall to share information and answer questions. Details will be forthcoming in Link. If you have questions regarding our return date or our Future of Work efforts, please feel free to talk with your manager or email [UCOP-FutureofWork@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-FutureofWork@ucop.edu). As always, please continue to take care of yourself and stay safe. I wish you and your family a happy Thanksgiving. Sincerely,Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Reminder: COVID-19 protocols remain in effect at all UCOP facilities November 2, 2021 Dear colleagues, I hope you are well and enjoying the fall season. I am writing to remind everyone that existing COVID-19 protocols remain in effect at all UCOP facilities regardless of changes to local county public health guidance. Alameda County public health officials recently published an amendment regarding the use of face coverings, effective Monday, November 1, 2021. The amendment does not change current face covering requirements for any UCOP-operated building in Oakland. As a reminder, the following COVID-19 protocols are in effect to enter or work at any UCOP facility: - Be in compliance with the UCOP COVID-19 Vaccination Policy - Wear a face covering regardless of vaccination status in all open workspaces and common areas - Complete the [UCOP Screen](https://ucop.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3JAhjmSFliQmyq1)symptom screening survey each day before entering the workplace and follow guidance if NOT APPROVED to enter the workplace - Comply with all COVID-19 mitigation measures and signage posted throughout the facility - Maintain physical distancing of six feet (unless close contact is for less than 15 minutes, such as riding in an elevator or passing in the corridor) - Wipe down surfaces, touchpoints and equipment in personal workspaces and common areas before and after use, using the provided disinfecting wipes Best regards, Steve Murray Director, Building and Administrative Service Center Follow-up message from EVP/COO Nava about UCOP's January 2022 on-site operations 20, 2021 Dear UCOP colleagues: In response to [my email earlier this week](https://link.ucop.edu/2021/08/20/ucop-return-to-on-site-operations-date-extended-to-january-2022/), we received some questions about why UCOP is able to extend its return to on-site work to January while campuses are preparing to reopen this fall. It's a logical question. The answer is that UCOP is a very different organizational environment, with different staffing needs than a campus, and what makes sense for UCOP may not work for a campus, and vice versa. UCOP is an administrative office that, unlike a campus, does not serve students and patients or have laboratories, and can effectively do much of its work remotely for the time being. In addition, our Oakland and Sacramento offices are undergoing renovation and many staff are occupying, or would need to occupy, temporary space until the renovations are completed later this fall. So it doesn't make sense to return the majority of UCOP staff to temporary workspaces for the next several months, when most staff can continue to effectively perform their jobs remotely. For UCOP, we need essential staff on-site for certain functions, and we believe it is fully safe for them (as well as staff who want to voluntarily return) to be there, following the appropriate safety protocols. Campuses are different and may need a variety of personnel on-site. Although UCOP and campuses have different staffing needs, one thing we all share is an absolute commitment to the health and well-being of every member of the UC community, regardless of location. I hope this additional information is helpful. If you have questions, please feel free to send them to [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer UCOP return to on-site operations date extended to January 2022 August 18, 2021 Dear UCOP colleagues, I am writing to let you know about a change in our plans for returning on-site. When I wrote to you in March, COVID-related cases were declining steadily and it was looking like we could return to working on-site this fall. However, in light of the unfortunate surge in COVID-19 cases throughout the U.S. due to the Delta variant, and evolving guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities, we have decided to revise our plans. After much discussion with President Drake and UCOP leadership, for the safety and well-being of everyone we have decided to extend the start date of our phased return to on-site work to January 2022. Essential staff currently working on-site will continue to do so. Other departments also doing essential work, such as RASC and UCPath, will proceed with their plans to return select staff critical to optimal operations. In addition, the UCDC program will be open to students for the fall and their staff will also be on-site, and our state and federal governmental relations offices may need some staff in the office in order to meet governmental and legislative schedules. While this shift to January 2022 for the broad UCOP community may provide relief for some, it may be less welcome news for others who are eager to come back on-site, at least some of the time. This was a difficult decision with many factors to consider. The well-being of employees is our priority. President Drake has asked us to re-evaluate the new return plan in mid-November to determine if the January timeframe should be revisited. We will communicate any changes at that time. Although we have pushed back our timing to January, interested staff can request to voluntarily return to on-site work starting in September while following all COVID-19 protocols, including masking, physical distancing and restrictions on large gatherings. Temporary space assignments will be made available for these requests and must be approved in advance and coordinated with the appropriate staff, as follows: - Franklin-Broadway campus: Complete the [UCOP Voluntary Return: Request for Interim Workspace form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/034b4ef8580b42daa0b5afbf5d54f1e9) - UCOP State Government Relations - Sacramento: Email [Ogden@ucop.edu](mailto:Kelley.Ogden@ucop.edu) - UCPath: Work with your manager - UC Press: Email [dnasitka@ucpress.edu](mailto:dnasitka@ucpress.edu) It is important to note that the extension to January does not change the need to comply with the systemwide [COVID-19 Vaccine Policy](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/07/ucs-covid-19-vaccine-policy.html) by September 1. UCOP will continue to implement tracking per this week's message from Nancy Pluzdrak. Please see the [UCOP Vaccine Policy Implementation webpage](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/vaccine-policy-implementation.html) for more information. Lastly, the Future of Work team is continuing its work and readjusting the milestones and deadlines to the new return timeline. The next step will be to determine position eligibility for specific work arrangements, followed by discussions with employees, which will occur over the next several weeks. Additional updates on this will be forthcoming. As always, please continue to take care of yourself and stay safe. If you have questions, please feel free to talk with your manager or email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). Sincerely,Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Compliance - Complete by September 1, 2021 August 16, 2021 Dear Colleagues, First and foremost, I hope you and your loved ones are healthy, and that you are taking care of yourself. In order to comply with the UC systemwide [COVID-19 vaccination policy](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/07/ucs-covid-19-vaccine-policy.html) that was issued in July, all UC employees must be fully vaccinated prior to entering a UC facility. Note that employees may request an exception to the COVID-19 vaccine requirement based on a medical exemption, disability exception, pregnancy deferral or religious objection. UCOP has partnered with a company named Sedgwick Claims Management to collect vaccination status and process exception or deferral requests. UC has worked with Sedgwick for more than 30 years and Sedgwick is also providing this service to a number of UC campuses. Information provided through their tool will be kept confidential and only accessed as stated in the policy. In keeping with the intent of the systemwide policy and the goal of keeping our community healthy, in order to comply with UC policy and continue to have access to UCOP facilities, by September 1, 2021 you must either (1) provide proof of vaccination; or (2) submit a request for an exception or deferral. If you have not either provided proof of vaccination or submitted a request for exception or deferral by September 1, you will not be permitted access to UCOP facilities and your building access badge will be deactivated until you are in compliance. What You Need to Do To upload your proof of vaccination or to request an exemption or deferral, go to [UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker](https://samlproxy.ucop.edu/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SSOService.php?spentityid=https://intake.sedgwick.com/) and follow the instructions. Please note that there may be a delay between submitting your proof or request and when you are considered compliant, so don't wait until August 31. Proof of vaccination: You will need to provide the dates of vaccination AND upload an image of your Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccination card (or foreign equivalent for those that received their vaccinations abroad - See the [COVID-19 vaccination policy FAQs](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus/employee-covid-vaccine-policy-faqs.pdf) for more information). Request for an exception or deferral: Once your request is submitted, it will automatically be sent for processing to Sedgwick, who will respond to your exception or deferral request and provide you with status updates. Those with approved exceptions or deferrals (or a pending request for one) will be required to observe non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including wearing a face covering and maintaining physical distancing while on-site, and participate in weekly COVID-19 testing. For more information about the proof of vaccination or exception/deferral process, visit the [UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Implementation page](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/vaccine-policy-implementation.html) on the coronavirus.edu website. Questions about completing the online tracker can be directed to [UCOP-COVID19-Vaccine@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Vaccine@ucop.edu). Thank you for your partnership and prompt action, and as always, please stay safe.Sincerely, Nancy Pluzdrak, MBA, EdD Executive Director, UCOP Human Resources Final UC COVID-19 vaccination policy and FAQs July 15, 2021 Dear UCOP colleagues, Following up on my message to you last month, I'm writing to share with you the University's [final policy regarding required COVID-19 vaccinations](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000695/SARS-Cov-2). There is also a comprehensive set of [frequently asked questions for employees](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus/employee-covid-vaccine-policy-faqs.pdf) about the policy, and I encourage you to read them as they address many questions and concerns. The final policy details were reached following a several-month consultation period with the UC community, including faculty and student health physician directors, that revealed strong support for moving forward with a COVID-19 vaccination requirement now. As I outlined in my [June message](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/announcements.html#june10), our approach to required COVID-19 vaccinations can be summarized as follows: - For the safety and well-being of the entire university community, the policy will require, with few exceptions, that all students, faculty and staff be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus in the coming weeks before they will be allowed on campus or in a facility or office. - Individuals will be required to show proof of vaccination, and UC locations are preparing for how they will record individual vaccination status. - For UCOP staff, compliance with the policy will be required two weeks before you are expected to be onsite at any of our offices. - For campuses, compliance with the policy will be required two weeks before faculty, staff and students are expected to be on campus for the fall term. - The policy will allow for medical exemptions consistent with CDC guidance and manufacturer labeling on contraindications and precautions. As with other policies, and, in the case of employees as required by federal and California law, faculty, staff and students will also be eligible to request accommodations based on disability or religious belief, and deferrals are available for those who are pregnant. - Those with approved exemptions, accommodations or deferrals may return to their location with the expectation that they will remain masked in all public settings, and comply with the local testing plan. - Employees who choose not to be vaccinated, and have no approved exemption, accommodation or deferral, potentially put others' health at risk and may face disciplinary actions. Guidelines for how the policy will be implemented systemwide are being finalized and are expected to be issued next week \u2014 we will share those with you once they are available. Questions about the policy may be sent to [UCOP-COVID19-Vaccine@UCOP.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Vaccine@UCOP.edu). As always, please continue to stay safe, take of yourself and loved ones, and thank you for your partnership in helping to keep our community healthy. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Reminder - UCOP Facility Status and COVID-19 Protocols June 17, 2021 Dear colleagues, Happily, state and federal agencies have issued updated COVID-19 guidance about reopening businesses and public venues in California. UCOP facilities, however, are subject to a number of additional and overlapping workplace requirements that require us to maintain our existing COVID-19 prevention protocols until the university completes implementation of the UC systemwide COVID-19 Vaccination Policy and UCOP vaccination verification tracking tool (estimated completion: July 15th)). We ask all supervisors and managers to assist us by maintaining the current criteria for essential staff working on-site, which is still defined as work that cannot be reasonably done remotely. Although the current UCOP COVID workplace restrictions will remain in place for the next several weeks, exception requests for urgent cases can be sent to [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). You must wait for a decision on your request before coming on-site. You will receive an email notification, and, if approved, you will receive additional information and requirements, including a temporary workspace assignment. If you were granted an approved exception before this email, do not submit another request. The return to on-site operations team continues to work closely with all UCOP locations to refine our phased approach to reoccupying offices. Specific details about our return to on-site operations plan will be shared shortly. As a reminder, Oakland staff may use the Franklin business center (Lobby 2) for brief, on-site work. UCOP staff visiting or working on-site are required to: - Register in iVisitor before coming on-site (Oakland staff only). - Complete the UCOP Screen online survey each day you are scheduled to visit regardless of vaccination status. Do not come in if you have any COVID-19-related symptoms. - Despite the state's recent lifting of the requirement for mask wearing among fully vaccinated individuals, UCOP will still require you to wear a face-covering while on-site even if fully vaccinated and follow physical distancing protocols until our vaccination verification tracking tool is implemented. We appreciate your patience as we work through the many details associated with future increases in occupancy at UCOP locations. Please contact the COVID-19 response team with questions at [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). Thank you, Thera Kalmijn Exec. Director, UCOP Operations UCOP COVID-19 Response Team Lead Steve Murray Director, Building and Administrative Service Center Information about required COVID-19 vaccinations for UCOP employees June 10, 2021 Dear UCOP colleagues: As campuses prepare for in-person instruction in the fall, and as we here at UCOP begin to move closer to returning to the office, I want to update you on the approach UC is taking regarding required COVID-19 vaccinations for faculty, staff and students. For the past several weeks, President Drake has been consulting with chancellors, Academic Senate representatives, UC Health leaders and other university stakeholders on a draft COVID-19 vaccination policy, and we expect to issue a final policy along with systemwide implementation guidelines by July 15th. Although the policy is still being finalized, in order to give everyone as much time as possible to comply with it, I wanted to share with you the direction we are taking: - For the safety and well-being of the entire university community, the policy will require, with few exceptions, that all students, faculty and staff be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus before they will be allowed on campus or in a facility or office. - Individuals will be required to show proof of vaccination, and UC locations are preparing for how they will record individual vaccination status. - For campuses, compliance with the policy will be required two weeks before faculty, staff and students are expected to be on campus for the fall term. - For UCOP staff, compliance with the policy will be required two weeks before you are expected to be onsite at any of our offices. - The policy will allow for narrow medical exemptions consistent with CDC guidance and manufacturer labeling on contraindications and precautions. As with other policies, and, in the case of employees as required by federal and California law, faculty, staff and students will also be eligible to request accommodations based on disability or religious belief. - Those with approved exemptions or accommodations may return to their location with the expectation that they will remain masked in all public settings, and comply with the local testing plan, which at a minimum may be weekly. - Employees who choose not to be vaccinated, and have no approved exemption, potentially put others at risk and may face disciplinary actions. - I will be back in touch within the next few weeks to share the final policy with you, as well as additional information about how we will implement it for UCOP locations. Thank you for your partnership in helping to keep our community healthy. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer UCOP Update - Vaccine Program, Return to On-site Operations Timing, and the Future of Work March 24, 2021 Dear colleagues, I am following up on my [last message](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/announcements.html#mar12) with an update on the UCOP vaccine program, our planning and timeline for returning to the office, and our efforts to plan for a future way of working that best meets the needs of our staff and organization. UCOP Vaccine Program Update To help UCOP employees get their vaccinations as soon as possible, we are adopting the state's program, which utilizes retail pharmacies and other local providers, and are encouraging UCOP employees to secure a vaccine appointment by registering on [myturn.ca.gov](https://myturn.ca.gov/) or through your health care provider. More and more vaccines are becoming available on a daily basis, and you are encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as you are eligible. Those essential on-site and age 65+ staff who were invited to receive a vaccine through UCOP's vaccine programs with UC San Francisco and UC Riverside should schedule first-dose appointments immediately if they have not yet done so and plan to receive second doses through the program. If you have questions, email [UCOP-COVID19-Vaccine@UCOP.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Vaccine@UCOP.edu). Return to On-site Operations Planning is underway for returning to on-site operations, which may vary by UCOP location. - For Oakland, we must complete the Franklin building renovations before we can return to on-site operations. Therefore, we anticipate a phased return to on-site operations date of no sooner than August 1 for the Franklin-Broadway offices, even if Alameda County public health officials allow for office openings sooner than this. - The return to on-site operations team is working closely with the UCPath Center, UC Washington Center (UCDC), the UCOP Sacramento office, and UC Press to develop return to on-site operations plans and more information will be communicated when it's available. We anticipate that return to on-site operations in these locations will be dependent on public health guidance and be no sooner than July 1. Future of Work Like many organizations, UCOP is considering how the needs of our workforce have changed based on our experience working through the pandemic. This is an opportunity to align UCOP's workforce and culture with UC values and modernize the way we work. To spearhead this effort, we recently launched a cross-functional UCOP Future of Work task force to evaluate short- and long-term options for working in on-site, remote, and hybrid models. Future ways of working must consider needs from three perspectives - the overall organization, the department/team, and the individual. As part of their work, the task force will conduct a UCOP staff survey to gather input for consideration. To maintain anonymity, the survey invitation will come from our partners Willis Towers Watson and an article will be published in Link. Once it has completed its work, the task force will present recommendations to me, President Drake and the division leaders in May 2021. If you have questions, please email [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). Take care and stay well.Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer It's been an extraordinary year - Thank you March 12, 2021 Dear colleagues, It has been a year since we began our journey through the COVID-19 pandemic with most of us working remotely and a small number of staff on-site to support essential operations. Who could have imagined that most of us would still be doing so a year later when we left our offices in March of 2020? Make no mistake about it, it has been a challenging year. We've faced this unprecedented global health crisis and have exhibited grace under fire, tackled extraordinary challenges, celebrated successes, and forged new ways of getting things done. Through it all, we've stuck together, helping and supporting each other, and proving just how adaptable and resilient we are. I am grateful to have such a wonderful community of colleagues and I sincerely appreciate your partnership and dedication to the important work we do. On behalf of the entire UCOP leadership team, thank you for your perseverance, flexibility, team spirit, and mission focus despite everything you're juggling. I also want to thank everyone who is working tirelessly to support the UCOP community and who make it possible for the rest of us to work from home and stay connected to each other and our families. It is also important to take a moment to recognize those of you who have been impacted by the COVID-19 virus directly or through a loved one. My heart goes out to those who have suffered a loss during this time. As we look toward the future, there are reasons to be optimistic. The delivery of vaccines is underway across California, the country and the global community. It's encouraging to see more and more people vaccinated each week, and that the number of COVID-19 cases are decreasing in some counties. With this comes a renewed focus on when we'll return to the office and how we'll work in the future. The UCOP team is working on a plan informed by input from many of you, and updates will be provided in the near future. Thank you for all that you do. It is reassuring to know that we can rely on each other as we continue this journey together. Please continue to take care of yourself and your loved ones and be safe.Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer UCOP launching COVID-19 vaccine program for staff FEBRUARY 10, 2021 Dear colleagues, I hope you are well and are continuing to take care of yourself. I am writing to update you on the program UCOP will employ to provide staff COVID-19 vaccinations. I know there is a variety of emotions surrounding vaccinations \u2014 excitement, relief, concerns, etc. \u2014 as well as questions about when and how vaccinations will be administered for the UCOP community. We are committed to keeping you informed.* The COVID-19 vaccine rollout across California and the nation continues to be a very dynamic situation, with a constantly evolving vaccine supply and public health guidance that must be adapted to statewide and regional circumstances. University of California Health (UCH) has been a key partner to the state in administering the COVID-19 vaccine to UC health care workers, UC patients over 65+, as well as eligible staff groups, which are determined by UCH leadership in coordination with the California Department of Public Health. UCOP is participating in [UC's systemwide vaccination program](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/02/covid-19-vaccination-ucs-progress-and-policy.html) and is now preparing to provide vaccines to our staff based on available supply. Through partnerships with UCSF Health and UC Riverside Health, our vaccine program will start with the following staff members in our Oakland and Riverside locations: - Staff Age 65+: Eligible immediately upon completing registration, dependent on vaccine and appointment availability - Essential on-site staff: Eligible after staff age 65+ have been offered vaccination, dependent on vaccine and appointment availability - All other UCOP staff: Timing to be determined based on public health guidelines and available vaccine supply. Vaccination information by location: Initial information by UCOP location is attached and available on the [UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Program](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/ucop-covid-19-vaccine-program.html) website, where it will be updated when new information becomes available. We are developing vaccination options for our UCDC and UCOP Sacramento locations. While this is good news, it is important to understand how limited vaccine supplies remain. As demand continues to outpace supply, we and other health care providers face the real possibility of running out of vaccines each week. In addition, we are continuing to expand our capacity to provide vaccinations, so that we are prepared to vaccinate greater numbers of people as the vaccine supply and distribution increase. As we work to make the COVID-19 vaccine available to UCOP staff through the UCOP vaccine program, you may also receive opportunities from county sites, your health provider or other sources. You should not hesitate to take advantage of those opportunities should they become available sooner. For the latest information about our UCOP vaccine program, please reference the following: [UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Program](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/ucop-covid-19-vaccine-program.html)website, including eligible employee groups and location-specific information - COVID-19: [Vaccine Information Frequently Asked Interim Policy: SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Program](https://www.ucop.edu/uc-health/_files/sars-cov2-vaccination-program-participation-policy.pdf)(as of 12/14/20) While we strongly encourage all staff to be vaccinated, it is not currently mandated or required. We all want this pandemic to end. A safe and effective vaccine can end the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts believe that at least 70% of people need to be vaccinated before the pandemic will end. In addition to preventing death, by reducing your chances of getting sick with COVID-19 through vaccination, you will also prevent long lasting effects of infection that have been reported. If you are in an eligible group and choose to decline the vaccine when offered by UCOP, you will be asked to complete a form confirming your decision. The UCOP vaccine program is being led and managed by UCOP Operations, and additional information will be communicated as it becomes available. If you have questions about the UCOP COVID-19 Vaccine Program, please email [UCOP-COVID19-Vaccine@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Vaccine@ucop.edu). All inquiries will be treated with confidentiality and sensitivity. Lastly, we are excited to share our partnership with UCR Health to stand up a UCR Health drive-through COVID-19 vaccine clinic to serve UC staff and patients at our UCPath location in Riverside. UCOP staff are working closely with the UCR Health team to plan logistics and avoid disruptions to UCPath operations. We are in the early stages of planning and more detailed information will be provided as it becomes available. Thank you for your continued patience and perseverance in support of UC's mission through your work here at UCOP. Take care, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President, Operations *Information provided in this communication is subject to change based on state and local public health guidance and available vaccine supply. Reduction of UCOP on-site services and staffing extended through March 1, 2021 JANUARY 12, 2021 Dear colleagues, Given the continued increase in COVID-19 cases occurring in our community and for the well-being of the UCOP community, we are extending [the reduction of UCOP on-site services](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/announcements.html#dec10) to March 1, 2021. As a reminder, we have scaled back or suspended the following operational services in Oakland facilities*: - Mail Services - mail service will only be available two days per week on Monday and Wednesday - Facilities Services - building engineering will be on-call and by appointment only - Moves -moves are suspended until at least March 1 - IT Client Services - on-site service will be reduced and continue in-person services by appointment only. On-site services will be limited to managing new and replacement hardware and accessories, hardware repairs, and receipt of returned equipment. - Business Resource Center - will be on-site one day per week on Fridays - Ergonomic equipment - no ergonomic pickups will be available until at least March 1 - Self-service drop-in business center (Oakland lobby 2) - Use of the business center requires a reservation by emailing [buildingservices@ucop.edu](mailto:buildingservices@ucop.edu)to limit use to one person at a time, and allow time between visitors. * UCPath and UCDC are reviewing on-site requirements and will continue to communicate directly to their teams. Sacramento staff are asked to continue to work from home. Managers should continue to work with staff to reduce on-site work and avoid any non-critical office visits. We also ask that managers work with on-site staff to identify work-from-home assignments wherever possible and explore leave options if needed. If managers have questions, they should contact their [UCOP Human Resources business partner](https://www.ucop.edu/local-human-resources/staff-contacts/find-hr-business-partner.html). We appreciate your continued commitment to the UCOP community during these challenging times. Take care and be safe,Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Further reduction of UCOP on-site services and staffing through January 15, 2021 DECEMBER 10, 2020 Dear colleagues, Given the accelerating increase in COVID-19 cases occurring in our community and for the well-being of the UCOP community, we are further reducing UCOP on-site staff and office visits to only the most critical and unavoidable on-site work through at least January 15, 2021. This reduced presence may be extended beyond January 15 if circumstances warrant. By limiting staff on-site and trips to and from the office, we will be in a better position to minimize interactions for those dedicated staff required to be on-site to perform critical functions. If you currently work from home, please continue to do so and do not come to the office unless absolutely necessary. As a result of this reduced presence, we are scaling back or suspending the following operational services in Oakland facilities*: - Mail Services - mail service will only be available two days per week on Monday and Wednesday - Facilities Services - building engineering will be on-call and by appointment only - Moves -moves are suspended until at least January 15 - IT Client Services - on-site service will be reduced and continue in-person services by appointment only. On-site services will be limited to managing new and replacement hardware and accessories, hardware repairs, and receipt of returned equipment. - Business Resource Center - will be on-site one day per week on Fridays - Ergonomic equipment - no ergonomic pickups will be available until at least January 15 - Self-service drop-in business center (Oakland lobby 2) - will remain available for use. Please check availability and limit use to one person at a time by emailing [buildingservices@ucop.edu](mailto:buildingservices@ucop.edu). *UCPath and UCDC are reviewing on-site requirements and will communicate directly to their teams. Sacramento staff are asked to continue to work from home. Managers should work with staff to reduce on-site work and avoid any non-critical office visits.

We appreciate your continued commitment to the UCOP community during these challenging times. Take care and be safe,Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer CA Regional Stay Home Order effective 12/7 DECEMBER 7, 2020 Dear colleagues, On Thursday, December 3, 2020, Governor Newsom announced that California will move to implement a [regional stay home order](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.3.20-Stay-at-Home-Order-ICU-Scenario.pdf) in regions that have less than 15% ICU availability. The governor [implemented the order](https://www.rivcoph.org/Portals/0/Documents/CoronaVirus/December/News/12.5.20_Gov_stay_at_home_order.pdf?ver=2020-12-05-161108-400\u00d7tamp=1607213047143) for all of Southern California and [five Bay Area counties are preemptively implementing](https://covid-19.acgov.org/covid19-assets/docs/press/joint-release-2020.12.04.pdf) the order effective Monday, December 7. The Sacramento area's ICU availability is [currently 18.2%](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/#regional-stay-home-order) and, therefore, Sacramento will likely also implement the new order soon. This more restrictive order will stay in effect for at least three weeks in Southern California and through January 4, 2021 in the Bay Area. The regional stay home order does not change UCOP's COVID-19 prevention plans as our protocols are in alignment with the more restrictive guidelines. Our goal is to support staff wellness by maintaining the minimum occupancy needed to support the University's work. As a result, some operational services will be modified, all departments with essential staff should review their on-site requirements, and additional protective equipment is now available: - All UCOP departments with essential staff on-site: The departments should review operational requirements and reduce on-site presence by reducing staff, days, or hours on-site wherever possible. Supervisors should work with staff to identify work-from-home assignments as appropriate. - Reduced on-site Facilities staff: We will maintain staff to support the core facilities functions (security, mail, janitorial, etc.). Remaining department packing will go forward on schedule. - IT Client Services: IT Service Desk in-person support will remain by [appointment only](mailto:servicedesk@ucop.edu). We have added on-site queuing signage and barriers to support staff in maintaining physical distance. - Face shields and door openers/button pushers: For staff continuing to work on-site, face shields and door openers/button pushers are available. Face shields must be worn with face-coverings (\"masks\") that cover the nose and mouth. Please contact your location's Facilities team for these items. UCOP is working with partners in each location to make regular COVID-19 asymptomatic testing available to on-site staff. If you need testing in the meantime, see [COVID-19 Testing Sites in California](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401) and [District of Columbia COVID-19 Testing Sites](https://coronavirus.dc.gov/testing). Contact your health care provider if you're experiencing symptoms. As a reminder, UCOP offices will be closed for curtailment starting December 23, 2020 through January 4, 2021. These are challenging times and your well-being remains our highest priority. If you have questions regarding your individual or department circumstances, please talk with your manager. I'm grateful for your continued dedication and partnership. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Extension of our remote work and limited on-site operation status OCTOBER 29, 2020 Dear colleagues, I hope you are well and staying healthy. I am writing to update you on our work location status. In consultation with President Drake and UCOP leadership, we have decided that UCOP will extend its current remote work and limited on-site operation status through June 30, 2021. This allows us to get through the winter and spring when we expect flu season and COVID-19 cases to be at their highest. As I am sure you've seen, other large organizations are taking similar measures. We will continue to evaluate and update you on the situation as it evolves. As we continue to navigate the uncertainty of working in the COVID-19 environment, your well-being is our highest priority. We have some great resources and tools available on our [Culture and Connectivity webpage](https://www.ucop.edu/ucop-operations/culture-and-connectivity/), and through a variety of [virtual classes and workshops](https://link.ucop.edu/classes/). Remember, our [Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) and Employee Assistance Program (EAP - UCPath)](https://www.ucop.edu/local-human-resources/op-life/worklife-programs/faculty-staff-assistance-program.html) are available if you need confidential resources. If you have questions regarding your individual or department circumstances, please talk with your manager. Please continue to take care of yourself, your family and those around you, and let us know if there is anything we can do to support you. Thank you again for your continued dedication, good work and partnership. Sincerely,Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Current operation status extended through end of year August 26, 2020 Dear colleagues, I hope everyone is well and staying safe during these extraordinarily challenging and uncertain times. I want to say how much I appreciate everyone's patience, resilience and commitment to keeping the work of the university going. I know how difficult and trying the present circumstances are for all of us. I am writing to update you on our work location status. Currently, most of us are working from home, except limited staff who are providing services considered essential by public health officials for on-site work. County public health officials have not yet approved office buildings for general occupancy and there is no indication of when that might happen. Further, the numbers of COVID-19 cases have not significantly decreased. Therefore, in consultation with UC President Michael V. Drake, M.D. and UCOP leadership, we have decided that UCOP will maintain its current remote work and limited on-site operation status through the end of the calendar year. It is possible we could continue to operate remotely into next year depending on guidance from public health officials. Even though most of us are now planning to work remotely for the rest of the year, this does not change the [systemwide executive order](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/08/2020-21-flu-vaccination-executive-order.pdf) requiring all members of the UC community to receive an influenza immunization before Nov. 1, 2020, or have an approved exemption, if they plan to access a UC facility at any time. It's an important proactive measure to help protect our communities and mitigate the severe burden on health care systems anticipated due to influenza illnesses during the coming fall and winter. I know the uncertainty of working in the COVID-19 environment is unsettling, but your well-being is our highest priority. Resources and tools to help are available on our [Culture and Connectivity](https://www.ucop.edu/ucop-operations/culture-and-connectivity/) webpage. If you have questions regarding your individual or department circumstances, please talk with your manager. Please continue to take care of yourself, your family and those around you, and let us know if there is anything we can do to support you. Thank you again for your continued dedication and partnership. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer COVID-19 symptom screening required for all UCOP office visits starting July 20 July 17, 2020 Dear UCOP colleagues: Although most UCOP staff continue to work remotely, a limited number of staff are working on-site and some staff need to visit the office as part of the Oakland moves or to pick up items. [As mentioned in this week's Link](https://link.ucop.edu/2020/07/14/new-ucop-screen-requirement-starting-july-20/), we are rolling out UCOP Screen, our quick, easy-to-use online self-reporting symptom survey, as part of our new COVID-19 protocols. Effective July 20, 2020, UCOP Screen will be required at all UCOP locations Starting Monday, July 20, 2020, all UCOP staff working or coming on-site for any reason or length of time are required to complete [UCOP Screen](https://ucop.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3JAhjmSFliQmyq1) daily before coming on-site and receive an \" approved\" status from the survey to be admitted to any UCOP facility. UCOP Screen is now available and can be accessed on a computer or mobile device. - Please complete UCOP Screen by reporting symptoms and possible contact with others affected by COVID-19 prior to coming to the office. - An 'APPROVED' status clears you to come on-site on the day the survey is taken only. - UCOP Screen must be completed each day you want to come on-site. - Please be ready to show the confirmation email or a screenshot, if requested by security or the on-site UCOP COVID-19 facilities management coordinator. - A 'NOT APPROVED' status means you cannot come on-site and must contact your supervisor and [UCOP-INCIDENT-REPORT@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-INCIDENT-REPORT@ucop.edu)for next steps. - UCOP Screen data will be stored securely and access will be strictly limited. - To ensure compliance, UCOP Screen survey results will be checked against building security reports. If you are unable to complete UCOP Screen before coming to the office, a station for completing the UCOP Screen survey will be available in the lobby or other designated area at your location. Please bookmark [UCOP Screen](https://ucop.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3JAhjmSFliQmyq1) for easy reference. Reminders: - Do not come on-site if you're experiencing any [COVID-19 Symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)or are feeling sick. - Bring and wear a face covering and follow physical distancing protocols and all pandemic-related facility signage when you are on-site.

For additional questions, please contact [UCOP-COVID19-Response@UCOP.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@UCOP.edu). We appreciate your continued dedication to helping maintain a healthy and supportive work environment. These measures of awareness \u2014 and staying home whenever you have symptoms \u2014 can go a long way to prevent the spread of illness. Thank you, Thera Kalmijn Executive Director, UCOP Operations Oakland offices to resume regular business hours June 8 June 5, 2020 Dear UCOP Colleagues, Since the Alameda County curfew has been lifted, Oakland offices will return to regular operating hours again starting Monday, June 8 for those essential staff working onsite. As a reminder, the rules for occupancy of UCOP facilities during the pandemic still apply: - Please enter your name in iVisitor when you come; - Wear face coverings; - Follow all physical distancing, sanitation and pandemic-related facility signage; - Please do not come in if you have been having any COVID-19-related symptoms or have been in close contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19 in the last 14 days. Thank you.Steven Murray Director, UCOP Building and Administrative Service Center Temporary restrictions on Oakland office hours and services June 2, 2020 Dear Oakland-based colleagues: In light of continuing demonstrations in and around Oakland and the broader SF Bay Area, for the safety of our staff we are temporarily limiting Oakland on-site office hours and some services as follows: - Oakland on-site office hours will be 10:00am \u2014 4:00pm, and only for pre-approved essential staff. - Visits to the office for ergonomic equipment or other reasons are temporarily suspended. - ITCS Service Desk will schedule in-person appointments for urgent issues only, and only by appointment. We continue to closely monitor circumstances, and we will relax these restrictions when conditions allow. We will let everyone know when we return to regular on-site hours. Thanks for your understanding and cooperation, and please stay safe. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Oakland offices closed June 1-2 May 31, 2020 Dear Oakland-based colleagues: In light of the protests and unrest in Oakland over the weekend and out of an abundance of caution for the safety of our staff, we will keep all offices in Oakland closed on Monday, June 1 and Tuesday, June 2. Staff scheduled to work onsite in Oakland on those days should work from home and check in with their supervisor. Given news coverage showing damage to buildings and structures near our Oakland offices, we want to assure you that while our Franklin Street building sustained minor damage, we were able to fully secure the facility and ensure the safety of staff onsite. Our other Oakland locations have not sustained any significant damage. Keeping the offices closed on Monday and Tuesday will allow clean up and repair crews in Oakland to do their work. We will assess the situation on Tuesday afternoon and communicate out whether there will be any further closures to our Oakland offices. As always, please continue to take care of yourself and stay safe. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer An update from EVP/COO Rachael Nava about reoccupying UCOP offices May 28, 2020 With State and County shelter-in-place orders set to expire soon in the counties where we operate, we are working hard to keep you as informed as possible about UCOP's Return to Normal Operations (R2NO). In the coming days, we expect that counties will extend and modify public health orders in order to slowly open sectors of the economy, including office workplaces. In anticipation of reopening, the [May 26 UCOP Link article](https://link.ucop.edu/2020/05/26/ucop-plans-for-return-to-normal-operations-r2no/) on UCOP's Return to Normal Operations announced a four-step phased plan aligned with public health and CDC guidance. Our offices are currently in UCOP Level 1 - Minimum Occupancy, Essential staff only. Our next step will be to move to UCOP Level 2 - Priority Facilities Occupancy - during which we will bring only select staff whose work is more difficult to achieve efficiently from home and those who elect by request to work onsite and gain approval to do so. The UCOP R2NO team will be working with division and department leaders to identify which teams and individuals should have priority or elective access to UCOP locations. Staff will be provided advance notice prior to their return to onsite work date, except staff who due the essential nature of their work may need to return more quickly. For the immediate time being most staff will continue to work from home. All staff who are in the CDC grouping \" [People who need to take extra precautions\"](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html) will continue to work from home and staff with extenuating circumstances not covered in the CDC grouping should speak with their supervisors. Even as some staff return to UCOP office locations, physical distancing requirements and other COVID-19 protocols remain in place, which means the total number of staff UCOP can accommodate onsite is limited to approximately 20 to 30% of full occupancy. In addition, to ensure the Oakland office moves can occur efficiently, the schedule of office construction may also be a factor in determining when departments will return to the office. We will continue to keep you informed as circumstances change. Please stay tuned to work email, UCOP's Link Newsletter, and the [UCOP.edu website](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/) for updates. As always, please continue to take care of yourself and stay safe. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer An important update about UCOP extending its telecommute status April 27, 2020 Dear UCOP colleagues: Earlier today, six Bay Area counties announced they are extending their [shelter-in-place orders](https://www.sfgate.com/news/editorspicks/article/Bay-Area-coronavirus-news-updates-San-Francisco-15228556.php) through the month of May. The orders apply to the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara, as well as the City of Berkeley, whose previous orders were all set to expire on May 3. For employees who work in our Oakland offices, this means we will continue to work remotely at least through May 31. Colleagues in our Sacramento offices will also remain on telecommute status through May. Current expiration dates for shelter-in-place orders in other areas where UCOP operates are as follows, but may also change based on local circumstances: - Washington, D.C. - current order set to expire May 15 - Riverside County - current order set to expire June 19 As a reminder, Governor Newsom's statewide stay-at-home order for California remains in effect with no specified end date. We will continue to keep you informed about UCOP operations and services as circumstances dictate. Please stay tuned to local news, work email and the [UCOP.edu website](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/) for updates. As always, please continue to take care of yourself and stay safe. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Caring for yourself and others \u2014 an update from EVP/COO Rachael Nava April 9, 2020 Dear UCOP colleagues: As we all continue to work from home, developing healthy and supportive work spaces and routines is critical in supporting personal wellness and team culture and connectivity. In the coming weeks, we'll offer more tips and resources to support all UCOP staff during these unusual and challenging times. This week, we'll focus on embracing equity and inclusion, ergonomics at home, and the myStrength app in the section below on UCOP Resources to Support Well-being. Embracing Equity and Inclusion As we continue to work through our changing social norms and new realities, it is imperative we remember to honor and acknowledge our differences and similarities. These unprecedented times require us to be more patient and flexible. We all carry the burden and responsibility to do our part in helping to flatten the curve and support our fellow citizens, co-workers, families, and friends through this global pandemic. As part of UC's response to the coronavirus, the Council of Chief Diversity Officers has prepared guidelines for maintaining supportive and inclusive environments. Please take a moment to review the [Equity and Inclusion During COVID-19](https://diversity.universityofcalifornia.edu/policies-guidelines/covid-19.html) guidance and resources provided by our equity and inclusion leadership. UCOP Resources to Support Well-being UCOP's Culture, Engagement, Diversity and Inclusion and Human Resources teams are pleased to offer new resources to support your well-being. This week, learn how to access the free myStrength app, which offers free, emotional health resources, including strategies for coping with stress during COVID-19. It is provided to all UC employees covered by UC's medical benefits. To access myStrength, you must register through your health insurance plan.

Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President/Chief Operating Officer An important update from EVP/COO Rachael Nava April 2, 2020 Dear UCOP colleagues: I'm writing to share with you [this letter from President Napolitano and chancellors](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/04/president-napolitano-provides-assurances-to-uc-employees-during-these-unprecedented-times.pdf) to the UC community, announcing there will be no COVID-19-related layoffs for career employees through the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2020. We know this is an extremely challenging and stressful time, and we have taken this action to provide staff with some assurance for the next few months during the stay-at-home orders. Currently, Governor Newsom's [statewide stay-at-home order](https://covid19.ca.gov/img/Executive-Order-N-33-20.pdf) remains in effect with no defined end date, and many Bay Area counties have extended their stay-at-home orders through May 3 rd. Accordingly, UCOP will remain on telecommute status with limited on-site operations through at least May 3 rd. Please continue to consult the [UCOP.edu website](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/) for tips and resources about staying healthy and working effectively from home, and if you have specific needs or questions you may send an email to [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu). Thank you for your resilience, partnership, ongoing dedication and good work during these unprecedented and difficult circumstances. I am very proud and grateful to work with such committed and capable colleagues. Please continue to take care of yourself and your loved ones. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President/Chief Operating Officer Update from EVP/COO Rachael Nava on UCOP operations March 20, 2020 Dear UCOP colleagues: The health and well-being of all UCOP staff continue to be our highest priority. Our UCOP teams have been working hard to move many employees to telecommute status, including functions that have never worked remotely. Many departments have been involved in making this rapid transition and we thank you all for your patience and dedication as we work quickly to respond to this evolving situation. These are unprecedented times and I am impressed with how quickly our UCOP community has adapted and found ways to continue to perform the important work of this great university. UCOP Operations Support As we observe the Governor's statewide \"shelter from home\" order, the delivery of some UCOP Operations services have been modified or reduced. [View a list of services and details on modifications or reductions](https://www.ucop.edu/ucop-operations/ucop-operations-and-office-service-level-status.html). What's Coming Up The UCOP COVID-19 Task Force is working on additional guidance and resources including, but not limited to, the following: - Implementing Zoom as the UCOP standard instant messaging tool for direct messaging and group/channel messaging (teams may continue to use Slack as well) - Equipment, ergonomics, and supplies while telecommuting - Culture, connectivity and wellness, including tips for healthy telecommuting - Reimbursement for pre-paid canceled work-related travel, conferences, and other cancellation expenses - Parking and pre-paid transportation programs - UCOP FAQ Please stay safe and healthy, and please stay tuned to work email and the [UCOP.edu website](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/) for updates. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice Update from EVP/COO Rachael Nava on UCOP \"shelter-in-place\" orders March 16, 2020 Earlier today, six Bay Area counties announced [\"shelter-in-place\" orders](https://www.kron4.com/news/6-bay-area-counties-orders-residents-to-stay-at-home-to-reduce-coronavirus-spread/), beginning at midnight tonight (Mar. 16) and remaining in effect at least through April 7. The orders direct everyone to stay inside their homes and away from others as much as possible for the next three weeks as public health officials desperately try to curb the rapid spread of coronavirus across the region. The orders apply to San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Contra Costa and Alameda counties. Accordingly, UCOP offices in Oakland will close at 10:00pm tonight (Mar. 16) and access to Oakland buildings will be restricted to emergency personnel only. The previously announced return-to-work date of Apr. 3 will be extended, and UCOP staff will work remotely through at least Apr. 7, possibly longer depending on guidance from public health officials. Additionally, some UCOP functions may need to operate at reduced service levels. UCPath Center leadership is providing guidance specific to UCPath Center employees, and staff in our Sacramento and Washington, D.C. offices should follow the guidance of local leadership. This is a rapidly evolving situation and we will provide additional updates regarding UCOP operations and services in the days ahead. Please stay tuned to local news, work email and the [UCOP.edu website](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/) for updates. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice Officer Update from EVP/COO Rachael Nava on UCOP operations March 13, 2020 Yesterday, we began our phased transition to teleworking with limited on-site operations continuing for critical functions. This transition will continue over the next week or more. While we still have received no reports of any immediate exposure threat to UCOP, our phased approach supports our staff and broader community by reducing the risk of community spread by minimizing face-to-face interactions, reducing commuting and travel, and increasing social-distancing. We will post these emails and continue to update the new [UCOP Coronavirus Website](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/); please bookmark it and check back often. We are monitoring news of school districts in our primary work locations announcing closures or moves to online learning. UC guidelines for utilizing leave, if necessary, and other [Employee Q&A's are available here](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus/employees.html) . In addition, please for working remotely](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/_files/preparing-to-telecommute.pdf)for UCOP employees. - The UCOP Oakland mail room is observing reduced service for at least two weeks due to USPS and vendor disruptions. Mail will be sorted on Wednesday mornings into departmental boxes in the 6 th floor Franklin mail room. Delivery services such as FedEx and UPS will be collected at the security desk and made available in the mailroom with the regular mail. Departments can send representatives to that location during regular business hours to collect mail. Please contact the Work Management Center at 510-987-6000 if you need a special accommodation or have questions. - The Franklin Garage is being made available temporarily to staff who must be on site in Oakland and don't already have parking. The garage hours will vary over the next several days. [See planned hours and closures](https://link.ucop.edu/2020/03/11/more-oakland-construction-updates/). - Join your colleagues who have already registered for [UCOPAlert](https://www.ucop.edu/safety-and-loss-prevention/ucop-safety-risk/ucop-staff-emergency-procedures/ucop-alert.html), the service that will contact all registered employees in the event of an emergency. Please protect your health with these [tips to prevent illness](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention-treatment.html) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and review this [help from UC health plans](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/03/your-health-plans-response-to-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak.html). If you do feel sick or have been in contact with others who are ill, please notify your manager and ensure you are taking care to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on [What to Do if You're Sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html). Thank you for your continued support and dedication. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer UCOP on telecommute and limited on-site operations status March 11, 2020 Yesterday, we provided updates on steps UCOP is taking to carefully monitor the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak along with guidance about how our campuses, labs, facilities, and UCOP offices can best protect themselves from potential exposure. At present, we have received no reports of any immediate exposure threat to UCOP. However, we have been working closely with the division leaders to prepare UCOP staff to transition to a \"telecommuting with limited on-site operations\" status. Division leaders will be working with managers and supervisors to determine and communicate the plan for each unit. Employees will begin to transition as early as tomorrow, Thursday March 12. The telecommunicating with limited on-site operations status will stay in effect until April 3, 2020 and will be re-evaluated as needed. Please note that during this time period, UCOP staff are expected to be fully available for meetings and responsive to requests during normal UCOP business hours. Our decision to move to a telecommuting with limited on-site operations status supports our staff and broader community by reducing the risk of community spread through minimizing face-to-face interactions, reducing commuting and travel, and increasing social-distancing. Our phased approach quickly reduces risk for our UCOP community by reducing the number of people in the office as quickly as possible so those required to remain in the office for any period of time will also be at lower risk. UCOP Telecommuting and Limited On-Site Operations Plan UCOP will implement a Phased Approach as follows. Group assignments will be finalized and documented by each division leader/chief of staff working in coordination with the UCOP COVID-19 Task Force. - Group 1: Supervisors and staff who are in the [CDC COVID 19 High Risk Populations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#who-is-higher-risk)should work with their supervisors to transition to telecommuting as soon as possible. - Group 2: Staff who are fully equipped with tools and access to perform their function remotely and are approved by their department manager to telecommute should start Thursday, March 12. - Group 3: Supervisors and staff who are not yet equipped to work remotely, but whose function can be performed remotely when equipment is available, will continue to report to the office until they have been equipped to work from home. Supervisors of these teams should also continue to report to the office until their team has been fully transitioned. The goal is to move this group to telecommuting by Friday, March 20. - Group 4: Supervisors and staff required for on-site continuing operations for functions that cannot be done remotely will continue to report to the office as determined by department managers. These departments include but may not be limited to the RASC, BIS, UCPath, some UCOP Operations units, and the PEO. Moving to an on-site/telecommuting rotation model will be evaluated to reduce the number of staff needed on-site at any one time. Staff who may be scheduled to work in shifts with reduced work hours will be eligible for administrative leave according to the [Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and Paid Leave and Remote Work Provisions](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/ucs-response-to-coronavirus.html). - Group 5: Supervisors and staff who are required to periodically support limited on-site operations may be asked to work from home but be available to report to the office on an as needed basis and will have continual access to the office. Division leaders/chiefs of staff will be working with department managers to finalize and document the assignment of staff to the appropriate group in collaboration with the UCOP COVID-19 Task Force in order to implement the transition to telecommuting and limited on-site operations as quickly as possible. Impact to Employees Currently on Leave For staff currently on leave, please contact the UCOP Leaves Manager, Shannon Brooks if you have questions. Important Resources for Telecommuting Transportation and Parking for Staff in Limited On-site Operations and During Transition In order to increase social distancing by reducing use of mass transit during the transition to telecommuting (from March 12 to March 20) and for staff required to work on-site, UCOP will provide parking access at the Franklin office for those who do not currently have access. Alternative options closer to the Kaiser building or taking public transportation to other locations outside Oakland are being assessed and will be communicated when we have additional information. Please contact [UCOP-COVID19-Response@UCOP.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@UCOP.edu) for more information about parking access. Equipping Additional Staff to Work Remotely The UCOP COVID-19 Task Force will work with division chiefs of staff to prioritize the issuance of our limited inventory of laptops and assess other equipment options to support telecommuting. The use of personal computers under specific guidance will be permitted for staff who do not have a UCOP-issued laptop (see [Preparing to Telecommute](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/_files/preparing-to-telecommute.pdf)). Access to the Office During Telecommute and Limited On-Site Operations For the safety of all, any staff requiring access to the Oakland offices who are on telecommute status and are not on the approved limited on-site operations staffing group must notify UCOP Oakland Security by registering their visit in [iVisitor](https://www.visitorentrysystem.com/ivisitor/Login?katfsn=26408667&oblbtd=10) or calling 510-987-9700 before visiting. For the UCDC location, telecommute staff requiring on-site access should notify Mac Hamlett at [mac.hamlett@ucop.edu](mailto:mac.hamlett@ucop.edu). For the UC Sacramento center, telecommute staff requiring on-site access should notify their supervisor. All staff should plan to take what they need before starting to telecommute so visits to the office are minimized. Additional Measures to Increase Social Distancing for On-site Staff To support our staff who are required to be on-site, managers may consider staggering shifts and working to create further physical separation between staff where possible (see Group 4 above). Supervisors and staff on-site are strongly encouraged to conduct all meetings by phone or Zoom regardless of the number of participants. In addition, staff should be aware of proximity to other people during lunch or other breaks and be mindful of contact with hard surfaces in common areas. If you have questions or concerns about a particular issue, please contact us at [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu) . [Contractors, Consultants, Visitors ] All contractors, consultants, and visitors should be notified that our UCOP offices are on telecommute and limited on-site operations status starting March 12 and therefore should not expect to have access to our offices. The primary UCOP department contact should immediately notify their contractors, consultants, and visitors to inform them of our office status and arrange to conduct business remotely. If a department anticipates that any contractors, consultants, or visitors will require access to any UCOP facility during our telecommute and limited on-site operations status, please submit the following information to the [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu) email box as well as to the division leader and division chief of staff: - Name - Company - Phone number (prefer cell number) - UCOP department contact - Dates and times required to be on-site - UCOP building destination (floor and/or room number) - Reason/necessity for visit We acknowledge that this is evolving rapidly and we are working to provide more detailed information as we implement these actions. Please send your questions and comments to [UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu](mailto:UCOP-COVID19-Response@ucop.edu) and we will work to post and aggregate the answers on [https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/](https://www.ucop.edu/coronavirus/). Throughout this time, we expect you to check daily for status updates and information regarding any operational decisions which may change due to the nature of this situation. We thank you in advance for your flexibility and appreciate your willingness to maintain business continuity during this time. Sincerely, Rachael Nava Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Letter to UCOP staff about UCOP guidance and impacts March 10, 2020 UC leadership continues to carefully monitor the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak and is providing guidance about how our campuses, labs, facilities, and UCOP offices can best protect themselves from potential exposure. The outbreak has now impacted a number of communities across California and there is evidence that we are moving to a stage where there is a higher probability of community transmission or spread from person-to-person contact. At present, we have received no reports of any immediate exposure threat to UCOP. Nevertheless, UCOP is already collecting information from managers and supervisors about our positions in order to quickly assess and plan for the potential impact of implementing a work from home environment where feasible, while ensuring critical operations, some of which can only be performed on site (such as UCPath and RASC), continue without disruption. We will communicate additional information on working from home as soon as possible and no later than the end of the week. Systemwide guidance on [ Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and Paid Leave and Remote Work Provisions ](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/ucs-response-to-coronavirus.html) was issued on March 9 to all UC locations. This guidance provides the following temporary emergency options to prepare for the possibility that some UCOP colleagues may become ill, need to care for someone who is ill, or are required to stay home due to community circumstances such as a school closure. This guidance applies for UCOP staff as well: - Employees unable to work due to their own or a family member's COVID-19 illness should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if there are no available leave balances the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. - Employees unable to come to work due to public health or University-required quarantine or self-isolation measures may work remotely if operationally feasible. If remote work is not operationally feasible, employees should use available leave balances, and if there are no available leave balances the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. - Employees unable to come to work due to a COVID-19 day care or school closure that requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if operationally feasible; if remote work is not operationally feasible, employees may use available leave balances including sick leave. - Locations may designate certain employees to work from home. If employees are designated to work from home, it will be considered paid work status. Employees in positions who are directed not to come to work by the University and are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work (as determined by the location) may be allowed up to 14 days of paid administrative leave. Locations may determine which positions to designate, provided that all health care workers are considered exempt from this category of designation. - Academic appointees who do not accrue sick and/or vacation leave and who are not otherwise eligible for paid medical leave under applicable provisions of the Academic Personnel Manual will receive up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover absences as described above. These measures are subject to change as the situation evolves, such as if the need to extend the availability of paid administrative leave becomes necessary. The President has advised all UC locations to avoid all non-essential work travel and some [ international restrictions](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/letter-from-president-napolitano-march-5-2020.pdf) are in place; employees who travel for work should [register](https://ehs.ucop.edu/away/#/trip/detail) to ensure they are covered by UC travel insurance in the case of an emergency. Travelers booked through our online program, Connexxus, are automatically registered for the travel insurance. As of today, UCOP is putting this additional guidance into place for UCOP staff to help limit the potential spread of infection to other areas. We encourage finding alternate means of conducting business. Domestic travel: UCOP recommends against all non-essential university-sponsored domestic travel, particularly by air. If travel is deemed essential for the university, and business cannot be conducted via alternative methods, please consider the following: - The employee's own current personal health condition - Current community spread of destination location - The possibility that a 14-day self-isolation period may be required if the destination location becomes of heightened concern per local, state, or federal public agencies. UCOP recommends the same considerations for personal domestic travel, including possible 14-day self-isolation. International travel: In addition to the President's UC-wide guidance on international travel, UCOP is restricting all non-essential international travel to all other international destinations. Any exceptions for essential travel require pre-approval confirmed in writing via email from the employee's Division Leader. Meetings and Visitor Guidance UCOP is following the [CDC guidance on mass gatherings and large events](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/gatherings.html). **Please note: UCOP-hosted meetings scheduled to take place before April 30 with 150 participants or more regardless of location should be cancelled or postponed. Any exceptions require pre-approval confirmed in writing via email from the Division Leader. In addition, UCOP encourages meeting organizers to include [Zoom technology](https://www.ucop.edu/information-technology-services/services/ucop-it-services/collaboration-zoom-sharepoint-videoconference/zoom-audio-video-web-conferencing.html) for meetings of any size in order to avoid travel and improve social distancing, even within UCOP. Questions or issues regarding Zoom should be directed to the UCOP IT Service Desk at 510-987-0457. If meetings are held in person, attendees should be reminded of personal hygiene practices to help them stay healthy and limit the potential for community transmission. Ensure easy access to handwashing facilities and, where possible, make available alcohol-based sanitizers. Inviting outside visitors to any UCOP location is discouraged and meetings should instead be done by phone, email or other means. This also applies to consultants and contractors, especially those that travel to UCOP locations by air. Staying Healthy In the meantime, please take heed of the following advice: - Employees who are sick should stay home until their symptoms resolve. Be aware that typical COVID-19 symptoms include sore throat, fever, and dry cough. - Follow simple precautions such as thorough handwashing to prevent the spread of disease, and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Use your arms, elbows, tissues or other means than your hands when touching public surfaces such as doors, buttons, railings, etc. Refrain from shaking hands and wash hands thoroughly before and after transporting from place to place. Ongoing Updates and Emergency Alerts As things are changing quickly, please use the following resources for ongoing updates and emergency messages: - UCOP website: In addition to email messages and the [Link e-newsletter](https://link.ucop.edu/), we are using the [UCOP website](https://www.ucop.edu/)to provide UCOP employees updates about coming to work and other important UCOP-specific information. Please check the website's home page regularly for updates. - UCOP Alert: In the event of an emergency, a message will be sent through UCOP Alert. If you are not already signed up, [please sign up here](https://link.ucop.edu/2020/02/24/will-your-phone-know-its-ucopalert-calling/).
