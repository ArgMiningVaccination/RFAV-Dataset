Vaccines could help reduce this risk. However, ICP do not always receive or are reimbursed for the specific vaccinations on which they are dependent in the Netherlands. This research aims to gain insights into the current challenges in the vaccination process of ICP in the Netherlands. Moreover, it aims to explore potential solutions for these challenges and the ideal vaccination process.Methods: Twelve semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders were conducted. Partly based on the challenges found by the Council for Health and Society (RVS) and the Dutch National Health Care Institute (ZIN) an interview guide was developed.Results: Several newly emerged challenges were identified: fair reimbursement for the efforts of stakeholders; circular reasoning of vaccine reimbursement and guidelines; suboptimal translation from guidelines to practice and no smooth-running infrastructure. Most challenges corresponded with those stated by the RVS and ZIN. Affordability and knowledge deficit in healthcare providers and patients were the most important challenges. Rarely the same solutions were mentioned, and no ideal vaccination process emerged.Conclusions: The various challenges in the vaccination process of ICP in the Netherlands implies the difficulty to solve the problem. It is recommended to focus on solving the most important challenges. A potential solution is to adjust the GVS registration process to make it easier for the pharmaceutical industry to apply for reimbursement towards various high-risk groups. Additionally, vaccination should have a more prominent role in the education of healthcare providers. Furthermore, stakeholders need to cooperate more to solve the reimbursement and guidelines issue. |Original language||English| |Article number||100340| |Number of pages||9| |Journal| Keywords - Immunocompromised patients - Infectious diseases - Vaccination - The Netherlands - Challenges - Qualitative research "}
