[Naturopathic medicine](https://naturemed.org/what-is-naturopathic-medicine/) emphasizes the importance of considering and addressing root causes of medical ailments. A naturopathic doctor (ND) is dedicated to helping their patients achieve improved health and quality of life through tailored diets, lifestyle modifications, and recommendations that best suit the patient's specific health and lifestyle needs. The connection between naturopathic doctors and their [patients](https://naturemed.org/patients/) is a mutually-beneficial relationship of education and healing.

By understanding the big picture of their health, patients can develop new strategies to maintain a healthier lifestyle. Naturopathic medicine strongly believes in the tenet of \"first, do no harm,\" which emphasizes non-invasive treatments for a range of health issues. Patients often work with the guidance of a licensed naturopathic doctor to combine dietary and lifestyle changes, herbal supplementation, and other gentle therapies with conventional medical remedies. This cautious, holistic approach helps ensure the treatment plan is tailored to each person's specific needs. Naturopathic medicine is regulated differently in each state.

Dr. Ashok Bhandari is a naturopathic physician based out of Bellevue, Washington, specializing in regenerative sports medicine and is a highly sought-after doctor and educator in the field of natural medicine. He is on a mission to bring effective, cause-oriented, restorative medicine to the masses. Though specializing in regenerative sports medicine in clinical practice, Dr. Bhandari places a heavy emphasis on individualized diet and lifestyle modifications. He believes that all treatments must be built on top of this strong foundation. The Institute for Natural Medicine's innovative new model for a two-year Naturopathic Primary Care Residency provides residency with a sustainable approach to funding. Each resident receives training in all aspects of a successful ND practice, including medical support, office tasks, billing, leadership, business training, and most importantly, mentoring, shadowing, and casework as a naturopathic physician. This is a rapidly growing program that has the potential to significantly grow throughout the United States with donor support. We believe that good health starts at a young age.
