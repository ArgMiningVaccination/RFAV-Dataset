ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES. Among potential etiologic factors for atopic manifestations, infant vacci- nations have recently been discussed. We evaluated in a prospective design whether infants who were unvaccinated or vaccinated according to incompletevaccination schedules in the rst 6 months of age were at decreased risk foreczema and recurrent wheeze in the rst year of life. METHODS. Information on vaccinations against diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis, tetanus; Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine; and eczema and recurrent wheeze was collected by repeated questionnaires in 2764 families participating in theKOALA Birth Cohort Study in the Netherlands. A standard vaccination schedulereferred to 3 diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis, tetanus, and Haemophilus influen- zaetype b vaccinations in the rst 6 months with the rst given in months 1 to 3; an incomplete vaccination schedule was dened as any other vaccination sched- ule. Exclusion criteria were prematurity (gestational age /H1102137 weeks) and congen- ital abnormalities related to immunity (such as Down syndrome). Multiple logisticregression models were tted to adjust for confounding factors. RESULTS. During the rst year of life, the incidence of eczema was 23% (584 of 2537 infants) and of recurrent wheeze, the incidence was 8.5% (203 of 2402 infants). At age 6 months, 1969 (77%) of 2545 infants had been vaccinated according to astandard schedule, 393 (15%) vaccinated according to an incomplete schedule,and 182 (7%) never vaccinated. Compared with infants with standard vaccination schedules, infants with incomplete schedules did not differ signicantly in eczema risk or recurrent wheeze. This was also true for infants who had never beenvaccinated.www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/ peds.2006-1479 doi:10.1542/peds.2006-1479 Key Words condence intervalIgE\u2014immunoglobulin EDPT\u2014 diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus Accepted for publication Aug 16, 2006 Address correspondence to Ischa Kummeling, MSc, Department of Epidemiology, Care and Public Health Research Institute, MaastrichtUniversity, PO Box 616, 6200 MD, \u00a9 2007 by theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics PEDIATRICS Volume 119, Number 2, February 2007 e367 at Universiteit Maastricht on December 22, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from CONCLUSION. This study shows that the risk of eczema or recurrent wheeze at 1 year of age does not differ be- tween infants with different vaccination status at the ageof 6 months. ATOPIC ECZEMA IS the most common atopic disease in infancy, affecting up to one third of children in Western societies.1The presence of atopic eczema has been reported to be associated with an increased risk ofwheeze and asthma later in life. 2 Among potential etiologic factors, vaccinations have recently been discussed. Two mechanisms have beenproposed by which vaccinations could affect the devel-opment of atopic disease: they may have direct allergy-inducing immune effects or prevent possible protective effects of natural infections. 3,4Epidemiologic evidence for an association between vaccinations and atopy de- velopment is inconsistent.4-26Some caution is needed, because some studies were hampered by small numbersof unvaccinated children, and some others were cross-sectional, in which, by design, the possibility of reversecausation exists. Also, the possibility of confounding by contraindication is a concern in interpreting results. Mo-tives for not vaccinating are likely to be health related,which may result in confounding by contraindication ifthese health-related problems are associated with atopicdisease but are not usually described in these studies. 27 The prospective KOALA Birth Cohort Study in the Netherlands includes a large proportion of infants who are completely unvaccinated ( n/H11005182 [7%]) at age 6 months, because their parents opted for deviating fromthe recommended vaccination schedule. KOALA is (in Dutch) an acronym for Child, Parent and Health: Life-style and Genetic Constitution. The present reportprospectively evaluates whether infants who were un-vaccinated or vaccinated according to an incompletevaccination schedule in the rst 6 months of age were atdecreased risk for eczema or recurrent wheeze in therst year of life compared with infants who were com-pletely vaccinated. We also present parental motives fordeviating from the standard vaccination schedule. METHODS Study Population The KOALA Birth Cohort Study started in October2000. 28Participants were recruited in the southern prov- inces of the Netherlands from 2 sources. First, healthy pregnant women at 34 weeks of gestation participatingin the Pregnancy-Related Pelvic Girdle Pain Study, acohort study, 29were asked to participate in the KOALA Study (\"conventional subcohort\"). These women hadbeen recruited through midwife practices at 12 to 16weeks of gestation (and were, therefore, not selected onthe basis of pelvic pain symptoms). Second, pregnantwomen with so-called \"alternative\" lifestyles were re- cruited through several specic recruitment channels,that is, anthroposophic doctors and midwives, anthro-posophic under-5 clinics, Steiner schools, posters andflyers in organic food shops, and magazines specialinterest homeopathy, anthroposophy, andantivaccine; Steiner with specic theories and practices onhealth, education, art, architecture, and \"biodynamic\"agriculture. A total of 2834 participants were included inthe KOALA study, of whom 2343 were found throughthe Pregnancy-Related Pelvic Girdle Pain Study and 491through the specic recruitment channels. Exclusion cri-teria in the present study were prematurity (gestationalage/H1102137 weeks) and congenital abnormalities related to immunity (such as Down syndrome). The study wasapproved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Univer-sity Maastricht/Academic Hospital Maastricht. All of theparticipants had signed informed consent and completedthe rst questionnaire at the third trimester of preg-nancy. Exposure and Follow-up In the Netherlands, during the time of the study, infantsin their rst 6 months were vaccinated against diphthe- ria, pertussis (with whole cell pertussis vaccine), polio-myelitis, tetanus (DPPT) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) at 2, 3, and 4 months of age. More specically,before March 2003, this concerned a combined DPPTvaccination and a separate Hib vaccination given simul-taneously. From March 2003 onward, a combinedDPPT-Hib vaccination was given. In this study, the com-bined diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus/polio vaccinationwith a separate Hib vaccination (as used before March2003) was considered as 1 DPPT-Hib vaccination at thesame time and is called \"DTTP-Hib.\" A minority of Dutchparents opt for deviating from the standard vaccinationschedule and, for example, omit the pertussis compo- nent from the DPPT vaccine or postpone the rst vacci-nations to a later age; some even refrain from all vacci-nations. Vaccinations in the rst 6 months of life were assessed by questionnaire when the infants were 7 months ofage. The questions were phrased as follows: \"Until now,has your child received the standard vaccinations?\"(namely DTTP-Hib vaccinations at 2, 3, and 4 months).Answering options were as follows: (1) yes; (2) no, my infant received vaccinations but according to anothervaccination schedule; or (3) no, my infant received novaccinations. Then, the age of the rst vaccination wasasked for. We divided infants in 3 groups: (1) vaccinatedaccording to a standard schedule (standard DPPT-Hibvaccinations, the rst vaccination given in months 1-3);(2) vaccinated according to an incomplete schedule (anyother schedule); or (3) never vaccinated until the age of e368 KUMMELING et al at Universiteit Maastricht on December 22, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from 6 months. Infants were regarded as vaccinated if they had been vaccinated at least once. We veried the pa-rental reported history of vaccinations in a random sam-ple of 300 subjects from the alternative subcohort byretrieving their vaccination records at the Dutch Vacci- nation Administration Ofce. Using these records, amedical student who was blinded for the parentally re-ported vaccination data determined by which vaccina-tion schedule the infants had been vaccinated. A total of73% of infants could be found in the records of theDutch Vaccination Administration Ofce, and the paren-tal reported history was similar to the information in themedical charts in 89% of these cases (notably, all 78infants who were not vaccinated according to the paren- tal report were not vaccinated according to the vaccina-tion records either, and 86 [91%] of 94 case subjectswho were standard vaccinated according to parents wereconrmed by the vaccination records). Eczema development in the rst year was assessed by questionnaire. At ages 7 and 12 months, parents wereasked whether their child had ever had an itchy rashthat was coming and going in the past months. If thisquestion was answered afrmatively at least once, in-fants were classied as having developed eczema in therst year of life. Infants for whom only diaper rash, rasharound the eyes, and/or scalp scaling was reported werenot regarded as having developed eczema. Wheeze was also asked for in the 7- and 12-month postpartum ques-tionnaires. At ages 7 and 12 months, parents were askedwhether their child ever had showed symptoms ofwheeze and how many attacks in the past months. \"Re-current wheeze\" was dened as a reported presence ofwheezing with /H113504 attacks ever in the rst year. Statistical AnalysisMissing data in the questionnaires were treated as miss-ing in the analyses and are presented as \"unknown\" inthe tables. Multiple logistic regression analyses wereused to adjust for potential confounders by simulta-neously including the following covariates in the regres-sion models (all for the rst 6 months of life and denedas in Table 1): gender; atopic manifestations suchas asthma, pet or house dust mite allergy, hay fever,eczema, and/or food allergy; number of older siblings;breastfeeding duration; attending care facilities; pets;exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS); anti-biotics use by mother during lactation; and oral antibi-otic use of infant. Because some previous studies indicated that associ- ations between exposures and atopic outcomes were limited to groups with increased inherited propensity for developing atopic disease, 30,31we rst tested the possibil- ity of an interaction between vaccination status and parental or sibling's history of atopy. Because none ofthese interaction terms were statistically signicant, theyTABLE 1 Characteristics of the Study Population for the Total Cohort, Stratied by Subcohort Characteristic Total Cohort (N/H110052764) N %a Male 51.0 604 21.9Both 8.9 /H113502 siblings, one or both atopic 159 6.0 Unknown 121 Breastfeeding at 6 mo of age Yes, months 1-4 exclusive BF 622 24.6Yes, months 1-4 nonexclusive BF 441 months 39.4Never breastfeeding 410 16.2Unknown Yes 831 32.5No 1724 67.5Unknown 209 45.7No 1387 54.3Unknown 209 Exposure to ETS in rst 6 mo Yes 294 11.8No 2197 88.2Unknown 273 Antibiotic exposure through breastfeeding in rst 6 mo Yes 262 9.5No 2161 90.5Unknown 341 Antibiotic exposure through oral medication in rst 6 mo Yes 489 19.9No 1973 80.1Unknown 302 Vaccinations in rst 6 months Standard vaccination schedule 1969 77.4Incomplete vaccination schedule b 393 15.4 Never vaccinated 182 7.2Unknown 220 Eczema in rst year No 1953 77.0Yes 584 23.0Unknown 227 Recurrent wheeze in rst year No 2199 91.5Yes 203 8.5Unknown 362 aData exclude missing respondents. bThis includes delayed schedule or alternative composition of vaccine.

Separate analyses of the conventional versus alternative subco-hort or boys versus girls showed that the key ndingswere similar within these groups. Therefore, we com-bined all of the infants in the nal analyses, adjusting for \"subcohort.\" Results are presented as unadjusted andadjusted odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% con-dence intervals (CIs). RESULTS In the present study, 3 children were excluded becauseof Down syndrome and 67 for prematurity (gestationalage/H1102137 weeks), resulting in 2764 participants. Of these, follow-up data on /H113501 health outcome until age 1 year were available for 90.3% ( n/H110052496), which was 89.1% (n/H110052036) of 95.8% ( n/H11005460) of the alternative subcohort. About half of the infants had nonatopic parents; one third had 1 nonatopic older sibling, and 10% had 1 atopic older sibling (Table 1). Most traditional risk factorswere equally present in both subcohorts, but in thealternative subcohort, antibiotic exposure through med-ication was less present than in the conventional subco-hort. By the age of 6 months, 1969 (77.4%) of 2545infants had been vaccinated according to a standardschedule, 393 (15%) according to an incomplete sched-ule, and 182 (7.2%) had never been vaccinated. Only 54.6% of the alternative compared with 95.5% of theconventional subcohort was vaccinated according to thestandard schedule. In total, 584 of 2537 infants (23.0%)were classied as having had eczema in the rst year oflife (this was 23.6% in the conventional and 20.4% inthe alternative subcohort). Of these 584 infants witheczema, 483 (83%) had no reported recurrent wheeze;55 (9%) also had reported recurrent wheeze, and for 46infants, information on recurrent wheeze was unavail-able. Recurrent wheeze was reported in 203 (8.5%) of2402 infants (this was 9.2% in the conventional and5.1% in the alternative subcohort). Of these 203 infantswith recurrent wheeze, 143 (70%) had no eczema, andfor 5 infants, information on eczema was unavailable. Ofall infants with recurrent wheeze, 67% had used specicwheeze or asthma medication before 6 months old ( /H9252 2-adrenergic or steroid inhalant therapy).Compared with infants vaccinated according to the standard schedule, infants who were vaccinated accord- ing to incomplete schedules at age 6 months did notdiffer signicantly in eczema risk (adjusted OR: 1.24;95% CI: 0.95-1.62; Table 2). This was also true forinfants who had never been vaccinated at age 6 monthscompared with infants vaccinated according to the stan-dard schedule (adjusted OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 0.85-2.00).The risk for recurrent wheeze did not differ signicantlyin infants with incomplete vaccination schedules com-pared with infants with standard schedules (adjustedOR: 1.38; 95% CI: 0.93-2.06). Again, this was also truefor had never been vaccinated (adjusted OR:0.76; 95% CI: 0.32-1.82). To exclude potential between vaccinations and eczema or wheeze, werestricted our analyses to infants at risk for a rst episode of eczema or recurrent wheeze after 6 months of age (byexcluding infants who had eczema [ n/H11005447] or recur- rent wheeze [ n/H11005107] onset in the same period as vaccinations had been given, namely, the rst 6months). The ORs for eczema did not change muchcompared with those in Table 2 (adjusted OR for incom-plete vaccination schedules: same was true for the association betweenrecurrent wheeze and having never been vaccinated(adjusted OR for no vaccinations: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.34-2.87); but when done for incomplete vaccination sched-ule, the OR moved slightly toward the 1 (adjusted OR forincomplete vaccination schedules: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.51-1.80). We tested the possibility of interaction betweenvaccination status and a parental or siblings' history ofatopic manifestations in the multivariate analyses. Noneof these tests showed a statistically signicant interaction(P/H11022.36). Illness of the infant was only rarely the motive to refrain from all vaccinations in the rst 6 months; this decision was more often based on beliefs with regard toa more natural development of the immune system, fearof adverse effects, and/or religion or life philosophy (Ta-ble 3).

Our study has the advantage ofbeing population based, with relatively short intervalsbetween subsequent follow-up questionnaires, whichdecreases the possibility of recall bias. The standard vac-cination schedule in the Netherlands is not very compli-cated, and vaccination history may be reliably obtainedusing questionnaires. Nevertheless, we compared a sub- set of the parental responses to the information con-tained in medical charts and found that nearly all of thevaccination data based on medical charts to be reflectedby the parental responses. We are fairly condent aboutthe validity when parents report that the infant was notvaccinated. First, parents have most often well-ex-pressed beliefs for not vaccinating; and second, the val-idation by the vaccination records showed 100% agree-ment. By contrast, if parents reported that the infant wasstandard vaccinated, this was not always conrmed bythe vaccination records. The vaccination records dependon reporting of each vaccination by the infant welfarecenter, and we cannot rule out that vaccinations were incompletely reported to the vaccination administration;however, because the validation was performed in thealternative subcohort where underreporting may bemore prevalent than in the conventional subcohort, wethink that misclassication is of minor effect on theresults. Follow-up rates were high, which would have limited potential bias with regard to baseline characteristics oroutcomes. We showed that parents mainly choose todeviate from the standard vaccination schedule becauseof certain (philosophical) beliefs. This stresses that, atleast in our study, motives to refrain from vaccinationsare unlikely to be health related, which limits the pos-sibility of confounding by contraindication or reversecausation. \"Fear of side effects like allergy\" was often thereason to refrain from all of the vaccinations, and onemay argue that this is a potential risk for confounding bycontraindication. This would, however, only be the case if fear of adverse effects was associated with an increasedrisk of eczema or wheeze by a family history of allergy,which was included as a potential confounder in all ofour analyses. We showed previously that some prudent lifestyle characteristics, among others, vaccinations, dif-fered between atopic and nonatopic families, dependingon whether atopic manifestations were present in par-ents or older siblings. 32Therefore, we considered a pa- rental and siblings' history of allergy as separate poten- tial confounders in all of the analyses. \"Infant's illness\"was often a motive for alternative vaccination schedulesbut rarely for no vaccination, which also indicates that potential reverse causation is limited. Several potential limitations merit consideration. In- fant eczema and recurrent wheeze at age 1 year may befairly unspecic for atopy. In individuals with an atopicconstitution, the underlying mechanism of developingeczema is often dominated by an immunoglobulin E(IgE) Specic IgE or totalserum IgE levels are, however, only weakly associated with atopic symptoms like eczema and wheeze. 33There- fore, we evaluated clinical symptoms and used the term \"eczema\" instead of \"atopic eczema.\" Our denitions ofeczema and recurrent wheeze were based on questionsadapted from International Study of Asthma and Aller- gies in Childhood questionnaires and included generallyaccepted characteristics, like a chronically relapsingcourse and an itchy rash (eczema) or recurrent symp-toms (wheeze). The fact that the majority of wheezecomplaints had been acknowledged by medical doctors(67% of infants with reported recurrent wheeze hadbeen using wheeze or asthma medication) maystrengthen the validity of our measure. Second, parentswho object to vaccinations could also have a different way of labeling atopic complaints. Differences in report-ing eczema or wheeze symptoms could also have oc-curred between the conventional and alternative subco-hort. Our ndings conrm the ndings of some other au- thors, although they were observed in older children.Diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT)-vaccinated childrenwere not afflicted more than nonvaccinated childrenTABLE 3 Parental Motives for Deviating From the Dutch Standard Vaccination Schedule Motive Incomplete Vaccination Schedule ( n/H11005393) No Vaccinations ( n/H11005182) n % n % Infant's illness 109 27.7 8 4.4 Preference for natural development of immune system 93 23.7 161 88.5Fear of adverse effects like allergy or other 73 18.6 103 58.2Doctor promotes restriction of vaccinations 23 5.9 63 34.6Religion or life philosophy 23 5.9 99 54.4Other 132 33.6 54 29.7 Percentages do not add to 100% because of the possibility of checking /H110221 item.

In contrast, authors of a Dutch retrospective study reported pertussis vaccination to be associated with lower risk of eczema in 6-year-old children. 17In this study, 39 of 44 infants classied as not vaccinated for pertussis had no vaccination at all, and pertussis-vacci-nated infants were also DPT vaccinated. Therefore, thecomparison made in this study would seem to reflect DPPT-vaccinated children versus completely unvacci-nated children. A cross-sectional survey in children aged3 to 18 years 15showed ever-eczema and current wheeze to be lower in partially vaccinated and completely un- vaccinated children. However, because of its cross-sec-tional design, the results of this study should be inter-preted with causation because of the possibility of reverse causation. In contrast, increased prevalence ofeczema in DPPT-vaccinated children aged 0 to 5 yearswas found in a prospective cohort study in New Zealandwith only 23 completely unvaccinated children. 8The authors of this study acknowledged that they had not been able to adjust simultaneously for all of the potentialconfounders because of the small numbers involved. CONCLUSION Our study shows that the risk of eczema or recurrentwheeze at the age of 1 year does not differ betweeninfants with different vaccination statuses at age 6months.
