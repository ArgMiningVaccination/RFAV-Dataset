Estimates of the use of traditional/complementarymedicine vary between countries, with about 10 per cent of the UK population reportinguse in the previous year, up to 20 per cent in Canada, 60 per cent in Hong Kong and 76 percent in Singapore. In countries such as Vietnam and China where traditional/complementarymedic ine is an integral part of the health system, as many as one-third of patients receive traditional medicine. In Ghana a majority of people rely on traditional medicine systems, while in Indi a 70 per cent of the population relies on traditional medicine for primary care. However, there are few estimates of the number of traditional medicine practitioners worldwide. In some countries practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine far outnumber c onvention almedical practitioners (South Africa, Ghana), whereas in others their numbers are comparable (India, China, Vietnam) and in some traditional medicine practitioners are a distinct minority (Europe, Australia and North America). Many practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine practise without qualification or w ithout adequate training. In response to the situation, the World Health Organization (WHO) h as recommended that governments develop national policies that include legislation and r egulation of practice, and of education, training and licensing. In recent years, several countries have introduced legislation to formalise the position of traditional/complementary practitioner swithin their he alth care systems or strengthened policies on traditional/ complementary medicine practice and training.Research findings ANNA DIXONAuthors COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINEKey topics MARCH 2008 2REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSIn this report the experience of 16 countries in regards to this issue are reviewed: Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Ghana, Hong Kong SAR, India, Japan, the Netherlands,Norway, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, South Africa,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK), United States of America(USA). Throughout, three domains of regulation are analysed: practice; education and training; licensing and registration of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine. Practice The need to ensure patient safety and prevent patients from receiving care from unqualified (or poorly qualified) practitioners has resulted in legislation being passed to professionalise traditional/complementary practitioners in many countries. In some countries, for example, the Netherlands, this has meant decriminalising the practice oftraditional/complementary medicine. Many practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine are multi-therapeutic practitioner s. Regulations apply either to the practice of a single therapy or recognise a diverse range of therapies. In the UK, legislation in the 1990s recognised osteopaths and chiropractors as separate professions. Whereas proposals (not yet implemented) toestablish a Complementary and Alternative Medicine Council in the UK to regulateacupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine recognise that these areoften practiced in combination. In Ghana and South Africa, there is a single act to licensealltradition alpractitioners. In most countries there are national rules governing the practice of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine. However, rules can vary by province, territory and state within a country, as is the case in Australia, Canada and the USA. Standards of practice and conduct are usually set out in a code of practice or ethics. Responsibility for standard setting is often delegated to professional associations. The problem may be that standards are set too low in order to increase membership. However, the process needs to be fl exible and responsive to changes in technology and practice, so this may be preferable to setting standards in legislation. In several countries the title used by the practitioner is protected. It is more difficult to restrict the activities that practitioners perform and therefore this seldom occurs. Protection oftitle does not prevent an unqualified person carrying out therapeutic procedures, some ofwhich carry risks. Protection of practice, on the other hand, is difficult to define and enforce;itis usually only in very limited areas where there are specific risks associated with the practice (such as the use of needles) that protection of practice is used. Training In or der to ensure that practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine have the necessary skills and competencies to treat patients safely, training may be regulated. The l ength of training and the qualifications obtained by practitioners of traditional/ comp lement ary medicine varies widely. Some practitioners continue to learn as apprentices, or via short courses or correspondence courses. No evidence was found of countriesREGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 3developing strategies to improve the standards of apprentice training and education such as on-the-job training in the basics of hygiene and anatomy. Other practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine obtain higher degrees, undertake training similar to that offeredthrough the medical curriculum and may be required to complete clinical training. Medical practitioners who practice traditional/complementary medicine may be required to have completed specialist training following completion of orthodox/Western medicaltraining. In other countries traditional/complementary medicine is a component of the medical curricula, and in others it is fully integrated into medical training. In general,standards of education and training are frequently set either specifying length of trainingor the content of a core curriculum. Standards that specify only the length of training havelimited the ability to ensure the quality of the training. Courses may be accredited byprofessional associations or by independent bodies. The accreditation systems that areindependent are likely to have greater external validity. Registration and licensing Some countries require practitioners to register or hold a license as a condition of practice. In Nor way, for example, the government accredits professional associations, whose members are then eligib le to ap ply for a license. In most countries reviewed here, individuals have to apply for registration or licensing. Eligibility is usually determined by the ability to show evidence of qualifications and/or safe clinical practice. In some countries there is automatic registration for practitionerswith ac credited qualifications: in others practitioners must pass a special licensing exam. Automatic registration of individuals depends on a robust and independent accreditation mec hanism. Where there is a large number of existing practitioners who would wish to apply for entry on a new register, licensing exams provide a consistent method of entry. Increasingly countries require re-licensing to be granted on completion of continuing professional development. Procedures for and the frequency of re-licensing vary and thereis as yet no consensus on the appropriate balance between monitoring and complianceburdens on practitioners and requirements for ensuring patient and public safety. In some countries and for some traditional/complementary therapies the risks posed by unlicensed practice are not deemed sufficient to justify statutory regulation. In these cases voluntaryregulation i spreferred. In other countries statutory regulation is introduced only if traditional/ complementary practitioner organisations can demonstrate that they have put in place the necessary structures and procedures. Major findings Many of these options are poorly evaluated and there has been little research into the relative merits of different approaches to the regulation of practitioners of traditional/complementarymedicine, particularly against specified objectives. Health system objectives as well as theobjectives for regulation of such practitioners differ widely between countries. These issuesneed f urther attention from researchers and policy-makers.4REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSIt appears that in countries where the health status is high among the general population and there is good access to Western medicine, the focus of government attention is onprotecting patients against harm and ensuring high-quality health care provision.Regulation is aimed at promoting safety and public protection. The approach is different inresource-poor countries where life expectancy is short and preventable diseases prevalent.The focus of government attention in these countries is on health improvement and prevention; regulation is aimed at enhancing the contribution of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine to health promotion and securing public access to medical services.REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 5Background to the report The World Health Organization (WHO) published its Strategy for Traditional Medicine in 2002. It set out a number of objectives: Integrate TM/CAM with national health care systems, as appropriate, by developing and implementing national TM/CAM policies and programmes. Promote the safety, efficacy and quality of TM/CAM by expanding the knowledge base on TM/CAM, and by providing guidance on regulatory and quality assurance standards. Increase the availability and affordability of TM/CAM, as appropriate, with an emphasis on access for poor populations. Promote therapeutically sound use of appropriate TM/CAM by providers and consumers. (World Health Organization 2002 p5) WHO m ade a number of recommendations relating to regulation and standards that nation algovernments needed to address, including: /square6the legislation and regulation of herbal products and the practice of therapies /square6the education, training and licensing of providers. The 56th World Health Assembly passed a resolution in 2003 that called on the Director Gener alto: ...facilit ate the efforts of interested Member States to formulate national policies and regulations on traditional and complementary and alternative medicine, and to promote exchange of information and collaboration on national policy and regulation oftraditional medicine among Member States. (World Health Assembly 2003) In collaboration with its six regional offices, WHO published a global survey of national policies on traditional medicine and the regulation of herbal medicines (World HealthOrganization 2005a). Its main focus is on herbal products. The WHO Centre for Health Development in Kobe has also compiled and published a global atlas of traditional and complementary medicine (World Health Organization 2005b). The two-volume atlas containsdetailed inf ormation on 2 3 countries worldwide and an overview of each region. It reports data from a questionnaire distributed throughout each of the WHO regions (Bodeker et al 2005; On g etal2005). WHO h asalso p ublished Guide lineson De velopin g Consumer Information on Proper Use of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine in support of its objectives to promote the rational use of traditional/complementary medicineby consumers (World Health Organization 2004b).Introduction6REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSBy focusing exclusively on the regulation of practitioners and related legislation, it is hoped this report will complement the work already undertaken by WHO on the issue of regulationof traditional/complementary medicine. Placing its practice on a legal footing and puttingin place competence requirements is intended to promote practice that is safe for bothpatients and consumers. This report examines the approaches to the regulation andregistration of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine in a number of countries in order to identify common issues. Objectives and purpose of the report The report aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the regulation of traditional medicine and complementary medicine practice in a selection of countries in order to inform thedevelopment of national legislation and policies to regulate their practice globally. Specifically the objectives of the report are: /square6to provide an overview of developments in the regulation of practitioners of traditional/ comp lement arymedic ine in a sel ection of countries /square6to describe legislation and its implementation to regulate the practice of traditional/ comp lementary therapies /square6to provide an o verview of systems of education, training and licensing of providers, and to describe how programmes of education and training are accredited /square6to evaluate the regulatory models and approaches. It is hoped that this update on developments in the regulation of traditional medicine and comp lement ary medicine practitioners will demonstrate the progress that has been made by a number of governments worldwide to ensure that patients can benefit from access to safe and high-quality health care. It is also hoped that by highlighting these cases other countries that are contemplating action in this area will be able to consider the different approaches adopted around the world and their relative advantages. Outline of the report The remaining part of the introduction elaborates definitions of key concepts to be used in the report and discusses some of the challenges of cross-country analysis in this area. It gives a brief description of the methodology used to collect information for the reportand pr esents the analytical framework. Section 2 gives an overview of the international situation regarding the market for traditional/complementary medicine. Section 3 summ arises the developments in the regulation of practitioners of traditional/complementary medic ine pr actitioner in the 16 c ountries chosen for review. Section 4 discusses the case studies, using the analytical framework to draw out similarities and differences in the approaches. For each regulatory approach identified, the report considers the extent to which it contributes to the goals of regulation. Section 5 concludes by identifying key issues for national and international policy-makers and further research questions thatneed to be addressed. Detailed case studies for each of the member countries are available on the King's Fund website (www.kingsfund.org.uk/regulatingcompmed).REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 7Definitions and concepts There is a wide range of terminology used to describe both orthodox or western medicine and traditional or complementary medicine. Some terms carry additional meaning in that they are used by either the proponents of or critics of complementary medicine. Given that there is little agreement on definitions and classifications, this report will adopt the termstraditional medicine and complementary medicine. However, where appropriate in the report,translations of terms used by regulatory bodies or in legislation are used. Before proceeding with setting out the analytical framework we briefly discuss some of the terms in use. The t erms 'traditional medicine' and 'complementary medicine' are relatively recent designations for a range of healing practices that have in some cases been practised for hundreds of years. Prior to the mid-twentieth century, such therapies were often referred toas 'primitive medicine' in colonial settings and 'fringe' or 'marginal medicine' in westerncontexts. In many countries, both developed and developing, there was considerabletension between western scientific medicine and other (indigenous) therapies up until themid-tw entieth c entury. Historical accounts have documented the extent of competition, coexistence, co-operation, integration and modification of alternative or traditional practices (Porter 1989; J\u00fctte 1996; Lindemann 1999). The t erm 'alternative' medicine suggests its use substitutes for and excludes use of conventional medicine. The term 'complementary medicine', which has been increasingly used since the 1980s, emphasises the use of treatments as an adjunct to, or supplementaryto, conventional medicine. The term 'complementary and alternative medicine' is widelyused in scientific and policy-related discourse and has been defined thus: 'A broad set ofhealth care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system' (World Health Organization 2000). Because complementary medicine is a relative concept, the knowledge and practices that are covered by the term vary between countries and are time-specific. Therefore, at the beginning of each case study the main therapies that are practiced in the country arehighlighted. Other terms that are used include 'unconventional', 'holistic', 'parallel','eastern' and 'folk' medicine. These compare as 'orthodox', 'conventional', 'allopathic', 'western' and 'scientific' medicine. Traditional medicine is a distinct concept and is concerned with indigenous medicine. WHO has defined it as: The sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in themaintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement ortreatment of physical and mental illness . (World Health Organization 2000) In industrialised societies, where western medicine dominates, the term is not widely used. Indig enou straditions, often called folk medicine, are often less widely practiced than8REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS'imported' practices. The term 'traditional medicine' is more common in countries where indigenous medicine has continued to flourish despite the introduction of western medicine. A system of health care that embraces conventional and traditional/complementary medicine can be referred to as an 'integrative system' (World Health Organization 2002).For example, all health care facilities are able to offer care from practitioners of western and traditional/complementary medicine. The term 'integrated health 'is also described as 'the safest and most effective aspects of mainstream medical science and complementary healthcare' (Foundation for Integrated Health 2007). An individual professional may betrained in both biomedicine and complementary systems of medicine and therefore ableto deliver integrated health care. Alternatively, care may be integrated at the level of a clinic,with practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine working side by side withconventional practitioners as part of a team. The f ocus of this report is on the regulation and registration of the practitioners of traditional and complementary medicine - that is, those who deliver therapeutic care to patients. Regulation is understood as the application of rules governing the professional behavior ofautonomous actors (individuals or organisations) usually by government (or a delegatedauthority) b utalso by voluntary agreement (self-regulation). There is a range of regulatory tools available to policy-makers, including legislation, enforced self-regulation, incentives (for example taxes and subsidies), disclosure, rights and liabilities. Regulation usuallyinvolves the setting of standards, monitoring adherence with those standards and enforcingcompliance with them (Baldwin and Cave 1999). The main focus of this report is on thelegislative framework governing the practice of traditional/complementary medicine. Methodo logy We conducted background literature searches in order to identify countries in which recent developments in the regulation of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine hadbeen reported. Working with experts at WHO, we chose 16 countries to reflect a diversityof cultural traditions, represent different continents, include both high income and lessdeveloped countries, and to include some countries where practice is fully integrated. They are all countries that have national legislation in place regulating the practice of traditional/complementary medicine. The f ollowing countries are covered by the report: Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Ghana, Hong Kong SAR, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and NorthernIreland (UK) and United States of America (USA). We devised terms of reference including questions and a template of headings ( seeAnnex 1) for each of the case studies. We also conducted searches of PUBMED to identify relevant published literature on each country as well as internet sites of ministries of health and relevantnational bodies for grey literature, such as legislation and policy documents. Gapsand outs tanding questions were identified and where necessary we contacted national professional associations and health ministries for additional information. A draft of the repor twascirculated to the relevant country offices of WHO for comment and correction.REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 9This final report reflects where possible the comments received at the time of publication. Any remaining errors of fact are the responsibility of the authors. Analytical framework to be used in the report WHO (2002) set out four types of health care systems based on the relationship between allopathic and traditional/complementary medicine: /square6integrative systems , in which traditional/complementary medicine is officially recognised and incorporated into all areas of health care provision: it is included in the national drug policy; providers and products are registered and regulated; therapies are available at hospitals and clinics (both public and private); treatment is reimbursed underhealth insurance; relevant research is undertaken; education in traditional/complementary medicine is available (WHO 2002) /square6inclusive systems , in which traditional/complementary medicine is recognised but is not yet fully integrated into all aspects of health care; work on policy, regulation, practice, health in surance coverage, research and education will usually be under way /square6tolerant systems , in which the national health care system is based on allopathic medic ine, b utsome practices are tolerated by law /square6exclusive systems ,in whic h the n ation alhealth care system is based on allopathic medicine and the practice of traditional/complementary medicine is illegal. Bodeker (2000) has suggested that historically the relationship between traditional/ complementary medicine and conventional medicine can broadly be classed as monopolistic (wher e modern medic aldoct ors have had the sole right to practice medicine, such as in the Netherl ands), tolerant (wher e traditional medical practitioners, while not formally recognised, are legally allowed to practice, as has been the case in many African countries), parallel (where both modern and traditional medicine are separate components of the national health system, such as in the Republic of Korea and India) and integrated (where modern and traditional medicine are integrated at the level of medical education, research andpractice, such as in China, the Republic of Korea and Vietnam). A variety of different classifications of traditional/complementary medicine were also identified in the literature. A number of classifications are of different therapy types ( see, for example, Kelner et al 2000; Fulder 1996; Lewith and Aldridge 1991). Given the differences ofstatusand prevalence of different therapies internationally these classifications are of limited use for this report. Jonas (2002) sets out a framework based on the relationship between traditional/ complementary medicine and conventional medicine. It identifies frontier therapies (those that challenge conceptual and paradigmatic assumptions about biological and scientificreality), emer ging therapies (those that involve common areas of interest for complementary medicine and conventional medicine) and integrating therapies (those thatmay be considered conventional but that overlap with complementary medicine practic es). In thi sclassification, integration relates to epistemology rather than the extent of integration in the health care delivery system.10 REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSKleinman in (Furnham and Smith 1988) distinguishes three overlapping sectors of health care: /square6the professional sector, made up of the organised, legally sanctioned health professions /square6the folk sector, made up of either sacred or secular practices including alternative therapies /square6the popular sector, which includes lay non-professionals who give advice about health. In this typology, those practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine who are subject to regulation would fall into the 'professional' sector rather than the 'folk' sector. The purpose of this report is not to classify countries according to the extent to which traditional/complementary medicine is integrated with conventional health care. An approachis needed to provide a systematic way of examining different aspects of the regulatoryframework as they apply to practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine. Generally,the ru les to which health care professionals are subject concern: their education and training; the requirements for licensing and registration; their ongoing practice and conduct. In each of these areas there are different objectives and different ways of implementing the rules. First, the purpose of setting requirements for education and training is to ensure that those who practice in a specific field of traditional/complementary medicine have the competence to do so safely. Educational and training requirements may be defined relating to thecontent of the curriculum, the length of educational courses or time spent in training, thelevel of qualification, and the skills and core competencies that participants must acquire. Second, sy stems of registration and licensing aim to help consumers and the public to distinguish between qualified and unqualified practitioners. Licensing usually means that only those who hold a license may practise medicine, whereas registration (or certification)means that anyone can practise but only those who are registered can use restricted titles.The requirements for registration and licensing are usually linked to completion of educationand tr ainin g butmay also be conditional on meeting other requirements such as language competence or length of experience of practice. When a new register is established existing practitioners are usually admitted to the register either by examination and/or a minimumperiod of clinical experience. Third, rules governing the practice of traditional/complementary medicine are usually designed to ensure ethical conduct and safe practice by licensed or registered practitioners. Cases of unethical conduct may result in the practitioner being subject to some kind of penalty. Breaches of standards might include negligence, poor-quality care, infringements ofthe l egal scope of practice and practice beyond the limits of competence. It is hoped that a taxonomy of the regulation of practitioners of traditional/complementary medic ine c an be dev eloped fr om an an alysis of the similarities and differences between countries' approaches to regulation and registration.REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 11Status of practice of traditional/complementary medicine It is a challenge to estimate the number of practitioners providing traditional/complementary medicine services within a country, especially if such practitioners practise withoutregistering. Commonly, conventional health care practitioners who practise traditional/complementary medicine do not need to register formally, so it is difficult to estimate theirnumber . Formal training courses may give an indication of the number of people entering practice. Yet some practitioners have never attended formal training courses but have learned through traditional systems of apprenticeship. Where practitioners are required to register, more robust estimates of the numbers of practitioners are becoming available. Despite these difficulties, it is clear that in some countries practitioners of traditional medic ine far outnumber conventional medical practitioners (South Africa, Ghana), whereas in other stheir number sare comparable (India, China, Vietnam), and in some countries traditional medicine practitioners are a distinct minority (European countries, Australia and the USA). It appears that where practitioners of traditional medicine comprise amajority of the health care workforce, policies are more likely to be designed to facilitate their contribution to public health improvement rather than to exclude them. Numbers ofpractitioners will also impact on the design and implementation of policies. For example,in Vietnam - where every practitioner is obliged to register by law - only 3,000 or so out ofan estimated 50,000 have done so to date. Regulation of traditional/complementary products and medicines Global estimates of the value of the trade in herbal medicine and other traditional/ comp lement arymedicine products are rare. Market assessments often estimate the value of the market in industrially produced herbal medicines and other products such as aromather apyoils and homeopathic remedies. Herbal preparations are also made up from raw ingredients by practitioners and particularly in low-income countries may use locally available plants. Ingredients for herbal preparations are also traded globally but are moredifficult to track than commercially manufactured products. The trend appears to be one ofrapid growth, with annual growth rates in the UK market in traditional/complementaryremedies running at over 14 per cent at the end of the 1990s. Explicit policies to increase the size of the export market by countries such as China suggest this trend will continue. In the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, where there are active policies to promote use of traditional medicine, 31 per cent of registered drugs in 1995 were herbal medicines (Hien and Truon g 2005). In Germ any, eight of the top hundred most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals in 1989 were herbal remedies; this declined to just three in 2001 (Dixon et al 2003). Due to de-listing of over-the-counter products by the sickness funds, there is almost no reimbursement of herbal remedies. Atthe time of the WHO s urvey, 92 countries (65 per cent of responding countries) reported that they had a law or regulation on herbal medicine in place in 2003 (World Health Organization 2005a). Within the European Union, product regulation is being addressedThe international context12 REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSthrough the implementation of the Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products. The Directive covers only manufactured products and leaves the regulation of dispensingof unlicensed herbal products to national determination (Ernst and Dixon 2004). There havebeen a number of high-profile cases where products of traditional/complementary medicinehave threatened public health. For example, Australian authorities audited the manufacturingquality control standards of Pan Pharmaceuticals following reports of serious adverse reactions to one of its products. As a result, it recalled more than 1,500 products fromworldwide distribution (Burton 2003; Loff and McKelvie 2003). Aristolochia, a common ingredient in traditional Chinese herbal medicines, caused 70 cases of kidney failure inBelgium in 1996 and has been banned from use in unlicensed herbal medicines in the UKsince July 1999 (www.mhra.gov.uk). Use of traditional/complementary medicine products and services Population surveys often vary in their methodology, making it difficult to estimate the comparative prevalence of use of traditional/complementary medicine. The indications are thatuse iswidespread and growing in most countries. Estimates for the proportion of adults who have used traditional/complementary medicine at some point in their lives are 73 per centin Canada (1999), 60 per cent in Australia (2002) and 34 per cent in Norway (1997). One- year pr evalence is lower, with estimates that in Canada between 12 and 20 per cent (2005) and in Germany 56 per cent (2002) of the population had used complementary medicine within the past 12 months, and 60 per cent of the population of Hong Kong SAR(1994), 66-75 per cent of Japanese adults (2002), 76 per cent of Singaporean adults(2005), 42 per cent of US adults (2003) and 10 per cent of UK adults reporting havingconsulted a practitioner of traditional medicine. In the Netherlands about 6 per cent of the population reported visiting a practitioner of complementary medicine and up to 15 per cent had consulted a practitioner (including general practitioners) for complementary medicine services (1995). However, it is likely these underestimate current patterns of use. In the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, where traditional/complementary medicine isintegrated into the health care system, it is estimated that 30 per cent of patients receivetraditional medicine. In China, traditional/complementary medicine accounts for one-thirdof outpatient and a quarter of inpatient treatment in rural areas. No estimates of prevalenceare available for the Republic of Korea but figures are likely to be high given the level of integration of traditional medicine into the health care delivery system. In Ghana, 70 per cent of the population relies exclusively on traditional medicine, while in India 70 per centofthe pop ulation r elies on traditional systems of medicine for primary health care needs. Reimbursement of traditional/complementary medicine services Reimbursement policies also vary between countries and are highly dependent on the overall design of the he alth c are system and the national context. Traditional/complementary therapies may be fully covered (as in China, the Republic of Korea and Vietnam), partially covered (as in Germany and the UK) or not covered at all (as is the case in some low-incomecountries where there is little public funding available for health care). In countries with publicly financed health care where there is an explicit package of services, such as Australia, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the Netherlands, REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 13a few traditional/complementary therapies are covered by public health insurance. The therapies that are covered vary according to the cultural traditions of that country. For example, in Japan national health insurance reimburses fully or partly acupuncture,moxibustion, Japanese traditional massage, judo therapy and Kampo and herbalmedicines. Most traditional/complementary medicine services are outside public coverand are therefore purchased out of pocket or covered by supplementary private health insurance. In the USA, with the exception of chiropractic, private health insurance tends tolimit coverage of traditional/complementary therapies strictly, with high deductibles and co-payments in place. In tax-funded systems where reimbursement decisions are less explicit, coverage of traditional/complementary medicine depends largely on historical factors and the dominanceof conventional medicine. For example, in the UK homeopathy is integrated in the NHS tosome extent, while other therapies are available only in some settings (for example, wherelocal purchasers have decided to pay for referrals or where conventional health care practitioners provide complementary therapies alongside conventional medical care). In Hong Kong SAR, where traditional/complementary medicine accounts for a large part ofthe health care delivery system, the majority of such services are provided in the privatesect or oper ating in parallel with the public system and private conventional medical practitioners. In Canada, some provincial plans provide cover usually for regulated practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine. In Norway, the public health systemoffers only limited cover for chiropractic; proposals for public reimbursement of traditional/complementary medicine services were rejected by a parliamentary committee in 1998. In addition to referrals to regulated practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine, private he alth in surance may reimburse other such therapies delivered directly by traditional/complementary practitioners, for example, Heilpraktiker in Germany. In low-income countries where public health care resources are scarce such as Ghana and India, the majority of traditional/complementary medicine services are paid out of pocket.In Indi a, tradition al/complementary therapies are available in some public facilities; nevertheless, between only 2 and 4 per cent of government expenditure is on these services. Spending is planned to increase to 10 per cent in future. Where traditional/complementarytherapies are integrated, as in China and Vietnam, it is usual for them to be covered bysocial insurance or provided in public health care facilities.14 REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSWHO has provided strategic direction for national governments in developing policies on traditional/complementary medicine (World Health Organization 2002). The WHO Strategyrecommended that governments develop national policies that should include legislationand regulation of practice, and education, training and licensing (World Health Organization2002). Several countries have enacted legislation in recent years to formalise the positionof practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine within the health care system orstrengthened policies on traditional/complementary medicine practice and training. A number of WHO publications have described the situation regarding policies in traditional/ complementary medicine worldwide (World Health Organization 2001; Bodeker et al 2005; Ong et al 2005; World Health Organization 2005b ). In addition, there have been a number of studies of the regulation of traditional/complementary medicinecommi ssioned by national governments in the course of developing their own policies and regulation s. The Australians conducted a review of occupational regulation of traditional/complementary medicine in a number of other countries (Bensoussan and Myers 1996). In 2002, the Irish government commissioned a report that included ananalysis of the regulation of complementary medicine practitioners in a number of countries(O'Sullivan 2002). The European Union funded a study of regulation in member states - theCouncilof Science and Technology (COST) Action on 'Unconventional medicine' (1993-98). Itfocused on ac upuncture, homeopathy, manipulation and herbalism and briefly described legal aspects of regulation (Monckton 1998). Information about how European Union member states currently regulate practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine hasbeen published more recently (Erdsal and Ramstad 2005). This section attempts to summarise the main developments in the regulation of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine, drawing on the country cases studiesprepared for this report. It focuses on training and education, licensing and registration,and practice standards as they apply to all practitioners of traditional/complementarymedicine. This includes practitioners with some formal training, those who have trained asapprentices, and western health professionals who practise traditional/complementary medic ine (w ith or without formal training). Although different licensing requirements may currently apply to different types of practitioners, the ultimate regulatory objective of ensuring safe and qualified practice of traditional/complementary medicine is the same. Policy-makers may therefore wish to consider legislation and regulations as they apply to all practitioners in order to ensure that the objectives are met in a co-ordinated way. Fulldetails of developments in traditional/complementary medicine in each country can befound in the case studies ( seewww.kingsfund.org.uk/regulatingcompmed). Education and training COMPETENC EREQUIREMENT S The types of qualifications obtained by practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine vary enormously between and within countries. Training will be offered in some therapiesDevelopments in the regulation of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicineREGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 15by correspondence courses or short weekend courses or evening classes. These may be appropriate if the purpose of training is familiarisation with the therapy or for personal orfamily use. Even among more established traditional/complementary therapies, the lengthof training and the level of qualification attained may vary considerably. For example, inJapan most practitioners must complete at least three years of training though, where morethan one therapy is taught, programmes may last up to five years. In India, the CentralCouncils for Indian Medicine and Homeopathy award a range of degrees at undergraduate and postgraduate level as well as diplomas. In some cases the length of study, content of the curriculum and clinical training requirements are similar to those for conventional medical training. For example, naturopathic doctors inCanada must complete four to five years of training at an accredited college including a period of clinical practice training following a three-year university degree (or premedicalstudies). In China, a doctor of traditional/complementary medicine must usually complete five years of study. In some countries, formal educational courses have only recently been established; for example, Ghana introduced a Bachelor of Science degree in herbal medicine in 2001. It is the first attempt there to integrate traditional herbal knowledge into a university scientific curriculum. REQUIREMENTS FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING Most associations for practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine establish minimum educ ation and tr ainin g requirements for members. In the Netherlands, practitioners are encouraged to establish systems of self-regulation before applying for statutory regulation. The Dutch Council of Classical Homeopathy has establishededucational requirements in line with European guidelines for homeopathic education setby the European Council for Classical Homeopathy and has requested consideration forstatutoryrecognition by the Dutch parliament. In the UK, the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health has been working with groups of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine to establish common standards of education andtraining and common accreditation systems. Standards may involve establishing norms for the number of hours of training or may give details of the content of the curriculum. For example, in order to join the Canadian Massage Ther apist Association members must have completed 2,200 hours of educational curriculum, whereas the Central Councils in India set out a curriculum for traditional/complementary medic ine tr ainin g as well as ensuring training institutions meet minimum standards. In some countries the training standards are the same for those wishing to practise traditional/ complementary medicine regardless of whether they are already trained as conventionalmedical practitioners; in Quebec, for example, the Bureau de l'Ordre des Acupuncteurs duQu\u00e9bec has set rules that apply to both physician and non-physician acupuncturistsregarding their training, education and annual registration. A number of countries have worked to establish a core curriculum for practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine. Some training includes biomedicine as a core component, whi le in other cases alternative explanatory models are taught and there is16 REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSlittle or no overlap with the training of conventional health care practitioners. In some countries training in traditional/complementary medicine is a formal part of the curriculumof medical practitioners. For example, in Germany ordinances passed in 2003 mean thatmedical faculties are obliged to include naturopathy and physical therapy in the trainingcurriculum. There are various specialist qualifications in complementary therapies thatdoctors may take, each with mandatory periods of practice and the skills that need to be learned. These standards are set by the regional medical associations based on templatesprovided by the Federal Medical Association. In Japan, Kampo medicine was formally incorporated into the model core curriculum for medical schools in 2001. In a number ofcountries the training in western medicine and traditional/complementary medicine arefully integrated, with common training components, for example, in Vietnam and China. Because of the lack of implementation of legislation in Ghana, official standards for education are absent and most training is still acquired through apprenticeships. The Traditional andAlternative Medicine Directorate within the Ministry of Health has produced training manuals for herbalists. Several countries that have established systems of licensing have introduced requir ements for continuing professional development or continuing medical education or are discussing proposals. In the UK, chiropractors and osteopaths are required to participate in continuing medical education. In India, there are discussions about makingongoing training mandatory. Many professional associations also run voluntary continuingmedical education courses for practitioners. ACCREDIT ATION OF TRAINING FOR PRACTITIONERS OF TRADITIONAL/COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE In some countries training is provided by private colleges and individual 'masters' and therefore the qualification or certificate gained has no external validity. Increasingly collegesand training institutions have sought external validation for their courses through nationalqualific ation authoritie s. In some cases these are national or regional curriculum authorities. In Australia, courses of study in traditional/complementary medicine may be accredited by the state/territoryeducational boards. Chiropractic and osteopathy training standards are set by theRegistration Boards in each state and accreditation is granted by the Australasian Councilon Chir opractic Education and the Council on Chiropractic Education Australasia Inc. The Australian National Training Authority has also funded projects to establish competency- based standards for complementary medicine training courses. In other cases the registering bodies accredit training institutions based on the standards required for entry on to the register. The Council for Naturopathic Medical Educationaccredits colleges in both Canada and the USA. Accredited colleges are allowed to administer the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) examinations to their candidates. These examinations are often required for licensing. In other c ases the government administration accredits training institutions. This may be the ministry of health or the education ministry. For example, in India the governmentREGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 17accredits training institutions but bases its decision on recommendations from the Central Councils; in Japan, all training institutions and colleges must be authorised either by theMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare or the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Scienceand Technology. Licensing and registration Most legislation establishes mechanisms for individual practitioners to register. However, in Norway, the Act No 64 allows associations for practitioners of complementary medicine to apply for registration to the Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs. If an association is approved, the individual registrants of the association may apply to be accepted onto the public register, and may, when accepted, use the title 'registered'. The Norwegian Homeopathic Association was accepted onto the register in 2005 and is still the only complementary and alternative medicine organisation to be accepted onto it. It is the association rather than the individuals that are registered in law. A number of countrie sautomaticallyadmit graduates of accredited colleges to their registers. For example, the Central Council of Indian Medicine and the Central Council of Homeopathy in India both aut omatically register graduates of accredited colleges. The General Osteopathic Counciland the General Chiropractic Council in the United Kingdom automatically admit graduates of accredited colleges as long as they meet the other requirements such as being in good health and having the necessary professional indemnity insurance. In other cases graduates of accredited colleges must also sit a licensing examination. For examp le, in Canada, the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of British Columbia sets a licensing examination that must be passed after completing certain education and training requirements. In Quebec, non-medical acupuncturists must graduate from an accredited college and pass an examination set by the regulatory college. Naturopathic doctors in Canada and the USA must pass a licensing examset by the North American Board of the Naturopathic Examiners after completing their formaleducation. In Japan, practitioners must pass a national examination in order to obtain alicence from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare after graduating from an accreditedschool or training institution. Practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine in China must pass a licensing exam designed by the Health Department and administered in the provinces in order to register; on successful completion of the exam, the local healthdepartment issues a certificate that specifies any limits to their scope of practice and permits them to practise within that area. In other countries, particularly those where there is a history of unlicensed practice by apprenticeship-trained practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine, the introductionof mandatory registration has meant establishing transitional systems for recognition of priorexperience and qualifications (for example, Hong Kong SAR). These might involve presenting evidence of years in practice or qualifications obtained overseas or prior to accreditation and usuallyinvolve sitting an examination as well. In the UK, when the new registers for osteopaths and chiropractors were opened, there was a transitional system whereby prior experience was able to be validated in order to be registered by the General Councils (often called 'gr andf atherin g').18 REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSSome registering bodies require re-licensing by providing proof of participation in continuing medical education. For example, in Alberta, Canada, chiropractors are required to provecontinuing education every three years in order to maintain their license to practise. The Department of AYUSH in India has proposed that all practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine receive reorientation and continuing medical education in orderto help them integrate into the public health care system, though this is not mandatory. In rare cases, practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine may be required only to sit a licensing examination with no requirements for training whatsoever; for example, inGermany Heilpraktiker are not required to undertake any formal training in traditional/ complementary therapies. In order to obtain a licence, applicants must sit an exam at thepublic health office; this mainly checks that they know the legal limits of practice and havesome basic clinical and biomedical knowledge. In mo st countries conventional health care practitioners are not required to register with traditional/complementary medicine bodies in order to practice, though in some (for example, Germany) they are required to meet certain standards in order to use the registeredtitle. In Japan, medical doctors who wish to practise and prescribe Kampo medicine arerequir ed to join the Society of Japanese Oriental Medicine and renew their membership every five years. The Japan Society for Acupuncture and Moxibustion also has in place a registration system of doctors. In China, conventional health care practitioners may alsoapply to take the traditional Chinese medicine examination in order to register. The practice of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine In mo st countries the practice of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine is governed by general laws that regulate such things as the possession and dispensing of restricted drugs, licensing of business premises, licensing of premises where skin penetration occurs (due to infection control) and consumer legislation regarding the advertising andtherapeutic claims that can be made. These laws are not reviewed in detail here, thoughthey may contribute significantly to the safe practice of traditional/complementary therapies.Here the focus is on legislation specifically to regulate the activities of practitioners. A number of countries within Europe had previously outlawed practice of medicine by anyone other than a registered physician. These measures to exclude complementarymedic ine pr actic e were not stringently implemented and have gradually been weakened or reformed. In the Netherlands, the Health Care Profession Bill (BIG) 1993, which came into force in 1998, redefined what constitutes the legal practice of medicine. The practice ofcomplementary medicine is no longer illegal but there is no legislation to establish standardsof practice or licensing systems for practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine. In this context, the legislation is being enacted in order to decriminalise the practice oftraditional/complementary medicine. Portugal (not included in this report) also passed legislation in 2003 to regulate the practice of acupuncture, homeopathy, osteopathy, naturopathy, phytotherapy and chiropractic, which had previously been illegal by non- medic alprofessionals (Erdsal and Ramstrad 2005). In contrast, the majority of the other pieces of legislation discussed below are enacted in order to professionalise the practice oftradition al/comp lementary medicine.REGULATING KING'S FUND 2008 19In a number of countries legislation has been introduced to give legal recognition as professionals to individual groups of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine.This mono-therapeutic approach was followed in the UK in the early 1990s when osteopathsand chiropractics obtained statutory recognition and protection of title under individualActs of Parliament. In other cases a single act is introduced to regulate all practitioners of traditional/ complementary medicine under an umbrella regulatory body recognising that such practitioners may be engaged in multi-therapeutic practice. For example, Ghana passedthe Traditional Medicine Practice Law in 2000, to establish a Traditional and AlternativeMedicine Council in order to register and license traditional medicine practitioners.However, the Law has not been implemented and the Council has not yet beenestablished. In South Africa, the Traditional Health Practitioners Act 2004 sets outprovisions for a single council to regulate a range of different traditional healthpractitioners, including traditional birth attendants, traditional surgeons and healers. In the UK, proposals for establishing a joint Complementary and Alternative Medicine Council were consulted on in 2004. It was proposed that the council would initially regulateacupuncturists, herbal medical practitioners and practitioners of traditional/Chinesemedic ine, r ecognising that these therapies are often practiced in combination. In other cases legislation has been introduced that regulates the practice of all medical practitioners, both conventional and traditional/complementary. For example, in China thePractitioner Act of the People's Republic of China implemented in 1999 regulates all medicalpractitioner s and establishes standards for training and for exams and registration, and codesofpractices. In most countries legislation to regulate practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine is made at national level, thus ensuring uniform standards of practice, freemovement of professionals and recognition of qualifications. However, in several countrieswher e ther e ispolitical devolution legislation on regulation of practitioners of traditional/ complementary medicine is made at regional or local level. For example, in Australia, Canada and the USA responsibility for legislation is devolved and lies with the states/provincesand territories. Consequently, only osteopaths and chiropractors are regulated in all statesand territories in Australia, and only chiropractors are regulated in all provinces andterritories in Canada. Practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine have hadstatutory recognition in the state of Victoria, Australia since 2002. Some provinces in Canada license massage therapists, acupuncturists and naturopathic practitioners. CODE SOFPRACTICE Commonly legislation is very general and establishes the regulatory body to which it delegates the responsibility for setting standards. The Indian Medical Central Council Act 1970established the C entralCouncil of Indian Medicine and the Central Council of Homeopathy, with powers to set standards of education, maintain a register and regulate practice. There may also be government or lay involvement in the setting of standards where issuesof public accountability are a concern.20 REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSIn some cases the responsibility for defining codes of practice is delegated to professional bodies. In Victoria, Australia, there is consensus that standards of practice for conventionalhealth care practitioners who incorporate traditional/complementary therapies into theirpractice should be established through guidelines and codes of practice rather thanlegislation. In Canada, standards of practice are set by the College of Chiropractors in eachprovince. In Norway, registered associations of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine are required to have in place statutes that set professional qualifications formembers, ethical rules and professional responsibilities. Codes of practice are often framed as ethical codes or codes of conduct that embody 'professional practice'. Practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine have producedcodes of ethics in a number of countries - for example Ghana, India, the Republic of Koreaand Singapore - or are required to in order to gain legal recognition, for example Norway. It is not always clear how compliance with the code is monitored or enforced. Disciplinaryprocedures for sanctioning practitioners who fail to meet these standards are often in place but they are exercised only in extreme cases of professional misconduct following a formal complaint. PRO TECTION OF TITLE OR PROTECTION OF SCOPE OF PRACTICE Some regulations specify the scope of practice - that is, they limit the legal right to perform certain tasks or procedures to certain practitioners. For example, in India it is illegal forpractitioners of traditional/complementary medicine to prescribe allopathic medicine. In Norway, treatment of communicable diseases that are hazardous to public health andseriou sdiseases and disorders is allowed to be provided only if its purpose is to alleviate or moder ate sympt oms, the tr eatment has been authorised by a doctor, and if no other treatment is available; any other disease or disorder may be treated by anyone. In Alberta, Canada, only a patient who has first consulted a conventional medical doctor may be treatedby an acupuncturist; acupuncturists must refer a patient to a conventional medical doctorif there are no improvements within six months. In other countries the legislation does not give legal rights over practice but limits the use of certain titles, for example, that of acupuncturist. In Germany, only doctors who have takenformal qualifications may use the title of acupuncture doctor or homeopathic doctor;however, there are no limits on practice. Some do limit scope of practice and confer protection of title on practitioners of traditional/ comp lementary medicine. In Ontario, Canada, chiropractors have the right to use the title of doctor and have a protected scope of practice.REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 21From the above analysis of the case studies, which accompany this report ( see www.kingsfund.org.uk/regulatingcompmed), it is possible to identify a range of regulatory options in the three areas of regulation identified above: education and training, licensingand registration, and practice ( seebelow). The overview identifies the different options available to policy-makers when designing regulations and discusses briefly some of thepossible advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches. TABLE 1: AN OVERVIEW OF THE REGULATORY OPTIONS FOR REGULATING PRACTITIONERS OF TRADITIONAL/COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE Area of regulation Regulatory options Education and Type of qualification: university education, specific training for practitioners of trainin g traditional/complementary medicine and for conventional health care practitioners Educational setting: schools, colleges or universities Specify standards in terms of length of training vs content of core curriculum Shared biomedical curriculum vs alternative curriculumPrivate/professional associations accredit courses vs independent accreditation (by registering body or government) Trainin g component of conventional medical training aimed at familiarisation vs integration Licensing and Individual registration vs associations of practitioners register (and all members registration automatically registered) Automatic registration with accredited qualification vs licensing exam vs both Recognition of prior non-accredited training or experience vs licensing exam Lifetime membership vs re-licensing (associated with continuing medical education)Joint or dual licensing of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine and conventional medical practitioners practicing traditional/complementary medic ine vs no additional licensing requirements for conventional medical practitioners Practic e Generic laws that also cover the practice of traditional/complementary medicine vs specific traditional/complementary medicine legislation Decrimin alisation of practice vs professionalisation of practice Mono-therapeutic (that is, individual traditional/complementary medicine practitioner r egulators) vs multi-therapeutic (that is, umbrella regulator for all such practitioners) vs integrated (that is, single regulator for traditional/ complementary and conventional medicine practitioners) Nation al vs regional/local standards of practice Setting specific standards (for example, hospital vs primary care; public hospital vs private practice) Delegate standard setting to professionals vs specify in legislationStatement of minimum standards vs statement of limits of practiceProtection or title vs protection of practiceDiscussion22 REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSUnderstanding approaches to regulation of TM/CM practice In most countries there is usually some existing legislation that applies to the practice of traditional/complementary medicine. It may be important to consider first whether these laws could simply be strengthened or amended to ensure higher standards of consumer protection for those people who chose to consult a practitioner of traditional/complementarymedicine. The principles of high-quality regulation, which are increasingly being applied tohealth care as well as to other sectors of the economy (Dixon 2006), require governments to reduce the regulatory burden and ensure that the costs and benefits of any new regulation are carefully evaluated. It is likely that requirements such as displaying prices, having liability insurance, and restricting the health claims that practitioners can make are likely to be lower cost and less burdensome than establishing more complex registration and licensing bodies. Laws that were established in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to regulate the practice of medicine resulted in the criminalisation of traditional/complementary medicinepractic e in a number of countries. Few prosecutions were made under these laws in more recentyears and as public demand for these therapies has grown a number of countries have decriminalised the practice of traditional/complementary medicine. However, decriminalisation means the situation in these countries is now similar to the that whichexisted in (Anglo-Saxon) countries with common law traditions - that is, anyone can set up practice as a practitioner of traditional/complementary medicine with no training or qualifications. Concern to ensure patient safety and prevent patients from receiving carefrom unqualified (or poorly qualified) practitioners means positive legislation is needed. Ther e is considerable fragmentation within and between some traditional/complementary therapies. For example, there are often multiple associations representing a therapy, each with their own knowledge base and approach to practice. Encouraging greater co-operationand c onsensus among practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine has been a priority for policy-makers in a number of countries prior to the introduction of statutory legislation. Furthermore, where the number of practitioners is small the costs of establishinga professional regulatory body with responsibilities for setting standards of education andpractice, accrediting courses and performing disciplinary procedures are likely to be high. This may be one justification for establishing an umbrella regulatory body covering most or allpractitioners of traditional/complementary medicine as is envisaged in the UK (Foundation for Integrated Health 2008) Other reasons may be recognition that many such practitioners practise several therapies and therefore to have separate licensing andstandardsfor each therapeutic area would be burdensome. Where integration of practice between practitioners of traditional/complementary and of conventional medicine is an objective, then integrated regulation may provide a means of supporting such practice.More research is needed to understand whether integrated practice can also be achievedeven where regulation is not integrated. The a dvantages of establishing national standards of practice are that they promote free movement of professionals and provide consistency for consumers in different geographical areas. Where certain practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine are regulated onlyin some p artsof the country, it may create geographical inequities in access becauseREGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 23referring practitioners will be limited in what therapies are available to their patients. The extent to which standards apply to all health care settings may vary and may be highlydependent on the context. For example, where traditional medicine is being practised mainlyin hospitals (as in Vietnam, China, the Republic of Korea and India), it may be easier toapply standards than it would be where traditional/complementary medicine is practisedin rural clinics (as in South Africa). There may also be grounds to differentiate between standards of practice for those operating in the public health system and those in privatepractice. For example, regulations for the private sector may focus on standards of facilities. These would not necessarily be appropriate for care delivered via public sector facilities. In many countries the standards of practice and ethical codes are set down by the practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine themselves. Where there is noregulatory body, the self-governing body may be responsible for setting standards. The problem may be that voluntary self-regulating bodies set the standards too low inorder to increase membership. If regulations are too prescriptive they can quickly become out of date. It is often a long and time-consuming process to revise primary legislation, therefore it may be preferablefor the prim ary legislation to set the framework and to leave the detail of the rules and standards of practice to secondary legislative arrangements such as administrative rules or statutory instruments that can be more flexible and responsive to changes in technologiesand practice. Alternatively, the rules and standards can be delegated to an independentregulatory body, which may then have to seek ministerial or parliamentary approval forproposed changes. This would prevent professional interests diluting the standards of practic e thatwould be expected by the public. Protection of title means that the public can be confident that anyone who advertises or presents themselves as an 'acupuncturist' or 'chiropractor', for example, is qualified andregistered. However, it does not prevent an unqualified person or indeed a conventionalhealth c are practitioner w ithout training to carry out procedures such as 'needling' or spinal manipulation or dispensing of herbal remedies. Unless the public is made aware of the existence of a register and there are prosecutions of those who falsely use the protectedtitle, it is unlikely to offer full protection to patients from unqualified practice. However, thealternative - that is, protection of practice - is very difficult to define in legislation in a waythat is enforceable. If the practices that are restricted are legitimately practised by otherhealth care practitioners, then limiting these practices will require specification of the scope ofpractice of every health care practitioner. Such legislation may inadvertently prevent lay people from things such as preparing a herbal tea for a family member if this might be construed a s 'dispensing a herbal remedy'. It is usually only in very limited areas where there are specific risks associated with the practice (such as the use of needles) that protection of practice is used. Under standin g ap proaches to training and education The type of qualific ation and educ ation settin g for the training of practitioners of traditional/ complementary medicine is likely to be determined by the status of the therapy within each countryand the entr y requirements and training standards that are established. 24 REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSThe advantages of integrating traditional/complementary medicine practice into the mainstream educational system are that the courses benefit from being subject to generalstandards of education that apply to all courses and educational establishments and arelikely to attract a more diverse range of applicants. Where there are public subsidies forfurther and higher education, these are usually available only to students at accreditedcolleges and universities. Integration of teaching staff exposes trainers of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine to wider educational training and curriculumdevelopment. Private colleges and universities with no public subsidy will mean that such training is available only to those who can afford the fees. Private colleges may be temptedto reduce entry qualifications in order to protect income. Standards that specify only the length of training are limited in the ability to ensure the quality of the training and that qualified practitioners have the necessary knowledge, skillsand competences for safe and high-quality practice. It is more usual, therefore, to specify acore curriculum or educational standards to which a course leading to a qualification in traditional/complementary medicine must adhere. Therapies that include a shared biomedical curriculum with conventional health care practitioners' training are likely to havegreater legitimacy and to acquire the confidence of health care practitioners. If patientscan be r eferred between conventional and practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine, then there are advantages in a common curriculum, in promoting communication and record keeping. Common training may also promote integration of practice. Accreditation systems that are independent are likely to have greater external validity. Ther e are conflicts of interest inherent in professional associations accrediting courses. Independent accreditation bodies may still be professionally led or at least have significant professional expertise available to them in order to judge the content of the courses. In order to ensure independence they may include lay or public members or be subject to approvalby government authorities. General curricular authorities or education regulators may bebetter placed to judge the pedagogic quality of the training. Given that many patients consult practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine as well as consulting conventional medical practitioners, a familiarisation course as part ofundergraduate training as a conventional health care practitioner is likely to contribute tobetter patient care and clinical-patient communication. However, if referrals to or frompractitioners of traditional/complementary medicine take place within the health caresystem, then more advanced courses in particular therapies may be appropriate. Finally, if integrated practice is desirable then the integration of practitioner-level training for pr actitioner sof both conventional medicine and traditional/complementary medicine might be considered. Specialisation courses at postgraduate level also allow conventional medical practitioners wishing to practice traditional/complementary medicine to train topractitioner l evel. Common s tandards of training for medical and non-medical practitioners, though desirable to ensure consistency for patients, can be difficult to establish in practice. There appears to be a growing consensus that minimum levels of anatomical, pharmacological and b iological knowledge are required in order to be a competent traditional/complementary medicine practitioner. This suggests that basic training should have a biomedical base onREGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 25which specialised traditional/complementary medicine competence can be built. In practice, especially in those countries where apprentice-trained practitioners are in the majority,most practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine do not have this biomedicaltraining. The educational content of apprenticeships is difficult to standardise due to thevery nature of apprenticeships; consequently in many countries they are losing ground toinstitutionally based training. Despite formalisation of training and education in many countries, the majority of practitioners worldwide are still made up of apprentice-trained practitioners. It is not clear from this reviewwhether countries are developing any strategies to improve the standards of training andeducation of these practitioners, such as on-the-job training in the basics of hygiene andanatomy. Understanding approaches to licensing and registering practitioners The approach adopted in Norway of accrediting associations of practitioners of traditional/ comp lement arymedic ine ap pears to be unique among the countries examined in this report, though a similar approach is being adopted in Denmark and Ireland. Further analysis of this approach would be useful to see whether this reduces the regulatory burden and c osts associated with statutory regulation but still ensures sufficient safeguards for patients. The standards set by the regulator concern the procedures that practitioner associations must have in place rather than the standards that individualsseeking registration must attain. The model delegates more of the responsibilities forregulation to the practitioner associations themselves. Wher e individual licensing systems are in place, automatic registration of individuals is likely to ensure the quality of traditional/complementary medicine practice only if there are robust and independent accreditation mechanisms in place. Where this is not the case or there are a large number of existing practitioners who would wish to apply for entry on anew register, licensing exams provide a consistent method of entry. During the transitionalperiod after setting up a new register it may be appropriate to offer both methods of entry. Ther e isa wider debate in health care regulation in general about the need to ensure that registrants remain up to date and fit to practice. Traditionally, once registrants had satisfied the entry criteria there were no further checks unless a complaint was received and theindiv idual wasfound to be unfit to practise or had committed an act of professional misconduct. Procedures for and the frequency of re-licensing vary and there is as yet no consensus on the appropriate balance between monitoring and compliance burdens onpractitioners and requirements for ensuring patient and public safety. Continuing medicaleducation requirements are now common for traditional/complementary medical practitionersbut whether these or other measures should form the basis of re-licensing will vary dependingon other pr ocedures for audit. Wher e ther e isprotection of title for practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine, convention almedical practitioners who wish to practise traditional/complementary medicine may wish to obtain the right to use the title as well. This can result in some practitioners bein g dual registered and unless procedures are defined there may be confusion over which26 REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSregulator has the primary authority to investigate or take action if there is a complaint. There may also be grounds for dual registration if it is deemed that conventional medicalpractitioners wishing to practise traditional or complementary medicine should attainstandards of training or qualification equivalent to those of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine. However, for some practitioners these requirements might deterthem from integrated practice. If the regulators of conventional health care practitioners are capable of regulating their practice of traditional and complementary therapies (throughtaking expert counsel, for example), then dual registration may not be deemed necessary. Large numbers of apprenticeship-trained practitioners pose a challenge to licensing and registration systems. Other than requiring formal or institutionalised training, some countrieshave put in place 'grandfathering' schemes to accredit prior experience. In high-incomecountries, marketing and advertising by practitioners of traditional/complementary medicineis monitored and prosecutions brought to the courts against continued practice byunregistered practitioners. In low-income countries, despite their practice being illegal, many unregistered practitioners continue to practise unchallenged. In such situations, where there are many apprenticeship-trained practitioners it may be appropriate to providesupport and retraining for these practitioners rather than implement a system of registrationfrom whic h many of them will be excluded. Lack of resources combined with rurality (for example, the majority of the population and practitioners live in rural areas) make the effective implementation of licensing and registration schemes difficult. However, in ruralareas where word-of-mouth may play a greater role, there may be less need for a formalregistration process to distinguish the qualified from the unqualified. In some c ountrie sand for some traditional/complementary therapies the risks posed by unlicensed practice are not deemed sufficient to justify statutory regulation. In these cases voluntary regulation is preferred. In other countries statutory regulation is introduced onlyif organisations of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine can demonstratethat they have put in place the necessary structures and procedures. The problem withvoluntary systems of professional regulation is that there are few sanctions available to those practitioners who fail to comply with the standards; they can be removed from the register but as there is no legal sanction they may continue to practise. Alternatively, theymay simply register with another professional association to whom they are not previouslyknown. Such problems concern policy-makers in Australia, where there are estimated to bemore than a hundred organisations representing practitioners of traditional/complementarymedic ine. Despite discussions to establish a single Australian Council of Complementary Medic ine, this has not so far been implemented. Manyofthese options are poorly evaluated and there has been little research into the relative merits of different approaches particularly against specified objectives. Health system objectives as well as the objectives for regulation of practitioners of traditional/comp lement arymedic ine diff er widely between countries. These issues need further attention from researchers and policy-makers. Issues raised for national and international policy-makers The inc reasing glo bal demand for traditional/complementary medicine together withREGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 27migration of health care workers is likely to mean that differences in the regulation of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine between countries will come underincreasing scrutiny. Within the European Union, despite statutory recognition in the UnitedKingdom, osteopaths are not free to practice in all other European Union member states.The ability of regulators to recognise overseas qualifications of practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine will need to be addressed. There is a role for international policy- makers to ensure that mutual recognition of qualifications and free movement of labourdoes not undermine national efforts to promote the quality of traditional/complementary medicine practice nationally. At national level, policy-makers may need to review the design of regulation against not only objectives of public protection and patient safety but also in light of principles of high-quality regulation and health promotion. It may be necessary to review the appropriatenessof models of professional regulation that have been developed for larger established healthcare practitioner groups. If there is neither the technical capacity nor the financial resources to establish further regulatory bodies, it may be necessary to rationalise regulatory functions or consider other regulatory mechanisms for meeting the desired objectives. From our r eading of these case studies, there is an emerging relationship between regulatory approaches in traditional/complementary medicine and wider health system objectives. It appears that in countries where health status is high among the general population andthere is good access to western scientific medicine, the focus of government attention ison protecting patients against harm and ensuring high-quality health care provision. The c oncern is that if traditional/complementary medicine is delivered by practitioners who are not registered or licensed it is not possible for the patient to be assured of the quality of training or level of competence of the practitioner. If safety is to be promoted and the public protected, regulation of the providers of traditional/complementary medicine andtheir education, training and practice is needed. The default position is one of exclusionunless proven safe. In contrast, in resource-poor countries where life expectancy is short and preventable diseases prevalent, the focus of government attention is on health improvement andprevention. The provision of western scientific medicine to the entire population is oftenbeyond the human and financial resources available - thus practitioners of traditional/complementary medicine are the main source of health care provision, particularly in ruralareas. The concern is that all human resources and natural resources should be harnessed for the impr ovement of health in the population. If health is to be promoted and the public given access to medical services, regulation of the practice of providers of traditional/ comp lement ary medicine is needed to enhance its contribution and impact. The default position is one of inclusion unless proven harmful. Given the diff erentobjectiv es for the health care system in general it may be appropriate for these countries to develop different regulatory models. Further research questions Research examining in more detail the costs and benefits of different regulatory models is28 REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSneeded to inform how future regulation is designed and implemented. Research into the application of other regulatory tools, and in particular consumer protection laws and tradingstandards, to traditional/complementary medicine would open up the potential foralternative approaches to the model of statutory professional regulation currently beingpursued in most countries. In the context of this study it was not possible to examine how the socio-political context in particular countries has influenced the development of regulation. Most regulation is generated by primary legislation and will therefore reflect the political concerns prevalentat the time. In countries where nationalism has been reasserted there appears to be a stronginterest in promoting indigenous or traditional medicine. Migration patterns have alsoinfluenced the extent to which traditional medicine from one culture has been 'exported'to another. Analysis of how traditional medicine spreads beyond the migrant communityand becomes more widely embedded would also be another interesting topic for analysis. There are some countries in which integrated practice is more widespread. Regulation in these countries is also often more integrated. Research to understand whether the designof regulation influences integration of practice or whether this reflects the culturalacceptability of traditional/complementary medicine would be useful.REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS \u00a9 KING'S FUND 2008 29Within this brief review it is clear that policy-makers in several countries have taken steps to introduce legislation to improve the regulation of practitioners of traditional/ complementary medicine. Much of the experience to date has been with establishingsystems of statutory professional regulation. However, the approaches vary considerablybetween countries. This report has identified a number of regulatory options for policy-makers who are designing regulation of practitioners of traditional/complementarymedicine. There is insufficient evidence available at this stage to be able to evaluate these options. This needs to be done in the context of specific regulatory objectives and wider health system goals.Conclusions30 REGULATING COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSReferences Baldwin R, Cave M (1999).
