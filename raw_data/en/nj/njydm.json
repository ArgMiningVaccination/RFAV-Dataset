[Modulation of polyepoxysuccinic acid on crystallization of calcium oxalate](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22573920-modulation-polyepoxysuccinic-acid-crystallization-calcium-oxalate) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search) Zhang, Yanqing; Tang, Yongming, E-mail: tangym@njtech.edu.cn; Xu, Jinqiu The influence of polyepoxysuccinic acid (PESA) on the phase composition and crystal morphology of calcium oxalate was investigated in this paper. It was found that the presence of PESA inhibited the growth of the monoclinic calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystal and promoted the nucleation of the tetragonal calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD). In addition, with the increase in PESA concentration, the aggregation of COD crystals was reduced but the particle size was increased. Under the conditions of low calcium-to-oxalate ratio and high CaOx concentration, PESA could not effectively stabilize the formation of COD. Based on molecular dynamic simulations, the adsorption ofmore \u00bb PESA on CaOx crystal faces was confirmed. - Graphical abstract: Introduction of PESA into crystallization solutions promotes the formation of calcium oxalate dehydrate and modifies the morphology of crystals. - Highlights: PESA induces the formation of COD at low supersaturation. Establishment of Ca-rich surface augments the adsorption of PESA. At Ca/Ox=0.5 PESA cannot induce the formation of COD compared with Ca/Ox=2. Interaction of PESA with COM faces is stronger than that with COD faces.\u00ab less [Characterization of Medicago truncatula reduced calcium alleles](http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=257176) [USDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database](https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/find-a-publication/) Calcium oxalate crystal formation is common in plants. Formation of these crystals has been shown to function in plant defense, calcium regulation, and aluminum tolerance.

[Patterns of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystallization V.; Kuimova, M. V. The paper presents the features of calcium oxalate crystallization in the presence of additives revealed through experimental modeling. The patterns of phase formation are shown for the Ca2+ - C2O4 2- - H2O and Ca2+ - C2O4 2- - PO4 3- - H2O systems with the components and pH of the saline varying over a wide concentrations range. The effect of additives on crystallization of calcium oxalate monohydrate was investigated. It was found that the ionic strength and magnesium ions are inhibitors, and calcium oxalate hydroxyapatite crystals are catalysts of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystallization. The basic calcium phosphate (apatite) was found to be most thermodynamically stable, which indicates its special role in kidney stone formation since it is found in virtually all stones. [Crystallization of calcium oxalate in minimally diluted urine](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JCrGr.192..448B) of calcium oxalate was studied in minimally diluted (92%) urine using a mixed suspension mixed product crystallizer in series with a Malvern particle sizer. The crystallization was initiated by constant flow of aqueous sodium oxalate and urine into the reaction vessel via two independent feed lines. Because the Malvern cell was in series with the reaction vessel, noninvasive measurement of particle sizes could be effected. In addition, aliquots of the mixed suspension were withdrawn and transferred to a Coulter counter for crystal counting and sizing. Steady-state particle size distributions were used to determine nucleation and growth kinetics while scanning electron microscopy was used to examine deposited crystals. Two sets of experiments were performed. In the first, the effect of the concentration of the exogenous sodium oxalate was investigated while in the second, the effect of temperature was studied. Calcium oxalate nucleation and growth rates were found to be dependent on supersaturation levels inside the crystallizer. However, while growth rate increased with increasing temperature, nucleation rates decreased. The favored phases were the trihydrate at 18\u00b0C, the dihydrate at 38\u00b0 and the monohydrate at 58\u00b0C. The results of both experiments are in agreement with those obtained in other studies that have been conducted in synthetic and in maximally diluted urine and which have employed invasive crystal counting and sizing techniques. As such, the present study lends confidence to the models of urinary calcium oxalate crystallization processes which currently prevail in the literature. [Aluminum Citrate Prevents Renal Injury from Calcium Oxalate oxalate monohydrate crystals are responsible for the kidney injury associated with exposure to ethylene glycol or severe hyperoxaluria. Current treatment strategies target the formation of calcium oxalate but not its interaction with kidney tissue. Because aluminum citrate blocks calcium oxalate binding and toxicity in human kidney cells, it may provide a different therapeutic approach to calcium oxalate-induced injury. Here, we tested the effects of aluminum citrate and sodium citrate in a Wistar rat model of acute high-dose ethylene glycol exposure. Aluminum citrate, but not sodium citrate, attenuated increases in urea nitrogen, creatinine, and the ratio of kidney to body weight in ethylene glycol-treated rats. Compared with ethylene glycol alone, the addition of aluminum citrate significantly increased the urinary excretion of both crystalline calcium and crystalline oxalate and decreased the deposition of crystals in renal tissue. In vitro, aluminum citrate interacted directly with oxalate crystals to inhibit their uptake by proximal tubule cells. These results suggest that treating with aluminum citrate attenuates renal injury in rats with severe ethylene glycol toxicity, apparently by inhibiting calcium oxalate's interaction with, and retention by, the kidney epithelium. PMID:23138489 [Calcium carbonate crystals promote calcium oxalate crystallization by heterogeneous or epitaxial nucleation: possible proportion of urinary stones have calcium oxalate (CaOx) as the major mineral phase. In these stones, CaOx is generally associated with minor amounts of other calcium salts. Several reports showing the presence of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium phosphate in renal stones suggested that crystals of those salts might be present in the early steps of stone formation. Such crystals might therefore promote CaOx crystallization from supersaturated urine by providing an appropriate substrate for heterogeneous nucleation. That possibility was investigated by seeding a metastable of CaOx was monitored by 45Ca incorporation. We showed that (1) seeds of vaterite (the hexagonal polymorph of CaCO3) and calcite (the rhomboedric form) could initiate calcium oxalate crystal growth; (2) in the presence of lithostathine, an inhibitor of CaCO3 crystal growth, such accretion was not observed. In addition, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that growth occurred by epitaxy onto calcite seeds whereas no special orientation was observed onto vaterite. It was concluded that calcium carbonate crystals promote crystallization of calcium oxalate and that inhibitors controlling calcium carbonate crystal formation in Henle's loop might play an important role in the prevention of calcium oxalate stone formation. [Efficacy of Mixtures of Magnesium, Citrate Adrian; Costa-Bauza, Antonia 2015-09-01 The main aim of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mixtures of magnesium, citrate and phytate as calcium oxalate crystallization inhibitors. A turbidimetric assay in synthetic urine was performed to obtain induction times for calcium oxalate crystallization in the absence and presence of different mixtures of inhibitors. The morphology of calcium oxalate crystals in the absence or presence of inhibitors and mixtures of the inhibitors was evaluated in 2 crystallization experiments at low and high calcium oxalate supersaturation. The crystals formed were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Examination of crystallization induction times revealed clear inhibitory magnesium, citrate and phytate on calcium oxalate crystallization, supporting usefulness in the treatment and prevention of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. Significant synergistic effects between magnesium and phytate were observed. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that phytate is a powerful crystal growth inhibitor of calcium oxalate, totally preventing the formation of trihydrate and monohydrate. In addition to crystallization inhibition capacity, citrate magnesium calcium oxalate its supersaturation. The effect between magnesium and phytate on calcium oxalate crystallization suggests that a combination of these 2 compounds may be highly useful as antilithiasis therapy.

[Reverse engineering the kidney: 2010-07-01 Crystallization of calcium oxalate monohydrate in a section of a single kidney nephron (distal convoluted tubule) is simulated using a model adapted from industrial crystallization. The nephron fluid dynamics is represented as a crystallizer/separator series with changing volume to allow for water removal along the tubule. The model integrates crystallization kinetics and crystal size distribution and allows the prediction of the calcium oxalate concentration profile and the nucleation and growth rates. The critical supersaturation ratio for the nucleation of calcium oxalate crystals has been estimated as 2 and the mean crystal size as 1 mum. The crystal growth order, determined as 2.2, indicates a surface integration mechanism of crystal growth and crystal growth dispersion. The model allows the exploration of the effect of varying the input calcium oxalate concentration and the rate of water extraction, simulating real life stressors for stone formation such as dietary loading and dehydration. [Unusual calcium oxalate crystals in ethylene glycol Sanders, H J 1980-06-01 A patient poisoned with ethylene glycol exhibited the symptoms of (1) hysteria, (2) metabolic acidosis with both a large anion gap and osmolal gap, and (3) crystalluria. However, the shape of the urinary crystals was prismatic and resembled hippurate rather than the expected dipyramidal calcium oxalate dihydrate. X-ray crystallography positively identified them as calcium oxalate monohydrate.

[Aspects of calcium oxalate crystallization: theory, in vitro studies, and in vivo implementation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10541262) Rodgers, A 1999-11-01 There are three main approaches to urolithiasis research: theory, basic science, and clinical implementation. Although each approach has yielded meaningful results, there does not appear to be complete synergy between them. This article examines these approaches as they pertain to urinary calcium oxalate crystallization processes. Theoretical calculations were performed to examine the role of oxalate concentration on calcium oxalate supersaturation. The effects of magnesium, citrate, and combinations thereof on calcium oxalate crystallization kinetics were examined in a mixed suspension, mixed product removal crystallizer. Finally, male volunteers were given supplements of calcium alone and binary combinations of calcium, magnesium, and citrate to investigate their effects on the urinary supersaturation of calcium oxalate. Calculations showed that oxalate is 23 times more potent than calcium in its effect on the supersaturation of calcium oxalate. In the in vitro experiments, magnesium and citrate reduced the growth and nucleation kinetics as well as the supersaturation. In combination, these two components were more effective than the individual components in reducing the growth rate and the supersaturation. All of the supplements favorably altered the kinetic and thermodynamic risk factors. Calcium was the most effective in reducing the urinary excretion of oxalate. Articulation of these three approaches is essential for the meaningful investigation and understanding of urolithiasis. [Reinjury risk of nano-calcium oxalate monohydrate and calcium oxalate dihydrate crystals on injured renal epithelial cells: aggravation of adhesion and aggregation](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4918896) Ouyang, 2016-01-01 Background Renal epithelial cell injury facilitates crystal adhesion to cell surface and serves as a key step in renal stone formation. However, the effects of cell injury on the adhesion of nano-calcium oxalate crystals and the nano-crystal-induced reinjury risk of injured cells remain unclear. Methods African green monkey renal epithelial (Vero) cells were injured with H2O2 to establish a cell injury model. Cell viability, production, and mitochondrial membrane potential (m) were determined to examine cell injury during adhesion. Changes in the surface structure of H2O2-injured cells were assessed through atomic force microscopy. The altered expression of hyaluronan during adhesion was examined through laser scanning confocal microscopy. nano-calcium oxalate oxalate dihydrate (COD) crystals to Vero cells was observed through scanning electron microscopy. Nano-COM and COD binding was quantitatively determined through inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry. Results The expression of hyaluronan on the cell surface was increased during wound healing because of Vero cell injury. The structure and function of the cell membrane were also altered by cell injury; thus, nano-crystal adhesion occurred. The ability of nano-COM to adhere to the injured Vero cells was higher than that of nano-COD crystals. The cell viability, SOD activity, and m decreased when nano-crystals attached to the cell surface. By contrast, the MDA content, reactive oxygen species production, and cell death rate increased. Conclusion Cell injury contributes to crystal adhesion to Vero cell surface. The attached nano-COM and COD crystals can aggravate Vero cell injury. As a consequence, crystal adhesion and aggregation are enhanced. These findings provide further insights into kidney stone [Arthritis associated with calcium oxalate crystals in an anephric patient treated with peritoneal dialysis](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6468370-arthritis-associated-calcium-oxalate-crystals-anephric-patient-treated-peritoneal-dialysis) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search) Rosenthal, A.; Ryan, L.M.; McCarty, D.J. 1988-09-02 The authors report a case of calcium oxalate arthropathy in a woman undergoing intermittent peritoneal dialysis who was not receiving pharmacologic doses of ascorbic acid. She developed acute arthritis, with calcium oxalate crystals in Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes, a phenomenon previously described in gout. Intermittent peritoneal dialysis may be less efficient than hemodialysis in clearing oxalate, and physicians should now consider calcium oxalate-associated arthritis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis who are not receiving large doses of ascorbic acid. [A simple method for quantitating the propensity for calcium oxalate crystallization in urine](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20040112170&hterms=Biomedicine&qs=Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall%26Ntk%3DAll%26N%3D0%26No%3D30%26Ntt%3DBiomedicine) [NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp) Wabner, C. L.; Pak, C. Y. 1991-01-01 To assess the propensity for spontaneous crystallization of calcium oxalate in urine, the permissible increment in oxalate is calculated. The previous method required visual observation of crystallization with the addition of oxalate, this warranted the need for a large volume of urine and a sacrifice in accuracy in defining differences between small incremental changes of added oxalate. Therefore, this method has been miniaturized and spontaneous crystallization is detected from the depletion of radioactive oxalate. The new \"micro\" method demonstrated a marked decrease (p < 0.001) in the permissible increment in oxalate in urine of stone formers versus normal subjects. Moreover, crystallization inhibitors added to urine, in vitro (heparin or diphosphonate) or in vivo (potassium citrate administration), substantially increased the permissible increment in oxalate. Thus, the \"micro\" method has proven reliable and accurate in discriminating stone forming from control urine and in distinguishing changes of inhibitory activity. [The influence of freezer storage of urine samples on the BONN-Risk-Index for calcium oxalate crystallization.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15259384) Laube, Norbert; Zimmermann, Diana J 2004-01-01 This study was performed to quantify the effect of a 1-week freezer storage of urine on its calcium oxalate crystallization risk. Calcium oxalate is the most common urinary stone material observed in urolithiasis patients in western and affluent countries. The BONN-Risk-Index of calcium oxalate crystallization risk in human urine is determined from a crystallization experiment performed on untreated native urine samples. We tested the influence of a 1-week freezing on the BONN-Risk-Index value as well as the effect of the sample freezing on the urinary osmolality. In vitro crystallization experiments in 49 native urine samples from stone-forming and non-stone forming individuals were performed in order to determine their calcium oxalate crystallization risk according to the BONN-Risk-Index approach. Comparison of the results derived from original sample investigations with those obtained from the thawed aliquots by statistical evaluation shows that i) no significant deviation from linearity between both results exists and ii) both results are identical by statistical means. This is valid for both, the BONN-Risk-Index and the osmolality data. The differences in the BONN-Risk-Index results of both procedures of BONN-Risk-Index determination, however, exceed the clinically acceptable difference. Thus, determination of the urinary calcium oxalate crystallization risk from thawed urine samples cannot be recommended. [Antioxidant properties of polysaccharide from the brown seaweed Sargassum graminifolium (Turn.), and its effects on calcium Chao-Yan; Wu, Wen-Hui; Wang, Jue; Lan, Min-Bo 2012-01-01 We investigated effects polysaccharides from the seaweed Sargassum graminifolium (Turn.) (SGP) on calcium oxalate crystallization, and determined its antioxidant activities. To examine the effects of SGP on calcium oxalate crystallization, we monitored nucleation and aggregation of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals, using trisodium citrate as a positive control. We assessed antioxidant activities of SGP by determining its reducing power, its ability to scavenge superoxide radicals, and its activity in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) The nucleation inhibition was 58.5 and 69.2%, respectively, and crystal aggregation was inhibited by 71.4 and 76.8%, respectively. Increasing concentrations of SGP resulted in increased scavenging of superoxide anions and DPPH radicals (IC = 1.9 and 0.6 mg/mL, respectively). These results suggest that SGP could be a candidate for treating urinary stones because of its ability to inhibit calcium oxalate crystallization and its antioxidant properties.

PMID:22363225 [An Assessment of Engineered Calcium Oxalate Crystal Formation on Plant Growth and Development as a Step toward Evaluating Its Use to Enhance Plant Defense.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26517544) Nakata, Paul A 2015-01-01 The establishment of new approaches to control chewing insects has been sought not only for direct use in reducing crop loss but also in managing resistance to the pesticides already in use. Engineered formation of calcium oxalate crystals is a potential strategy that could be developed to fulfill both these needs. As a step toward this development, this study investigates the effects of transforming a non-calcium oxalate crystal accumulating plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, into a crystal accumulating plant. Calcium oxalate crystal accumulating A. thaliana lines were generated by ectopic expression of a single bacterial gene encoding an oxalic acid biosynthetic enzyme. Biochemical and cellular studies suggested that the engineered A. thaliana lines formed crystals of calcium oxalate in a manner similar to naturally occurring crystal accumulating plants. The amount of calcium oxalate accumulated in leaves also reached levels similar to those measured in the leaves of Medicago truncatula in which the crystals are known to play a defensive role. Visual inspection of the different engineered lines, however, suggested a phenotypic consequence on plant growth and development with higher calcium oxalate concentrations. The restoration of a near wild-type plant phenotype through an enzymatic reduction of tissue oxalate supported this observation. Overall, this study is a first to provide initial insight into the potential consequences of engineering calcium oxalate crystal formation in non-crystal accumulating plants. [Crystallization of calcium oxalate dihydrate in a buffered calcium-containing glucose solution by irradiation with non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure in the glucose solution by irradiation with non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma (NEAPP), in which the NEAPP plume contacted the solution surface, via the generation of several intermediate organic products such as gluconic acid. A thermodynamically unstable phase of calcium oxalate dihydrate crystallized rapidly during incubation of a NEAPP-irradiated glucose solution that contained calcium ions and was buffered at neutral pH. Longer irradiation times increased the growth rate and the number of seed crystals. [Synthesis of calcium oxalate crystals in culture medium irradiated with atmospheric-pressure of microns in size were synthesized in a culture medium irradiated through contact with a plume of non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasma (NEAPP). The particulates were identified in the crystalline phase as calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD). The original medium contained constituents such as NaCl, d-glucose, CaCl2, and NaHCO3 but not oxalate or oxalic acid. The oxalate was clearly synthesized and crystallized in the medium as thermodynamically unstable COD crystals after the NEAPP irradiation. [Calcium growth modification; in combination with a photophysical investigation has been employed to give insight into the interaction between calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and a series of tetrazole containing crystal growth modifier's (CGM's), in conjunction with characterisation of morphological changes using scanning electron and optical microscopy. The tetrazole CGM's were found to interact by surface adsorption with minimal morphological changes to the COM crystals however, significant interactions via chemisorption were observed; it was discovered that the chemisorption is sufficiently strong for aggregation of the tetrazole species to occur within the crystal during crystallisation. [Reevaluation of the plant \"gemstones\": Calcium oxalate Land plants face the perpetual dilemma of using atmospheric carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and losing water vapors, or saving water and reducing photosynthesis and thus growth. The reason behind this dilemma is that this simultaneous exchange of gases is accomplished through the same minute pores on leaf surfaces, called stomata. In a recent study we provided evidence that pigweed, an aggressive weed, attenuates this problem exploiting large crystals of calcium oxalate as dynamic carbon pools. This plant is able to photosynthesize even under drought conditions, when stomata are closed and water losses are limited, using carbon dioxide from crystal decomposition instead from the atmosphere. Abscisic acid, an alarm signal that causes stomatal closure seems to be implicated in this function and for this reason we named this path \"alarm photosynthesis.\" The so-far \"enigmatic,\" but highly conserved and widespread among plant species calcium oxalate crystals seem to play a crucial role in the survival of plants.

During their growth and development, silkworm larvae accumulate massive amounts of calcium oxalate crystals in their Malpighian tubules with no apparent harm to the organism. This manuscript reports studies of crystal structure in the tubules along with analyses identifying molecular constituents of tubule exudate.

PMID:27471886 [Citrate, not phosphate, can dissolve calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals and detach these crystals Somchai; oxalate monohydrate (COM) kidney stone disease has not yet been implemented due to a lack of well characterized COM dissolution agents. The present study therefore aimed to identify potential COM crystal dissolution compounds. COM crystals were treated with deionized water (negative control), 5 mM EDTA (positive control), 5 mM sodium citrate, or 5mM sodium phosphate. COM crystal dissolution activities of these compounds were evaluated by phase-contrast and video-assisted microscopic examinations, semi-quantitative analysis of crystal size, number and total mass, and spectrophotometric oxalate-dissolution assay. In addition, effects of these compounds on detachment of COM crystals, which adhered tightly onto renal tubular cell surface, were also investigated. The results showed that citrate, not phosphate, had a significant dissolution effect on COM crystals as demonstrated by significant reduction of crystal size (approximately 37% decrease), crystal number (approximately 53% decrease) and total crystal mass (approximately 72% decrease) compared to blank and negative controls. Spectrophotometric oxalate-dissolution assay successfully confirmed the COM crystal dissolution property of citrate. Moreover, citrate could detach up to 85% of the adherent COM crystals from renal tubular cell surface. These data indicate that citrate is better than phosphate for dissolution and detachment of COM crystals. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. [Biosynthesis of l-Ascorbic Acid and Conversion of Carbons 1 and 2 of l-Ascorbic Acid to Oxalic Acid Occurs within Individual Calcium l-Ascorbic acid (AsA) and its metabolic precursors give rise to oxalic acid (OxA) found in calcium oxalate crystals in specialized crystal idioblast cells in plants; however, it is not known if AsA and OxA are synthesized within the crystal idioblast cell or transported in from surrounding mesophyll cells. Isolated developing crystal idioblasts from Pistia stratiotes were used to study the pathway of OxA biosynthesis and to determine if idioblasts contain the entire path and are essentially independent in OxA synthesis. Idioblasts were supplied with various 14C-labeled compounds and examined by micro-autoradiography for incorporation of 14C into calcium oxalate crystals. [14C]OxA gave heavy labeling of crystals, indicating the isolated idioblasts are functional in crystal formation. Incubation with [1-14C]AsA also gave heavy labeling of crystals, whereas [6-14C]AsA gave no labeling. Labeled precursors of AsA (l-[1-14C]galactose; d-[1-14C]mannose) also resulted in crystal labeling, as did the ascorbic acid analog, d-[1-14C]erythorbic acid. Intensity of labeling of isolated idioblasts followed the pattern OxA > AsA (erythorbic acid) > l-galactose > d-mannose. Our results demonstrate that P. stratiotes crystal idioblasts synthesize the OxA used for crystal formation, the OxA is derived from the number 1 and 2 carbons of AsA, and the proposed pathway of ascorbic acid synthesis via d-mannose and l-galactose is operational in individual P. stratiotes crystal idioblasts. These results are discussed with respect to fine control of calcium oxalate precipitation and the concept of crystal idioblasts as independent physiological compartments. PMID:11161021 [Crystallization of calcium oxalates K 2009-10-06 To gain more insight into protein structure-function relationships that govern ectopic biomineralization processes in kidney stone formation, we have studied the ability of urinary proteins (Tamm-Horsfall bone osteopontin, poly-L-aspartic acid (poly asp), poly-L-glutamic acid (poly glu)) in modulating precipitation reactions of kidney stone-related calcium oxalate mono- and dihydrates (COM, COD). Combining scanning confocal microscopy and fluorescence imaging, we determined the crystal faces of COM with which these polypeptides interact; using scanning electron microscopy, we characterized their effects on crystal habits and precipitated volumes. Our findings demonstrate that polypeptide adsorption to COM crystals is dictated first by the polypeptide's affinity for the crystal followed by its preference for a crystal face: basic and relatively hydrophobic macromolecules show no adsorption, while acidic and more hydrophilic polypeptides adsorb either nonspecifically to all faces of COM or preferentially to {100}/{121} edges and {100} faces. However, investigating calcium oxalates grown in the presence of these polypeptides showed that some acidic proteins that adsorb to crystals do not affect crystallization, even if present in excess of physiological concentrations. These proteins (albumin, bikunin, PTF1, recombinant OPN) have estimated total hydrophilicities from 200 to 850 kJ/mol and net negative charges from -9 to -35, perhaps representing a \"window\" in which proteins adsorb and coat urinary crystals (support of excretion) without affecting crystallization. Strongest effects on crystallization were observed for polypeptides that are either highly hydrophilic (>950 kJ/mol) and highly carboxylated (poly asp, poly glu), or else highly hydrophilic and highly phosphorylated (native OPN isoforms), suggesting [Antiurolithiatic Potential of Crystallization Inhibition, formulation prescribed for renal stones by the physicians but has not been experimentally evaluated for its antiurolithiatic potential using cell-lines. This study is aimed to scientifically substantiate the antiurolithiatic effect of Neeri extract (NRE) through calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystallization inhibition, scavenging of free radicals, and protection of renal tubular epithelial NRK-52E cells from oxalate-induced injury. The crystallization inhibition was studied by turbidimetric assay while the free radical scavenging potential was determined for superoxide and nitric oxide (NO) radicals. The cytoprotective effect against oxalate-induced injury was assessed by estimating lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and determining cell viability using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. NRE significantly inhibited the CaOx crystallization in a concentration-dependent manner and also scavenged superoxide (IC 50 302.88 g/ml) and NO (IC 50 300.45 g/ml) free radicals. It did not show any significant cytotoxicity for NRK-52E cells till the highest dose (500 g/ml) and found to be safe. When NRK-52E cells, injured by exposing to oxalate crystals for 24 h, were treated with NRE, it appreciably prevented the cell injury in a dose-dependent manner. It significantly decreased the elevated LDH leakage toward normal range and improved renal cell viability (82.37% \u00b1 0.87%), hence, prevented growth and retention of crystals. The experimental findings concluded that Neeri is a potent antiurolithiatic formulation that inhibited CaOx crystallization and prevented tubular retention of crystals by protecting the renal cells against oxalate-induced injury as well as reducing the oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals. Neeri extract significantly ( P < 0.001) inhibited the in crystallization (88.11% [Physical characteristics of Medicago oxalate crystals determine their effectiveness in insect defense](http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=243652) [USDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database](https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/find-a-publication/) Plant structural traits can act as defense against herbivorous insects, causing them to avoid feeding on a given plant or tissue.

[Plasma oxalic acid oxalate poisoning](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=473488) Zarembski, P. M.; Hodgkinson, A. 1967-01-01 Observations are reported on five cases of suicide or attempted suicide by poisoning with oxalic acid or ethylene glycol. Elevated oxalic acid levels were observed in the plasma, stomach contents, and a number of tissues. Raised oxalic acid levels in plasma were associated with reduced total and ultrafilterable calcium levels. It is suggested that the reduction in plasma total calcium level is due mainly to the deposition of calcium oxalate in the soft tissues, but inhibition of the parathyroid glands may be a contributory factor. Microscopic examination of various tissues indicated that oxalic acid is deposited in the tissues in two forms: (1) crystalline calcium oxalate dihydrate in the kidney and (2) a non-crystalline complex of calcium oxalate and lipid in liver and other tissues. PMID:5602563 [Using MRI to detect and differentiate calcium oxalate and hydroxyapatite crystals and calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHA) crystals were commonly associated with breast benign and malignant lesions, respectively. In this research, CaOX (n = 6) and CaHA (n = 6) crystals in air-bubble-free agarose phantom were studied and characterized by using MRI at 9.4 Tesla scanner. Calcium micro-crystals sizes ranged from 200 - 500 microns were made with either 99% pure CaOX or CaHA powder and embedded in agar to mimic the dimensions and calcium content of breast microcalcifications in vivo. MRI data were acquired with high spatial resolution T2-weighted (T2W) images and gradient echo images with five different echo times (TEs). The crystals areas were determined by setting the threshold relative to agarose signal. The ratio of crystals areas were calculated by the measurements from gradient echo images divided by T2W images. Then the ratios as a function of TE were fitted with the radical function. The results showed that the blooming artifacts due to magnetic susceptibility between agar and CaHA crystals were more than twice as large as the susceptibility in CaOX crystals (p < 0.05). In addition, larger bright rings were observed on gradient echo images around CaHA crystals compared to CaOX crystals. Our results suggest that MRI may provide useful information regarding breast microcalcifications by evaluating the apparent area of crystals ratios obtained between gradient echo and T2W images.

This study endeavors to detail the scientific mechanisms involved in calcium oxalate calculi formation, and, more importantly, their inhibition under growth conditions imposed by the traditional medicinal approach using the herbal extract, Larrea tridentata. The calculi were synthesized without and with Larrea tridentata infusion by employing the single diffusion gel technique. A visible decrease in calcium oxalate crystal growth with increasing amounts of Larrea tridentata herbal infusion was observed in photomicrographs, as well as a color change from white-transparent for pure crystals to light orange-brown for crystals with inhibitor. Analysis of the samples, which includes Raman, infrared absorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) techniques, demonstrate an overall transition in morphology of the crystals from monohydrate without herbal extract to dihydrate with inhibitor. Furthermore, the resulting data from Raman and infrared absorption support the possibilities of the influences, in this complex process, of NDGA and its derivative compounds from Larrea tridentata, and of the bonding of the magnesium of the inhibitor with the oxalate ion on the surface of the calculi crystals. This assumption corroborates well with the micrographs obtained under higher magnification, which show that the separated small crystallites consist of darker brownish cores, which we attribute to the dominance of growth inhibition by NDGA, surrounded by light transparent thin shells, which possibly correspond to passivation of the crystals by magnesium oxalate. The SEM results reveal the transformation from the dominant monoclinic structure of the calcium oxalate crystals grown alone to the tetragonal [Osteopontin regulates adhesion of calcium of calcium crystals with renal tubular cells is an important factor during the formation of urinary stones. We previously reported the strong expression of osteopontin (OPN) on renal tubular cells in the stone-forming kidney, suggesting that OPN plays a role in the crystal-cell interaction. In the present study, we examined the biological consequences of inhibiting OPN expression at the translational level on the formation and adhesion of crystals. We synthesized antisense OPN expression vector (pTet-OPNas) using the tetracycline-regulated expression system. The pTet-OPNas was constructed using a mouse OPN cDNA sequence in an inverted (antisense) orientation. Two clones (NRK-52E/ASs) were identified by transfection of pTet-OPNas into NRK-52E cells and they showed a marked reduction of OPN synthesis in the absence of tetracycline. Calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal suspension was spread homogeneously on top of the NRK-52E cells. After incubation, the association of CaOx crystals and cells was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Intact NRK-52E cells, NRK-52E cells transfected with empty vector and tetracycline-treated antisense clones (NRK-52E/ASs), under identical conditions, were associated with CaOx crystals. In contrast, the expression of antisense OPN prevented the association of CaOx crystals with NRK-52E cells. Osteopontin plays a crucial role in the adhesion process of CaOx crystals to renal tubular cells in stone formation. [Contribution of calcium oxalate to soil-exchangeable calcium](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70103893) Dauer, Jenny M.; Perakis, Steven S. 2013-01-01 Acid deposition and repeated biomass harvest have decreased soil calcium (Ca) availability in many temperate forests worldwide, yet existing methods for assessing available soil Ca do not fully characterize soil Ca forms. To account for discrepancies in ecosystem Ca budgets, it has been hypothesized that the highly insoluble biomineral Ca oxalate might represent an additional soil Ca pool that is not detected in standard measures of soil-exchangeable Ca. We asked whether several standard method extractants for soil-exchangeable Ca could also access Ca held in Ca oxalate crystals using spike recovery tests in both pure solutions and soil extractions. In solutions of the extractants ammonium chloride, ammonium acetate, and barium chloride, we observed 2% to 104% dissolution of Ca oxalate crystals, with dissolution increasing with both solution molarity and ionic potential of cation extractant. In spike recovery tests using a low-Ca soil, we estimate that 1 M ammonium acetate extraction dissolved sufficient Ca oxalate to contribute an additional 52% to standard measurements of soil-exchangeable Ca. However, in a high-Ca soil, the amount of Ca oxalate spike that would dissolve in 1 M ammonium acetate extraction was difficult to detect against the large pool of exchangeable Ca. We conclude that Ca oxalate can contribute substantially to standard estimates of soil-exchangeable Ca in acid forest soils with low soil-exchangeable Ca. Consequently, measures of exchangeable Ca are unlikely to fully resolve discrepancies in ecosystem Ca mass balance unless the contribution of Ca oxalate to exchangeable Ca is also assessed. [In vitro inhibition of calcium oxalate crystallization and crystal adherence to renal a multifactorial disease and remains a public health problem around the world. Of all types of renal stones, calcium oxalate (CaOx) is the most common composition formed in the urinary system of the patients with urolithiasis. The present study is aimed at evaluating the antiurolithiatic properties of the Tris-Cl extract (TE) of Terminalia arjuna (T. arjuna). The antilithiatic activity of TE of T. arjuna was investigated on nucleation, aggregation, and growth of the CaOx crystals, as well as its protective potency was tested on oxalate-induced cell injury of NRK-52E renal epithelial cells. Also, in vitro antioxidant activity of TE T. arjuna bark was also determined. The TE of T. arjuna exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of nucleation and growth of CaOx crystals. Inhibition of aggregation of CaOx crystals remains constant. When NRK-52E cells were injured by exposure to oxalate for 48 h, the TE prevented the cells from injury and CaOx crystal adherence resulting in increased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The TE also scavenged the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals with an IC50 at 51.72 \u00b5g/mL. The results indicated that T. arjuna is a potential candidate for phytotherapy against urolithiasis as it attains the ability to inhibit CaOx crystallization and scavenge DPPH free radicals in vitro along with a cytoprotective role. [Characterization of Calcium Oxalates Generated as Monje, Paula V.; Baran, Enrique J. 2002-01-01 The chemical composition and morphology of solid material isolated from various Cactaceae species have been analyzed. All of the tested specimens deposited high-purity calcium oxalate crystals in their succulent modified stems. These deposits occurred most frequently as round-shaped druses that sometimes coexist with abundant crystal sand in the tissue. The biominerals were identified either as CaC2O4.2H2O (weddellite) or as CaC2O4.H2O (whewellite). Seven different species from the Opuntioideae subfamily showed the presence of whewellite, and an equal number of species from the Cereoideae subfamily showed the deposition of weddellite. The chemical nature of these deposits was assessed by infrared spectroscopy. The crystal morphology of the crystals was visualized by both conventional light and scanning electron microscopy. Weddellite druses were made up of tetragonal crystallites, whereas those from whewellite were most often recognized by their acute points and general star-like shape. These studies clearly demonstrated that members from the main traditional subfamilies of the Cactaceae family could synthesize different chemical forms of calcium oxalate, suggesting a definite but different genetic control. The direct relationship established between a given Cactaceae species and a definite calcium oxalate biomineral seems to be a useful tool for plant identification and chemotaxonomy.

[Calcium oxalate syntheses in a solution containing glucose by the atmospheric pressure plasma irradiation](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016APS..GECSR3002K) [NASA Astrophysics Data pressure plasma (NEAPP) has been attracted attention because of its characteristic high reactivity even in a low temperature so that various phenomena by the NEAPP such as a sterilization, growth promotion and so forth have been reported around the world. Previously, we reported the NEAPP irradiation generated the calcium oxalate crystals in the medium, which contains 31 kinds of organics and inorganics. The Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) which was used in previous study is composed of no oxalate. Interestingly, not only crystallization but also synthesis of the oxalate was occurred by the NEAPP irradiation. Also the crystallization details were analyzed with the X-ray diffraction (XRD). In this study, we have clarified the mechanism on the crystallization due that D-glucose, calcium ion and bicarbonate ions are minimum essential components. The oxalate synthesis was proved by the gas chromatography and mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Finally, we conclude that a supersaturation of oxalic acid synthesized in those 3 species by the NEAPP.

[Nanoscale observations of the effect of citrate on calcium oxalate precipitation on (CaC2O4xH2O) minerals are naturally occurring minerals found in fossils, plants, kidney stones and is a by-product in some processes such as paper, food and beverage production [1,2]. In particular, calcium oxalate monohydrate phase (COM) also known as whewellite (CaC2O4H2O), is the most frequently reported mineral phase found in urinary and kidney stones together with phosphates. Organic additives are well known to play a key role in the formation of minerals in both biotic and abiotic systems, either facilitating their precipitation or hindering it. In this regard, recent studies have provided direct evidence demonstrating that citrate species could enhance dissolution of COM and inhibit their precipitation. [3,4] The present work aims at evauate the influence of pH, citrate and oxalic acid concentrations in calcium oxalate precipitation on calcite surfaces (Island Spar, Chihuahua, Mexico) through in-situ nanoscale observation using in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker) in flow-through experiments. Changes in calcium oxalate morphologies and precipitated phases were observed, as well as the inhibitory effect of citrate on calcium oxalate precipitation, which also lead to stabilization an the amorphous calcium oxalate phase.

The present study attempted to evaluate the antilithiatic properties of Tribulus terrestris commonly called as \"gokhru\" which is often used in ayurveda to treat various urinary diseases including urolithiasis. The activity of Tribulus terrestris was investigated on nucleation and the growth of the calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals as well as on oxalate induced cell injury of NRK 52E renal epithelial cells. Tribulus terrestris extract exhibited a concentration dependent inhibition of nucleation and the growth of CaOx crystals. When NRK-52E cells were injured by exposure to oxalate for 72 h, Tribulus terrestris extract prevented the injury in a dose-dependent manner. On treatment with the different concentrations of the plant, the cell viability increased and lactate dehydrogenase release decreased in a concentration dependent manner. The current data suggests that Tribulus terrestris extract not only has a potential to inhibit nucleation and the growth of the CaOx crystals but also has a cytoprotective role. Our results indicate that it could be a potential candidate for phytotherapy against urolithiasis. [Lowering urinary John; Assimos, Dean G. 2016-01-01 Dietary modifications should be considered as a first line approach in the treatment of idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. The amounts of oxalate and calcium consumed in the diet are significant factors in the development of the disease due to their impact on urinary oxalate excretion. There are a number of strategies that can be employed to reduce oxalate excretion. The consumption of oxalate-rich foods should be avoided and calcium intake adjusted to 1000-1200 mg/day. To encourage compliance it should be emphasized to patients that they be vigilant with this diet as a deviation in any meal or snack could potentially result in significant stone growth. The evidence underlying these two modifications is outlined and other strategies to reduce urinary oxalate excretion are reviewed.

[Herbal extracts of calcium crystals in [NASA Astrophysics Data System S.; B.; Joshi, M. J.; Vaidya, A. B. 2005-02-01 A large number of people in this world are suffering from urinary stone problem. Calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) containing stones (calculi) are commonly found. In the present study, COM crystals were grown by a double diffusion gel growth technique using U-tubes. The gel was prepared from hydrated sodium metasilicate solution. The gel framework acts like a three-dimensional crucible in which the crystal nuclei are delicately held in the position of their formation, and nutrients are supplied for the growth. This technique can be utilized as a simplified screening static model to study the growth, inhibition and dissolution of urinary stones in vitro. The action of putative litholytic studied in of COM crystals. Tribulus terrestris and Bergenia ligulata are commonly used as herbal medicines for urinary calculi in India. To verify the inhibitive effect, aqueous extracts of Tribulus terrestris and Bergenia ligulata were added along with the supernatant solutions. The growth was measured and compared, with and without the aqueous extracts. Inhibition of COM crystal growth was observed in the herbal extracts. Maximum inhibition was observed in Bergenia ligulata followed by Tribulus terrestris. The results are discussed.

[Characterization of calcium oxalate biominerals The water-accumulating leaves of crassulacean acid metabolism plants belonging to five different families were investigated for the presence of biominerals by infrared spectroscopic and microscopic analyses. Spectroscopic results revealed that the mineral present in succulent species of Agavaceae, Aizoaceae, H2O). Crystals were predominantly found as raphides or solitary crystals of various morphologies. However, representative Crassulaceae members and a succulent species of Asteraceae did not show the presence of biominerals. Overall, these results suggest no correlation between calcium oxalate generation and crassulacean acid metabolism in succulent plants. [Diet, but not oral J; Goldfarb, David S 2010-12-01 We examined the effect of a controlled diet and two probiotic preparations on urinary oxalate excretion, a risk factor for calcium oxalate kidney stone formation, in patients with mild hyperoxaluria. Patients were randomized to a placebo, a probiotic, or a synbiotic preparation. This tested whether these probiotic preparations can increase oxalate metabolism in the intestine and/or decrease oxalate absorption from the gut. Patients were maintained on a controlled diet to remove the confounding variable of differing oxalate intake from food. Urinary oxalate excretion and calcium oxalate supersaturation on the controlled diet were significantly lower compared with baseline on a free-choice diet. Neither study preparation reduced urinary oxalate excretion nor calcium oxalate supersaturation. Fecal lactobacilli colony counts increased on both preparations, whereas enterococcal and yeast colony counts were increased on the synbiotic. Total urine volume and the excretion of oxalate and calcium were all strong independent determinants of urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation. Hence, dietary urinary the tested probiotics did not influence urinary oxalate levels in patients on a restricted oxalate diet. However, this study suggests that dietary oxalate restriction is useful for kidney stone prevention. [Autophagy inhibition attenuates hyperoxaluria-induced renal tubular oxidative injury and calcium oxalate crystal depositions in the rat kidney.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653411) Duan, Xiaolu; Kong, Zhenzhen; Mai, Xin; 2018-06-01 Hyperoxaluria-induced oxidative injury of renal tubular epithelial cell is a casual and essential factor in kidney calcium oxalate (CaOx) stone formation. Autophagy has been shown to be critical for the regulation of oxidative stress-induced renal tubular injury; however, little is known about its role in kidney CaOx stone formation. In the present study, we found that the autophagy antagonist chloroquine could significantly attenuate oxalate-induced autophagy activation, oxidative injury and mitochondrial damage of renal tubular cells in vitro and in vivo, as well as hyperoxaluria-induced CaOx crystals depositions in rat kidney, whereas the autophagy agonist rapamycin exerted contrasting effects. In was significantly attenuated by chloroquine pretreatment but was markedly enhanced by rapamycin pretreatment, whereas the protective effect of chloroquine on rat renal tubular cell oxidative injury was partly reversed by a p38 protein kinase activator anisomycin. Furthermore, the knockdown of similar chloroquine on oxalate-induced cell oxidative injury and p38 phosphorylation in vitro. Taken together, our results revealed that autophagy inhibition could attenuate oxalate-induced oxidative injury of renal tubular cell and CaOx crystal depositions in the rat kidney via, at least in part, inhibiting the activation of p38 signaling pathway, thus representing a novel role of autophagy in the regulation of oxalate-induced renal oxidative injury and CaOx crystal depositions for the first time.

[Antilithiatic Activity of phlorotannin rich extract of Sarghassum Wightii on Calcium Oxalate is a common urological disorder responsible for serious human affliction and cost to the society with a high recurrence rate. The aim of the present study was to systematically evaluate the phlorotannin rich extract of Sargassum wightii using suitable in vitro and in vivo models to provide scientific evidence for its antilithiatic activity. Materials and Methods: To explore the effect of Sargassum wightii on calcium oxalate crystallization, in vitro assays like crystal nucleation, aggregation and crystal growth were performed. Calcium oxalate urolithiasis was induced in male Sprague dawley rats using a combination of gentamicin and calculi producing diet (5% ammonium oxalate and rat pellet feed). The biochemical parameters like calcium, oxalate, magnesium, phosphate, sodium and potassium were evaluated in urine, serum and kidney homogenates. Histopathological studies were also done to confirm the biochemical findings. Results: The yield of Sargassum wightii extract was found to be 74.5 gm/kg and confirmed by quantitative analysis. In vitro experiments with Sargassum wightii showed concentration dependent inhibition of calcium oxalate nucleation, aggregation and growth supported by SEM analysis. In the in vivo model, Sargassum wightii reduced both calcium and oxalate supersaturation in urine, serum and deposition in the kidney. The biochemical results were supported by histopathological studies. Conclusion: The findings of the present study suggest that Sargassum wightii has the ability to prevent nucleation, aggregation and growth of calcium oxalate crystals. Sargassum wightii has better preventive effect on calcium oxalate stone formation indicating its strong potential to develop as a therapeutic option to prevent recurrence of urolithiasis. PMID:26200544 [Cooperation of 2011-10-01 Osteopontin (OPN) is one of a group of proteins found in urine that are believed to limit the formation of kidney stones. In the present study, we investigate the roles of phosphate and carboxylate groups in the OPN-mediated modulation of calcium oxalate (CaOx), the principal mineral phase found in kidney stones. To this end, crystallization was induced by addition of CaOx solution to ultrafiltered human urine containing either human kidney OPN (kOPN; 7 consecutive carboxylates, 8 phosphates) or synthesized residues 65-80 pOPAR) 220-235 (pSHEpSTEQSDAIDpSAEK; P3) of rat bone OPN. Sequence 65-80 was also synthesized without the phosphate group (OPAR). Effects on calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and dihydrate (COD) formation were studied by scanning electron microscopy. We found that controls form large, partly intergrown COM platelets; COD was never observed. Adding any of the polyelectrolytes was sufficient to prevent intergrowth of COM platelets entirely, inhibiting formation of these platelets strongly, and inducing formation of the COD phase. Strongest effects on COM formation were found for pOPAR and OPAR followed by kOPN and then P3, showing that acidity and hydrophilicity are crucial in polyelectrolyte-affected COM crystallization. At higher concentrations, OPAR also inhibited COD formation, while P3, kOPN and, in particular, pOPAR promoted COD, a difference explainable by the variations of carboxylate and phosphate groups present in the molecules. Thus, we conclude that carboxylate groups play a primary role in inhibiting COM formation, but phosphate and carboxylate groups are both important in initiating and promoting COD formation. [Specific Adsorption of Osteopontin and A.; Hunter, Graeme K. 2007-01-01 Protein-crystal interactions are known to be important in biomineralization. To study the physicochemical basis of such interactions, we have developed a technique that combines confocal microscopy of crystals with fluorescence imaging of proteins. In this study, osteopontin (OPN), a protein abundant in urine, was labeled with the fluorescent dye AlexaFluor-488 and added to crystals of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM), the major constituent of kidney stones. In five to seven optical sections along the z axis, scanning confocal microscopy was used to visualize COM crystals and fluorescence imaging to map OPN adsorbed to the crystals. To quantify the relative adsorption to different crystal faces, fluorescence intensity was measured around the perimeter of the crystal in several sections. Using this method, it was shown that OPN adsorbs with high specificity to the edges between {100} and {121} faces of COM and much less so to {100}, {121}, or {010} faces. By contrast, poly-L-aspartic to {121} faces, whereas poly-L-glutamic acid adsorbs to all faces approximately equally. Growth of COM in the presence of rat bone OPN results in dumbbell-shaped crystals. We hypothesize that the edge-specific adsorption of OPN may be responsible for the dumbbell morphology of COM crystals found in human urine. PMID:17496021 [Impact of Dietary Calcium and Oxalate, Enteric colonization with Oxalobacter formigenes, a bacterium whose main energy source is oxalate, has been demonstrated to decrease the risk of recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. We assessed the impact of diets controlled in calcium and oxalate contents on urinary and fecal analytes in healthy subjects who were naturally colonized with O. formigenes or not colonized with O. formigenes. Materials and Methods A total of 11 O. formigenes colonized and 11 noncolonized subjects were administered diets controlled in calcium and oxalate contents. We assayed 24-hour urine collections and stool samples obtained on the last 4 days of each 1-week diet for stone risk parameters and O. formigenes levels. Mixed model analysis was used to determine the effects of colonization status on these variables. Results Urinary calcium and oxalate excretion were significantly altered by the dietary changes in O. formigenes colonized and noncolonized individuals. Mixed model analysis showed significant interaction between colonization status and oxalate excretion on a low calcium (400 mg daily)/moderate oxalate (250 mg daily) diet (p = 0.026). excretion was 19.5% lower in O. formigenes than in noncolonized subjects on the low calcium/moderate oxalate diet (mean \u00b1 SE 34.9 \u00b1 2.6 vs 43.6 \u00b1 2.6 mg, p = 0.031). Conclusions Results suggest that O. formigenes colonization decreases oxalate excretion during periods of low calcium and moderate oxalate intake.

The present study aimed to determine whether urinary oxalate and pH may be affected by vitamin C supplementation in calcium stone-forming patients. Forty-seven adult calcium stone-forming patients received either 1 g (N=23) or 2 g (N=24) of vitamin C supplement for 3 days and 20 healthy subjects received 1 g. A 24-hour urine sample was obtained both before and after vitamin C for calcium, oxalate, magnesium, citrate, sodium, potassium, and creatinine determination. The Tiselius index was used as a calcium oxalate crystallization index. A spot fasting morning urine sample was also obtained to determine the urinary pH before and after vitamin C. Fasting urinary pH did not change after 1 g (5.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 5.8 +/- 0.7) or 2 g vitamin C (5.8 +/- 0.8 vs. 5.8 +/- 0.7). A significant increase in mean urinary oxalate was observed in calcium stone-forming patients receiving either 1 g (50 +/- 16 vs. 31 +/- 12 mg/24 hours) or 2 g (48 +/- 21 vs. 34 +/- 12 mg/24 hours) of vitamin C and in healthy subjects (25 +/- 12 vs. 39 +/- 13 mg/24 hours). A significant increase in mean Tiselius index was observed in calcium stone-forming patients after 1 g (1.43 +/- 0.70 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.65) or 2 g vitamin C (1.61 +/- 1.05 vs. 0.99 +/- 0.55) and in healthy subjects (1.50 +/- 0.69 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.46). Ancillary analyses of spot urine obtained after vitamin C were performed in 15 control subjects in vessels with or without ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) with no difference in urinary oxalate between them (28 +/- 23 vs. 26 +/- 21 mg/L), suggesting that the in vitro conversion of ascorbate to oxalate did not occur. These data suggest that vitamin C supplementation may increase urinary oxalate excretion and the risk of calcium oxalate crystallization in calcium stone-forming patients. [A Study Growth Modifiers System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Kwak, Junha John Crystallization processes are ubiquitous in nature, science, and technology. Controlling crystal growth is pivotal in many industries as material properties and functions can be tailored by tuning crystal habits (e.g. size, shape, phase). In biomineralization, organisms exert excellent control over bottom-up synthesis and assembly of inorganic-organic structures (e.g. bones, teeth, exoskeletons). This is made possible by growth modifiers that range from small molecules to macromolecules, such as proteins. Molecular recognition of the mineral phase allows proteins to function as nucleation templates, matrices, and growth inhibitors or promoters. We are interested in taking a biomimetic approach to control crystallization via biomolecular growth modifiers. We investigated calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM), found in plants and kidney stones, as a model system of crystallization. We studied the effects of four common proteins on COM crystallization: bovine serum albumin (BSA), transferrin, lactoferrin, and COM crystallization, we classified BSA and lysozyme as COM growth inhibitor and promoter respectively. Their inhibition and promotion effects were also evident in the macroscopic crystal habit. Through adsorption and microscopy experiments, we showed that BSA exhibits binding specificity for the apical surfaces of macroscopic COM crystals. Lysozyme, on the other, functions via a non-binding mechanism at the surface to accelerate the growth of the apical surfaces. We also synthesized and studied peptides derived from the protein primary sequences to identify putative domains responsible for these inhibition and promotion effects. Collectively, our study of physiologically relevant biomolecules suggests potential roles of COM modifiers in pathological crystallization and helps to develop guidelines for rational design of biomolecular growth modifiers for applications in crystal engineering. [Oxalate and Sucralose Absorption in Idiopathic Calcium Oxalate Stone Formers](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3152675) Juquan; Ross P.; Assimos, Dean G. 2011-01-01 Objectives Oxalate has been hypothesized to undergo absorption in the large and small intestine by both paracellular and transepithelial transport. Sucralose is a chlorinated sugar that is absorbed by paracellular mechanisms. This study's objective was to better understand intestinal oxalate transport by correlating oxalate and sucralose absorption Methods Idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers were recruited to provide urine specimens on both a self-selected diet and following a meal containing 90 mg of 13C2-oxalate and 5 grams of sucralose, and a stool sample for determination of Oxalobacter formigenes colonization. The 24 hour urine collections were fractionated into the first 6 hours and the subsequent 18 hours. Sucralose and oxalate excretion were measured during these periods and used to estimate absorption. Results A total of 38 subjects were evaluated. The majority of both the 13C2-oxalate and sucralose absorption occurred within the 0-6 hour collection. The 13C2-oxalate and sucralose absorptions were significantly correlated at the 0-6 hour, the 6-24 hour, and the total 24 hour time periods (p<0.04). All five oxalate hyperabsorbers(> 15% absorption) also absorbed significantly more sucralose during the 0-6 hour and whole 24 hour time points (p<0.04). Oxalobacter formigenes colonization did not significantly alter oxalate absorption. Conclusion The results suggest that the majority of oxalate is absorbed in the proximal portion of the gastrointestinal tract and that paracelluar transport is involved. Augmented paracellular transport, as evidenced by increased sucralose absorption, may also influence oxalate absorption. PMID:21676449 [Calcium oxalate contribution to calcium cycling of nutrient status](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714005180#) Dauer, Jenny M.; Perakis, oxalate) is an insoluble biomineral that forms in plants and fungi, and occurs in soils across many types of ecosystems. Assessing how Ca oxalate may shape ecosystem Ca cycling requires information on the distribution of Ca oxalate among plant biomass, detritus, and mineral soil, and how it varies with ecosystem Ca status. We compared two Douglas-fir forests of contrasting ecosystem Ca availability, and found that Ca oxalate was partitioned similarly among plant biomass, detritus and mineral soil major ecosystem compartments at both sites, and total pools of Ca oxalate were greater in the high-Ca forest. However, the proportional importance of Ca oxalate was greater in the low-Ca than high-Ca forest (18% versus 4% of actively cycling ecosystem Ca, respectively). And calcium oxalate in mineral soil, which is of particular interest as a potential long-term Ca reservoir, was a larger portion of total available Ca (exchangeable Ca plus Ca oxalate Ca) in the low-Ca site than the high-Ca site (9% versus 1% of available soil Ca, respectively). Calcium oxalate was the dominant form of Ca returned from plants to soil as leaf litterfall at the high-Ca site, yet calcium oxalate disappeared rapidly from decomposing litter (0.28 yr1 or faster) at both sites. We conclude that accumulation of Ca oxalate in forest ecosystems appears most closely related to overall Ca supply for live biomass pools, and that the accumulation of Ca oxalate in forest floor and mineral soil is limited by rapid microbial degradation of putatively unavailable Ca oxalate.

[Size-dependent cellular uptake mechanism and cytotoxicity toward calcium oxalate on Vero cells](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017NatSR...741949S) [NASA Ouyang, Jian-Ming 2017-02-01 Urinary crystals with various sizes are present in healthy individuals and patients with kidney stone; however, the cellular uptake mechanism of calcium oxalate of various sizes has not been elucidated. This study aims to compare the internalization of nano-/micron-sized (50 nm, 100 nm, and 1 m) calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and dihydrate (COD) crystals in African green monkey renal epithelial (Vero) cells. The internalization and adhesion of COM and COD crystals to Vero cells were enhanced with decreasing crystal size. Cell death rate was positively related to the amount of adhered and internalized crystals and exhibited higher correlation with internalization than that with adhesion. Vero cells mainly internalized nano-sized COM and COD crystals through clathrin-mediated pathways as well as micron-sized crystals through macropinocytosis. The internalized COM and COD crystals were distributed in the lysosomes and destroyed lysosomal integrity to some extent. The results of this study indicated that the size of crystal affected cellular uptake mechanism, and may provide an enlightenment for finding potential inhibitors of crystal uptake, thereby decreasing cell injury and the occurrence of kidney stones. [SaRNA-mediated activation of TRPV5 reduces renal calcium oxalate deposition in rat via decreasing urinary calcium excretion.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28776078) Zeng, Tao; Duan, Zeng, Guohua 2018-06-01 Hypercalciuria is a main risk factor for kidney stone formation. TRPV5 is the gatekeeper protein for mediating calcium transport and reabsorption in the kidney. In the present study, we tested the effect of TRPV5 activation with small activating RNA (saRNA), which could induce gene expression by targeting the promoter of the gene, on ethylene glycol (EG)-induced calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals formation in rat kidney. Five pairs of RNA activation sequences targeting the promoter of rat TRPV5 were designed and synthesized. The synthesized saRNA with the strongest activating effect was selected, and transcellular calcium transportation was tested by Fura-2 analysis. Subsequently, Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into three groups and fed with water, 1% EG for 28 days after injecting the negative control saRNA, 1% EG for 28 days after injecting the selected TRPV5-saRNA, respectively. The CaOx crystal formation and the 24-h urine components were assessed. In vitro study, saRNA ds-320 could significantly activate the expression of TRPV5 and transcellular calcium transportation. In vivo study, after 28 days treatment of EG, rats pre-infected with saRNA ds-320 had lower urinary calcium excretion and renal CaOx crystals formation as compared to that pre-infected with negative control saRNA. Activation of TRVP5 with saRNA ds-320 could inhibit EG-induced calcium oxalate crystals formation via promoting urine calcium reabsorption and decreasing urine calcium excretion in rats. [Medical therapy, calcium oxalate M. S.; Pak, C. Y. 1997-01-01 The development of diagnostic protocols that identify specific risk factors for calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis has led to the formulation of directed medical regimens that are aimed at correcting the underlying metabolic disturbances. Initiation of these treatment programs has reduced markedly the rate of stone formation in the majority of patients who form stones. This article discusses the rationale that underlies the choice of medical therapy for the various pathophysiologic causes of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis and the appropriate use of available medications. [Distribution of organic matrix in calcium oxalate renal calculi.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6791784) B; Goldberg, E P 1981-01-01 The quantity of protein and carbohydrate comprising the matrix of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) renal stones was found to decrease with distance from the surface of the stone. The average organic concentration of stones 3 to 30 mm in diameter ranged from 5.7% at the surface to 2.7% at the core. This concentration gradient suggests matrix involvement in a \"growth front\" on stone surfaces with migration of organic material from the \"older\" interior. The matrix distribution was not readily correlated with density variations or with the presence of hydroxyapatite or calcium oxalate dihydrate. Surface matrix concentrations were greater than amounts predicted by physical adsorption. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of the organic-rich surface layer and also suggested that increase in stone size occurs predominantly by crystal growth with microcrystal aggregates as growth centers. [Flow-driven pattern of calcium oxalate is studied experimentally in the presence of spatial gradients by controlled flow of calcium into oxalate solution. The density difference between the reactants leads to strong convection in the form of a gravity current that drives the spatiotemporal pattern formation. The phase diagram of the system is constructed, the evolving precipitate patterns are analyzed and quantitatively characterized by their diameters and the average height of the gravity flow. The compact structures of calcium oxalate monohydrate produced at low flow rates are replaced by the thermodynamically unstable calcium oxalate dihydrate favored in the presence of a strong gravity current. [Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate gout and other crystal deposition diseases.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1654974) Reginato, A J 1991-08-01 The number of crystal or birefringent particles associated with arthritis is increasing, and a uniform taxonomy is needed. The term gout has been proposed as a generic term for these diseases based on historical, clinical, and crystallographic reasons. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate gout follows monosodium urate gout in frequency, and its spectrum of clinical manifestations continues to grow. Familial calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate gout was described for the first time in kindreds studied in England and Tunisia; new Jewish and Spanish kindreds were also reported. Type I collagen was shown to nucleate nativelike calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals, and pyrophosphate elaboration was explored in cartilage explants in an attempt to reproduce the in vivo metabolic or endocrine disorders associated with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate gout. The effect of pyrophosphatase and different cofactors such as magnesium in dissolving calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals was investigated. High-resolution electron microscopy was used to study the interrelation between apatite and other basic calcium phosphate crystals in apatite gout. Raman microscopy was applied for the first time to identify crystals in biologic specimens. A simple and specific technique for basic calcium phosphate crystal identification is necessary to understand the relationship between different calcium phosphate crystals and osteoarthritis. Several reports about children and young patients with primary oxalate gout described the effect of oxalate on eyes, periodontal tissues, and bone. Multicenter studies showed poor results of renal transplantation, but favored combined liver and renal transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [Calciphytoliths (calcium oxalate crystals) analysis for the identification of decayed tea plants sinensis L.).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25342006) Zhang, Jianping; Lu, Houyuan; Huang, Linpei 2014-10-24 The history of tea is poorly known, mainly due to the questionable identification of decayed tea plants in archaeological samples. This paper attempts to test the utility of calciphytoliths (calcium oxalate crystals) for the identification of tea in archaeological samples. It provides the first survey of the macropatterns of calciphytoliths in several species of Theaceae and common non-Theaceae plants. Crystals were extracted from 45 samples of tea, Theaceae and common non-Theaceae plants, and detected microscopically between crossed polarizers. In tea plants, druse and trichome base are the most distinctive crystals. Druses have the smallest diameter (11.65 \u00b1 3.64 m), and trichome bases have four distinctive straight and regular cracks, similar to a regular extinction cross. The results provide morphological criteria for distinguishing tea from other plants, specifically the presence of identifiable druses together with calcified trichome bases. The implications are significant for understanding the history of tea and plant exploitation, especially for plants for which the preservation of macrofossils is poor. [Concave Urinary Crystallines: Direct Evidence of Calcium Oxalate Crystals Dissolution Citrate In Vivo](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3855932) Shang, Yun-Feng; Xu, Zhang, Guang-Na; Ouyang, Jian-Ming 2013-01-01 The changes in urinary crystal properties in patients with calcium oxalate (CaOx) calculi after oral administration of potassium citrate (K3cit) were investigated via atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD), and zeta potential analyzer. The AFM and SEM results showed that the surface of urinary crystals became concave, the edges and corners of crystals became blunt, the average size of urinary crystallines decreased significantly, and aggregation of urinary crystals was reduced. These changes were attributed to the significant increase in concentration of excreted citrate to 492 \u00b1 \u00b1 before K3cit intake. After the amount urinary citrate was increased, it complexed with Ca2+ ions on urinary crystals, which dissolved these crystals. Thus, the appearance of concave urinary crystals was a direct evidence of CaOx dissolution by citrate in vivo. The XRD results showed that the quantities and species of urinary crystals decreased after K3cit intake. The mechanism of inhibition of formation of CaOx stones by K3cit was possibly due to the complexation of Ca2+ with citrate, increase in urine pH, concentration of urinary inhibitor glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and the absolute value of zeta potential after K3cit intake. PMID:24363634 [Novel porcine model for calcium stone are not clearly delineated. Porcine are the most anatomically and physiologically congruent mammal to humans. Our objectives were to develop a cost-effective and easily reproducible porcine model for the study of calcium-based nephrolithiasis. Crossbred male pigs (n = 16) were assigned randomly to one of the following treatments: (1) control; (2) ethylene glycol (EG) + vitamin AC; (7) EG + VD + G. Treatments were administered for 28 days; blood and urine were collected on day 0, 14, and 28. At the endpoint of the study, renal tissue was collected for gross and microscopic analysis of crystal stone formation and inflammation. Stone-forming parameters were observed in serum and urine. For control versus all other treatments, by day 28, serum BUN and creatinine were less (P < 0.01), urinary creatinine, citrate and pH were greater (P < 0.01), and urinary oxalate was less (P < 0.01). Histopathological analysis of H&E staining and stone analysis revealed formation of calcium oxalate stones and crystal formation within the renal cortex and medulla for all animals except control. Nephrotoxicity was observed in one animal from treatment EG + G. The treatments explored in this experiment provided novel examples of cost-effective porcine models for the study of nephrolithiasis. EG + VD had the strongest indicators of nephrolithiasis nephrotoxicity. [Oxalate absorption and endogenous oxalate absorption or endogenous oxalate synthesis can contribute to hyperoxaluria, a primary risk factor for the formation of calcium oxalate-containing kidney stones. This study involves a comparative assessment of oxalate absorption and endogenous oxalate synthesis (SFs) and non-stone formers (NSFs) and assessment of of supplementation on oxalate absorption and endogenous oxalate synthesis. Twenty-nine individuals with a history of calcium oxalate kidney stones (19 men, 10 women) and 19 age-matched NSFs (8 men, 11 women) participated in two 6-day controlled feeding experimental periods: ascorbate-supplement (2 g/d) and no-supplement treatments. An oxalate load consisting of 118 mg of unlabeled oxalate and 18 mg of 13C2 -oxalic acid was administered the morning of day 6 of each experimental period. Mean 13C2 -oxalic acid absorption averaged across the ascorbate and no-supplement treatments was significantly greater in SFs (9.9%) NSFs SFs and treatments. oxalate correlated strongly with both 13C2 absorption (SFs, r = 0.76; P < 0.01; NSFs, r = 0.62; P < 0.01) and endogenous synthesis (SFs, r = 0.95; P < 0.01; NSFs, r = 0.92; P < 0.01). SFs are characterized by greater rates of both oxalate absorption and endogenous oxalate synthesis, and both these factors contribute to the hyperoxaluric state. The finding that ascorbate supplementation increased urinary total and endogenous oxalate levels suggested that this practice is a risk factor for individuals predisposed to kidney stones. [Kinetics of calcium oxalate crystal urine.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27328814) Laube, Norbert; Klein, Florian; Bernsmann, Falk 2017-04-01 It is routinely observed that persons with increased urinary stone risk factors do not necessarily form uroliths. Furthermore, stone formers can present with urinalyses that do not reflect the clinical picture. We explain this discrepancy by differences in crystallization kinetics. In 1162 urines, crystallization of Ca-oxalate was induced according to the BONN-Risk-Index (BRI) method. The urine's relative light transmissivity (RLT) was recorded from 100 % at start of titration to 95 % due to nuclei formation and crystal growth. From the RLT changes, a measure of the thermodynamic inhibition threshold of crystal formation (BRI) and of crystal growth kinetics is derived (\"turbidity slope\" after crystallization onset). On average, subjects presenting with a low inhibition threshold, i.e., high BRI, also present significantly higher crystal growth rates compared with subjects in lower BRI classes. Only subjects in the highest BRI class show a lower growth rate than expected, probably due to a depletion of supersaturation by massive initial nucleation. With increasing thermodynamic risk of crystal formation (i.e., increasing BRI) due to an imbalance between inhibitors and promoters of crystal formation, an increase in the imbalance between inhibitors and promoters of crystal growth (i.e., increasing growth rate) is observed. Both lead to an increased urolith formation risk. Healthy subjects with increased BRI are an exception to this trend: their urine is thermodynamically prone to form stones, but they show a kinetic inhibition preventing nuclei from significant growth. [Factors shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) to treat calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) renal calculi gives excellent fragmentation results. However, the retention of post-ESWL fragments within the kidney remains an important health problem. This study examined the effect of various urinary conditions and crystallization inhibitors on the regrowth of spontaneously-passed post-ESWL COD calculi fragments. Methods Post-ESWL COD calculi fragments were incubated in chambers containing synthetic urine varying in pH and calcium concentration: pH = 5.5 normocalciuria (3.75 mM), pH = 5.5 hypercalciuria (6.25 mM), pH = 6.5 normocalciuria (3.75 mM) or pH = 6.5 hypercalciuria (6.25 mM). Fragment growth was evaluated by measuring increases in weight. Fragment growth was standardized by calculating the relative mass increase. Results Calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals formed on COD renal calculi fragments under all conditions. Under pH = 5.5 normocalciuria conditions, only COM crystals formed (growth rate = 0.22 \u00b1 0.04 g/mg\u00b7h). Under pH = 5.5 hypercalciuria and under pH = 6.5 normocalciuria conditions, COM crystals and a small number of new COD crystals formed (growth rate = 0.32 \u00b1 0.03 g/mg\u00b7h and 0.35 \u00b1 0.05 g/mg\u00b7h, respectively). Under pH = 6.5 hypercalciuria conditions, large amounts of COD, COM, hydroxyapatite and brushite crystals formed (growth rate = 3.87 \u00b1 0. 34 g/mg\u00b7h). A study of three crystallization inhibitors demonstrated that phytate completely inhibited fragment growth (2.27 M at pH = 5.5 and 4.55 M at pH = 6.5, both under hypercalciuria conditions), while 69.0 M pyrophosphate caused an 87% reduction in mass under pH = 6.5 hypercalciuria conditions. In contrast, 5.29 mM citrate did not inhibit fragment mass increase under pH = 6.5 hypercalciuria conditions. Conclusion The growth rate of COD calculi fragments under pH = 6.5 hypercalciuria conditions was approximately ten times that observed under the other three [An assessment of engineered calcium oxalate crystal formation on plant growth and development as a step toward evaluating its use to enhance plant defense](http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=317261) [USDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database](https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/find-a-publication/) The establishment of new approaches to control chewing insects has been sought not only for direct use in reducing crop loss but also in managing resistance to the pesticides already in use.

[Role of cellular oxalate in oxalate clearance of patients with calcium oxalate plasma, and urinary oxalate and erythrocyte oxalate flux in patients with calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) stone formation vs normal controls. Pathologic oxalate clearance in humans is mostly integrated in calcium oxalate stone formation. An underlying cause of deficient oxalate clearance could be defective transmembrane oxalate transport, which, in many tissues, is regulated by an anion exchanger (SLC26). We studied 2 groups: 40 normal controls and 41 patients with COM stone formation. Red blood cells were divided for cellular oxalate measurement and for resuspension in a buffered solution (pH 7.40); 0.1 mmol/L oxalate was added. The supernatant was measured for oxalate immediately and 1 hour after incubation. The plasma and urinary oxalate were analyzed in parallel. The mean cellular oxalate concentrations were significantly greater in the normal controls (5.25 +/- 0.47 micromol/L) than in those with COM stone formation (2.36 +/- 0.28 micromol/L; P < .01). The mean urinary oxalate concentrations were significantly greater in those with COM stone formation (0.31 +/- 0.02 mmol/L) than in the controls (0.24 +/- 0.02 mmol/L; P < .01). The cellular oxalate concentrations correlated significantly with the plasma (r = 0.49-0.63; P < .01) and urinary oxalate (r = -0.29-0.41; P < .03) concentrations in both groups. The plasma oxalate concentrations correlated significantly with the urinary oxalate concentrations (r = -0.30; P < .03) in the controls and with the erythrocyte oxalate flux (r = 0.25; P < .05) in those with COM stone formation. Our data implicate the presence of a cellular oxalate buffer to stabilize plasma and urinary oxalate concentrations in normal controls. [Mimicking the biomolecular control of calcium oxalate K 2012-08-21 Scanning confocal interference microscopy (SCIM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate the adsorption of the synthetic polypeptide poly(l-glutamic acid) (poly-glu) to calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals and its effect on COM formation. At low concentrations (1 g/mL), poly-glu inhibits growth most effectively in 001 directions, indicating strong interactions of the polypeptide with {121} crystal faces. Growth in <010> directions was inhibited only marginally by 1 g/mL poly-glu, while growth in <100> directions did not appear to be affected. This suggests that, at low concentrations, poly-glu inhibits lattice-ion addition to the faces of COM in the order {121} > {010} {100}. At high concentrations (6 g/mL), poly-glu resulted in the formation of dumbbell-shaped crystals featuring concave troughs on the {100} faces. The effects on crystal growth indicate that, at high concentrations, poly-glu interacts with the faces of COM in the order {100} > {121} > {010}. This mirrors MD simulations, which predicted that poly-glu will adsorb to a {100} terrace plane (most calcium-rich) in preference to a {121} (oblique) riser plane but will adsorb to {121} riser plane in preference to an {010} terrace plane (least calcium-rich). The effects of different poly-glu concentration on COM growth (1-6 g/mL) may be due to variations between the faces in terms of growth mechanism and/or (nano)roughness, which can affect surface energy. In addition, 1 g/mL might not be adequate to reach the critical concentration for poly-glu to significantly pin step movement on {100} and {010} faces. Understanding the mechanisms involved in these processes is essential for the development of agents to reduce recurrence of kidney stone disease.

PMID:25342006 [Distribution of calcium oxalate crystals in floral organs of Araceae in relation to pollination strategy.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22753813) Cot\u00e9, Gary G; Gibernau, Marc 2012-07-01 Many flowers are pollinated by potentially hungry insects, yet flowers also contain gametes and embryos which must be protected from predation. Microscopic calcium oxalate crystals in plant tissues have been proposed to protect against herbivory. Aroids, which have an unusual diversity of such crystals, also exhibit diverse pollination strategies. Many species have pollinators that do not feed while visiting the flowers, while other species, especially those pollinated by beetles, offer sterile staminodia as food rewards. We examined flowers of 21 aroid species with various pollination strategies to test the hypothesis that crystals protect vital gametes and embryos while allowing consumption of food bribes. Aroid inflorescences collected from the field or from greenhouse material were sectioned, cleared, and examined by bright field and polarization microscopy. All species examined, regardless of pollination strategy, arrayed crystals around unshed pollen and ovules. Less vital tissues, such as odoriferous appendages, had few crystals. Staminodia offered as food to beetle pollinators, however, differed greatly between species in their crystal contents. Some had minimal crystals; some had crystals in patterns suggesting they limit beetle feeding; still others had abundant crystals in no obvious pattern. The results are consistent with crystals protecting against insect predation of gametes and embryos. However, the role of crystals in food-bribe staminodia is unclear. They may limit and direct feeding by beetles in some species, while in others they might have no protective role. [Sulfate and thiosulfate inhibit oxalate transport via a dPrestin (Slc26a6)-dependent in Julian A T; Romero, Michael F 2016-01-15 Nephrolithiasis is one of the most common urinary tract disorders, with the majority of kidney stones composed of calcium oxalate (CaOx). Given its prevalence (US occurrence 10%), it is still poorly understood, lacking progress in identifying new therapies because of its complex etiology. Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly) is a recently developed model of CaOx nephrolithiasis. Effects of sulfate and thiosulfate on crystal formation were investigated using the Drosophila model, as well as electrophysiological effects on both Drosophila (Slc26a5/6; dPrestin) laevis oocyte heterologous expression system. Results indicate that both transport thiosulfate with a much higher affinity than sulfate Additionally, both compounds were effective at decreasing CaOx crystallization when added to the diet. However, these results were not observed when compounds were applied to Malpighian tubules ex vivo. Neither compound affected CaOx crystallization in knockdown animals, indicating a role for principal cell-specific dPrestin in luminal oxalate transport. Furthermore, thiosulfate has a higher affinity for dPrestin and mSlc26a6 compared with oxalate These data indicate that thiosulfate's ability to act as a competitive inhibitor of oxalate via dPrestin, can explain the decrease in CaOx crystallization seen in the presence of thiosulfate, but not sulfate. Overall, our findings predict that thiosulfate or oxalate-mimics may be effective as therapeutic competitive inhibitors of CaOx crystallization.

[Response surface methodology based extraction of Tribulus terrestris leads to an upsurge of antilithiatic efficacy established via both in vitro as well as in vivo studies and is used in numerous anti-urolithiatic herbal formulations viz. Cystone, Uriflow, Uritone and Neeri. However, to fully utilize its antilithiatic potential, the influence of different extraction parameters on antilithiatic ability of T. terrestris aqueous extract needs elucidation. Thus, the current study was undertaken using statistically optimized extraction conditions for aqueous extract preparation. Response surface methodology was employed to observe the influence of three variables i.e. temperature (\u00b0C), time (h) and solid: liquid ratio (S: L) on the extraction yield (%) and protein content (mg/g) of T. terrestris aqueous extract. RSM results revealed that the high S:L ratio, low temperature and reduced incubation time were optimal conditions for aqueous extraction. Under such extraction conditions the protein content reached the value of 26.6\u00b11.22 mg/g and the obtained extraction yield was 27.32\u00b11.62%. The assessment of antilithiatic activity of 4 selected extracts (AE1-4), revealed enhanced nucleation and aggregation inhibition of calcium oxalate crystals with AE1 and AE2, which in addition significantly altered the size and morphology of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals compared to AE3 and AE4. In vitro cell culture based studies on renal epithelial cells (MDCK, NRK-52E and PK 15) proved that the AE1 showed higher cytoprotective potency by increasing cell viability as compared to the oxalate treated group. The free radical scavenging activity of aqueous extract lowered the reactive oxygen specie's induced damage and potentially reduced the signals of programmed cell death due to oxalate injury. In addition, modulation of the COM crystal morphology was enhanced by AE1 as compared to AE2. The FTIR and GC-MS analysis of AE1, showed the presence of biomolecules which could aid in the attenuation of lithiatic process.

In the light [Defining and systematic analyses of aggregation indices to evaluate degree of calcium oxalate crystal Crystal aggregation is one of the most crucial steps in kidney stone pathogenesis. However, previous studies of crystal aggregation were rarely done and quantitative analysis of aggregation degree was handicapped by a lack of the standard measurement. We thus performed an in vitro assay to generate aggregation of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals with various concentrations (25-800 \u00b5g/ml) in saturated aggregation buffer. The crystal aggregates were analyzed by microscopic examination, UV-visible spectrophotometry, and GraphPad Prism6 software to define a total of 12 aggregation indices (including number of aggregates, aggregated mass index, optical density, aggregation coefficient, span, number of aggregates at plateau time-point, aggregated area index, aggregated diameter index, aggregated symmetry index, time constant, half-life, and rate constant). The data showed linear correlation between crystal concentration and almost all of these indices, except only for rate constant. Among these, number of aggregates provided the greatest regression coefficient (r=0.997; p<0.001), whereas the equally second rank included aggregated mass index and optical density (r=0.993; p<0.001 and r=0.993; p<0.001, respectively) and the equally forth were aggregation coefficient and span (r=0.991; p<0.001 for both). These five indices are thus recommended as the most appropriate indices for quantitative analysis of COM crystal aggregation in vitro. [Risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis in postmenopausal women supplemented postmenopausal women lost less bone mass when supplemented with calcium or estrogen therapy. However, the safety of the treatments in terms of the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation is unknown. We therefore conducted this study to determine the alteration in calcium oxalate supersaturation after calcium supplement or after combined calcium and estrogen therapy in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Fifty-six postmenopausal women were enrolled in this study. All subjects were more than 10 years postmenopausal with vertebral or femoral osteoporosis by bone mineral density criteria. They were randomly allocated to receive either 625 mg of calcium carbonate (250 mg of elemental calcium) at the end of a meal three times a day (group A, n=26) or calcium carbonate in the same manner plus 0.625 mg/day of conjugated equine estrogen and 5 mg medrogestone acetate from day 1-12 each month (group B, n=30). The age (mean +/- S.E.M.) was 66.3 65.1 weight 54.1 +/- 1.2 and 55.3 +/- 2.1 kg, in group A and group B, respectively. Urine specimens (24-h) were collected at baseline and 3 months after treatment for the determination of calcium oxalate saturation by using Tiselius's index (AP(CaOx)) and calcium/citrate ratio. After 3 months of treatment, there was no significant alteration from baseline for urinary excretion of calcium, citrate and oxalate. Urinary phosphate excretion was significantly reduced (6.3 +/- 0.7 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.7 mmol/day for group A and 8.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 5.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/day for group B, P<0.05), whereas net alkaline absorption was significantly elevated (10.1 +/- 3.6 vs. 20.1 +/- 4.4 meq/day for group A and 4.8 +/- 3.2 vs. 19.9 +/- 3.6 meq/day for group B, P<0.05). Calcium/citrate ratio and AP(CaOx) determined at baseline were not different from the corresponding values after treatment in both groups; calcium/citrate: 10.1 +/- 3.1 vs. 10.1 +/- 2.5 for group A and 9.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 11.9 +/- 2.5 for group B and [Microorganisms and calcium oxalate stone disease.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15499215) Goldfarb, David S 2004-01-01 Microorganisms may have a role in the pathogenesis and prevention of kidney stones. The subjects of this review include nanobacteria, Oxalobacter formigenes, and lactic acid bacteria. Not reviewed here is the well-described role of infections of the urinary tract with Proteus species and other urease-producing organisms associated with struvite stone formation. Nanobacteria have been proposed to be very small (0.08-0.5 nm), ubiquitous organisms that could play a role in stone formation. The theory is that nanobacteria can nucleate carbonate apatite on their surfaces and thereby provide the nidus for stone formation. However, their existence remains uncertain and many investigators are openly skeptical. Recent investigations suggest that they are artifacts, and not actually living organisms, but their proponents continue to study them. O. formigenes is an obligate anaerobe which may be important in the prevention of stone formation. Its sole substrate for generation of ATP is oxalate. It may thereby metabolize its human host's dietary oxalate and diminish intestinal absorption and subsequent urinary excretion of oxalate. There is evidence that the organism's absence, perhaps sometimes due to courses of antibiotics, may be a cause of hyperoxaluria and stone formation. In early investigations, patients not colonized with the organism can be recolonized. Urinary oxalate can be diminished by accompanying an oxalate-containing meal with the organism. One study demonstrated that a preparation of lactic acid bacteria successfully reduced urinary oxalate excretion in 6 patients with calcium oxalate stones and hyperoxaluria. The mechanism of this effect is uncertain since these bacteria lacked the gene possessed by O. formigenes which codes for that organism's oxalate uptake mechanism. The author is currently completing a small randomized controlled clinical trial with this preparation in calcium stone-forming patients with idiopathic hyperoxaluria.

Its presence on apical membrane and in COM crystal-bound fraction was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Pretreating MDCK cells cell-crystal adhesion. Immunofluorescence staining also confirmed the direct binding of purified -enolase to COM crystals at {121} > {100} > {010} crystal faces. Coating COM crystals with urinary proteins diminished the crystal binding capacity to cells and purified -enolase. Moreover, -enolase selectively bound to COM, not other crystals. Chemico-protein interactions analysis revealed that -enolase interacted directly with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Incubating the cells with Mg2+ prior to cell-crystal adhesion assay significantly reduced crystal binding on the cell surface, whereas preincubation with EDTA, a divalent cation chelator, completely abolished Mg2+ effect, indicating that COM and Mg2+ competitively bind to -enolase. Taken together, we successfully confirmed the role of -enolase as a COM crystal receptor to mediate COM crystal adhesion at apical membrane of renal tubular cells. It may also serve as a target for stone prevention by blocking cell-crystal adhesion and stone nidus formation. for (COM) in solutions containing macromolecules. Two mucopolysaccharides (sodium heparin and chondroitin sulfate) and two proteins (positively charged lysozyme and negatively charged bovine serum albumin) were studied as adsorbates. The effects of pH, calcium oxalate surface charge (varied by calcium or oxalate ion activity), and citrate concentration were investigated. All four macromolecules showed evidence for adsorption. The macromolecule concentrations needed for reversing the surface charge indicated that the mucopolysaccharides have greater affinity for the COM surface than the proteins. Citrate ions at high concentrations appear to compete effectively with the negative protein for surface sites but show no evidence for competing with the positively charged protein. [The influence of scale inhibitors on calcium oxalate](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/696872-influence-scale-inhibitors-calcium-oxalate) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search) Gill, J.S. 1999-11-01 Precipitation of calcium oxalate is a common occurrence in mammalian urinary tract deposits and in various industrial processes such as paper making, brewery fermentation, sugar evaporation, and tannin concentration. Between pH 3.5 to 4.5 the driving force for calcium oxalate precipitation increases almost by three fold. It is a complicated process to predict both the nature of a deposit and at which stage of a multi-effect evaporator a particular mineral will deposit, as this depends on temperature, pH, total solids, and kinetics of mineralization. It is quite a challenge to inhibit calcium oxalate precipitation in the pH range of 4--6.more \u00bb Al{sup 3+} ions provide excellent threshold inhibition in this pH range and can be used to augment traditional inhibitors such as polyphosphates and polycarboxylates.\u00ab less [Calcium extraction from brine water and seawater using 2017-01-01 Calcium can be extracted not only from rocks but also from natural liquor such as seawater and brine water. In order to extract the calcium from seawater and brine water, oxalic acid was used in this research. Effect of variations of the volume of the oxalic acid at a constant concentration in seawater and brine water to produce calcium was investigated. The concentration of oxalic acid was 100 g/l and the variations of its volume were 2 ml, 4 ml, 6 ml, 8 ml, 10 ml, 20 ml, 30 ml, 40 ml, and 50 ml. The used seawater and brine water were firstly evaporated from 100 ml into 50 ml and then the oxalic acid was added into them with mixing to produce the calcium precipitates. The precipitates were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the filtrates were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The SEM analysis showed that the precipitates from brine water were consisted of only calcium compound while from seawater sodium one was also found along with calcium compound. The XRD analysis showed that the calcium was present in the form of calcium oxalate for both seawater and brine water. The ICP-OES analysis of the filtrate from seawater precipitation showed that the its calcium content was decreased from 826.20 ppm to 0.04 ppm while from brine water, it decreased from 170.06 ppm to 1.96 ppm. These results showed that both seawater and brine water have the potential to be a raw material for calcium production. [Crystallization of calcium oxalate monohydrate at dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine monolayers in the presence of chondroitin sulfate A](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004JCrGr.270..646O) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) monohydrate (COM) crystals beneath dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) monolayers in the presence of chondroitin sulfate A (C4S) was systematically examined under different surface pressure. The results indicated that the addition of C4S can inhibit the crystal growth and prevent the aggregation of COM crystals. Under tips were obtained. The DPPC monolayer at a surface pressure of 10 mN/m can match the Ca2+ distance of the (1 bar 0 1) face of COM better than at 20 mN/m. The addition of C4S could cooperatively modulate the interaction strength between the monolayer (or itself) with the specific morphology determining faces such as (1 bar 0 1) and (0 2 0), and thus results in remarkable stabilization of the (1 bar 0 1) faces. The dramatic changes in morphological details were due to the strong electrostatic interactions between the Ca2+-rich (1 bar 0 1) crystal faces of COM and the polyanionic polysaccharide C4S together with the negatively charged sites of the zwitterionic DPPC monolayers. The increase of the concentration of C4S can further enhance the stabilization of the (1 bar 0 1) face.

It was a common complication during jejunoileal bypass, but much less seen in modern gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity. The major cause of it is enteric hyperoxaluria. We report on a patient here with acute kidney disease due to calcium oxalate nephropathy, rather than the conditions mentioned above. The male patient received a Roux-en Y hepaticojejunostomy and common bile duct drainage. In addition to enteric hyperoxaluria, chronic kidney disease related metabolic acidosis, chronic diarrhea related volume depletion, a high oxalate and low potassium diet, long term ascorbic acid intake and long term exposure to antibiotics, all predisposed him to having oxalate nephropathy. This is the first case with such conditions and we recommend that similarly diagnosed patients avoid all these predisposing factors, in order to avoid this rare disease and its undesired outcome.

Therefore, we evaluated and characterized the presence, morphology and composition of CaOx crystals in both species. Crystals were isolated from greenhouse and in vitro vegetative stems, and from ripe fruit peels and pulp by enzymatic digestion and density centrifugation and quantified with a haemocytometer. Morphologies were studied using scanning electron microscopy, elemental composition with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and salt composition with X-ray powder diffraction. Analyses conducted confirmed that isolated crystals were exclusively composed by CaOx, both mono- and dihydrated. Highest crystal contents were measured in greenhouse stems, followed by the fruit peels. While very few crystals were quantified in in vitro plants, they were not detected in the fruit pulp at all, which is of advantage for its human consumption and could be linked to mechanisms of seed dispersal through animals. Different crystal morphologies were observed, sometimes varying between genotypes and tissues analysed.

All rights Orthosiphon grandiflorus, Hibiscus sabdariffa and sabdariffa and Phyllanthus amarus extracts on known risk factors for calcium oxalate stones in rats. We divided 30 male Wistar rats into 5 equal groups. Controls were fed a standard diet and the remaining groups received a 3% glycolate diet for 4 weeks to induce hyperoxaluria. One glycolate fed group served as the untreated group and the others were given oral extracts of Orthosiphon grandiflorus, Hibiscus sabdariffa or Phyllanthus amarus at a dose of 3.5 mg daily. We collected 24-hour urine and blood samples. Kidneys were harvested for histological examination. We measured the renal tissue content of calcium and oxalate. The Hibiscus sabdariffa group showed significantly oxalate group significantly increased urinary citrate vs the untreated group. Histological examination revealed less CaOx crystal deposition in the kidneys of Hibiscus sabdariffa and Phyllanthus amarus treated rats than in untreated rats. Those rats also had significantly lower renal tissue calcium content than untreated rats. All parameters in the Orthosiphon grandiflorus treated group were comparable to those in the untreated group. Hibiscus sabdariffa and Phyllanthus amarus decreased calcium crystal deposition in the kidneys. The antilithic effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa may be related to decreased oxalate retention in the kidney and more excretion into urine while that of Phyllanthus amarus may depend on increased urinary citrate. In contrast, administering Orthosiphon grandiflorus had no antilithic effect. Copyright \u00a9 2011 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

[Calcium oxalate crystals increased enolase-1 secretion from renal tubular cells that subsequently enhanced crystal and monocyte invasion through oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals cause kidney stone disease by still unclear mechanisms. The present study aimed to characterize changes in secretion of proteins from basolateral compartment of renal tubular epithelial cells after exposure to COM crystals and then correlated them with the stone pathogenesis. Polarized MDCK cells were cultivated in serum-free medium with or without 100 g/ml COM crystals for 20 h. Secreted proteins collected from the lower chamber (basolateral compartment) were then resolved in 2-D gels and visualized by Deep Purple stain (n = 5 gels/group). Spot matching and intensity analysis revealed six protein spots with significantly altered levels in COM-treated samples. These proteins were then identified by tandem The increased enolase-1 level was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Functional analysis revealed that enolase-1 dramatically induced COM crystal invasion through ECM migrating chamber in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, enolase-1 bound onto U937 monocytic cell surface markedly enhanced cell migration through the ECM migrating chamber. In summary, our data indicated that the increased secretory enolase-1 induced by COM crystals played an important role in crystal invasion and inflammatory process in renal interstitium. [Effect of animal and vegetable protein intake on subjects and idiopathic calcium stone-formers on dietary regimens which differed in the type and amount of protein allowed; 24-h urine collections were obtained from 41 practising vegetarians and 40 normal persons on a free, mixed, \"mediterranean\" diet. Twenty idiopathic calcium stone-formers were also studied while on two low calcium, low oxalate diets which differed in that animal protein was high in one and restricted in the other. Vegetarians had higher urinary oxalate levels than controls and although the calcium levels were markedly lower, urinary saturation with calcium/oxalate was significantly higher. This mild hypercalciuria was interpreted as being secondary to both a higher intake and increased fractional intestinal absorption of oxalate. Changing calcium stone-formers from a high to a low animal protein intake produced a significant decrease in calcium excretion but there was no variation in urinary oxalate. As a result, the decrease in calcium oxalate saturation was only marginal and not significant. It was concluded that dietary animal protein has a minimal effect on oxalate excretion. Mild hyperoxaluria of idiopathic calcium stone disease is likely to be intestinal in origin. Calcium stone-formers should be advised to avoid an excess of animal protein but the risks of a vegetable-rich diet should also be borne in mind.

A western blot analysis was used to examine the MRP-1 and BCRP expression levels. Surface-expressed PS was detected assay. The cell-permeable fluorogenic to measure the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. A rat model of hyperoxaluria was obtained using 0.5% ethylene glycol and 1.0% ammonium chloride. In addition, certain animals received verapamil (50 mg/kg body weight), which is a common inhibitor of MRP-1 and BCRP. The degree of nephrolithiasis was assessed histomorphometrically using sections stained by Pizzolato method and by measuring the calcium oxalate crystal content in the renal tissue. Oxalate produced a concentration-dependent increase in the synthesis of MRP-1 and BCRP. Treatment with MK571 and Ko143 (MRP-1- inhibitors, Adding the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine significantly MRP-1 and BCRP expression. In vivo, markedly decreased nephrocalcinosis was observed compared with that in the rat model of hyperoxaluria without verapamil treatment. Oxalate induces the upregulation of MRP-1 BCRP, which act as phospholipid floppases causing PS externalization in the renal epithelial cell membrane. The process is mediated by intracellular ROS production. The ROS-mediated increase in the synthesis of MRP-1 and BCRP can play an important role in hyperoxaluria-promoted calcium oxalate urolithiasis by facilitating phosphatidylserine redistribution in renal epithelial cells.

In the current study, we show for the first time that calcium oxalate stones are formed in the mouse inner ear of a genetic model for hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction in humans. The vestibular system within the inner ear is dependent on extracellular tiny calcium carbonate minerals for proper function. Thousands of these biominerals, known as otoconia, are associated with the utricle and saccule sensory maculae and are vital for mechanical stimulation of the sensory hair cells. We show that a missense mutation within the Slc26a4 gene abolishes the transport activity of its encoded protein, pendrin. As a consequence, dramatic changes in mineral composition, size, and shape occur within the utricle and saccule in a differential manner. Although abnormal giant carbonate minerals reside in the utricle at all ages, in the saccule, a gradual change in mineral composition leads to a formation of calcium oxalate in adult mice. By combining imaging and spectroscopy tools, we determined the profile of mineral composition and morphology at different time points. We propose a novel mechanism for the accumulation and aggregation of oxalate crystals in the inner ear. [Anti-Transforming Growth Factor IgG Elicits a Dual Effect on Calcium Crystallization and Nephrocalcinosis-Related Chronic a heterogeneous group of diseases caused by intrinsic or environmental microparticles or crystals, promoting tissue inflammation and scarring. Certain proteins interfere with crystal formation and growth, e.g., with intrarenal calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal formation, a common cause of kidney stone disease or nephrocalcinosis-related chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized that immunoglobulins can modulate CaOx microcrystal formation and crystal growth and that therefore, biological IgG-based drugs designed to specifically target disease modifying proteins would elicit a dual effect on the outcome of CaOx-related crystallopathies. Indeed, both the anti-transforming growth factor (TGF) IgG and control IgG1 antibody impaired CaOx crystallization in vitro, and decreased intrarenal CaOx crystal deposition and subsequent CKD in mice on an oxalate-rich diet compared to oxalate-fed control mice. However, the TGF-specific IgG antibody showed nephroprotective effects beyond those of control IgG1 and substantially reduced interstitial fibrosis as indicated by magnetic resonance imaging, silver and -smooth muscle actin staining, slowed the decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared to treatment with control IgG1 [slope of m = 8.9 vs. m = 14.5 l/min/100 g body weight (BW)/day, = 38.3%], an increased GFR at the end of the study (120.4 vs. 42.6 l/min/100 g BW, = 64.6%), and prolonged end stage renal disease (ESRD)-free renal survival by 10 days ( = 38.5%).

In tequila distilleries, 5/6 of the workers who handle the agave stems have experienced the characteristic irritation. In contrast, only 1/3 of workers in agave plantations who harvest agave plants, complain of the irritation. It is confirmed that all the irritation suffered in both distilleries and plantations takes place at bodily locations where the plants come into contact with the worker's skin in the course of their work. [NALP3-mediated inflammation is a principal cause of progressive renal failure oxalate S. 2013-01-01 Oxalate nephropathy with renal failure is caused by multiple disorders causing hyperoxaluria due to either overproduction of oxalate (primary hyperoxaluria) or excessive absorption of dietary oxalate (enteric hyperoxaluria). To study the etiology of renal failure in crystal-induced kidney disease, we created a model of progressive oxalate nephropathy by feeding mice a diet high in soluble oxalate (high oxalate in the absence of dietary calcium). Renal histology was characterized by intratubular calcium-oxalate crystal deposition with an inflammatory response in the surrounding interstitium. Oxalate nephropathy was not found in mice fed a high oxalate diet that also contained calcium. NALP3, also known as cryopyrin, has been implicated in crystal-associated diseases such as gout and silicosis. Mice fed the diet high in soluble oxalate demonstrated increased NALP3 expression in the kidney. Nalp3-null mice were completely protected from the progressive renal failure and death that occurred in wild-type mice fed the diet high in soluble oxalate. NALP3-deficiency did not affect oxalate homeostasis, thereby excluding differences in intestinal oxalate handling to explain the observed phenotype. Thus, progressive renal failure in oxalate nephropathy results primarily from NALP3-mediated inflammation.

Materials and methods Urinary COM crystals were generated in sieved (sCOM), centrifuged and filtered (cfCOM), and ultrafiltered (ufCOM) portions of a pooled human urine and their adhesion to MDCK-II cells was compared using six different ultrafiltered urine samples as the binding medium. Crystal matrix extract (CME) was prepared by demineralizing calcium oxalate crystals precipitated from human urine and used to prepare COM crystals with intracrystalline, and intracrystalline + surface-bound CME at protein concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 5.0 mg/L. The amount of protein associated with the crystals was qualitatively assessed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, using prothrombin fragment 1 (PTF1) as a marker. Protein concentration was determined in sieved, centrifuged and filtered, and ultrafiltered fractions of 10 additional urine samples. Results The median crystal attachment in the six urine types decreased in the order iCOM > ufCOM > cfCOM = sCOM, in inverse proportion to the concentration of protein in the solution or urine from which they were precipitated. sCOM and cfCOM crystals bound 23% less than iCOM crystals. The attachment of COM crystals generated in the presence of increasing concentrations of CME proteins was unaffected up to a concentration of 5 mg/L, but binding of crystals containing the same concentrations of intracrystalline + surface-bound proteins decreased proportionally at protein concentrations from 0 to 5.0 mg/L. Conclusion Inorganic COM crystals bind significantly more strongly to MDCK-II cells than urinary crystals precipitated from sieved 2009-01-01 Calcium oxalate druses were isolated from the stems and leaves of six Pereskioideae family members and investigated by infrared spectroscopy, showing that in all samples the biomineral was present in the form of whewellite, CaC2O4 x H2O. As Pereskia is thought to represent the \"ancestral\" condition of the leafless stem-succulent cacti, these results suggest that the biomineralization of calcium oxalate in Cactaceae represents a primitive characteristic of the group and also support a close genetic relationship between Pereskia and Opuntia. [Proteomic analysis of a rare urinary stone composed of calcium carbonate and calcium objective of the present study was to investigate the matrix protein of a rare urinary stone that contained calcium carbonate. A urinary stone was extracted from a 34-year-old male patient with metabolic alkalosis. After X-ray diffractometry and infrared analysis of the stone, proteomic analysis was carried out. The resulting mass spectra were evaluated with protein search software, and matrix proteins were identified. X-ray diffraction and infrared analysis confirmed that the stone contained calcium carbonate and calcium oxalate dihydrate. Of the identified 53 proteins, 24 have not been previously reported from calcium oxalate- or calcium phosphate-containing stones. The protease inhibitors and several proteins related to cell adhesion or the cytoskeleton were identified for the first time. We analyzed in detail a rare urinary stone composed of calcium carbonate and calcium oxalate dihydrate. Considering the formation of a calcium carbonate stone, the new identified proteins should play an important role on the urolithiasis process in alkaline condition. \u00a9 2013 The Japanese Urological Association. [Mucin 4 Gene Silencing Reduces Oxidative Stress and Calcium Oxalate Crystal Formation in Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells Through the Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Signaling Pathway in Nephrolithiasis plagues a great number of patients all over the world. Increasing evidence shows that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and renal tubular epithelial cell (RTEC) dysfunction and attrition are central to the pathogenesis of kidney diseases. Mucin 4 (MUC4) is reported as an activator of ERK signaling pathway in epithelial cells. In this study, using rat models of calcium oxalate (CaOx) nephrolithiasis, the present study aims to define the roles of MUC4 and ERK signaling pathway as contributors to oxidative stress and CaOx crystal formation in RTEC. Data sets of nephrolithiasis were searched using GEO database and a heat flow map was drawn. Then MUC4 function was predicted. Wistar rats were prepared for the purpose of model establishment of ethylene glycol and ammonium chloride induced CaOx nephrolithiasis. In order to assess the detailed regulatory mechanism of MUC4 silencing on the ERK signaling pathway and RTEC, we used recombinant plasmid to downregulate MUC4 expression in Wistar rat-based models. Samples from rat urine, serum and kidney tissues were reviewed to identify oxalic acid and calcium contents, BUN, Cr, Ca2+ and P3+ levels, calcium crystal formation in renal tubules and MUC4 positive expression rate. Finally, RT-qPCR, Western blot analysis, and ELISA were employed to access oxidative stress state and CaOx crystal formation in RTEC. Initially, MUC4 was found to have an influence on the process of nephrolithiasis. MUC4 was upregulated in the CaOx nephrolithiasis model rats. We proved that the silencing of MUC4 triggered the inactivation of ERK signaling pathway. Following the silencing of MUC4 or the inhibition of ERK signaling pathway, the oxalic acid and calcium contents in rat urine, BUN, Cr, Ca2+ and P3+ levels in rat serum, p-ERK1/2, expressions in RTEC and MDA levels in the cultured supernatant were downregulated, but the GSH-Px, CAT and SOD levels in the cultured supernatant were [Organic Selenium Alleviated the Formation of Ethylene Glycol-Induced Calcium Oxalate Renal Calculi by Improving Osteopontin Expression and Capability Dogs.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26018495) Yongwang; Huang, Kehe 2015-12-01 Twenty one-year-old local male dogs were randomly assigned into four groups (five dogs per group). The control and the ethylene glycol (EG) groups were fed basal diets without the EG+sodium diets with EG containing SS and SY, respectively. Blood, urine, and renal samples were taken after 18 weeks of feeding. The results showed that compared with the control group, the serum calcium levels and antioxidase activities significantly decreased in the EG group. Serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and urine calcium and oxalate levels significantly increased. Calcium oxalate crystal deposition and osteopontin (OPN) messenger RNA and protein expression in the renal tissues significantly increased. These changes above in the EG group were reversed within limits by adding selenium in the diets (both EG+SS and EG+SY groups). Further, compared with the EG+SS group, the EG+SY group showed better effects in decreasing the formation of EG-induced calcium oxalate renal calculi and OPN expression and improving antioxidant capability in dogs. It indicates that organic selenium has the potential value to alleviate the formation of EG-induced calcium oxalate renal calculi. [[Quantitative mineralogical analyzes of kidney stones and diagnosing metabolic disorders in female patients with calcium oxalate A O 2016-02-01 To conduct a complex examination of female patients with calcium oxalate urolithiasis to detect metabolic disorders, leading to stone formation. The study was carried out using complex physical and chemical methods, including quantitative X-ray phase analysis of urinary stones, pH measurement, volumetry, urine and blood spectrophotometry. Quantitative mineralogical composition of stones, daily urine pH profile, daily urinary excretion of ions of calcium, magnesium, oxalate, phosphate, citrate and uric acid were determined in 20 female patients with calcium oxalate stones. We have shown that most of the stones comprised calcium oxalate monohydrate or mixtures of calcium oxalate dihydrate and hydroxyapatite. Among the identified abnormalities, the most frequent were hypocitraturia and hypercalciuria - 90 and 45%, respectively. Our findings revealed that the daily secretion of citrate and oxalate in patients older than 50 years was significantly lower than in younger patients. In conclusion, daily urinary citrate excretion should be measured in female patients with calcium oxalate stones. This is necessary both to determine the causes of stone formation, and to monitor the effectiveness of citrate therapy. [Fasting urinary calcium-to-creatinine and oxalate-to-creatinine J P urolithiasis, but breed-specific reports of urinary metabolites and their relationship with stone status are lacking. To compare urinary metabolites (calcium and oxalate) and blood ionized calcium (iCa) concentrations between CaOx stone formers and breed-matched stone-free controls for and Shih Tzu breeds. Forty-seven Miniature Schnauzers (23 cases and 24 controls), 27 Bichons Frise (14 cases and 13 controls), and 15 Shih Tzus (7 cases and 8 controls). Prospective study. Fasting spot urinary calcium-to-creatinine and oxalate-to-creatinine ratios (UCa/Cr and UOx/Cr, respectively) and blood iCa concentrations were measured and compared between cases and controls within and across breeds. Regression models were used to test the effect of patient and environmental factors on these variables. UCa/Cr was higher in cases than controls for each of the 3 breeds. In addition to stone status, being on a therapeutic food designed to prevent CaOx stone recurrence was associated with higher UCa/Cr. UOx/Cr did not differ between cases and controls for any of the breeds. Blood iCa was higher in cases than controls in the Miniature Schnauzer and Bichon Frise breeds and had a moderate correlation with UCa/Cr. Hypercalciuria is associated with CaOx stone status in the Miniature Schnauzer, Bichon Frise, and Shih Tzu breeds. UOx/Cr did not correlate with stone status in these 3 breeds. These findings may influence breed-specific stone prevention recommendations. Copyright \u00a9 2015 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine. [The electrokinetic behavior of calcium oxalate for (COM) solutions containing macromolecules. Two mucopolysaccharides (sodium heparin and chrondroitin sulfate) and two proteins (positively charged lysozyme and negatively charged bovine serum albumin) were studied as adsorbates. The effects of pH, calcium oxalate surface charge (varied by calcium or oxalate ion activity), and citrate concentration were investigated. All four macromolecules showed evidence for chemical adsorption. The macromolecule concentrations needed for reversing the surface charge indicated that the mucopopolysacchrides have greater affinity for the COM surface than the proteins. The amount of proteins that can chemically adsorb appears to be limited to approximately one monomolecular layer. When the surface charge is high, an insufficient number of proteins can chemically adsorb to neutralize or reverse the surface charge. The remaining surface charge is balanced by proteins held near the surface by longer range electrostatic forces only. Citrate ions at high concentrations appear to compete effectively with the negative protein for surface sites but show no evidence for competing with the positively charged protein. [Kidney stone matrix proteins ameliorate calcium oxalate monohydrate formation is a highly prevalent disease, affecting 8-10% of the human population worldwide. Proteins are the major constituents of human kidney stone's organic matrix and considered to play critical role in the pathogenesis of disease but their mechanism of modulation still needs to be explicated. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effect of human kidney stone matrix proteins on the calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) mediated cellular injury. The renal epithelial cells (MDCK) were exposed to 200g/ml COM crystals to induce injury. The effect of proteins isolated from human kidney stone was studied on COM injured cells. The alterations in cell-crystal interactions were examined by phase contrast, polarizing, fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, its effect on the extent of COM induced cell injury, was quantified by flow cytometric analysis. Our study indicated the antilithiatic potential of human kidney stone proteins on COM injured MDCK cells. Flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence imaging ascertained that matrix proteins decreased the extent of apoptotic injury caused by COM crystals on MDCK cells. Moreover, the electron microscopic studies of MDCK cells revealed that matrix proteins caused significant dissolution of COM crystals, indicating cytoprotection against the impact of calcium oxalate injury. The present study gives insights into the mechanism implied by urinary proteins to restrain the pathogenesis of kidney stone disease. This will provide a better understanding of the formation of kidney stones which can be useful for the proper management of the disease. Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. [Peeping into Human Renal Calcium Oxalate Stone Matrix: Characterization of Novel Proteins Involved in the Intricate Mechanism of Urolithiasis](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3722206) Tandon, Chanderdeep 2013-01-01 Background The increasing number of patients suffering from urolithiasis represents one of the major challenges which nephrologists face worldwide today. For enhancing therapeutic outcomes of this disease, the pathogenic basis for the formation of renal stones is the need of hour. Proteins are found as major component in human renal stone matrix and are considered to have a potential role in crystal-membrane interaction, crystal growth and stone formation but their role in urolithiasis still remains obscure. Methods Proteins were isolated from the matrix of human CaOx containing kidney stones. Proteins having MW>3 kDa were subjected to anion exchange chromatography followed by molecular-sieve chromatography. The effect of these purified proteins was tested against CaOx nucleation and growth and on oxalate injured Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) renal epithelial cells for their activity. Proteins were identified by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF MS) followed by database search with MASCOT server. In silico molecular interaction studies with CaOx crystals were also investigated. Results Five proteins were identified from the matrix of calcium oxalate kidney stones by MALDI-TOF MS followed by database search with MASCOT server with the competence to control the stone formation process. Out of which two proteins were promoters, two were inhibitors and one protein had a dual activity of both inhibition and promotion towards CaOx nucleation and growth. Further molecular modelling calculations revealed the mode of interaction of these proteins with CaOx at the molecular level. Conclusions We identified and characterized Ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, Ras GTPase-activating-like protein, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 2, RIMS-binding protein 3A, Macrophage-capping protein as novel proteins from the matrix of human calcium oxalate stone which play a critical role in kidney stone formation. Thus, these [Evidence for net renal tubule oxalate secretion in patients kidney L.; Asplin, John R.; Worcester, Elaine M.; Coe, Fredric L. 2011-01-01 Little is known about the renal handling of oxalate in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH). To explore the role of tubular oxalate handling in IH and to evaluate whether differences exist between IH and normal controls, we studied 19 IH subjects, 8 normal subjects, and 2 bariatric stone formers (BSF) during a 1-day General Clinical Research Center protocol utilizing a low-oxalate diet. Urine and blood samples were collected at 30- to 60-min intervals while subjects were fasting and after they ate three meals providing known amounts of calcium, phosphorus, sodium, protein, oxalate, and calories. Plasma oxalate concentrations and oxalate-filtered loads were similar between patients (includes IH and BSF) and controls in both the fasting and fed states. Urinary oxalate excretion was significantly higher in patients vs. controls regardless of feeding state. Fractional excretion of oxalate (FEOx) was >1, suggesting tubular secretion of oxalate, in 6 of 19 IH and both BSF, compared with none of the controls (P < 0.00001). Adjusted for water extraction along the nephron, urine oxalate rose more rapidly among patients than normal subjects with increases in plasma oxalate. Our findings identify tubular secretion of oxalate as a key mediator of hyperoxaluria in calcium stone formers, potentially as a means of maintaining plasma oxalate in a tight range. PMID:21123489 [Nucleation kinetics, crystal growth and optical studies on lithium hydrogen oxalate monohydrate single non-linear optical single crystals have been grown by slow evaporation solution technique at 40 \u00b0C. The nucleation parameters such as critical radius, interfacial tension, and critical free energy change have been evaluated using the experimental data. The solubility and the nucleation curve of the crystal at different temperatures have been analyzed. The crystal has a positive temperature coefficient of solubility. The metastable zone width and induction period have been determined for the aqueous solution growth of lithium hydrogen oxalate monohydrate. The UV-vis-NIR spectrum showed this crystal has high transparency. The photoconductivity studies indicate lithium hydrogen oxalate monohydrate has positive photoconductivity behaviour. The low etch pit density observed on (0 0 1) crystal surface and the high resolution x-ray difraction analysis indicate the good quality of the grown crystals [Effect of calcium oxalate on the photocatalytic degradation of Orange II on degradation of aqueous solution of Orange II, has been investigated in the presence of ZnO catalyst with calcium oxalate as sacrificial agent. This study demonstrated that the performance of ZnO photocatalyst can be improved by addition of calcium oxalate. Results show that adsorption is an important parameter controlling the degradation phenomena. Indeed, the added oxalate causes a drop in the pH medium, what causes a better adsorption of Orange II on the ZnO surface. The effect of calcium oxalate is to increase the concentration of superoxides (O{2/\u00b7-}) and hydroperoxides (HO2\u00b7) radicals, which are key intermediaries in the mechanism of photodegradation because of their powerful force of oxidation. [Contribution of dietary oxalate to urinary H. O.; Assimos, D. G. 2001-01-01 BACKGROUND: The amount of oxalate excreted in urine has a significant impact on calcium oxalate supersaturation and stone formation. Dietary oxalate is believed to make only a minor (10 to 20%) contribution to the amount of oxalate excreted in urine, but the validity of the experimental observations that support this conclusion can be questioned. An understanding of the actual contribution of dietary oxalate to urinary oxalate excretion is important, as it is potentially modifiable. METHODS: We varied the amount of dietary oxalate consumed by a group of adult individuals using formula diets and controlled, solid-food diets with a known oxalate content, determined by a recently developed analytical procedure. Controlled solid-food diets were consumed containing 10, 50, and 250 mg of oxalate/2500 kcal, as well as formula diets containing 0 and 180 mg oxalate/2500 kcal. Changes in the content of oxalate and other ions were assessed in 24-hour urine collections. RESULTS: Urinary oxalate increased as dietary oxalate intake increased. With oxalate-containing diets, the mean contribution of dietary oxalate to urinary oxalate excretion ranged from 24.4 +/- mg/2500 kcal/day diet to 41.5 +/- 9.1% on the 250 mg/2500 kcal/day diet, much higher than previously estimated. When the calcium content of a diet containing 250 mg of oxalate was reduced from 1002 mg to 391 mg, urinary excretion increased by a mean of 28.2 +/- 4.8%, and the mean dietary contribution increased to 52.6 +/- 8.6%. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that dietary oxalate makes a much greater contribution to urinary oxalate excretion than previously recognized, that dietary calcium influences the bioavailability of ingested oxalate, and that the absorption of dietary oxalate may be an important factor in calcium oxalate stone formation. [The genetic composition of Oxalobacter formigenes and its relationship to colonization and calcium disease](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3713771) Knight, John; 2013-01-01 Oxalobacter formigenes is a unique intestinal organism that relies on oxalate degradation to meet most of its energy and carbon needs. A lack of colonization is a risk factor for calcium oxalate stone disease. Protection against calcium oxalate stone disease appears to be due to the oxalate degradation that occurs in the gut on low calcium diets with a possible further contribution from intestinal oxalate secretion. Much remains to be learned about how the organism establishes and maintains gut colonization and the precise mechanisms by which it modifies stone risk. The sequencing and annotation of the genomes of a Group 1 and a Group 2 strain of O. formigenes should provide the informatic tools required for the identification of the genes and pathways associated with colonization and survival. In this review we have identified genes that may be involved and where appropriate suggested how they may be important in calcium oxalate stone disease. Elaborating the functional roles of these genes should accelerate our understanding of the organism and clarify its role in preventing stone formation. PMID:23632911 [Pathology and Epidemiology of Oxalate Nephrosis in To investigate cases of acute oxalate nephrosis without evidence of ethylene glycol exposure, archived data and tissues from cheetahs ( Acinonyx jubatus) from North America ( n = southern Africa ( n = 257), and France ( n = 40) were evaluated. Renal and gastrointestinal tract lesions were characterized in a subset of animals with ( n = 100) and without ( n = 165) oxalate crystals at death. Crystals were confirmed as calcium oxalate by Raman spectroscopy in 45 of 47 cheetahs tested. Crystals were present in cheetahs from 3.7 months to 15.9 years old. Cheetahs younger than 1.5 years were less likely to have oxalates than older cheetahs ( P = .034), but young cheetahs with oxalates had more oxalate crystals than older cheetahs ( P < .001). Cheetahs with oxalate crystals were more likely to have renal amyloidosis, interstitial nephritis, or colitis and less likely to have glomerular loop thickening or gastritis than those without oxalates. Crystal number was positively associated with renal tubular necrosis ( P .001), regeneration ( P = .015), and casts ( P .001) but inversely associated with glomerulosclerosis, renal amyloidosis, and interstitial nephritis. Crystal number was unrelated to the presence or absence of colitis and was lower in southern African than American and European animals ( P = .01). This study found no evidence that coexisting chronic renal disease (amyloidosis, interstitial nephritis, or to oxalate nephrosis. Oxalate-related renal disease should be considered as a potential cause of acute renal failure, especially in young captive cheetahs. The role of location, diet, stress, and genetic predisposition in the pathogenesis of oxalate nephrosis in cheetahs warrants further study. methods dedicated to low growth syntheses dedicated to low solubility actinide-oxalate systems and adapted to glove box handling are described. These methods based on the use of precursors of either actinide metal or oxalic acid have been optimized on lanthanide systems (analogue of actinides(III)) and then assessed on real actinide systems. They allow the synthesis of several actinide oxalate single crystals, Am2(C2O4)3(H2O)3\u00b7xH2O, Th(C2O4)2\u00b76H2O, M2+x[PuIV2-xPuIIIx(C2O4)5]\u00b7nH2O and M1-x[PuIII1-xPuIVx(C2O4)2\u00b7H2O]\u00b7nH2O. It is the first time that these well-known compounds are formed by crystal growth methods, thus enabling direct structural studies on transuranic element systems and acquisition of basic data beyond deductions from isomorphic (or not) lanthanide compounds. Characterizations by X-ray diffraction, UV-visible solid spectroscopy, demonstrate the potentialities of these two crystal growth methods to obtain oxalate compounds. [Determination of urine oxalate level in rats with renal calcium oxalate calculus by high-performance liquid chromatography.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25676276) Cao, Qiu-shi; Ba, Yuan-ming; Luo, Jun-hua; Dai, Qi 2015-02-01 To establish a method of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for determining the urine oxalate levle in rats with renal calcium oxalate calculus. Totally 24 SPF Wistar healthy male rats were randomly divided into control group(n=12)and ethylene glycol (EG) group (n=12). Rats in per day+1% (EG), along with free access to drinking water.The control group was fed with deionized water, along with the intragastric administration of normal saline (1 ml per day). Twenty-eight days after modelling, the 24-hour urine samples were collected, and the urine oxalic acid levels were determined using HPLC and the results were compared with those of catalytic spectrophotometry using oxidation of methyl. During the HPLC, the samples were separated on Aglient 5TC-C18 (250\u00d74.6 mm,5 m), eluted with mixture of methanol (0.1 mol/L) and ammonium acetate (15:85) at 1.2 ml/min, and detected at 314 nm, with the column temperature being 20 . The standard curves of high and low concentrations of oxalic acid were y=5909.1x+378730, R\u00b2 =0.9984 and y=7810.5x-16635, R\u00b2 =0.9967,respectively. The lowest detectable concentration in this method was 5 g/ml. The linear high concentration range of oxalate stood at 62.50-2000.00 g/ml, and the linear low concentration range of oxalate stood at 6.25-100.00 g/ml. Its average recovery was 95.1%, its day-to-day precisions were 3.4%-10.8% and catalytic spectrophotometry showed significantly higher urinary oxalic acid concentration and 24 h urine oxalate level in EG group compared with the code effect: A transformation observed in [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Lisgarten, J. N.; Marks, J. A. 2018-05-01 This paper reports on an unusual crystal-crystal transformation phenomenon, which we have called the Morse Code Effect, based on the change in appearance of lead(II) oxalate crystals grown in agarose gels. [Quantitative Mineralogical Composition Calculi and I 2018-05-03 The paper focuses on the relationship of risk factors and metabolic disorders with mineralogical composition of calculi, age and gender of calcium oxalate stone formers. Stone mineralogical composition, 24 hour biochemistry and pH-profile of urine were examined for sixty four stone formers using powder X-ray diffraction, spectrophotometric and potentiometric techniques. The analysis indicated that 44 % of calculi were composed of pure calcium oxalate monohydrate, whereas other 56 % contained both monohydrate and dihydrate or usually their mixtures with hydroxyl apatite. Hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria and hyperuricosuria were identified as the most frequent disorders. Patients with pure calcium oxalate stones and calcium oxalate mixed with apatite revealed different patterns including age, acid-base balance of urine, calcium, citrate excretion etc.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that most patients simultaneously reveal several risk factors. The special attention should be paid to normalize the daily citrate, calcium and urate excretion. High risk patients, such as postmenopausal females or stone formers with a high apatite content require a specific metabolic evaluation towards in highlighting abnormalities associated with stone formation. [Diversity in Protein Profiles of Individual stones contain low amounts of proteins, some of which have been implicated in progression or prevention of kidney stone formation. To gain insights into the pathophysiology of urolithiasis, we have characterized protein components of calcium oxalate kidney stones by proteomic approaches. Proteins extracted from kidney stones showed highly heterogeneous migration patterns in gel electrophoresis as reported. This was likely to be mainly due to proteolytic degradation and protein-protein crosslinking of Tamm-Horsfall protein and prothrombin. Protein profiles of calcium oxalate kidney stones were obtained by in-solution protease digestion followed by nanoLC-MALDI-tandem mass spectrometry, which resulted in identification of a total of 92 proteins in stones from 9 urolithiasis patients. Further analysis showed that protein species and their relative amounts were highly variable among individual stones. Although proteins such as prothrombin, osteopontin, calgranulin A and calgranulin B were found in most stones tested, some samples had high contents of prothrombin and osteopontin, while others had high contents of calgranulins. In addition, calgranulin-rich stones had various neutrophil-enriched proteins such as myeloperoxidase and lactotransferrin. These proteomic profiles of individual kidney stones suggest that multiple systems composed of different groups of proteins including leucocyte-derived ones are differently involved in pathogenesis of individual kidney stones depending on situations. PMID:23874695 [Substituting milk for apple juice does not increase kidney stone risk in most normocalciuric adults who form calcium oxalate stones.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9508013) Massey, L K; Kynast-Gales, S A 1998-03-01 Increasing intake of dietary calcium from less than 400 mg to 800 mg daily may decrease the absorption of dietary oxalate, which in turn would decrease urinary oxalate excretion. The effect of substituting milk for apple juice on urine composition and risk of calcium oxalate precipitability was studied. Twenty-one normocalciuric adults with a history of at least 1 calcium oxalate stone and urinary oxalate excretion exceeding 275 micromol/day on their self-selected Each participant consumed two moderate-oxalate (2,011 micromol/day) study diets, which were identical except that one contained 360 mL milk and the other contained 540 mL apple juice as the beverage with meals. Four days free-living then 2 days in the metabolic unit of a university nutrition department. Tiselius risk index for calcium oxalate precipitability calculated from urine composition. Paired t tests. Twenty-four hour urinary oxalate excretion was 18% lower (P<.0001) on the milk diet vs the juice diet: 423 vs 514 micromol, respectively. Calcium excretion was 17% higher (P<.05) on the milk vs juice diet: 4.7 vs 3.9 mmol, respectively. Urinary magnesium and citrate excretion, volume, and Tiselius risk index did not differ between diets. Substituting 360 mL milk daily for apple juice with meals in a diet containing moderate amounts of dietary oxalate from whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables does not increase the risk index of calcium oxalate precipitability in most normocalciuric adults who form stones. [A test of the hypothesis that oxalate secretion produces proximal crystallization in The sequence of events by which primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) causes renal failure is unclear. We hypothesize that proximal tubule (PT) is vulnerable because oxalate secretion raises calcium oxalate (CaOx) supersaturation (SS) there, leading to crystal formation and cellular injury. We studied cortical and papillary biopsies from two PH1 patients with preserved renal function, and seven native kidneys removed from four patients at the time of transplant, after short-term (2) or longer term (2) dialysis. In these patients, and another five PH1 patients without renal failure, we calculated oxalate secretion, and estimated PT CaOx SS. Plasma oxalate was elevated in all PH1 patients and inverse to creatinine clearance. Renal secretion of oxalate was present in all PH1 but rare in controls. PT CaOx SS was >1 in all nonpyridoxine-responsive PH1 before transplant and most marked in patients who developed end stage renal disease (ESRD). PT from PH1 with preserved renal function had birefringent crystals, confirming the presence of CaOx SS, but had no evidence of cortical inflammation or scarring by histopathology or hyaluronan staining particularly at the corticomedullary junction in distal PT while cortical collecting ducts were spared. Longer ESRD showed widespread cortical CaOx, and in both groups papillary tissue had marked intratubular CaOx deposits and fibrosis. CaOx SS in PT causes CaOx crystal formation, and CaOx deposition in distal PT appears to be associated with ESRD. Minimizing PT CaOx SS may be important for preserving renal function in PH1.

[Surface heat shock protein 90 serves as a potential receptor for calcium oxalate crystal on apical membrane of (COM) crystals on renal tubular epithelial cells is a crucial step in kidney stone formation. Finding potential crystal receptors on the apical membrane of the cells may lead to a novel approach to prevent kidney stone disease. Our previous study identified a large number of crystal-binding proteins on the apical membrane of MDCK cells. However, their functional role as potential crystal receptors had not been validated. The present study aimed to address the potential role of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) as a COM crystal receptor. The apical membrane was isolated from polarized MDCK cells by the peeling method and recovered proteins were incubated with COM crystals. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of HSP90 in the apical membrane and the laser-scanning the surface HSP90 expression on the apical membrane of the intact cells. Crystal adhesion assay showed that blocking surface HSP90 by specific anti-HSP90 antibody and knockdown of HSP90 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) dramatically reduced crystal binding on the apical surface of MDCK cells (by approximately 1/2 and 2/3, respectively). Additionally, crystal internalization assay revealed the presence of HSP90 on the membrane of endocytic vesicle containing the internalized COM crystal. Moreover, pretreatment of MDCK cells with anti-HSP90 antibody significantly reduced crystal internalization (by approximately 1/3). Taken together, our data indicate that HSP90 serves as a potential receptor for COM crystals on the apical membrane of renal tubular epithelial cells and is involved in endocytosis/internalization of the crystals into the cells. [Distinguishing characteristics of idiopathic calcium oxalate kidney stone formers with amounts of plaque.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092598) Xiangling; Krambeck, E; 2014-10-07 Overgrowth of calcium oxalate on Randall's plaque is a mechanism of stone formation among idiopathic calcium oxalate stone-formers (ICSFs). It is less clear how stones form when there is little or no plaque. Participants were a consecutive cohort of ICSFs who underwent percutaneous nephroscopic papillary mapping in the kidney or kidneys containing symptomatic stones and a papillary tip biopsy from a representative calyx during a stone removal procedure between 2009 and 2013. The distribution of Randall's plaque coverage was analyzed and used to divide ICSFs into those with a high (5%; mean, 10.5%; n=10) versus low (<5%; mean, 1.5%; n=32) amount of plaque coverage per papilla. Demographic and laboratory features were compared between these two groups. Low-plaque stone formers tended to be obese (50% versus 10%; P=0.03) and have a history of urinary tract infection (34% versus 0%; P=0.04). They were less likely to have multiple prior stone events (22% versus 80%; P=0.002) and had a lower mean (187\u00b186 mg versus 291\u00b199 mg; P<0.01). Morphologically, stones from patients with low amounts of plaque lacked a calcium phosphate core by microcomputed tomography. Papillary biopsies from low plaque stone-formers revealed less interstitial and basement membrane punctate crystallization. These findings suggest that other pathways independent of Randall's plaque may contribute to stone pathogenesis among a subgroup of ICSFs who harbor low amounts of plaque.

[On the nature and origin of a detailed study carried out in Solanum sisymbriifolium Lam. on the development of the circular cell cluster (CCC) during crystal deposition, as well as the composition of the crystals. Light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize tissue throughout anther development. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) allowed the determination of the elemental composition of crystals that form in the CCC region, and infrared and x-ray diffraction analysis were used to specify the crystal salt composition. TEM analysis revealed that the crystals originated simultaneously within the vacuoles in association with a paracrystalline protein. Prior to the appearance of protein within vacuoles, protein paracrystals were visible in both rough endoplasmic reticulum vesicles ribosomes on constitute nucleation sites for druse crystals formation. EDAX revealed that C, O, and Ca were the main elements, and K, Cl, Mg, P, S, and Si, the minor elements. X-ray powder diffraction of crystals detected the predominant presence of calcium oxalate, but also vestiges of calcite, quartz, and sylvite. The calcium oxalate coexisted in the three chemical forms, that is, whewellite, weddellite, and caoxite. Infrared spectrophotometry identified bands that characterize H-O, C-H bonds, all of calcium oxalate, and Si-O-Si, of quartz. These results were compared with studies of anthers carried out in other Solanaceae genera. [Comparison of the x-ray attenuation properties of breast calcifications, aluminium, hydroxyapatite and calcium oxalate.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23470559) Warren, L M; Mackenzie, A; Dance, D R; Young, K C 2013-04-07 Aluminium is often used as a substitute material for calcifications in phantom measurements in mammography. Additionally, calcium oxalate, hydroxyapatite and aluminium are used in simulation studies. This assumes that these materials have similar attenuation properties to calcification, and this assumption is examined in this work. Sliced mastectomy samples containing calcification were imaged at \u00d75 magnification using a digital specimen cabinet. Images of the individual calcifications were extracted, and the diameter and contrast of each calculated. The thicknesses of aluminium required to achieve the same contrast as each calcification when imaged under the same conditions were calculated using measurements of the contrast of aluminium foils. As hydroxyapatite and calcium oxalate are also used to simulate calcifications, the equivalent aluminium thicknesses of these materials were also calculated using tabulated attenuation coefficients. On average the equivalent aluminium thickness was 0.85 times the calcification diameter. For calcium oxalate and hydroxyapatite, the equivalent aluminium thicknesses were 1.01 and 2.19 times the thickness of these materials respectively. Aluminium and calcium oxalate are suitable substitute materials for calcifications. Hydroxyapatite is much more attenuating than the calcifications and aluminium. Using solid hydroxyapatite as a substitute for calcification of the same size would lead to excessive contrast in the mammographic image. [Calcium oxalate druses Fagopyrum contain high levels of crystalline calcium oxalate (CaOx) deposits, or druses, that can affect the leaf optical properties. As selenium has been shown to modify the uptake and accumulation of metabolically important elements such as calcium, we hypothesised that the numbers of druses can be altered by selenium treatment, and this would affect the leaf optical properties. Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.) was grown outdoors in an experimental field. At the beginning of flowering, plants were foliarly sprayed with sodium selenate solution at 10 mg selenium L -1 or only with water. Plant morphological, biochemical, physiological and optical properties were examined, along with leaf elemental composition and content. Se spraying did not affect leaf biochemical and functional properties. However, it increased leaf thickness and the contents of Se in the leaves, and decreased the density of calcium oxalate druses in the leaves. Except Se content, Se spraying did not affect contents of other elements in leaves, including total calcium per dry mass of leaf tissue. Redundancy analysis showed that of all parameters tested, only the calcium oxalate druses parameters were significant in explaining the variability of the leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra. The density of CaOx druses positively correlated with the reflectance in the blue, green, yellow and UV-B regions of the spectrum, while the area of CaOx druses per mm 2 of leaf transection area positively correlated with the transmittance in the green and yellow regions of the spectrum.

[Contrasting calcium localization and speciation in leaves of Medicago trunculata mutant COD5 X-ray database](https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/find-a-publication/) Oxalate-producing plants accumulate calcium oxalate crystals (CaOx(C)) in the range of 3-80%(w/w) of their dry weight, reducing calcium (Ca) bioavailability. The calcium oxalate deficient 5 (cod5) mutant of Medicago truncatula has been previously shown to contain similar Ca, but lower oxalate and Ca... [Ozone-Induced Responses in Croton floribundus Spreng. Here, we proposed that volatile organic compounds (VOC), specifically methyl salicylate (MeSA), mediate the formation of calcium oxalate crystals (COC) in the defence against ozone (O3) oxidative damage. We performed experiments using Croton floribundus, a pioneer tree species that is tolerant to O3 and widely distributed in the Brazilian forest. This species constitutively produces COC. We exposed plants to a controlled fumigation experiment and assessed biochemical, physiological, and morphological parameters. O3 induced a significant increase in the concentrations of constitutive oxygenated compounds, MeSA and terpenoids as well as in COC number. Our analysis supported the hypothesis that ozone-induced VOC (mainly MeSA) regulate ROS formation in a way that promotes the opening of calcium channels and the subsequent formation of COC in a fast and stable manner to stop the consequences of the reactive oxygen species in the tissue, indeed immobilising the excess calcium (caused by acute exposition to O3) that can be dangerous to the plant. To test this hypothesis, we performed an independent experiment spraying MeSA over C. floribundus plants and observed an increase in the number of COC, indicating that this compound has a potential to directly induce their formation. Thus, the tolerance of C. floribundus to O3 oxidative stress could be a consequence of a higher capacity for the production of VOC and COC rather than the modulation of antioxidant balance. We also present some insights into constitutive morphological features that may be related to the tolerance that this species exhibits to O3. PMID:25165889 [Oxalate induces mitochondrial dysfunction and 2018-05-01 Monocytes/macrophages are thought to be recruited to the renal interstitium during calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stone disease for crystal clearance. Mitochondria play an important role in monocyte function during the immune response. We recently determined that monocytes in patients with CaOx kidney stones have decreased mitochondrial function compared to healthy subjects. The objective of this study was to determine whether oxalate, a major constituent found in CaOx kidney stones, alters cell viability, mitochondrial function, and redox homeostasis in THP-1 cells, a human derived monocyte cell line. THP-1 cells were treated with varying concentrations of CaOx crystals (insoluble form) or sodium oxalate (NaOx; soluble form) for 24h. In addition, the effect of calcium phosphate (CaP) and cystine crystals was tested. CaOx crystals decreased cell viability and induced mitochondrial dysfunction and redox imbalance in THP-1 cells compared to control cells. However, NaOx only caused mitochondrial damage and redox imbalance in THP-1 cells. In contrast, both CaP and cystine crystals did not affect THP-1 cells. Separate experiments showed that elevated oxalate also induced mitochondrial dysfunction in primary monocytes from healthy subjects. These findings suggest that oxalate may play an important role in monocyte mitochondrial dysfunction in CaOx kidney stone disease. Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

[Calcium oxalate crystals induces tight junction disruption in distal renal tubular epithelial cells by activating ROS/Akt/p38 MAPK signaling Yu, Lei; Gan, Xiuguo; Liu, Xukun; An, Ruihua 2017-11-01 Tight junction plays important roles in regulating paracellular transports and maintaining cell polarity. Calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals, the major crystalline composition of kidney stones, have been demonstrated to be able to cause tight junction disruption to accelerate renal cell injury. However, the cellular signaling involved in COM crystal-induced tight junction disruption remains largely to be investigated. In the present study, we proved that COM crystals induced tight junction disruption by activating ROS/Akt/p38 MAPK pathway. Treating Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with COM crystals induced a substantial increasing of ROS generation and activation of Akt that triggered subsequential activation of ASK1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Western blot revealed a significantly decreased expression of ZO-1 and occludin, two important structural proteins of tight junction. Besides, redistribution and dissociation of ZO-1 were observed by COM crystals treatment. Inhibition of ROS by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) attenuated the activation of ASK1, p38 MAPK, down-regulation ZO-1 and occludin. The redistribution and dissociation of ZO-1 were also alleviated by NAC treatment. These results indicated that ROS were involved in the regulation of tight junction disruption induced by COM crystals. In addition, the down-regulation of ZO-1 and occludin, the phosphorylation by MK-2206, an inhibitor of Akt kinase, implying Akt was involved in the disruption of tight junction upstream of p38 MAPK. Thus, these results suggested that ROS-Akt-p38 MAPK signaling pathway was activated in COM crystal-induced disruption of tight junction in MDCK cells. [Inhibition of calcium oxalate crystal deposition on kidneys M 2012-06-01 present study at systematic evaluation of the calyces of Hibiscus sabdariffa to establish its scientific validity for anti-urolithiatic property using ethylene glycol-induced hyperoxaluria model in male albino rats. Administration of a mixture of 0.75% ethylene glycol and 2% ammonium chloride resulted in hyperoxaluria as well as increased renal excretion of calcium and phosphate. The decrease in the serum calcium concentration indicates an increased calcium oxalate formation. Supplementation of aqueous extract of H. sabdariffa at different doses (250, 500 and 750 mg/kg body weight) significantly lowered the deposition of stone-forming constituents in the kidneys and serum of urolithiatic rats. These findings have been confirmed through histological investigations. Results of in vivo genotoxicity testing showed no significant chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow cells of ethylene glycol-induced rats. The plant extracts at the doses investigated induced neither toxic nor lethal effects and are safe. It can be concluded that the calyces of H. sabdariffa are endowed with anti-urolithiatic activity and do not have genotoxic effects. Thus, it can be introduced in clinical practices and medicine in the form of orally administered syrup after further investigations and clinical trials. [Modulation of calcium oxalate dihydrate growth by selective phosphorylated Marc 2009-08-28 mineral and the urinary protein osteopontin/uropontin (OPN) are commonly found in kidney stones. To investigate the effects of OPN on COD growth, COD crystals were grown with phosphorylated or a polyaspartic showed increased dimensions of the {110} prismatic faces attributable to selective inhibition at this crystallographic face. At high concentrations of OPN, elongated crystals with dominant {110} faces were produced, often intergrown, interpenetrating twin crystals. Poly-Asp(86-93) dose-dependently elongated crystal morphology along the {110} faces in a manner similar to OPN. In crystal growth studies using fluorescently tagged poly-Asp(86-93) followed by imaging of crystal interiors using confocal microscopy, sectoral (compositional) zoning in COD was observed resulting from selective binding and incorporation (occlusion) of peptide exclusively into {110} crystal sectors. Computational modeling of poly-Asp(86-93) adsorption to COD {110} and {101} surfaces also suggests increased stabilization of the COD {110} surface and negligible change to the natively stable {101} surface. Ultrastructural, colloidal-gold immunolocalization of OPN by transmission electron microscopy in human stones confirmed an intracrystalline distribution of OPN. In summary, OPN and its poly-Asp(86-93) sequence similarly affect COD mineral growth; the {110} crystallographic faces become enhanced and dominant attributable to {110} face inhibition by the protein/peptide, and peptides can incorporate into the mineral phase. We, thus, conclude that the poly-Asp(86-93) domain is central to the OPN ability to interact with the {110} faces of COD, where it binds to inhibit crystal growth with subsequent intracrystalline incorporation (occlusion). [Oxalate to hyperoxaluria and subsequent acute oxalate nephritis (AON). AON related to chronic pancreatitis is a rare and poorly described condition precluding early recognition and treatment. We collected the clinical characteristics, treatment, and renal outcome of 12 patients with chronic pancreatitis-associated AON followed in four French renal units. Before AON, mild to moderate chronic kidney disease was present in all patients, diabetes mellitus in eight (insulin [n = 6]; oral antidiabetic drugs [n = 2]), and known chronic pancreatitis in only eight. At presentation, pancreas imaging showed gland atrophy/heterogeneity, Wirsung duct dilation, calcification, or pseudocyst. Renal findings consisted of rapidly progressive renal failure with tubulointerstitial profile. Acute modification of glomerular filtration preceded the AON (i.e., diarrhea and diuretics). Increase in urinary oxalate excretion was found in all tested patients and hypocalcemia in nine (<1.5 mmol/L in four patients). Renal biopsy showed diffuse crystal deposits, highly suggestive of oxalate crystals, with tubular necrosis and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates. Treatment consisted of pancreatic enzyme supplementation, oral calcium intake, and an oxalate-free diet in all patients and renal replacement therapy in five patients. After a median follow-up of 7 months, three of 12 patients reached end-stage renal disease. AON is an under-recognized severe crystal-induced renal disease with features of tubulointerstitial nephritis that may occur in patients with a long history of chronic pancreatitis or reveal the pancreatic disease. Extrinsic triggering factors should be prevented. [The effect of ascorbic acid ingestion on the biochemical and physicochemical risk factors associated with calcium oxalate kidney stone formation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9589801) Auer, B L; Auer, D; Rodgers, A L 1998-03-01 The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of ingestion of large doses of vitamin C on urinary oxalate excretion and on a number of other biochemical and physicochemical risk factors associated with calcium oxalate urolithiasis. A further objective was to determine urinary ascorbate excretion and to relate it qualitatively to ingested levels of the vitamin and oxalate excretion. Ten healthy males participated in a protocol in which 4 g ascorbic acid was ingested for 5 days. Urines (24 h) were collected prior to, during and after the protocol. The urine collection procedure was designed to allow for the analysis of oxalate in the presence and absence of an EDTA preservative and for the analysis of ascorbic acid by manual titration using 2,6 dichlorophenolindophenol. Physicochemical risk factors such as the calcium oxalate relative supersaturation and Tiselius risk index were calculated from urine composition. The results showed that erroneously high analytical oxalate levels occur in the asence of preservative. In the preserved samples there was no significant increase in oxalate excretion at any stage of the protocol. Ascorbate excretion increased when vitamin C ingestion commenced but levelled out after 24 hours suggesting that saturation of the metabolic pool is reached within 24 hours after which ingested ascorbic acid is excreted unmetabolized in the urine. While transient statistically significant changes occurred in some of the biochemical risk factors, they were not regarded as being clinically significant. There were no changes in either the calcium oxalate relative supersaturation or Tiselius risk index. It is concluded that ingestion of large doses of ascorbic acid does not affect the principal risk factors associated with calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. [Oxalate secretion by ectomycorrhizal A. 2015-07-01 Trees and their associated rhizosphere organisms play a major role in mineral weathering driving calcium fluxes from the continents to the oceans that ultimately control long-term atmospheric CO2 and climate through the geochemical carbon cycle. Photosynthate allocation to tree roots and their mycorrhizal fungi is hypothesized to fuel the active secretion of protons and organic chelators that enhance calcium dissolution at fungal-mineral interfaces. This was tested using 14CO2 supplied to shoots of Pinus sylvestris ectomycorrhizal with the widespread fungus Paxillus involutus in monoxenic microcosms, revealing preferential allocation by the fungus of plant photoassimilate to weather grains of limestone and silicates each with a combined calcium and magnesium content of over 10 wt.%. Hyphae had acidic surfaces and linear accumulation of weathered calcium with secreted oxalate, increasing significantly in sequence: quartz, granite < basalt, olivine, limestone < gabbro. These findings confirmed the role of mineral-specific oxalate exudation in ectomycorrhizal weathering to dissolve calcium bearing minerals, thus contributing to the geochemical carbon cycle. [Crystal forms of the crystalline forms of the antidepressant o-desmethylvenlafaxine salt as potential new commercial forms and evaluate their physicochemical properties, in particular the dissolution rate. A new hydrogen oxalate salt of o-desmethylvenlafaxine hydrogen oxalate (ODV-OX) was synthesized, and a polymorph screening was performed using different solvents and crystallization conditions. Crystalline forms were characterized by a combination of solid-state techniques: X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The stability of all crystalline phases was tested under International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) conditions (40\u00b0C and 75% Relative Humidity (RH)) for 1 week. Dissolution tests were performed on the hydrogen oxalate salt ODV-OX Form 1 and compared with dissolution test on the commercial form of the succinate salt of o-desmethylvenlafaxine. Five crystalline forms of ODV-OX were isolated, namely three hydrated forms (Form 1, Form 2, Form 3) and two anhydrous forms (Form 4 and Form 5). Comparative solubility tests on ODV-OX Form 1 and o-desmethylvenlafaxine succinate evidenced a significant increase in solubility for the hydrogen oxalate salt (142 g/l) with respect to the succinate salt (70 g/l). \u00a9 2015 Royal Pharmaceutical Society. [Discrimination of clinically significant calcium salts using MARS spectral CT](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017SPIE10132E..35K) N. 2017-03-01 Calcium compounds within tissues are usually a sign of pathology, and calcium crystal type is often a pointer to the diagnosis. There are clinical advantages in being able to determine the quantity and type of calcifications non-invasively in cardiovascular, genitourinary and musculoskeletal disorders, and treatment differs depending on the crystal type and quantity. The problem arises when trying to distinguish between different calcium compounds within the same image due to their similar attenuation properties. There are spectroscopic differences between calcium salts at very low energies. As calcium oxalate and calcium hydroxyapatite can co-exist in breast and musculoskeletal pathologies of the breast, we wished to determine whether Spectral CT could distinguish between them in the same image at clinical X-ray energy ranges. Energy thresholds of 15, 22, 29 and 36keV and tube voltages of 50, 80 and 110kVp were chosen, and images were analysed to determine the percentage difference in the attenuation coefficients of calcium hydroxyapatite samples at concentrations of 54.3, 211.7, 808.5 and 1169.3mg/ml, and calcium oxalate at a concentration of 2000 mg/ml. The two lower concentrations of calcium hydroxyapatite were distinguishable from calcium oxalate at all energies and all tube voltages, whereas the ability to discriminate oxalate from hydroxyapatite at higher concentrations was dependent on the threshold energy but only mildly dependent on the tube voltage used. Spectral CT shows promise for distinguishing clinically important calcium salts. [Characterization of metabolic network of oxalic acid biosynthesis through RNA seq data analysis of developing spikes of finger millet (Eleusine coracana): Deciphering the role of key genes involved in oxalate formation in relation to grain calcium accumulation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29459009) Akbar, Anil 2018-04-05 In the present study, we identified seven major genes of oxalic acid biosynthesis pathway (SGAT, GGAT, OXO) from developing spike transcriptome of finger millet using rice as a reference. Sequence alignment of identified genes showed high similarity with their respective homolog in rice except for OXO and GLO. Transcript abundance (FPKM) reflects the higher accumulation of identified genes in GP-1 (low calcium genotype) as compared to GP-45 (high calcium genotype) which was further confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis, indicating differential oxalate formation in both genotypes. Determination of oxalic acid and tartaric acid content in developing spikes explain that higher oxalic acid content in GP-1 however, tartaric acid content was more in GP-45. Higher calcium content in GP-45 and lower oxalate accumulation may be due to the diversion of more ascorbic acid into tartaric acid and may correspond to less formation of calcium oxalate. Our results suggest that more than one pathway for oxalic acid biosynthesis might be present in finger millet with probable predominance of ascorbate-tartarate pathway rather than glyoxalate-oxalate conversion. Thus, finger millet can be use as an excellent model system for understanding more specific role of nutrients-antinutrients interactions, as evident from the present study.

[The influence of oxalate-promoted growth growth of silicate layers or metal hydroxide layers in the interlayer space of other clay minerals is known from various mixed-layer clay minerals such as illite-smectite (I-S), chlorite-vermiculite, and mica-vermiculite. In a recent study, the present authors proposed that smectite-group minerals can be synthesized from solution as new 2:1 silicate layers within the low-charge interlayers of rectorite. That study showed how oxalate catalyzes the crystallization of saponite from a silicate gel at low temperatures (60\u00baC) and ambient pressure. As an extension of this work the aim of the present study was to test the claim that new 2:1 silicate layers can be synthesized as new intercalating layers in the low-charge interlayers of rectorite and whether oxalate could promote such an intercalation synthesis. Two experiments were conducted at 60\u00baC and atmospheric pressure. First, disodium oxalate solution was added to a suspension of rectorite in order to investigate the effects that oxalate anions have on the structure of rectorite. In a second experiment, silicate gel of saponitic composition (calculated interlayer charge 0.33 eq/O10(OH)2) was mixed with a suspension of rectorite and incubated in disodium oxalate solution. The synthesis products were extracted after 3 months and analyzed by X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The treatment of ultrathin sections with octadecylammonium (nC = 18) cations revealed the presence of 2:1 layer silicates with different interlayer charges that grew from the silicate gel. The oxalate-promoted nucleation of saponite and talc crystallites on the rectorite led to the alteration and ultimately to the destruction of the rectorite structure. The change was documented in HRTEM lattice-fringe images. The crystallization of new 2:1 layer silicates also occurred within the expandable interlayers of rectorite but not as new 2:1 silicate layers parallel to the previous 2 [Oxalate secretion by ectomycorrhizal Paxillus A. 2015-01-01 Trees and their associated rhizosphere organisms play a major role in mineral weathering driving calcium fluxes from the continents to the oceans that ultimately control long-term atmospheric CO2 and climate through the geochemical carbon cycle.

PMID:26197714 [Urinary and plasma oxalate during ingestion pure a re-evaluation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6628476) Fituri, N; Allawi, N; Bentley, M; Costello, J 1983-01-01 Daily ingestion of 8 g of pure ascorbic acid by 8 normal subjects for 7 days did not, in contrast to previous reports in the literature, significantly alter urinary or plasma oxalate during or after ingestion. When urine with raised ascorbate values was heated at 100 degrees C for 30 min, a significant increase in urinary oxalate concentration was observed. Plasma ascorbate reached a mean value during ingestion of 3.3 mg/100 ml. Urinary citrate excretion significantly decreased during the first 4 days of ascorbic acid ingestion; however, the urinary inhibitory activity of calcium oxalate crystal growth was not significantly altered. Urinary and serum urate as well as urinary calcium and magnesium were unaltered by ingestion of the vitamin supplement. [Inhibition of Glycolate Oxidase With Dicer-substrate siRNA Reduces Calcium Oxalate Deposition in (PH1) is disorder alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase a key hepatic enzyme in the detoxification glyoxylate arising from multiple normal metabolic pathways to glycine. Accumulation of glyoxylate, a precursor of oxalate, leads to the overproduction of oxalate in the liver, which accumulates to high levels in kidneys and urine. Crystalization of calcium oxalate (CaOx) in the kidney ultimately results in renal failure. Currently, the only treatment effective in reduction of oxalate production in patients who do not respond to high-dose vitamin B6 therapy is a combined liver/kidney transplant. We explored an alternative approach to prevent glyoxylate production using Dicer-substrate small interfering the hepatic conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate. This approach efficiently reduces GO mRNA and protein in the livers of mice and nonhuman primates. Reduction of hepatic GO leads to normalization of urine oxalate levels and reduces CaOx deposition in a preclinical mouse model of PH1. Our results support the use of DsiRNA to reduce liver GO levels as a potential therapeutic approach to treat PH1. PMID:26758691 [Stone size limits the use of Hounsfield units for prediction of calcium oxalate role of stone size in predicting urinary calculus composition using Hounsfield units on noncontrasted computed tomography (CT) scan. A retrospective review was performed for all patients who underwent ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy during a 1-year period, had a stone analysis performed, and had CT imaging available for review. All CT scans were reviewed by a board-certified radiologist. Variables evaluated included age, sex, body mass index, stone size, stone location, Hounsfield units (HUs), and stone composition. We identified a total of 91 patients (41 men and 50 women) with CT imaging and stone analysis available for review. Stone analysis showed 41 calcium oxalate monohydrate (CaOxMH), 13 calcium oxalate dihydrate, 29 calcium phosphate, 5 uric acid, 2 struvite, and 1 cystine stone. Average age was 46 years, and average body mass index was 32 kg/m2. Measured HUs varied significantly with size for CaOxMH and calcium oxalate dihydrate stones (P values <.05), but not for calcium phosphate stones (P = .126). Using a CaOxMH identification value of 700-1000 HUs, 28 of 41 stone compositions (68%) would not have been correctly identified, including all 10 (100%) small (<5 mm) stones, 13 of 22 (59%) medium (5-10 mm) stones, and 5 of 9 large (>10 mm) stones (55%). For calcium stones, the ability of CT HUs to predict stone composition was limited, likely due to the mixed stone composition. Within a cohort of CaOxMH stone formers, measured HUs varied linearly with stone size. All stones <5 mm were below thresholds for CaOxMH composition. Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.

[Preventive treatment of calcium oxalate crystal deposition are used for their diuretic, urolithiatic and anti-inflammatory effects on urinary system problems in Turkey and the most common traditional remedy for kidney stones is the tea of immortal flowers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the preventive effect of infusions prepared from capitulums of barellieri on formation of kidney stones. Sodium oxalate (Ox-70mg/kg intraperitoneally) was used to induce kidney stones on Wistar albino rats. At the same time, two different doses of the plant extracts (HG: 62.5 and 125mg/kg; HS: 78 and 156mg/kg) were dissolved in the drinking water and administered to animals for 5 days. Potassium citrate was used as positive control in the experiments. During the experiment, water intake, urine volume and body weights of the animals were recorded. At the end of the experiments, liver, kidney and body weights of the animals were determined; biochemical analysis were conducted on urine, blood and plasma samples. Histopathological changes in kidney tissues were examined and statistical analysis were evaluated. HS extract showed the highest preventive effect at 156mg/kg dose (stone formation score: 1.16), whereas a number of kidney stones were maximum in sodium oxalate group (stone formation score: 2.66). Helichrysum extracts decreased urine oxalate and uric acid levels and increased citrate levels significantly. In addition, Helichrysum extracts regulated the negative changes in biochemical and hematological parameters occurred after Ox injection. We conclude that Helichrysum extracts could reduce the formation and growth of kidney stones in Ox-induced urolithiasis and can be beneficial for patients with recurrent stones. In addition, this is the first study on the preventive effect of immortal flowers. Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. [Acute oxalate nephropathy due to Irumban puli (Averrhoa bilimbi) is commonly used as a traditional remedy in the state of Kerala. Freshly made concentrated juice has a very high oxalic acid content and consumption carries a high risk of developing acute renal failure (ARF) by deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in renal tubules. Acute oxalate nephropathy (AON) due to secondary oxalosis after consumption of Irumban puli juice is uncommon. AON due to A. bilimbi has not been reported before. We present a series of ten patients from five hospitals in the State of Kerala who developed ARF after intake of I. puli fruit juice. Seven patients needed hemodialysis whereas the other three improved with conservative management. [Externalization of phosphatidylserine via multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1)/P-glycoprotein in oxalate-treated epithelial implications calcium Yue-Qiu; An, Rui-Hua 2016-02-01 We investigated the possible involvement of multidrug resistance protein 1 P-glycoprotein (MDR1 P-gp) in the oxalate-induced of phosphatidylserine in renal epithelial cell membranes. Real-time PCR and western blotting were used to examine MDR1 expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells at the mRNA and protein levels, respectively, whereas surface-expressed phosphatidylserine was detected by the annexin V-binding assay. Oxalate treatment resulted in increased synthesis of MDR1, which resulted in phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization in the renal epithelial cell membrane. Treatment the MDR1 inhibitor PSC833 significantly attenuated phosphatidylserine externalization. Transfection of the human MDR1 gene into renal epithelial cells significantly increased PS externalization. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that oxalate increases the synthesis of MDR1 P-gp, which plays a key role in hyperoxaluria-promoted calcium oxalate urolithiasis by facilitating phosphatidylserine redistribution in renal epithelial cells. [Turning sunlight into stone: the oxalate-carbonate pathway in a tropical the iroko tree (Milicia excelsa), has the property to enhance carbonate precipitation in tropical oxisols, where such accumulations are not expected due to the acidic conditions in these types of soils. This uncommon process is linked to the oxalate-carbonate pathway, which increases soil pH through oxalate oxidation. In order to investigate the oxalate-carbonate pathway in the iroko system, fluxes of matter have been identified, described, and evaluated from field to microscopic scales. In the first centimeters of the soil profile, decaying of the organic matter allows the release of whewellite crystals, mainly due to the action of termites and saprophytic fungi. In addition, a concomitant flux of carbonate formed in wood tissues contributes to the carbonate flux and is identified as a direct consequence of wood feeding by termites. Nevertheless, calcite biomineralization of the tree is not a consequence of in situ oxalate consumption, but rather related to the oxalate oxidation inside the upper part of the soil. The consequence of this oxidation is the presence of carbonate ions in the soil solution pumped through the roots, leading to preferential mineralization of the roots and the trunk base. An ideal scenario for the iroko biomineralization and soil carbonate accumulation starts with oxalatization: as the iroko tree grows, the organic matter flux to the soil constitutes the litter, and an oxalate pool is formed on the forest ground. Then, wood rotting agents (mainly termites, saprophytic fungi, and bacteria) release significant amounts of oxalate crystals from decaying plant tissues. In addition, some of these agents are themselves producers of oxalate (e.g. fungi). Both processes contribute to a soil pool of \"available\" oxalate crystals. Oxalate consumption by oxalotrophic bacteria can then start. Carbonate and calcium ions present in the soil solution represent the end products of the oxalate-carbonate pathway.

A supersaturation of CaOx crystal may cause nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. The inflammation derived from the CaOx crystal accumulation, together with innate or secondary renal alterations, could strongly affect the renal function. In this case a consumption of probiotics with either oxalate-degrading activity at intestinal level and systemic anti-inflammatory activity could be an alternative approach to treat the subjects with excess of urinary oxalate excretion. 11 strains of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria), already included in the list of bacteria safe for the human use, were investigated for their capability to degrade oxalate by mean of RP-HPLC-UV method and modulate inflammation in an in vitro model system based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Four promising bacterial strains identified as innovative biological tools for the prevention and the therapeutic treatment of hyperoxaluria and the inflammatory events associated to the Ox accumulation. The oxalate-degrading activity of some probiotics and their capability to modulate the release of inflammation mediators could be exploited as a new nutraceutical and therapeutic approach for the treatment of oxalate accumulation and the related inflammatory state. \u00a9 2014 Institute of Food Technologists\u00ae [Influence of a low- and a high-oxalate vegetarian diet on intestinal oxalate absorption and urinary excretion.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17609696) Thomas, E; von Unruh, G E; Hesse, A 2008-09-01 To compare quantitatively the effect of a low- and a high-oxalate vegetarian diet on intestinal oxalate absorption and urinary excretion. Eight healthy volunteers (three men and five women, mean age 28.6+/-6.3) were studied. Each volunteer performed the [(13)C(2)]oxalate absorption test thrice on a low-oxalate mixed diet, thrice on a low-oxalate vegetarian diet and thrice on a high-oxalate vegetarian diet. For each test, the volunteers had to adhere to an identical diet and collect their 24-h urines. In the morning of the second day, a capsule containing [(13)C(2)]oxalate was ingested. On the low-oxalate vegetarian diet, mean intestinal oxalate absorption and urinary and 0.414+/-0.126 (P=0.012), compared to the mixed On the mmol/day, P=0.093) did not change significantly, compared to the mixed diet. A vegetarian diet can only be recommended for calcium oxalate stone patients, if the diet (1) contains the recommended amounts of divalent cations such as calcium and its timing of ingestion to a meal rich in oxalate is considered and (2) excludes foodstuffs with a high content of nutritional factors, such as phytic acid, which are able to chelate calcium. [Microstructures of Randall's plaques and their interfaces with calcium oxalate monohydrate kidney preferred sites for the formation of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) kidney stones. However, although processes of interstitial calcium phosphate (CaP) plaque formation are not well understood, the potential of plaque microstructures as indicators of CaP precipitation conditions received only limited attention. We investigated RP-associated COM stones for structural details of the calcified tissues and microstructural features of plaque-stone interfaces as indicators of the initial processes of stone formation. Significantly increased CaP supersaturation can be expected for interstitial fluid, if reabsorbed ions from the tubular system continuously diffuse into the collagenous connective tissue. Densely packed, fine-grained CaP particles were found in dense textures of basement membranes while larger, laminated particles were scattered in coarse-meshed interstitial tissue, which we propose to be due to differential spatial confinements and restrictions of ion diffusion. Particle morphologies suggest an initial precipitation as metastable amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP). Morphologies and arrangements of first COM crystals at the RP-stone interface ranged from stacked euhedral platelets to skeletal morphologies and even porous, dendritic structures, indicating, in this order, increasing levels of COM supersaturation. Furthermore, these first COM crystals were often coated with CaP. On this basis, we propose that ions from CaP-supersaturated interstitial fluid may diffuse through porous RP into the urine, where a resulting local increase in COM supersaturation could trigger crystal nucleation and, hence, initiate stone formation. Ion-depleted fluid in persistent pores of initial COM layers may get replenished from interstitial fluid, leading to CaP precipitation in porous COM. [Oxalate and phytate of soy foods.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15998131) Linda K 2005-07-13 The consumption of foods made from soybeans is increasing because of their desirable nutritional value. However, some soy foods contain high concentrations of oxalate and/or phytate. Oxalate is a component of calcium oxalate kidney stones, whereas phytate is an inhibitor of calcium kidney stone formation. Thirty tested commercial soy foods exhibited ranges of 0.02-2.06 mg oxalate/g and 0.80-18.79 mg phytate/g. Commercial soy foods contained 2-58 mg of total oxalate per serving and 76-528 mg phytate per serving. Eighteen of 19 tofu brands and two soymilk brands contained less than 10 mg oxalate per serving, defined as a low oxalate food. Soy flour, textured vegetable soy protein, vegetable soybeans, soy nuts, tempeh, and soynut butter exhibited greater than 10 mg per serving. The correlation between oxalate and phytate in the soy foods was significant (r = 0.71, P < 0.001) indicating that oxalate-rich soy foods also contain higher concentrations of phytate. There also was a significant correlation, based on molar basis, between the divalent ion binding potential of oxalate plus phytate and calcium plus magnesium (r = 0.90, P < 0.001) in soy foods. Soy foods containing small concentrations of oxalate and moderate concentrations of phytate may be advantageous for kidney stone patients or persons with a high risk of kidney stones. [Oxalate Content of Taro Leaves Grown in Central Vietnam.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28231080) Du Thanh, Hang; Phan Vu, Hai; Vu Van, Hai; Le Duc, Ngoan; Le Minh, Tuan; Savage, Geoffrey 2017-01-01 Leaves were harvested from four different cultivars of Colocasia esculenta and three cultivars of Alocasia odora that were growing on nine different farms in central Vietnam. The total, soluble and insoluble oxalate contents of the leaves were extracted and measured using HPLC chromatography. Total calcium determinations were also carried out on the same samples. The total oxalate content of the leaves ranged from 433.8 to 856.1 mg/100 g wet matter (WM) while the oxalate ranged from 147.8 to 339.7 mg/100 g WM. The proportion of soluble oxalate ranged from 28% to 41% (overall mean 35%) of the total oxalate content of the leaves. The equivalent insoluble oxalate proportion ranged from 59% to 72% of the total (overall mean 65%). There was little difference between the Colocasia esculenta and Alocasia odora taro cultivars, although the content was significantly higher in Alocasia odora cultivars. The overall mean total calcium content was 279.5 mg/100 WM and the percentage of insoluble calcium bound as calcium oxalate ranged from 31.7% to 57.3% of the total calcium content (overall mean 47.1%). The oxalate content in taro leaves is a major factor to consider when different cultivars of taro are recommended for human or animal consumption. [Acute oxalate nephropathy due to Irumban puli (Averrhoa bilimbi) is commonly used as a traditional remedy in the state of Kerala. Freshly made concentrated juice has a very high oxalic acid content and consumption carries a high risk of developing acute renal failure (ARF) by deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in renal tubules. Acute oxalate nephropathy (AON) due to secondary oxalosis after consumption of Irumban puli juice is uncommon. AON due to A. bilimbi has not been reported before. We present a series of ten patients from five hospitals in the State of Kerala who developed ARF after intake of I. puli fruit juice. Seven patients needed hemodialysis whereas the other three improved with conservative management. PMID:23960349 [Degradation of oxalate in rats implanted K Tarachand, U hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis in man. Since oxalate is a metabolic end product in mammals, the feasibility of its enzymic degradation has been tested in vivo in rats by administering exogenous oxalate oxidase. Oxalate oxidase, isolated from banana fruit peels, in its native form was found to be non-active at the physiological pH of the recipient animal. However, its functional viability in the recipient animal was ensured by its prior binding with ethylenemaleic anhydride, thus shifting its pH activity curve towards the alkaline range. Rats implanted with dialysis membrane capsules containing such immobilized oxalate oxidase in their peritoneal cavities effectively metabolized intraperitoneally injected [14C]oxalate as well as its precursor [14C]glyoxalate. The implantation of capsules containing coentrapped multienzyme preparations of oxalate oxidase, catalase and peroxidase led to a further degradation of administered [14C]oxalate in rats. [Elemental distribution analysis 2009-10-01 Various crystals are seen in human urine. Some of them, particularly calcium oxalate dihydrate, are seen normally. Pathological crystals indicate crystal formation initiating urinary stones. Unfortunately, many of the relevant crystals are not recognized in light microscopic analysis of the urinary deposit performed in most of the clinical laboratories. Many crystals are not clearly identifiable under the ordinary light microscopy. The objective of the present study was to perform scanning electron microscopic (SEM) assessment of various urinary deposits and confirm the identity by elemental distribution analysis (EDAX). 50 samples of urinary deposits were collected from urinary stone clinic. Deposits containing significant crystalluria (more than 10 per HPF) were collected under liquid paraffin in special containers and taken up for SEM studies. The deposited crystals were retrieved with appropriate Pasteur pipettes, and placed on micropore filter paper discs. The fluid was absorbed by thicker layers of filter paper underneath and discs were fixed to brass studs. They were then gold sputtered to 100 A and examined under SEM (Jeol JSM 35C microscope). When crystals were seen, their morphology was recorded by taking photographs at different angles. At appropriate magnification, EDAX probe was pointed to the crystals under study and the wave patterns analyzed. Components of the crystals were recognized by utilizing the data. All the samples analyzed contained significant number of crystals. All samples contained more than one type of crystal. The commonest crystals encountered included of urinary crystals described were correlated with the wavelengths obtained through elemental distribution analysis. Various urinary crystals that [Specific Inhibition of Hepatic Lactate Dehydrogenase Reduces Primary hyperoxalurias (PHs) are autosomal recessive disorders caused by the overproduction of oxalate leading to calcium oxalate precipitation in the kidney and eventually to end-stage renal disease. One promising strategy to treat PHs is to reduce the hepatic production of oxalate through substrate reduction therapy by inhibiting liver-specific glycolate oxidase (GO), which controls the conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate, the proposed main precursor to oxalate. Alternatively, diminishing the amount of hepatic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) expression, the proposed key enzyme responsible for converting glyoxylate to oxalate, should directly prevent the accumulation of oxalate in PH patients. Using RNAi, we provide the first in vivo evidence in mammals to support LDH as the key enzyme responsible for converting glyoxylate to oxalate. In addition, we demonstrate that reduction of hepatic LDH achieves efficient oxalate reduction and prevents calcium oxalate crystal deposition in genetically engineered mouse models of PH types 1 (PH1) and 2 (PH2), as well as in chemically induced PH mouse models. Repression of hepatic LDH in mice did not cause any acute elevation of circulating liver enzymes, lactate acidosis, or exertional myopathy, suggesting further evaluation of liver-specific inhibition of LDH as a potential approach for treating PH1 and PH2 is warranted.

[Influence of gamma-irradiation on the non-isothermal decomposition of unirradiated and irradiated Ca-Gd oxalate has been studied by adopting differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric (TG) techniques. The reaction occurs through two stages corresponding to the decomposition of gadolinium oxalate (Gd-Ox) followed by that of calcium oxalate (Ca-Ox). The kinetic parameters for both the stages are calculated by using solid state reaction models and Coats-Redfern's equation. The co-precipitation as well as irradiation alter the DTA peak temperatures and the kinetic parameters of Ca-Ox. The decomposition of Gd-Ox follows the two dimensional Contracting area (R-2) mechanism, while that of Ca-Ox follows the Avrami-Erofeev (A(2)) mechanism (n =2), which are also exhibited by the co-precipitated and irradiated samples. Co-precipitation decreases the energy of activation and the pre-exponential factor of the individual components but the reverse phenomenon takes place upon irradiation of the co-precipitate. The mechanisms underlying the phenomena are explored. [The Roles and Mechanisms of Intestinal Oxalate Transport in Oxalate Homeostasis](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=2430047) Hatch, Marguerite; Freel, Robert W. 2008-01-01 The mammalian intestine has an important role in the dynamics of oxalate exchange and thereby is significant in the etiology of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. Here we review some of the phenomenological observations that have led to the conclusion that anion exchangers (antiporters) are important mediators of secondarily active, net oxalate transport along the intestine (both absorptive and secretory). Understanding the mechanisms of transepithelial oxalate transport has been radically advanced in recent years by the identification of the SLC26 family of anion transporters which has facilitated the identification of specific proteins mediating individual apical or basolateral oxalate transport pathways. Moreover, identification of specific exchangers has underscored their relative importance to oxalate homeostasis as revealed by using knockout mouse models and facilitated studies of oxalate transport regulation in heterologous expression systems. Finally, the significance of oxalate degrading bacteria to oxalate homeostasis is considered from basic and applied perspectives. PMID:18359395 [Molecular modifiers reveal a mechanism of pathological crystal Astrophysics Data Jeffrey D. 2016-08-01 Crystalline materials are crucial to the function of living organisms, in the shells of molluscs, the matrix of bone, the teeth of sea urchins, and the exoskeletons of coccoliths. However, pathological biomineralization can be an undesirable crystallization process associated with human diseases. The crystal growth of biogenic, natural and synthetic materials may be regulated by the action of modifiers, most commonly inhibitors, which range from small ions and molecules to large macromolecules. Inhibitors adsorb on crystal surfaces and impede the addition of solute, thereby reducing the rate of growth. Complex inhibitor-crystal interactions in biomineralization are often not well elucidated. Here we show that two molecular inhibitors of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystallization\u2014citrate and hydroxycitrate\u2014exhibit a mechanism that differs from classical theory in that inhibitor adsorption on crystal surfaces induces dissolution of the crystal under specific conditions rather than a reduced rate of crystal growth. This phenomenon occurs even in supersaturated solutions where inhibitor concentration is three orders of magnitude less than that of the solute. The results of bulk crystallization, in situ atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory studies are qualitatively consistent with a hypothesis that inhibitor-crystal interactions impart localized strain to the crystal lattice and that oxalate and calcium ions are released into solution to alleviate this strain. Calcium oxalate monohydrate is the principal component of human kidney stones and citrate is an often-used therapy, but hydroxycitrate is not. For hydroxycitrate to function as a kidney stone treatment, it must be excreted in urine. We report that hydroxycitrate ingested by non-stone-forming humans at an often-recommended dose leads to substantial urinary excretion. In vitro assays using human urine reveal that the molecular modifier hydroxycitrate is as effective an inhibitor of nucleation [Crystal growth, piezoelectric, non-linear optical and of lithium hydrogen oxalate non-linear optical single crystals have been grown by slow evaporation solution growth technique at 35 \u00b0C. Single crystal X-ray diffraction study showed that the grown crystal belongs to the triclinic system with space group P1. The mechanical strength decreases with increasing load. The piezoelectric coefficient is found to be 1.41 pC/N. The nonlinear optical property was measured using Kurtz Perry powder technique and SHG efficiency was almost equal to that of KDP. [Oxalate deposition on asbestos bodies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14506632) D; Piantadosi, Claude A 2003-08-01 We report on a deposition of oxalate crystals on ferruginous bodies after occupational exposure to asbestos demonstrated in 3 patients. We investigated the mechanism and possible significance of this deposition by testing the hypothesis that oxalate generated through nonenzymatic oxidation of ascorbate by asbestos-associated iron accounts for the deposition of the crystal on a ferruginous body. Crocidolite asbestos (1000 microg/mL) was incubated with 500 micromol H(2)O(2) and 500 micromol ascorbate for 24 hours at 22 degrees C. The dependence of oxalate generation on iron-catalyzed oxidant production was tested with the both the metal chelator deferoxamine and the radical scavenger dimethylthiourea. Incubation of crocidolite, H(2)O(2), and ascorbate in vitro generated approximately 42 nmol of oxalate in 24 hours. Oxalate generation was diminished significantly by the inclusion of either deferoxamine or dimethylthiourea in the reaction mixture. Incubation of asbestos bodies and uncoated fibers isolated from human lung with 500 micromol H(2)O(2) and 500 micromol ascorbate for 24 hours at 22 degrees C resulted in the generation of numerous oxalate crystals. We conclude that iron-catalyzed production of oxalate from ascorbate can account for the deposition of this crystal on ferruginous bodies. [Trichoderma koningii as a biomineralizing fungous agent of oxalate crystals in typical Argiudolls aim of the present study, performed on typical Argiudolls in a natural reserve with little or no anthropic impact, was to characterize the fungous biomineralizing process of calcium oxalate crystals in organic horizons of the soil. The chosen sites possessed different plant cover, identified as acacia woods and grassy meadows with particular micro environmental conditions that have differing effects in the process of biomineralization. The contribution of the plant material in the soil is a key factor since 1) it generates the particular composition of the organic horizons, 2) it determines the nature of decomposing organisms, and 3) it affects the presence, composition and development of biominerals. According to the results obtained, the acacia woods prove to be a site comparatively more favorable to the fungous biomineralizing process. This makes itself manifest in the greater abundance and development of crystals in the organic horizons of the soil, resulting in whewellite (CaC2O4.H2O) and weddellite (CaC2O4.(2+x) H2O) regarding biomineral species developed, the latter being the major component. The observation of both species of biominerals is noteworthy since it represents the first cited in the country. The isolated fungous organisms were Trichoderma koningii, and Absidia corymbifera. T. koningii was identified as the most active biomineralizing organism thus constituting the first reference to indicate this species as a biomineral producing agent. [Determinants of calcium and oxalate excretion in subjects with with urinary calcium (UCE) or oxalate excretion (UOE) is uncertain in calcium stone formers (CSFs). Our aim was to investigate this association in a large group of Caucasian CSFs. We retrospectively reviewed data of CSFs evaluated at our Kidney Stone Clinic from 1984 to 2015. Data on body mass index (BMI), MetS traits defined according to international consensus, family history of urolithiasis, anti-hypertensive treatments, calcemia, renal function, and 24-h urinary profile of lithogenic risk were collected. The association between MetS traits and UCE or UOE was tested with multivariate linear regression models accounting for a long list of potential confounders. We included 3003 CSFs, aged 44 \u00b1 14 years. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, overweight (BMI 25 kg/m 2 ) and dyslipidemia was 17, 2, 42 and 38%, respectively. Median values of UCE and UOE were 211 mg/24 h (IQR 143-296) and 28 mg/24 h (IQR 22-34), respectively. At a multivariate model, including age, sex, date of examination, drug treatments, family history, renal function, blood calcium and urinary factors as covariates, hypertension was a significant positive determinant of UCE ( \u00b1 SE 0.23 \u00b1 0.07, p = 0.003), but overweight, dyslipidemia and diabetes were not. No MetS trait was significantly associated with UOE in multivariate models. In a large group of Caucasian CSFs, hypertension was the only MetS trait significantly associated with UCE, while no MetS trait was associated with oxalate excretion. [Prophylactic role of phycocyanin: a study formation and the associated renal injury is thought to be caused by free radical mediated mechanisms. An in vivo model was used to investigate the effect of phycocyanin (from Spirulina platensis), a known antioxidant, against calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Hyperoxaluria was induced in two of these groups by intraperitoneal infusion of sodium oxalate (70 mg/kg) and a pretreatment of phycocyanin (100 mg/kg) as a single oral dosage was given, 1h prior to sodium oxalate infusion. An untreated control and drug control (phycocyanin alone) were also included in the study. We observed that phycocyanin significantly controlled the early biochemical changes in calcium oxalate stone formation. The antiurolithic nature of the drug was evaluated by the assessment of urinary risk factors and light microscopic observation of urinary crystals. Renal tubular damage as divulged by urinary marker enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl as decreased tubulointerstitial, tubular dilatation and mononuclear inflammatory cells, indicated that renal damage was minimised in drug-pretreated group. Oxalate levels (P < 0.001) and lipid peroxidation (P < 0.001) in kidney tissue were significantly controlled by drug pretreatment, suggesting the ability of phycocyanin to quench the free radicals, thereby preventing the lipid peroxidation mediated tissue damage and oxalate entry. This accounts for the prevention of CaOx stones. Thus, the present analysis revealed the antioxidant and antiurolithic potential of phycocyanin thereby projecting it as a promising therapeutic agent against renal cell injury associated kidney stone formation. [Structural variability in neptunium(V) oxalate compounds: synthesis and structural characterization Bean, C; Garcia, Eduardo; Scott, Brian L; Runde, Wolfgang 2004-10-04 Reaction of a (237)Np(V) stock solution in the presence of oxalic acid, calcium chloride, and sodium hydroxide under hydrothermal conditions produces single crystals of a neptunium(V) oxalate, Na(2)NpO(2)(C(2)O(4))OH.H(2)O. The structure consists of one-dimensional chains running down the a axis and is the first example of a neptunium(V) oxalate compound containing hydroxide anions. [Concentration The kidney eliminates the major fraction of plasma oxalate. It is well known that oxalate is freely filtered by glomeruli and secreted by the proximal tubules. However, the renal handling of oxalate in distal nephrons, which is considered as playing an important role in stone formation, remains obscure. At 15-180 min after intravenous injection of 14C-oxalate to rats, the intrarenal localization of radioactivity was quantitatively measured by the radioluminographic method using a bioimaging analyzer. Tissue radioactivity was compared with plasma, and urinary radioactivities were measured by a liquid scintillation counter. The control study was conducted with 14C-inulin. The radioactivity of 14C-oxalate in the papilla was 10 times greater than in the cortex and eight times greater than in the medulla 180 min after injection when almost no radioactivity was present in the urine. In contrast, the radioactivity of 14C-inulin was nine times less in the papilla than in the cortex at the same time. Oxalate remains in the renal papilla for an extended period. This accumulation of oxalate may be attributed to calcium oxalate crystal fixation along the deep nephron which is considered to be the first step of stone formation. [Influence of acidifying or alkalinizing diets on bone mineral density and urine relative supersaturation with calcium oxalate and struvite in healthy cats.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24066920) Sherry K; Tamberlyn D To evaluate the influence of acidifying or alkalinizing diets on bone mineral density and urine relative supersaturation (URSS) with calcium oxalate and struvite in healthy cats. 6 castrated male and 6 spayed female cats. 3 groups of 4 cats each were fed diets for 12 months that differed only in acidifying or alkalinizing properties (alkalinizing, neutral, and acidifying). Body composition was estimated by use of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and 48-hour urine samples were collected for URSS determination. Urine pH differed significantly among diet groups, with the lowest urine pH values in the acidifying diet group and the highest values in the alkalinizing diet group. Differences were not observed in other variables except urinary ammonia excretion, which was significantly higher in the neutral diet group. Calcium oxalate URSS was highest in the acidifying diet group and lowest in the alkalinizing diet group; struvite URSS was not different among groups. Diet was not significantly associated with bone mineral content or density. Urinary undersaturation with calcium oxalate was achieved by inducing alkaluria. Feeding an alkalinizing diet was not associated with URSS with struvite. Bone mineral density and calcium content were not adversely affected by diet; therefore, release of calcium from bone caused by feeding an acidifying diet may not occur in healthy cats. [Correlation between the development of calcium oxalate stones and polymorphisms in the fibronectin gene in the Uighur population of the Xinjiang region of China.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26535688) Murat, M; Aniwer, Y 2015-10-29 Here, we have investigated the correlation between calcium oxalate stone formation and Fn gene polymorphisms in urinary calculi patients among the Uighur population (Xinjiang region). In this case control study, genomic DNA extracted from the peripheral blood of 129 patients with calcium oxalate stones (patient group) and 94 normal people (control group) was used to genotype polymorphisms in the rs6725958, rs10202709, and rs35343655 sites of the Fn gene by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Subsequently, the association between different genotypes and susceptibility to calcium oxalate stone formation was compared among the patient and control groups. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the rs6725958, rs10202709, and rs35343655 sites of the Fn gene among the patient and control groups. The genotype distributions of the three loci complied with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The results of allele frequencies of the patient/control group for polymorphisms in the rs6725958 site of the Fn gene were C = 179 (69.92%)/119 (63.30%) and A = 77 (30.08%)/69 (36.70%), in the rs10202709 site were C = 245 (95.70%)/176 (93.63%) and T = 11 (4.30%)/12 (6.38%), and in the rs35343655 site of the Fn gene were A = 139 (54.30%)/87 (46.28%) and G = 117 (45.70%)/101 (53.72%). We observed no significant differences between the three SNPs and development of calcium oxalate stones. Polymorphisms in rs6725958, rs10202709, and rs35343655 of the Fn gene had no obvious effect on the susceptibility to the development of calcium oxalate stones in the Uighur population, residing in the Xinjiang region of China. [Oxalate content of cereals and knowledge of food oxalate content is of essential importance for dietary treatment of recurrent calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Dietary oxalate can contribute considerably to the amount of urinary oxalate excretion. Because cereal foods play an important role in daily nutrition, the soluble and total oxalate contents of various types of cereal grains, milling products, bread, pastries, and pasta were analyzed using an HPLC-enzyme-reactor method. A high total oxalate content (>50 mg/100 g) was found in whole grain durum (76.6 mg/100 g). Total oxalate content was comparably high in whole grain products of T. aestivum, that is, wheat flakes and flour, as well as in whole grain products of T. durum, that is, couscous, bulgur, and pasta. The highest oxalate content was demonstrated for wheat bran (457.4 mg/100 g). The higher oxalate content in whole grain than in refined grain cereals suggests that oxalic acid is primarily located in the outer layers of cereal grains. Cereals and cereal products contribute to the daily oxalate intake to a considerable extent. Vegetarian diets may contain high amounts of oxalate when whole grain wheat and wheat products are ingested. Recommendations for prevention of recurrence of calcium oxalate stone disease have to take into account the oxalate content of these foodstuffs. [Efficient green luminescence of terbium oxalate crystals: A case study with Judd-Ofelt theory and single crystal structure analysis and the effect of dehydration on luminescence](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018JSSCh.262...68A) [NASA Astrophysics Data System Design and synthesis of Lanthanide based metal organic framework is a frontier area of research owing to their structural diversity enabling specific applications. The luminescence properties of rare earths, tuned by the structural features of Ln-MOFs are investigated extensively. Rare earth oxalates which can be synthesized in a facile method, ensuring the structural features of MOFs with excellent photoluminescence characteristics deserves much attention. This work is the first time report on the single crystal structure and Judd-Ofelt (JO) theoretical analysis - their correlation with the intense and sharp green luminescence of Terbium oxalate crystals. The intense green luminescence observed for Terbium oxalate crystals for a wide range of excitation from DUV to visible region despite the luminescence limiting factors are discussed. The absence of concentration quenching and lifting up of forbidden nature of f-f transitions, allowing direct excitation of Terbium ions is analysed with the help of JO theory and single crystal structure analysis. The JO analysis predicted the asymmetry of Terbium sites, allowing the electric dipole transitions and from the JO intensity parameters, promising spectroscopic parameters - emission cross section, branching ratio, gain band width and gain coefficient of the material were calculated. The single crystal structure analysis revealed the asymmetry of Tb sites and structure of Terbium oxalate is formed by the hydrogen bonded stacking of overlapped six Terbium membered rings connected by the oxalate ligands. The molecularly thick layers thus formed on the crystal surface are imaged by the atomic force microscopy. The presence of water channels in the structure and the effect of lattice water molecules on the luminescence intensity are also investigated. [Calcium Oxalate Urolithiasis: Missing Manoj; Miller, Aaron W 2018-05-29 Urinary stone disease (USD) has known associations with the gut microbiota. Approximately 80% of kidney stones contain oxalate as a primary constituent and diverse oxalate-degrading bacteria exist within the human gut that may protect against USD. While bacteriotherapy represents a promising strategy to eliminate oxalate and reduce the risk of USD, oxalate-degrading probiotics have had limited success. To identify limitations of oxalate-degrading probiotics and refine development of bacteriotherapies to prevent USD, we review the literature associated with the gut microbiota and USD. A literature search was performed to identify publications that examine the role of oxalate-degrading bacteria or the whole gut microbiota in oxalate metabolism and the pathophysiology of USD. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies that examined the association of the whole gut microbiota with USD. In addition, we evaluated the gut microbiota of healthy individuals and those with co-morbidities related to USD using publically available data from the American Gut Project (AGP). Studies on O. formigenes reveal that colonization by this species is not a good predictor of USD risk nor urinary oxalate excretion. The species of oxalate-degrading bacteria used in probiotics and duration of administration does not impact efficacy or persistence. Studies focused on the whole gut microbiota reveal broad shifts in the gut microbiota associated with USD and a diverse microbial network is associated with oxalate metabolism. AGP data analysis demonstrated a strong overlap in microbial genera depleted in diseased individuals among USD and co-morbidities. The associations between the gut microbiota and USD extend beyond individual functional microbial species. Common shifts in the gut microbiota may facilitate the onset of USD and/or co-morbidities. The successful development of bacteriotherapies to inhibit USD will need to incorporate strategies that target a broad diversity of bacteria rather than [Urinary Calcium and Oxalate Excretion in Healthy Adult Cats Are Not Affected by Increasing Dietary Levels of Bone Meal in a Canned Diet](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3734279) Passlack, Nadine; Zentek, J\u00fcrgen 2013-01-01 This study aimed to investigate the impact of dietary calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P), derived from bone meal, on the feline urine composition and the urinary pH, allowing a risk assessment for the formation of calcium oxalate (CaOx) uroliths in cats. Eight healthy adult cats received 3 canned diets, containing 12.2 (A), 18.5 (B) and 27.0 g Ca/kg dry matter (C) and 16.1 (A), 17.6 (B) and 21.1 g P/kg dry matter (C). Each diet was fed over 17 days. After a 7 day adaptation period, urine and faeces were collected over 2\u00d74 days (with a two-day rest between), and blood samples were taken. Urinary and faecal minerals, urinary oxalate (Ox), the urinary pH and the concentrations of serum Ca, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were analyzed. Moreover, the urine was microscopically examined for CaOx uroliths. The results demonstrated that increasing levels of dietary Ca led to decreased serum PTH and Ca and increased faecal Ca and P concentrations, but did not affect the urinary Ca or Ox concentrations or the urinary fasting pH. The urinary postprandial pH slightly increased when the diet C was compared to the diet B. No CaOx crystals were detected in the urine of the cats. In conclusion, urinary Ca excretion in cats seems to be widely independent of the dietary Ca levels when Ca is added as bone meal to a typical canned diet, implicating that raw materials with higher contents of bones are of subordinate importance as risk factors for the formation of urinary CaOx crystals. PMID:23940588 [Phase transformation of calcium oxalate of relative humidity and new spectroscopic properties of calcium oxalates and their controversial transformation mechanism are presented. We have focused on whewellite (CaC2O4\u00b7H2O) and weddellite [CaC2O4\u00b7(2 + x) H2O], the most common phases of calcium oxalate; these compounds occur in many organisms, in kidney stones and in particular kinds of films found on the surface of many works of art. Low temperature experiments carried out by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy have highlighted both the high structural order in the crystalline state of whewellite and the disordered distribution of the zeolitic water molecules in weddellite. The synthesised nanocrystals of weddellite have been kept under different hygrometric conditions in order to study, by X-ray powder diffraction, the role of \"external\" water molecules on their stability. Moreover, in order to identify the different kinds of water molecules, a re-investigation, supported by quantum chemical calculations, of the observed vibrational spectra (IR and Raman) of whewellite has been conducted. [Selective Rac1 injury the major mechanisms implicated in calcium oxalate nucleation, aggregation and growth of kidney stones. We previously demonstrated that oxalate-induced NADPH oxidase-derived free radicals play a significant role in renal injury. Since NADPH oxidase activation requires several regulatory proteins, the primary goal of this study was to characterize the role of Rac GTPase in oxalate-induced NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative injury in renal epithelial cells. Our results show that oxalate significantly increased membrane translocation of Rac1 and NADPH oxidase activity of renal epithelial cells in a time-dependent manner. We found that NSC23766, a selective inhibitor of blocked oxalate-induced membrane translocation of Rac1 In the absence of Rac1 inhibitor, oxalate exposure significantly increased hydrogen peroxide formation and LDH release in renal epithelial cells. In contrast, Rac1 inhibitor pretreatment, significantly decreased oxalate-induced hydrogen peroxide production and LDH release. Furthermore, PKC and inhibitor, oxalate exposure did not increase Rac1 protein translocation, suggesting that PKC resides upstream from Rac1 in the pathway that regulates NADPH oxidase. In conclusion, our data demonstrate for the first time that Rac1-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase might be a crucial mechanism responsible for oxalate-induced oxidative renal cell injury. These findings suggest that Rac1 signaling plays a key role in oxalate-induced renal injury, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target to prevent calcium oxalate crystal deposition in stone formers and reduce recurrence.

Method High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area diffraction, fast Fourier transformation of HRTEM, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were performed to analyze the components of these nanocrystallites. Results The main components of CaOx stones are calcium oxalate monohydrate and a small amount of dehydrate, while those of urinary nanocrystallites are calcium oxalate monohydrate, uric acid, and calcium phosphate. The mechanism of formation of CaOx stones was discussed based on the components of urinary nanocrystallites. Conclusion The formation of CaOx stones is closely related both to the properties of urinary nanocrystallites and to the urinary components. The combination of HRTEM, fast Fourier transformation, selected area electron diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy could be accurately performed to analyze the components of single urinary nanocrystallites. This result provides evidence for nanouric acid and/or nanocalcium phosphate crystallites as the central nidus to induce CaOx stone formation.

M. 2000-01-01 BACKGROUND: The amount of oxalate ingested may be an important risk factor in the development of idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. Reliable food tables listing the oxalate content of foods are currently not available. The aim of this research was to develop an accurate and reliable method to measure the food content of oxalate. METHODS: Capillary electrophoresis (CE) and ion chromatography (IC) were compared as direct techniques for the estimation of the oxalate content of foods. Foods were thoroughly homogenized in acid, heat extracted, and clarified by centrifugation and filtration before dilution in water for analysis. Five individuals consuming self-selected diets maintained food records for three days to determine their mean daily oxalate intakes. RESULTS: Both techniques were capable of adequately measuring the oxalate in foods with a significant oxalate content. With foods of very low oxalate content (<1.8 mg/100 g), IC was more reliable than CE. The mean daily intake of oxalate by the five individuals tested was 152 +/- 83 mg, ranging from 44 to 352 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS: CE appears to be the method of choice over IC for estimating the oxalate content of foods with a medium (>10 mg/100 g) to high oxalate content due to a faster analysis time and lower running costs, whereas IC may be better suited for the analysis of foods with a low oxalate content. Accurate estimates of the oxalate content of foods should permit the role of dietary oxalate in urinary oxalate excretion and stone formation to be clarified. Other factors, apart from the amount of oxalate ingested, appear to exert a major influence over the amount of oxalate excreted in the urine. [Oxalobacter formigenes Colonization and Oxalate Dynamics in a Mouse Model](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4495196) Li, Xingsheng; Ellis, Melissa L. 2015-01-01 Animal and human studies have provided compelling evidence that colonization of the intestine with Oxalobacter formigenes reduces urinary oxalate excretion and lowers the risk of forming calcium oxalate kidney stones. The mechanism providing protection appears to be related to the unique ability of O. formigenes to rely on oxalate as a major source of carbon and energy for growth. However, much is not known about the factors that influence colonization and host-bacterium interactions. We have colonized mice with O. formigenes OxCC13 and systematically investigated the impacts of diets with different levels of calcium and oxalate on O. formigenes intestinal densities and urinary and intestinal oxalate levels. Measurement of intestinal oxalate levels in mice colonized or not colonized with O. formigenes demonstrated the highly efficient degradation of soluble oxalate by O. formigenes relative to other microbiota. The ratio of calcium to oxalate in diets was important in determining colonization densities and conditions where urinary oxalate and fecal oxalate excretion were modified, and the results were consistent with those from studies we have performed with colonized and noncolonized humans. The use of low-oxalate purified diets showed that 80% of animals retained O. formigenes colonization after a 1-week dietary oxalate deprivation. Animals not colonized with O. formigenes excreted two times more oxalate in feces than they had ingested. This nondietary source of oxalate may play an important role in the survival of O. formigenes during periods of dietary oxalate deprivation. These studies suggest that the mouse will be a useful model to further characterize interactions between O. formigenes and the host and factors that impact colonization.

Deposition of crystals in brain and meninges is exceptionally rare in primary oxalosis. Images 2011-01-01 Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) is thought to protect against calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) stone formation by inhibiting COM aggregation. Several studies reported that stone formers produce THP with reduced levels of glycosylation, particularly sialic acid levels, which leads to reduced negative charge. In this study, normal THP was treated with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid residues, confirmed by an isoelectric point shift to higher pH. COM aggregation assays revealed that desialylated THP (ds-THP) promoted COM aggregation, while normal THP inhibited aggregation. The appearance of protein aggregates in solutions at ds-THP concentrations 1 \u00b5g/mL in 150 mM NaCl correlated with COM aggregation promotion, implying that ds-THP aggregation induced COM aggregation. The aggregation-promoting effect of the ds-THP was independent of pH above its isoelectric point, but was substantially reduced at low ionic strength, where protein aggregation was much reduced. COM aggregation promotion was maximized at a ds-THP to COM mass ratio of ~0.025, which can be explained by a model wherein partial COM surface coverage by ds-THP aggregates promotes crystal aggregation by bridging opposing COM surfaces, whereas higher surface coverage leads to repulsion between adsorbed ds-THP aggregates. Thus, desialylation of THP apparently abrogates a normal defensive action of THP by inducing protein aggregation, and subsequently COM aggregation, a condition that favors kidney stone formation. PMID:21229239 [Oxalate, and progression Purpose of review Oxalate is an end product of metabolism excreted via the kidney. Excess urinary oxalate, whether from primary or enteric hyperoxaluria, can lead to oxalate deposition in the kidney. Oxalate crystals are associated with renal inflammation, fibrosis and progressive renal failure. It has long been known that as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) becomes reduced in chronic kidney disease (CKD), there is striking elevation of plasma oxalate. Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that elevation of plasma oxalate in CKD may promote renal inflammation and more rapid progression of CKD independent of primary etiology. Recent findings The inflammasome has recently been identified to play a critical role in oxalate-induced renal inflammation. Oxalate crystals have been shown to activate the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat inflammasome 3 (also known as NALP3, NLRP3 or cryopyrin), resulting in release of Interleukin-1 and macrophage infiltration. Deletion of inflammasome proteins in mice protects from oxalate-induced renal inflammation and progressive renal failure. Summary The findings reviewed in this article expand our understanding of the relevance of elevated plasma oxalate levels leading to inflammasome activation. We propose that inhibiting oxalate-induced inflammasome activation, or lowering plasma oxalate, may prevent or mitigate progressive renal damage in CKD, and warrants clinical trials. PMID:27191349 [Hyperoside protects human kidney2 cells against oxidative damage acid.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29750296) Chen, Ye, Lihong; Li, Wangjian; Li, Dongzhang; Li, Feng 2018-05-02 The majority of renal calculi (kidney stones) are calcium stones. Oxidative damage to renal tubular epithelial cells induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the predominant cause of calcium oxalate stone formation. Hyperoside (Hyp) is a flavonol glycoside extracted from medicinal plants and appears to exhibit potent antioxidant activity in various cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of Hyp on renal cells exposed to oxidative stress simulated by oxalic acid (OA), and to determine whether the underlying mechanism involves the nuclear factor E2related factor2 (Nrf2)antioxidative response element signaling pathway. The study determined the indicators of high oxidative stress, including ROS and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in human kidney2 cells and the results demonstrated that the levels of ROS, as evaluated by flow cytometry, and H2O2 were significantly increased following treatment with OA (5 mmol/l) for 24 h (OA group), compared with those in the untreated control group. The increased activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in these cells explained this observation, as it is a major source of ROS. The results demonstrated that, in the OA group, the adhesion of calcium oxalate crystals and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly increased, and MTT assay demonstrated that cell viability was inhibited, compared with the control, which indicated that severe injury of cells was induced by OA. However, when the cells were pretreated with Hyp prior to treatment with OA (drug group), the levels of ROS and H2O2, and the activities of NADPH oxidase and LD were increased, and the adhesion of calcium oxalate crystals to cells was reduced, compared with the OA group. Western blot analysis and reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the protein and mRNA expression levels of Gout, Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition, and Basic Calcium Phosphate reviews the main radiographic features of crystal deposition diseases. Gout is linked to monosodium urate crystals. Classic radiographic features include subcutaneous tophi, paraarticular and exuberant bone hyperostosis. Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) can involve numerous hyaline cartilages, fibrocartilages, or tendons. CPPD arthropathy involves joints usually spared by osteoarthritis. Basic calcium phosphate deposits are periarticular or intraarticular. Periarticular calcifications are amorphous, dense, and round or oval with well-limited borders, and most are asymptomatic. When resorbing, they become cloudy and less dense with an ill-defined shape and can migrate into adjacent structures. Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. [Renal papillary calcification the development of calcium The objective of this study is to determine in a case series (four patients) how calcified deposits in renal papillae are associated with the development of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) papillary calculi. From the recently collected we evaluated patients, subjected to COM papillary lithiasis. The COM papillary calculi were found to result from subepithelial injury. Many of these lesions underwent calcification by hydroxyapatite (HAP), with calculus morphology and the amount of HAP in the concave zone dependent on the location of the calcified injury. Most of these HAP deposits grew, eroding the epithelium covering the renal papillae, coming into contact with urine and starting the development of COM calculi. Subepithelial HAP plaques may alter the epithelium covering the papillae, resulting in the deposit of COM crystals directly onto the epithelium. Tissue calcification depends on a pre-existing injury, the continuation of this process is due to modulators and/or crystallization inhibitors deficiency. Since calculus morphology and the amount of detected HAP are dependent on the location and widespread of calcified injury, all types of papillary COM calculi can be found in the same patient. All patients had subepithelial calcifications, with fewer papillary calculi, demonstrating that some subepithelial calcifications did not further evolve and were reabsorbed. A high number of subepithelial calcifications increases the likelihood that some will be transformed into COM papillary calculi. [The effect of hydrodynamic and thermodynamic factors and the addition of citric acid on the precipitation of reports on the investigation of experimental conditions relevant for spontaneous precipitation of significant amount of pure calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD). For this purpose, the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic parameters, such as mode of agitation, temperature, supersaturation and concentration of additives (citrate ions), have been studied. The results show that in the model systems, without the citrate addition and applied mechanical stirring, calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) was observed as dominant modification after 20 min of aging, while the magnetic stirring resulted in a formation of a mixture of COM and calcium oxalate trihydrate (COT), regardless of the temperature applied. In the mechanically stirred systems, the addition of citrate ions in the range of concentrations, 0.001 mol dm -3 < c i (Na 3 C 6 H 5 O 7 ) < 0.012 mol dm -3 , caused the formation of COM and COD mixture at all temperatures. At the same conditions and in the magnetically stirred systems formation of COD, in a mixture with COT or COM, has been observed. The highest COD content in the mechanically stirred system was obtained at 45 \u00b0C and c i (Na 3 C 6 H 5 O 7 ) = 0.001 mol dm -3 (w = 89.5%), while in the magnetically stirred system almost pure COD was obtained at 37 \u00b0C and c i (Na 3 C 6 H 5 O 7 ) = 0.008 mol dm -3 (w = 96.5%). [Study of lithium extraction from brine water, Bledug Kuwu, Indonesia by the precipitation series of oxalic acid and carbonate sodium](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AIPC.1964b0007S) Lithium is one of the key elements in the development of batteries for electric car applications. Currently, the resources of the world's lithium are derived from brine water and lithium mineral based on spodumene rock. Indonesia which is located in the area of the ring of fire, has potential brine water resources in some area, such as brine water from Bledug Kuwu, Central Java that used in this research. The purposes of this research are to characterize brine water, Bledug Kuwu and to investigate the influence of chemical solvents on Li, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al, B ion precipitation from brine water. This research was done with 2 times the process of chemical precipitation that runs series as follows: 5 liters of brine water were chemically precipitated using 400 ml of 12.43 N oxalic acid and followed by chemical precipitation using 400 mL of 7.07 N sodium carbonate solutions. Evaporation and filtration processes were also done twice in an effort to separate white precipitate and filtrate. The filtrate was analyzed by ICP-OES and white precipitates (salts) were analyzed by SEM, XRD, and XRF. The result shows that oxalate precipitation process extracted 32.24% Al, 23.42% B, 22.43% Ca, 14.26% Fe, 3.21 % K, 9.86% Na and 14.26% Li, the following process by carbonate precipitation process extracted 98.86% Mg, 73% Ca, 22.53% Li, 82.04% Al, 14.38% B, 12.50% K, 2.27% Na. There is 63.21% lithium is not extracted from the series process. The SEM analysis shows that the structure of granules on the precipitated salts by oxalic acid form gentle cubic-shaped solid. In the other hand, oxalate precipitation followed by sodium carbonate has various particle sizes and the shape of crystals is fragments, prism and cube look like magnesium carbonate, calcium chloride, and calcite's crystal respectively. This is in accordance with XRD analysis phases of whewellite [Effects of diet on urine urolithiasis.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15131098) Lulich, cats with calcium oxalate (CaOx) urolithiasis were evaluated to determine the effect of diet on urine CaOx saturation. Two dietary treatments were evaluated in each cat: the diet consumed just prior to urolith detection and a canned diet formulated to prevent CaOx uroliths. This study revealed that hypercalciuria is a consistent abnormality in cats with CaOx urolith formation. When urolith-forming cats consumed a diet formulated to prevent urolith formation, activity product ratios for CaOx (which estimate the degree to which urine is saturated with CaOx) were significantly lower. These results suggest that consumption of an appropriately formulated urolith-prevention diet will reduce recurrence of CaOx urolithiasis. [Crystal growth, structural, optical, thermal and dielectric properties of lithium hydrogen oxalate monohydrate lithium hydrogen oxalate monohydrate have been investigated by FTIR and FT- Raman analyses. It has low absorbance in the UV-Vis-NIR region. The laser damage threshold study confirms that the material withstands upto 30 mJ with time of 7 s, after that circular dot damage is seen on the surface. The dark region of the surface damage spot occurs due to the thermal effects. The material is thermally stable upto 93 \u00b0C and there is no weight loss below this temperature. The dielectric studies were carried out at the frequency regions of 1 kHz-1 MHz and different temperatures from 40 \u00b0C to 80 \u00b0C. Semi-organic non-linear optical (NLO) single crystal lithium hydrogen oxalate monohydrate has been grown by slow evaporation solution growth technique. The Hirshfeld surface analysis was performed to understand the different intermolecular interactions in the title compound. The fingerprint plots contain the highest portion of HO/OH (48.3%) interactions. [Improving nutritional quality and fungal tolerance in soya bean and grass pea by (Lathyrus sativus) seeds are important sources of dietary proteins; however, they also contain antinutritional metabolite oxalic acid (OA). Excess dietary intake of OA leads to nephrolithiasis due to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in kidneys. Besides, OA is also a known precursor of -N-oxalyl-L-,-diaminopropionic acid (-ODAP), a neurotoxin found in grass pea. Here, we report the reduction in OA level in soya bean (up to 73%) and grass pea (up to 75%) seeds by constitutive seed-specific velutipes. In addition, -ODAP level of grass pea seeds was also reduced up to 73%. Reduced OA content was interrelated with the associated increase in seeds micronutrients such as calcium, iron and zinc. Moreover, constitutive expression of FvOXDC led to improved tolerance to the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum that requires OA during host colonization. Importantly, FvOXDC-expressing soya bean and grass pea plants were similar to the wild type with respect to the morphology and photosynthetic rates, and seed protein pool remained unaltered as revealed by the comparative proteomic analysis. Taken together, these results demonstrated improved seed quality and tolerance to the fungal pathogen in two important legume crops, by the expression of an oxalate-degrading enzyme. \u00a9 2016 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. [Protective Effects of Pistacia lentiscus L. fruit extract prevalence of kidney stones is increasing and plants are frequently used to treat urolithiasis. Pistacia lentiscus L, a plant which freely grows around the Mediterranean basin areas, is widely used for various pathologies. P. lentiscus has an important impact as it has economical value on top of its pharmacological interest. Decoctions of its aerial parts and/or resin are used to treat kidney stones. To in vitro assess the potential nephroprotective effect of Pistacia lentiscus ethanolic fruit extract (PLEF) on proximal tubular cells in response to the adhesion of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals. Human Kidney [HK]-2 cells were incubated with and without COM in the presence or absence of PLEF. Cell viability was measured by the resazurin assay. The expression of E-cadherin was analyzed by PCR. The extracellular production of H 2 O 2 was measured by Amplex\u00ae Red H 2 O 2 Assay. The numbers of detached or non-adherent COM crystals in the presence of PLEF were microscopically captured and counted using ImageJ software. The interaction of PLEF with COM and the effect of PLEF on crystal size were analyzed by flow cytometry. The spectrophotometric measurement of turbidity was performed for assessing the COM concentration. PLEF incubated with COM was able to increase the cell viability. The decrease of E-cadherin expression after incubation with COM was counteracted by PLEF. Overproduction of H 2 O 2 induced by COM was also inhibited by PLEF. Observations using flow cytometry showed that interactions between PLEF and the COM crystals occurred. PLEF was also effective in reducing the particles size and in lowering COM concentration. Our data show that COM tubulotoxicity can be significantly reversed by PLEF -at least in part- via an inhibition of COM crystals adhesion onto the apical membrane. This early beneficial effect of PLEF needs to be further investigated as a useful strategy in nephrolithiasis prevention.

However, the nature of the basolateral membrane oxalate transport process that operates in series with SLC26A6 to mediate active oxalate secretion in the intestine remains unknown. Sulfate anion SLC26A1) mediates intestinal oxalate transport. mice have a phenotype of hyperoxalemia, hyperoxaluria, and calcium oxalate stones. We, therefore, tested the role of Sat1 in mouse duodenum, a tissue with Sat1 expression and SLC26A6-dependent oxalate secretion. Although the active secretory flux of oxalate across mouse duodenum was strongly inhibited (>90%) by addition of the disulfonic stilbene DIDS to the basolateral solution, secretion was unaffected by changes in medium concentrations of sulfate and bicarbonate, key substrates for Sat1-mediated anion exchange. Inhibition of production by acetazolamide and complete removal of bicarbonate from the buffer also produced no change in oxalate secretion. Finally, active oxalate secretion was not reduced in Sat1-null mice. We conclude that a DIDS-sensitive basolateral transporter is involved in mediating oxalate secretion across mouse duodenum, but Sat1 E; Aronson, Peter S 2017-01-01 Patients with cystic fibrosis have an increased incidence of hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. Net intestinal absorption of dietary oxalate results from passive paracellular oxalate absorption as modified by oxalate back secretion mediated by the SLC26A6 oxalate transporter. We used mice deficient in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (Cftr) to test SLC26A6-mediated oxalate secretion is defective in cystic fibrosis. We intestinal tissue from C57BL/6 (wild-type) and Cftr -/- mice in Ussing chambers and measured transcellular secretion of [ 14 C]oxalate. Intestinal tissue isolated from Cftr -/- mice exhibited significantly less transcellular oxalate secretion than intestinal tissue of wild-type mice. However, glucose absorption, another representative intestinal transport process, did not differ in Cftr -/- tissue. Compared with wild-type mice, Cftr -/- mice showed reduced expression of SLC26A6 in duodenum by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, coexpression of stimulated SLC26A6-mediated Cl - -oxalate exchange in Xenopus oocytes. In association the profound defect in intestinal oxalate secretion, Cftr -/- mice had serum and urine oxalate levels 2.5-fold greater than those of wild-type mice. We conclude that defective intestinal oxalate secretion mediated by SLC26A6 may contribute to the hyperoxaluria observed in this mouse model of cystic fibrosis. Future studies are needed to address whether similar mechanisms contribute to the increased risk for calcium oxalate stone formation observed in patients with cystic fibrosis.

[Oxalates in oca (New Zealand yam) (Oxalis tuberosa Mol.).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10606566) A B; Savage, L 1999-12-01 Oca (Oxalis tuberosa Mol.) or New Zealand yam, in common with other members of this genus, contains oxalate, an antinutritive factor. Twelve South American and two New Zealand cultivars of oca were analyzed for total and soluble oxalate contents of the tubers. The range of total oxalate levels was 92-221 mg/100 g of fresh weight. Levels of soluble and total oxalate extracted from the tubers were not significantly different, suggesting that no calcium oxalate is formed in the tubers. The oxalate concentrations obtained in this study for oca suggest that previously reported values are too low and that oca is a moderately high oxalate-containing food. This is the first report of a tuber crop containing moderate to high levels of soluble oxalates in the tubers and no insoluble oxalates. [Association Study of Klotho Gene Polymorphism With Calcium Oxalate Stones in The The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between Klotho gene polymorphisms andcalcium oxalate stones in Xinjiang Uyghur people. We compared 128 patients with calcium oxalate stones (case group) and 94 healthypeople (control group), detected the genotype and allele distributions of polymorphisms (SNPs)of the Klotho gene (rs3752472, rs650439, and rs1207568) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The distributions of the genotype and allele frequencies of the SNPs were consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the two groups. There were statistically significant differences between the genotype andallele distributions of rs3752472 between the case and control groups; the allele frequencies in the case/controlgroups were C = 240 (93.7%)/151 (80.3%) and T = 16 (6.3%)/37 (19.7%). There was no statistically significantdifference in the genotype distribution of rs650439 between the case and control groups, but there was a differencein the allele distribution; the allele frequencies in the case/control groups were = 202 (78.9%)/143 (57.2%) andT = 54 (21.1%)/107 (42.8%). There were no statistically significant differences in genotype and allele distributionsbetween the case and control groups of rs1207568; the allele frequencies in the case/control groups were C = 194(71.3%)/145 (77.1%) and T = 78 (28.7%)/43 (22.9%). In rs3752472, the risk for patients with the C and A allelesincreased by 3.675 and 2.799 times, respectively. The rs3752472 and rs650439 SNPs are related to the risk of calcium oxalate stones in Xinjiang Uyghurpeople, and might be one of the risk factors. [The oxalate-carbonate pathway: at the interface between biology calcite in otherwise carbonate-free acidic soils through the biological degradation of oxalate is a mechanism termed oxalate-carbonate pathway. This pathway lies at the interface between biological and geological systems and constitutes an important, although underestimated, soil mineral carbon sink. In this case, atmospheric CO2 is fixed by the photosynthetic activity of oxalogenic plants, which is partly destined to the production of oxalate used for the chelation of metals, and particularly, calcium. Fungi are also able to produce oxalate to cope with elevated concentrations of metals. In spite of its abundance as a substrate, oxalate is a very stable organic anion that can be metabolized only by a group of bacteria that use it as carbon and energy sources. These bacteria close the biological cycle by degrading calcium oxalate, releasing Ca2+ and inducing a change in local soil pH. If parameters are favourable, the geological part of the pathway begins, because this change in pH will indirectly lead to the precipitation of secondary calcium carbonate (calcite) in unexpected geological conditions. Due to the initial acidic soil conditions, and the absence of geological carbonate in the basement, it is unexpected to find C in the form of calcite. The activity of the oxalate-carbonate pathway has now been demonstrated in several places around the world, suggesting that its importance can be even greater than expected. In addition, new roles for each of the biological players of the pathway have been revealed recently forcing us to reconsider a global biogeochemical model for oxalate cycling. [Renal papillary calcification of renal calculi: a case series study](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3599710) 2013-01-01 Background The objective of this study is to determine in a case series (four patients) how calcified deposits in renal papillae are associated with the development of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) papillary calculi. Methods From the recently collected calculi, we evaluated retrospectively patients, subjected to retrograde COM papillary lithiasis. Results The COM papillary calculi were found to result from subepithelial injury. Many of these lesions underwent calcification by hydroxyapatite (HAP), with calculus morphology and the amount of HAP in the concave zone dependent on the location of the calcified injury. Most of these HAP deposits grew, eroding the epithelium covering the renal papillae, coming into contact with urine and starting the development of COM calculi. Subepithelial HAP plaques may alter the epithelium covering the papillae, resulting in the deposit of COM crystals directly onto the epithelium. Tissue calcification depends on a pre-existing injury, the continuation of this process is due to modulators and/or crystallization inhibitors deficiency. Conclusions Since calculus morphology and the amount of detected HAP are dependent on the location and widespread of calcified injury, all types of papillary COM calculi can be found in the same patient. All patients had subepithelial calcifications, with fewer papillary calculi, demonstrating that some subepithelial calcifications did not further evolve and were reabsorbed. A high number of subepithelial calcifications increases the likelihood that some will be transformed into COM papillary calculi.

[Crucibleless crystal growth and Radioluminescence study of calcium tungstate single crystal fiber](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014OptMa..37...51S) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) J. P.; Silva, R. S. 2014-11-01 In this article, single phase and high optical quality scheelite calcium tungstate single crystal fibers were grown by using the crucibleless laser heated pedestal growth technique. The as-synthesized calcium tungstate powders used for shaping seed and feed rods were investigated by X-ray diffraction technique. As-grown crystals were studied by Raman spectroscopy and Radioluminescence measurements. The results indicate that in both two cases, calcined powder and single crystal fiber, only the expected scheelite CaWO4 phase was observed. It was verified large homogeneity in the crystal composition, without the presence of secondary phases. The Radioluminescence spectra of the as-grown single crystal fibers are in agreement with that present in Literature for bulk single crystals, presented a single emission band centered at 420 nm when irradiated with -rays. [The B; Savage, G P 2001-08-01 It is believed that soluble oxalate has higher bioavailability than insoluble oxalate. Oca (Oxalis tuberosa) is moderately high in oxalate and contains oxalate in soluble form only. We estimated the bioavailability of oxalate in oca based on the urinary excretion of oxalate after oxalate loading with oca to estimate the bioavailability of oxalate in oca. We also clarified whether bioavailability differs in various oxalate loads from the same food source and studied the effect of an additional calcium source on the bioavailability of oxalate from oca. Four men and 4 women ingested 50, 100 and 150 gm. oca as well as 100 gm. oca with 100 gm. sour cream. Oxalate was measured in a 6-hour urine sample from each volunteer. The mean bioavailability of oxalate from oca plus or minus standard deviation was 1.44% +/- 1.31% during the 6-hour period after intake. There was no significant difference in oxalate bioavailability among oxalate intake levels in this study, although oca consumption with sour cream significantly decreased the uptake of oxalate (p <0.01). The variation in bioavailability among individuals was high in our study. The bioavailability of oxalate in oca appears to be similar to that in spinach. However, bioavailability varies among individuals and depends on other constituents of a combined meal. [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Narayana crystallization in gels has found wide applications in the fields of biomineralization and macromolecular crystallization in addition to crystallizing materials having nonlinear optical, ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, and other properties. Furthermore, by using this method it is possible to grow single crystals with very high perfection that are difficult to grow by other techniques. The gel method of crystallization provides an ideal technique to study crystal deposition diseases, which could lead to better understanding of their etiology. This chapter focuses on crystallization in gels of compounds that are responsible for crystal deposition diseases. The introduction is followed by a description of the various gels used, the mechanism of gelling, and the fascinating phenomenon of Liesegang ring formation, along with various gel growth techniques. The importance and scope of study on crystal deposition diseases and the need for crystal growth experiments using gel media are stressed. The various crystal deposition diseases, viz. (1) urolithiasis, (2) gout or arthritis, (3) cholelithiasis and atherosclerosis, and (4) pancreatitis and details regarding the constituents of the crystal deposits responsible for the pathological mineralization are discussed. Brief accounts of the theories of the formation of urinary stones and gallstones and the role of trace elements in urinary stone formation are also given. The crystallization in gels of (1) the urinary stone constituents, viz. calcium oxalate, calcium phosphates, uric acid, cystine, etc., (2) the constituents of the gallstones, viz. cholesterol, calcium carbonate, etc., (3) the major constituent of the pancreatic calculi, viz., calcium carbonate, and (4) cholic acid, a steroidal hormone are presented. The effect of various organic and inorganic ions, trace elements, and extracts from cereals, herbs, and fruits on the crystallization of major urinary stone and gallstone salt, Me2NH2 +\u00b7HC2O4 \u00b70.5H2C2O4, were isolated as a side product from the reaction involving Me2NH, H2C2O4 and Sn(n-Bu)3Cl in a 1:2 ratio in methanol or by the reaction of the (Me2NH2)2C2O4 salt and Sn(CH3)3Cl in a 2:1 ratio in ethanol. The asymmetric unit comprises a dimethylammonium cation (Me2NH2 +), an molecule of oxalic acid (H2C2O4) situated about an inversion center. From a supramolecular point of view, the three components interact together via hydrogen bonding. The Me2NH2 + cations and the HC2O4 anions are in close proximity through bifurcated N\u2014H(O,O) hydrogen bonds, while the HC2O4 anions are organized into infinite chains via O\u2014HO hydrogen bonds, propagating along the a-axis direction. In addition, the oxalic acid (H2C2O4) molecules play the role of connectors between these chains. Both the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of each diacid are involved in four intermolecular interactions with two Me2NH2 + and two HC2O4 ions of four distinct polymeric chains, via two N\u2014HO and two O\u2014HO hydrogen bonds, respectively. The resulting molecular assembly can be viewed as a two-dimensional bilayer-like arrangement lying parallel to (010), and reinforced by a C\u2014HO hydrogen bond. PMID:25995858 [The high prevalence of Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) and basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals are important in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) but are under recognized even in end stage disease. We determined the prevalence of these calcium crystals in synovial fluid (SF) of persons undergoing total knee arthroplasty for degenerative arthritis. SF samples were obtained from 53 knee joints undergoing total arthroplasty for a pre-operative diagnosis of OA. SF were analyzed via compensated light microscopy for CPPD crystals and a semiquantitative radiometric assay for BCP crystals. Fifty pre-operative radiographs were analyzed and graded according to the scale of Kellgren and Lawrence. Patients had an average age of 70 years at the time of surgery. CPPD and/or BCP crystals were identified in 60% of SF. Overall radiographic scores correlated with mean concentrations of BCP crystals. Higher mean radiographic scores correlated with the presence of calcium-containing crystals of either type in SF Radiographic chondrocalcinosis was identified in only 31% of those with SF CPPD. Pathologic calcium crystals were present in a majority of SF at the time of total knee arthroplasty. Intraoperative SF analysis could conveniently identify pathologic calcium crystals providing information that may be relevant to the future care of the patient's replaced joint and that of other joints. This information could also potentially aid in predicting the likelihood of the need for contralateral total knee arthroplasty. [Determination of Oxalate Content in Herbal Remedies and Dietary especially diet, is a prominent risk factor that affects the formation of calcium oxalate stones. Urinary oxalate excretion is directly related to the amount of oral intake and intestinal absorption rate of oxalate. This work evaluated the possibility of increasing oxalate ingestion, which could lead to secondary hyperoxaluria, associated with the intake of herbal remedies and dietary supplements containing plant extracts. A wide variety of 17 commercially available drugs and dietary supplements were analyzed using ion chromatography. The results showed remarkable differences in oxalate contents of the extracts. Total oxalate concentrations ranged from 0.03 to 2.2 mg/g in solid samples and from 0.005 to 0.073 mg/mL in liquid samples. The selected herbal remedies and dietary supplements containing plant extracts represent only a low risk for calcium oxalate stone formers, if the recommended daily dose is not exceeded. [Long-term, low-dose, intravenous vitamin C leads patients on regular dialysis treatment (RDT) is advised to obviate deficiency and improve epoetin response in those with functional iron deficiency. However, clear-cut safety concerns regarding hyperoxalemia are still poorly understood. This study tries to establish safety/efficacy profiles of ascorbate and oxalate during long-term intravenous ascorbate supplementation. A prospective study was performed in 30 patients on RDT showing ascorbate deficiency (plasma ascorbate < 2.6 mg/L [<15 micromol/L]): 18 patients were administered intravenous ascorbate during 18 months (250 mg/wk, subsequently increased to 500 mg), and 12 patients were taken as reference untreated cases. Plasma ascorbate and oxalate assays and dialytic balance chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively) at baseline, during treatment, and 12 months after withdrawal. Plasma ascorbate levels increased dose dependently with supplementation (1.6 +/- +/- 10.1 micromol/L]) with 2.8 [37.5 +/- 16.0 micromol/L] with 500 mg/wk of ascorbate), but only normalized with greater dosages for several months in 94% of patients. Baseline plasma oxalate levels increased from 3.2 +/- 0.8 mg/L (35.8 4.5 +/- 0.9 mg/L (50.3 +/- 10.4 micromol/L) with 250 and 500 mg, respectively ( P < 0.001). The calcium oxalate saturation threshold was exceeded by 7 of 18 patients (40%) during 6 months therapy with 500 mg/wk. Ascorbate dialysis removal increased from 37.8 +/- 23.2 mg (215 +/- 132 micromol) to micromol) supplementation (P < 0.001), with corresponding increases in P < 0.01).

A cocrystal of theophylline and oxalic acid was used as a model system, and poly(acrylic acid), poly(caprolactone), and poly(ethylene glycol) were the additives. The cocrystal formation was selectively hindered with addition of poly(acrylic acid). First the size of the cocrystals were reduced, and eventually the cocrystallization was inhibited to generate neat theophylline crystals. The theophylline crystals were of a distinctively different crystal structure from known polymorphs, based on powder X-ray diffraction. They were also obtained in nanoscale size, when millimeter-scale crystals formed without poly(acrylic acid). Polymeric additives that could form specific interactions with crystallizing compounds seem to be useful tools for the phase and size control of pharmaceutical crystals. [Serum Estradiol and Testosterone Levels in Kidney Stones Disease with and without Calcium Oxalate Components in Naturally Postmenopausal Women](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3781087) Ou, Lili; Duan, Xiaolu; Zeng, Guohua 2013-01-01 Objective Epidemiological data reveal that the overall risk for kidney stones disease is lower for women compared to age-matched men. However, the beneficial effect for the female sex is lost upon menopause, a time corresponding to the onset of fall in estrogen levels. The aim of this study was to describe the serum estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) characteristics of naturally postmenopausal women with kidney stones. Methods 113 naturally postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed kidney stones (aged 57.4\u00b14.98 years) and 84 age frequency matched stone-free controls (56.9\u00b14.56 years) were validly recruited in the case-control study. The odds ratios (ORs) for the associations between sex hormones and kidney stones were estimated with logistic regression models, adjusting for demographic data and medical history. Patients were also stratified analyzed according to stone components (calcium oxalate stones [COS]; non-calcium oxalate stones [NCOS]). Results Serum E2 (21.1 vs. 31.1 pg/ml) was significantly lower in kidney stones patients compared to controls. Post-hoc analysis demonstrated that this effect was driven by COS patients (p<0.001). According to tertiles of the E2 levels, a significant higher frequency of COS was seen in the lowest E2 group (p <0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified E2 level as a strong factor that was independently associated with the risk for COS (per 1 SD increase, OR=0.951, 95% confidence interval = 0.069-0.665). However, serum T levels did not significantly differ among the groups. Conclusions Naturally postmenopausal women with higher remaining estradiol levels appear less likely to suffer from kidney calcium oxalate stones. However, no correlation was found between serum T level and kidney stones. These findings support the hypothesis that higher postmenopausal endogenous estrogens may protect against kidney stones with ageing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifteen healthy non-stone-forming adults participated in this study. Subjects first abstained from using vitamins, medications, or foods enriched in omega-3 fatty acids for 30 days. Next, they collected two 24-hour urine specimens while consuming a self-selected diet. Subjects consumed an extremely low-oxalate and normal-calcium diet for 5 days and collected 24-hour urine specimens on the last 3 days of this diet. Next, the subjects took 2 fish oil capsules containing 650-mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 450-mg docosahexaenoic acid twice daily for 30 days. They consumed a self-selected diet on days 1-25 and the controlled diet on days 26-30. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected on days 28-30. Excretion levels of urinary analytes including oxalate and glycolate were analyzed. RESULTS Although there was a significant reduction in urinary oxalate, magnesium, and potassium excretions and an increase in uric acid excretion during the controlled dietary phases compared with the self-selected diet, there were no significant differences in their excretion during controlled diet phases with and without fish oil supplementation. CONCLUSION These results suggest that fish oil supplementation does not reduce endogenous oxalate synthesis or urinary oxalate excretion in normal adults during periods of extremely low oxalate intake. However, these results do not challenge the previously described reduction in urinary oxalate excretion demonstrated in normal subjects consuming a moderate amount of oxalate in conjunction with fish oil. PMID:25102784 [Influence of calcium ions on the crystallization of (sodium hydrogenocarbonate), the presence of calcium ions in solutions is unavoidable due to the production process. The understanding of the Ca 2+ role in NaHCO 3 crystallization would be helpful for improving the quality of the final products. The influence of calcium ions on NaHCO 3 crystallization was investigated in a 5-l mixed suspension mixed product removal crystallizer under controlled conditions. A density meter was used for continuous supersaturation monitoring. After a steady state had been reached, different CaCl 2 amounts were added at a constant flow rate. It was found that limited calcium ion levels in the system reduce drastically the nucleation frequency of NaHCO 3 and has a limited influence on crystal growth rate. The supersaturation measurements and other methods confirmed this phenomenon. The relationship between the Ca 2+ influence on NaHCO 3 crystallization, the calcium carbonate solubility and its metastable zone in concentrated NaHCO 3 solution was established. In fact, Ca 2+ has a maximum effect on NaHCO 3 crystallization kinetics when the saturation of calcium carbonate in NaHCO 3 solution has been reached, and the effect is constant in the metastable zone. The excess of Ca 2+ precipitates in NaHCO 3 solution as CaCO 3, as observed by energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction. This explained why an increasing Ca 2+ concentration in the solution has a limited influence on NaHCO 3 crystal size distribution and habit, but decreases the crystal purity. It is also confirmed that an impurity as Ca 2+ has no influence on the equilibrium NaHCO 3-Na 2CO 3. [Oxalate metal complexes hygroscopicity Takahashi, Y. 2011-05-01 Atmospheric aerosols have both a direct and an indirect cooling effect that influences the radiative balance at the Earth's surface. It has been estimated that the degree of cooling is large enough to weaken the warming effect of carbon dioxide. Among the cooling factors, secondary organic aerosols (SOA) play an important role in the solar radiation balance in the troposphere as SOA can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and extend the lifespan of clouds because of their high hygroscopic and water soluble nature. Oxalic acid is an important component of SOA, and is produced via several formation pathways in the atmosphere. However, it is not certain whether oxalic acid exists as free oxalic acid or as metal oxalate complexes in aerosols, although there is a marked difference in their solubility in water and their hygroscopicity. We employed X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy to characterize the calcium (Ca) and zinc (Zn) in aerosols collected at Tsukuba in Japan. Size-fractionated aerosol samples were collected for this purpose using an impactor aerosol sampler. It was shown that 10-60% and 20-100% of the total Ca and Zn in the finer particles (<2.1 m) were present as Ca and Zn oxalate complexes, respectively. Oxalic acid is hygroscopic and can thus increase the CCN activity of aerosol particles, while complexes with various polyvalent metal ions such as Ca and Zn are not hygroscopic, which cannot contribute to the increase of the CCN activity of aerosols. Based on the concentrations of noncomplexed and metal-complexed oxalate species, we found that most of the oxalic acid is present as metal oxalate complexes in the aerosols, suggesting that oxalic acid does not always increase the hygroscopicity of aerosols in the atmosphere. Similar results are expected for other dicarboxylic acids, such as malonic and succinic acids. Thus, it is advisable that the cooling effect of organic aerosols should be estimated by including the information on metal [Cholinergic signaling inhibits oxalate transport by human intestinal T84 cells](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3328906) Cheng, Ming; Aronson, Peter S. 2012-01-01 Urolithiasis remains a very common disease in Western countries. Seventy to eighty percent of kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate, and minor changes in urinary oxalate affect stone risk. Intestinal oxalate secretion mediated by anion exchanger SLC26A6 plays a major constitutive role in limiting net absorption of ingested oxalate, thereby preventing hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Using the relatively selective PKC- inhibitor rottlerin, we had previously found that PKC- activation inhibits Slc26a6 activity in mouse duodenal tissue. To identify a model system to study physiologic agonists upstream of PKC-, we characterized the human intestinal cell line T84. Knockdown studies demonstrated that endogenous SLC26A6 mediates most of transport by T84 cells. Cholinergic stimulation with carbachol modulates intestinal ion transport through signaling pathways including PKC activation. We therefore examined whether carbachol affects oxalate transport in T84 cells. We found that carbachol significantly inhibited oxalate transport by T84 cells, an effect blocked by rottlerin. Carbachol also led to significant translocation of PKC- from the cytosol to the membrane of T84 cells. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we observed that carbachol inhibits oxalate transport through the M3 muscarinic receptor C. Utilizing the Src inhibitor PP2 and phosphorylation studies, we found that the observed regulation downstream of PKC- is partially mediated by c-Src. Biotinylation studies revealed that carbachol inhibits oxalate transport by reducing SLC26A6 surface expression. We conclude that carbachol negatively regulates oxalate transport by reducing SLC26A6 surface expression in T84 cells through signaling pathways including and soil the calcium oxalate to low-magnesium calcite and represents a potential long-term terrestrial sink for atmospheric CO(2). In this pathway, bacterial oxalate degradation is associated with a strong local alkalinization and subsequent carbonate precipitation. In order to test whether this process occurs in soil, the role of bacteria, fungi and calcium oxalate amendments was studied using microcosms. In a model system with sterile soil amended with laboratory cultures of oxalotrophic bacteria and fungi, the addition of calcium oxalate induced a distinct pH shift and led to the final precipitation of calcite. However, the simultaneous presence of bacteria and fungi was essential to drive this pH shift. Growth of both oxalotrophic bacteria and fungi was confirmed by qPCR on the frc (oxalotrophic bacteria) and 16S rRNA genes, and the quantification of ergosterol (active fungal biomass) respectively. The experiment was replicated in microcosms with non-sterilized soil. In this case, the bacterial and fungal contribution to oxalate degradation was evaluated by treatments with specific biocides (cycloheximide and bronopol). Results showed that the autochthonous microflora oxidized calcium oxalate and induced a significant soil alkalinization. Moreover, data confirmed the results from the model soil showing that bacteria are essentially responsible for the pH shift, but require the presence of fungi for their oxalotrophic activity. The combined results highlight that the interaction between bacteria and fungi is essential to drive metabolic processes in complex environments such as soil. \u00a9 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. [Effect of Potassium Citrate on Calcium Phosphate Stones in a Model of 2015-01-01 Potassium citrate is prescribed to decrease stone recurrence in patients with calcium nephrolithiasis. Citrate binds intestinal and urine calcium and increases urine pH. Citrate, metabolized to bicarbonate, should decrease calcium excretion by reducing bone resorption and increasing renal calcium reabsorption. However, citrate binding to intestinal calcium may increase absorption and renal excretion of both phosphate and oxalate. Thus, the effect of potassium citrate on urine calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate supersaturation and stone formation is complex and difficult to predict. To study the effects of potassium citrate on urine supersaturation and stone formation, we utilized 95th-generation inbred genetic hypercalciuric stone-forming rats. Rats were fed a fixed amount of a normal calcium (1.2%) diet supplemented with potassium citrate or potassium chloride (each 4 mmol/d) for 18 weeks. Urine was collected at 6, 12, and 18 weeks. At 18 weeks, stone formation was visualized by radiography. Urine citrate, phosphate, oxalate, and pH levels were higher and urine calcium level was lower in rats fed potassium citrate. Furthermore, calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate supersaturation were higher with potassium citrate; however, uric acid supersaturation was lower. Both groups had similar numbers of exclusively calcium phosphate stones. Thus, potassium citrate effectively raises urine citrate levels and lowers urine calcium levels; however, the increases in urine pH, oxalate, and phosphate levels lead to increased calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate supersaturation. Potassium citrate induces complex changes in urine chemistries and resultant supersaturation, which may not be beneficial in preventing calcium phosphate stone formation.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that TNFRs also have a direct role in tubular crystal deposition and progression of hyperoxaluria-related CKD. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed upregulated tubular expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in human and murine kidneys with calcium oxalate (CaOx) nephrocalcinosis-related CKD compared with controls. Western blot and mRNA expression analyses in mice yielded consistent data. When fed an oxalate-rich diet, wild-type mice developed progressive CKD, whereas Tnfr1-, Tnfr2- , and Tnfr1/2- deficient mice of hyperoxaluria, Tnfr1-, Tnfr2- , and Tnfr1/2 -deficient mice also lacked intrarenal CaOx deposition and tubular damage observed in wild-type mice. Inhibition of TNFR signaling prevented the induced expression of the crystal adhesion molecules, CD44 and annexin II, in tubular epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo , and treatment with the small molecule TNFR inhibitor R-7050 partially protected hyperoxaluric mice from nephrocalcinosis and CKD. We conclude that TNFR signaling is essential for CaOx crystal adhesion to the luminal membrane of renal tubules as a fundamental initiating mechanism of oxalate nephropathy. Furthermore, therapeutic blockade of TNFR might delay progressive forms of nephrocalcinosis in oxalate nephropathy, such as primary hyperoxaluria.

Crystals of calcium phosphate from saturated solution of hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca 10(PO 4) 6(OH) 2) were deposited on the surfaces of ferroelectric ceramics lead zirconate titanium (Pb(Ti,Zr)O 3, PZT). The results of the experiment demonstrated the acceleration effects of polarized PZT on the crystal growth of calcium phosphate. Furthermore, it is indicated that polarization also influenced the orientation of the deposited crystals due to the growth of a layer of (0 0 2) oriented octacalcium phosphate (OCP, Ca 8H 2(PO 4) 6\u00b75H 2O) on the negatively charged surfaces of PZT.

It is desirable to reduce the oxalic acid content because oxalic acid acts as an anti-nutritive calcium-binding component. More than 30 years ago, an enzyme (an oxidase) that breaks down oxalic acid into CO2 and H2O2 was discovered and found to be naturally present in spinach leaves. However, nitrate, which can also be present because of the use of common nitratebased fertilizers, inactivates the enzyme. In the CEA technique, one cuts off the supply of nitrate and keeps the spinach plants cool while providing sufficient oxygen. This technique provides the precise environment that enables the enzyme to naturally break down oxalate. The result of application of this technique is that the oxalate content is reduced by 2/3 in one week. [Hydroxyproline Metabolism and Oxalate Synthesis in Primary Hyperoxaluria.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29588429) John; Todd; Holmes, Ross P 2018-06-01 Background Endogenous oxalate synthesis contributes to calcium oxalate stone disease and is markedly increased in the inherited primary hyperoxaluria (PH) disorders. The incomplete knowledge regarding oxalate synthesis complicates discovery of new treatments. Hydroxyproline (Hyp) metabolism results in the formation of oxalate and glycolate. However, the relative contribution of Hyp metabolism to endogenous oxalate and glycolate synthesis is not known. Methods To define this contribution, we performed primed, continuous, intravenous infusions of the stable isotope [ 15 N, 13 C 5 ]-Hyp in nine healthy subjects and 19 individuals with PH and quantified the levels of urinary 13 C 2 -oxalate and 13 C 2 -glycolate formed using ion chromatography coupled to mass detection. Results The total urinary oxalate-to-creatinine ratio during the infusion was 73.1, 70.8, 47.0, and 10.6 mg oxalate/g creatinine in subjects with PH1, PH2, and PH3 and controls, respectively. Hyp metabolism accounted for 12.8, 32.9, and 14.8 mg oxalate/g creatinine in subjects with PH1, PH2, and PH3, respectively, compared with 1.6 mg oxalate/g creatinine in controls. The contribution of Hyp to urinary was 15% in controls in subjects with PH1, PH2, The contribution of Hyp to urinary glycolate was 57% in controls, 30% in subjects with PH1, and <13% in subjects with PH2 or PH3. Conclusions Hyp metabolism differs among PH types and is a major source of oxalate synthesis in individuals with PH2 and PH3. In patients with PH1, who have the highest urinary excretion of oxalate, the major sources of oxalate remain to be identified. Copyright \u00a9 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology. [Total flavonoids styracifolium (D. styracifolium), which is considered as a Chinese herbal medicine, has been reported to treat the kidney stone diseases. However, the potential phytochemically active components and the underlying mechanisms associated with its efficacy in targeting urolithiasis remain to be elucidated. This study aims to investigate the anti-urolithiatic effect of total flavonoids of D. styracifolium (TFDS) on calcium oxalate (CaOx) renal stones in Sprague-Dawley rats. Animal models of CaOx urolithiasis were established in male Sprague-Dawley rats by adding 5% w/w hydroxy-L-proline (HLP) in regular rat chow. The TFDS orally at 100, 400 mg/kg, respectively, were administered along with HLP for 28 days. At the end of 28 days of treatment, urine and serum samples were collected for crystalluria determination and various biochemical analysis. Kidney tissues were isolated and processed for antioxidant parameters measurement and histopathological examinations. HLP-induced hyperoxaluria alone reliably caused CaOx nephrolithiasis in rats. We showed that TFDS significantly reduced crystalluria and CaOx crystal deposits in the kidney sections as compared to untreated HLP group. Also, TFDS was observed to decrease urinary oxalate excretion, alleviate the pro-acidosis condition, improve the impaired renal functions and renal epithelial cell injury. Moreover, TFDS protected against the oxidative stress changes via reducing MDA content, increasing CAT and GSH-Px activities in renal homogenate, as well as attenuating the expression of MCP-1, OPN and TGF- proteins. These results indicated that TFDS had beneficial effect on inhibition of CaOx formation in the rat kidney probably through a combination of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, urine alkalinizing activities, and lowering the concentration of urinary stone-forming constituents. Thus, TFDS might have clinical implications in preventing oxidative renal cell injury and, ultimately, kidney stone formation. The [Urine risk factors in children with calcium kidney stones and their siblings](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3353022) Bergsland, Kristin J.; John R. 2012-01-01 Calcium nephrolithiasis in children is increasing in prevalence and tends to be recurrent. Although children have a lower incidence of nephrolithiasis than adults, its etiology in children is less well understood; hence treatments targeted for adults may not be optimal in children. To better understand metabolic abnormalities in stone forming children, we compared chemical measurements and the crystallization properties of 24-hour urine collections from 129 stone formers matched to 105 non-stone forming siblings and 183 normal, healthy children with no family history of stones; all aged 6 to 17 years. The principal risk factor for calcium stone formation was hypercalciuria. Stone formers have strikingly higher calcium excretion along with high supersaturation for calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, and a reduced distance between the upper limit of metastability and supersaturation for calcium phosphate, indicating increased risk of calcium phosphate crystallization. Other differences in urine chemistry that exist between adult stone formers and normal individuals such as hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, abnormal urine pH and low urine volume were not found in these children. Hence, hypercalciuria and a reduction in the gap between calcium phosphate upper limit of metastability and supersaturation are crucial determinants of stone risk. This highlights the importance of managing hypercalciuria in children with calcium stones.

[In vitro and in vivo study of effect of Abdelkhalek; Touhami, Mohamed; Mbarki, Mohamed 2005-12-01 The diversity of experimental results obtained in the study of the effect of citrus juice on urinary lithogenicity moved us to study the effect of these substances in vitro and in-vivo. The in-vitro study is based on the turbidimetric method on calcium oxalate crystallization. In vivo, we studied the effect of lemon juice consumption on urinary chemistry and we tested it on calcium oxalate crystallization in natural urine. The formation of crystals is induced by the addition of the oxalate and calcium solution. Optical density (OD) is measured in a closed system at physiological conditions. The effects of the various juices of lemon, was evaluated by the addition of 50 ml of juice. A male volunteer with no history of kidney stone participated in this study, by lemon juice ingestion. The pH, concentration of oxalate, calcium and citrate were determined before and after ingestion and urine was freshly analyzed by microscopy. In synthetic urine, the inhibition rate of calcium oxalate crystallization increases gradually with the lemon juice concentration. In natural urine, we noted that the kinetics of crystallization of calcium oxalate, before and after ingestion of lemon juice, are comparable. In vivo, after ingestion, a small increase in mean urinary pH (from 6.7 +/- 0.1 to 6.9 +/- 0.1) was noted. Indeed, oxalate calcium means and citrate excretion increased during this period with 33.41%, 6.85% and 3.53% respectively. This increase in the oxalate excretion is probably explained by the conversion of the exogenous ascorbic acid contained in the lemon juice. These results show that the lemon juice presents an important inhibitory effect in vitro. The ingestion of the lemon juice seems to dissipate a effect of great quantity of citrates which in turn increases the excretion of oxalates. The presence of these two elements simultaneously: citrate and oxalate compensate for their opposite effect. [Crystal structure and spectroscopic behavior of synthetic novgorodovaite Ca2(C2O4)Cl2\u00b72H2O and Synthetic novgorodovaite analog Ca2(C2O4)Cl2\u00b72H2O is identical to its natural counterpart. It crystallizes in the monoclinic I2/ m space group with a = 6.9352(3), b = 7.3800(4), c = 7.4426(3) \u00c5, = 94.303(4)\u00b0, V = 379.85(3) and 2. The heptahydrate analog, Ca2(C2O4)Cl2\u00b77H2O, crystallizes as triclinic twins in the P \\\\overline{1} space group with a = 7.3928(8), b = 8.9925(4), c = 10.484(2) \u00c5, 70.95(1), = 88.545(7)\u00b0, V = 655.3(1) \u00c53 and Z = 2. The crystal packing of both calcium oxalate-chloride double salts favors the directional bonding of oxalate, C2O4 2-, ligands to calcium ions as do other related calcium oxalate minerals. The -bonding between C and O atoms of the C2O4 2- oxalate group leaves sp 2-hydridised orbitals of the oxygen atoms available for bonding to Ca. Thus, the Ca-O bonds in both calcium oxalate-chloride double salts are directed so as to lie in the plane of the oxalate group. This behavior is reinforced by the short O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O distances between the oxygens attached to a given carbon atom, which favors them bonding to a shared Ca atom in bidentate fashion. Strong bonding in the plane of the oxalate anion and wide spacing perpendicular to that plane due to repulsion between oxalate -electron clouds gives rise to a polymerized structural units which are common to both hydrates, explaining the nearly equal cell constants 7.4 \u00c5 which are defined by the periodicity of Ca-oxalate chains in the framework (monoclinic b triclinic a). When compared with novgorodovaite, the higher water content of Ca2(C2O4)Cl2\u00b77H2O leads to some major differences in their structures and ensuing physical properties. While novgorodovaite has a three-dimensional framework structure, in the higher hydrate, the highly polar water molecules displace chloride ions from the calcium coordination sphere and surround them through OwH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonds. As a result, polymerization in Ca2(C2O4)Cl2\u00b77H2O solid is limited to the formation [Bioleaching of incineration fly ash by Aspergillus niger - precipitation of metallic salt crystals and morphological alteration of the fungus.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28626642) Xu, Tong-Jiang; Ramanathan, Thulasya; Ting, Yen-Peng 2014-09-01 This study examines the bioleaching of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash by Aspergillus niger , and its effect on the fungal morphology, the fate of the ash particles, and the precipitation of metallic salt crystals during bioleaching. The fungal morphology was significantly affected during one-step and two-step bioleaching; scanning electron microscopy revealed that bioleaching caused distortion of the fungal hyphae (with up to 10 m hyphae diameter) and a swollen pellet structure. In the absence of the fly ash, the fungi showed a linear structure (with 2-4 m hyphae diameter). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction confirmed the precipitation of calcium oxalate hydrate crystals at the surface of hyphae in both one-step and two-step bioleaching. Calcium oxalate precipitation affects bioleaching via the weakening of the fly ash, thus facilitating the release of other tightly bound metals in the matrix. [Correlation between oxalic acid production and copper tolerance in Wolfiporia cocos](https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/5687) C. A. Clausen; Frederick Green; B. M. Woodward; J. W. Evans; R. C. DeGroot 2000-01-01 The increased interest in copper-based wood preservatives has hastened the need for understanding why some fungi are able to attack copper-treated wood. Due in part to accumulation of oxalic acid by brown-rot fungi and visualization of copper oxalate crystals in wood decayed by known copper-tolerant decay fungi, oxalic acid has been implicated in copper tolerance by... [High variability of the heterogeneous ice nucleation potential of oxalic acid dihydrate and sodium of airborne oxalic acid dihydrate and sodium oxalate particles in the deposition and condensation mode has been investigated by controlled expansion cooling cycles in the AIDA aerosol and cloud chamber of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology at temperatures between 244 and 228 K. Previous laboratory studies have highlighted the particular role of oxalic acid dihydrate as the only species amongst a variety of other investigated dicarboxylic acids to be capable of acting as a heterogeneous ice nucleus in both the deposition and immersion mode. We could confirm a high deposition mode ice activity for 0.03 to 0.8 m sized oxalic acid dihydrate particles that were either formed by nucleation from a gaseous oxalic acid/air mixture or by rapid crystallisation of highly supersaturated aqueous oxalic acid solution droplets. The critical saturation ratio with respect to ice required for deposition nucleation was found to be less than 1.1 and the size-dependent ice-active fraction of the aerosol population was in the range from 0.1 to 22%. In contrast, oxalic acid dihydrate particles that had crystallised from less supersaturated solution droplets and had been allowed to slowly grow in a supersaturated environment from still unfrozen oxalic acid solution droplets over a time period of several hours were found to be much poorer heterogeneous ice nuclei. We speculate that under these conditions a crystal surface structure with less-active sites for the initiation of ice nucleation was generated. Such particles partially proved to be almost ice-inactive in both the deposition and condensation mode. At times, the heterogeneous ice nucleation ability of oxalic acid dihydrate significantly changed when the particles had been processed in preceding cloud droplet activation steps. Such behaviour was also observed for the second investigated species, namely sodium oxalate. Our experiments address the atmospheric scenario that coating layers [High variability of the heterogeneous ice nucleation potential of oxalic acid dihydrate and sodium of airborne oxalic acid dihydrate and sodium oxalate particles in the deposition and condensation mode has been investigated by controlled expansion cooling cycles in the AIDA aerosol and cloud chamber of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology at temperatures between 244 and 228 K.

In biological systems, epitaxial relationships between crystal structures may be important in nucleating the deposit of a solid phase. The biologically preferred calcium phosphate species, apatite, and cholesterol crystal have structurally compatible crystallographic faces which allow epitaxial growth of one crystal upon another. The present study describes a new approach to explore, in vitro, the crystallization processes of calcium phosphate (CaP) with cholesterol (CS) and cholestanol (CN) which are related to atherosclerosis. Aqueous solutions containing calcium and phosphate ions or CaP crystals as hydroxyapatite were added into saturated ethanolic solutions of CS or CS and 10% CN. After precipitation, crystals were collected and analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infra-red (IR), X-ray, scanning electron microscope (SEM-LINK), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and atomic absorption. The principal result is the well-formed crystals precipitation when an aqueous solution and CaP seed crystals were added to saturated solutions of CS and 10% CN. Cholesterol-cholestanol dihydrate (CC2W) crystals precipitated in the presence of CaP seeds were compared to the CC2W crystals obtained without the mineral compound. The results of this comparison indicate a special link between crystals of CaP and CC2W, and support the epitaxial relationship between the two kinds of crystals. The potential of CC2W crystals to be precipitated by CaP seed crystals prove likewise the possible significant role of the cholestanol metabolite in the process of cholesterol crystallization and calcification in the arteries. [An Investigational RNAi Therapeutic Targeting Glycolate Oxidase Reduces Oxalate Primary 1 (PH1), an inherited rare disease of glyoxylate metabolism, arises from mutations in the enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase. The resulting deficiency in this enzyme leads to abnormally high oxalate production resulting in calcium oxalate crystal formation and deposition in the kidney and many other tissues, with systemic oxalosis and ESRD being a common outcome. Although a small subset of patients manages the disease with vitamin B6 treatments, the only effective treatment for most is a combined liver-kidney transplant, which requires life-long immune suppression and carries significant mortality risk. In this report, we discuss the development of ALN-GO1, an investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic targeting glycolate oxidase, to deplete the substrate for oxalate synthesis. Subcutaneous administration of ALN-GO1 resulted in potent, dose-dependent, and durable silencing of the mRNA encoding glycolate oxidase and increased serum glycolate concentrations in and nonhuman primates. ALN-GO1 also increased urinary glycolate concentrations in normal nonhuman primates and in a genetic mouse model of PH1. Notably, ALN-GO1 reduced urinary oxalate concentration up to 50% after a single dose in the genetic mouse model of PH1, and up to 98% after multiple doses in a rat model of hyperoxaluria. These data demonstrate the ability of ALN-GO1 to reduce oxalate production in preclinical models of PH1 across multiple species and provide a clear rationale for clinical trials with this compound.

Morphological studies of the LSO crystal deduced by BFDH law. In the UV-vis spectrum wide transparent region and large band gap were found. SHG is equal to KDP crystal and d{sub 33} was found to be equal to 6pC/N. Grown crystal belongs to softer category. - Abstract: New semiorganic crystal of lithium sulfate monohydrate oxalate (LSO) for nonlinear application was synthesized by controlled slow evaporation method. The growth rate of various planes of the grown crystal was estimated by morphological study. Singlemore \u00bb crystal XRD analysis confirmed that the crystal belongs to triclinic lattice with space group P1. High transparency (95%) with large band gap (4.57 eV) was analyzed by UV-vis studies. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were used to identify various functional groups present in the LSO crystal. SHG efficiency was found to be equal to the KDP crystal. Thermal stability (up to 117.54 \u00b0C) and melting point (242 \u00b0C) of the crystal were studied by TG-DTA. In dielectric measurements, the value of dielectric constant decreases with increase in frequency. Hardness studies confirmed soft nature of crystals. The piezoelectric coefficient was found to be 6pC/N along [0 0 1].\u00ab less [Metamagnetism and weak ferromagnetism (II) oxalate dihydrate were synthesized through a precipitation reaction of aqueous solutions of nickel chloride and oxalic acid. Magnetic susceptibility exhibits a sharp peak at 3.3 K and a broad rounded maximum near 43 K. We associated the lower maximum with a metamagnetic transition that occurs when the magnetic field is about 3.5 T. The maximum at 43 K is typical of 1D antiferromagnets, whereas weak ferromagnetism behavior was observed in the range of 3.3-43 K. [In Idiopathic Calcium Oxalate Stone Formers, Unattached Stones Show Evidence of Having Originated as Attached Stones on Randall's Plaque](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=2807918) Miller, Nicole L.; Williams, James C.; Evan, Andrew Sharon Shelly E.; Lingeman, James E. 2009-01-01 Objective To analyze the structure and composition of unattached stones in idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers (ICSF) and compare them to attached stones from the same cohort in order to investigate whether more than one pathogenic mechanism exists for stone formation in ICSF. Patients and methods ICSF undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy or ureteroscopy for treatment of nephrolithiasis were consented for this study. All accessible renal papillae were endoscopically imaged using a digital endoscope. All stones were removed and determined by the operating surgeon to be attached or unattached to the underlying papilla. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), which provides three-dimensional analysis of entire stones, was used to compare the structure and composition of attached versus unattached stones. Results Of 115 stones collected from 9 patients (12 renal units), only 25 stones were found not to be attached to renal papillae. Of these 25 stones, 4 were lost and 12 showed definite morphological evidence of having been attached to tissue, probably having been knocked off of papillae during access. For the remaining 9 stones, micro-CT analysis revealed at least one internal region of calcium phosphate within each of these unattached calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones. That is, the internal structure of the unattached stones is consistent with their having originated attached to RP, and then having become detached but retained in the kidney, with new layers of CaOx eventually covering the original attachment site. Conclusions Micro CT analysis supports the hypothesis that in ICSF, both attached and unattached stones occur as a result of a common pathogenic mechanism. That is, in this type of stone former, CaOx stones\u2014even those not showing morphology that betrays attachment\u2014all originate attached to interstitial plaque on the renal [The osteopontin-controlled switching of calcium oxalate monohydrate morphologies in artificial urine provides insights into papillary kidney (OPN) plays an important role in preventing the formation of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) kidney stones. To gain insight into these mechanisms, crystallization was induced by addition of human kidney OPN to artificial urine (ionic strength comparable to urine; without citrate), and the OPN-COM interaction studied using a combination of scanning electron (SEM) and confocal microscopy. By SEM, we found that increasing OPN concentrations formed large monoclinic penetration twins (no protein added) and, at higher concentrations (1-, 2g/ml OPN), super and hyper twins with crystal habits not found in previous studies. For instance, the hyper twins indicate well-facetted gearwheel-like habits with \"teeth\" developed in all the Alginate/Gelatin/Calcium Oxalate Matrix for of of pectic substances and are used in several processes, mainly in food and textile industries. In this study, a biomimetic matrix of alginate/gelatin/calcium oxalate (AGOCa) was synthesized for the in situ immobilization encapsulation of crude pectinase from Aspergillus niger ATCC 9642, obtaining an immobilization efficiency of about 61.7 %. To determine the performance of AGOCa matrix, this was compared to control matrices of alginate/calcium oxalate (AOxal) and alginate/water (ACa). By the evaluation of pH and temperature effects on the enzyme activity, it was observed an increase on pectinolytic activity for both three tested matrices with an increase on pH and temperature. The kinetic parameters for pectinase immobilized in the three matrices were determined using citric pectin as substrate. Values of K m of 0.003, 0.0013, and 0.0022 g mL(-1) and matrices obtained, respectively. After 33 days of storage, the pectinase immobilized in the three different matrices kept its initial activity, but that immobilized in AGOCa presented high stability to the storage with a relative activity of about 160 %. The enzyme immobilized in AGOCa, AOxal, and ACa could be used in 10, 8, and 7 cycles, respectively, keeping 40 % of its initial activity. [(Dimethylphosphoryl)methanaminium hydrogen oxalate-oxalic acid (2/1)](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3998424) Bialek, Sebastian; Clemens, The reaction of (dimethylphosphoryl)methanamine (dpma) with oxalic acid in ethanol yielded the title solvated salt, C3H11NOP+\u00b7C2HO4 \u00b70.5C2H2O4. Its asymmetric unit consists of hydrogen oxalate anion and a half-molecule of oxalic acid located around a twofold rotation axis. The H atom of the hydrogen oxalate anion is statistically disordered over two positions that are trans to each other. The hydrogen oxalate monoanion is not planar (bend angle 16\u00b0) whereas the oxalic acid molecule shows a significantly smaller bend angle (7\u00b0). In the crystal, the components are connected by strong O\u2014HO and much weaker N\u2014HO hydrogen bonds, leading to the formation of layers extending parallel to (001). The structure was refined from a racemically twinned crystal with twin components in an approximate 1:1 ratio.

As silver beet contains high oxalate concentrations and consumption of high levels can cause the development of kidney stones in some people, the reduction of oxalate during preparation and fermentation of kimchi was investigated. The silver beet stems and leaves were soaked in a 10% brine solution for 11 h and then washed in cold tap water. The total, soluble and insoluble oxalate contents of the silver beet leaves were reduced by soaking in brine, from 4275.81 \u00b1 165.48 mg/100 g weight (FW). Fermenting the kimchi for 5 days at 19.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b0C in 5 L ceramic jars with a water airtight seal resulted in a mean 38.50% reduction in total oxalate content and a mean 22.86% reduction in soluble oxalates. The total calcium content was essentially the same before and after the fermentation of the kimchi (mean 296.1 mg/100 g FW). The study showed that fermentation of kimchi significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the total oxalate concentration in the initial mix from 609.32 \u00b1 15.69 to 374.71 \u00b1 7.94 mg/100 g FW in the final mix which led to a 72.3% reduction in the amount of calcium bound to insoluble oxalate.

The composition and structure of these crystals were investigated, the crystallization environment was inspected, and the physical chemistry constants of the yolk fluid were determined through the incubation period. Polarized light microscopy was used to observe the generation and distribution of calcium carbonate crystals in the yolk sac. In addition, X-ray diffraction was employed to analyze the composition and crystal phase of the yolk sac. A decalcification and deproteination method was established to analyze the ultrastructure and composition of the crystals, as well as the internal relationship between inorganic and organic phases of the crystals. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to evaluate the characteristics of the crystals. Our results demonstrated that the calcium carbonate crystals were mainly composed of vaterite and calcite, with vaterite being the major component. Vaterite, a type of biomaterial generated by an organic template control, presented as a concentric hierarchical spherical structure. The organic nature of the biomaterial prevented vaterite from transforming into calcite, which is more thermodynamically stable than vaterite. Additionally, the configuration, size, and aggregation of vaterite were also mediated by the organic template. This bio-vaterite was found during the incubation period and is valuable in calcium transport during embryonic development. Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. [Exploring the Therapeutic Mechanism of Desmodium styracifolium on Oxalate Crystal-Induced Kidney Injuries Using Comprehensive Approaches Based on Proteomics and Network Pharmacology.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29950996) Hou, Jiebin; Chen, Wei; herb, Desmodium styracifolium (Osb.) Merr (DS) has been applied clinically to alleviate crystal-induced kidney injuries, but its effective components and their specific mechanisms still need further exploration. This research first combined the methods of network pharmacology and proteomics to explore the therapeutic protein targets of DS on oxalate crystal-induced kidney injuries to provide a reference for relevant clinical use. Methods: Oxalate-induced kidney injury mouse, rat, and HK-2 cell models were established. Proteins differentially expressed between the oxalate and control groups were respectively screened using iTRAQ combined with MALDI-TOF-MS. The common differential proteins of the three models were further analyzed by molecular docking with DS compounds to acquire differential targets. The inverse docking targets of DS were predicted through the platform of PharmMapper. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) relationship between the inverse docking targets and the differential proteins was established by STRING. Potential targets were further validated by western blot based on a mouse model with DS treatment. The effects of constituent compounds, including luteolin, apigenin, and genistein, were investigated based on an oxalate-stimulated HK-2 cell model. Results: Thirty-six common differentially expressed proteins were identified by proteomic analysis. According to previous research, the 3D structures of 15 major constituents of DS were acquired. Nineteen differential targets, including cathepsin D (CTSD), were found using molecular docking, and the component-differential target network was established. Inverse-docking targets including p38 MAPK and CDK-2 were found, and the network of component-reverse docking target was established. Through PPI analysis, 17 inverse-docking targets were linked to differential proteins. The combined network of component-inverse docking target-differential proteins was then constructed [Results of the TTF-TCNQ and the calcium carbonate crystallization on the Long Duration Exposure Facility](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19920017884&hterms=calcium+properties&qs=Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall%26Ntk%3DAll%26N%3D0%26No%3D10%26Ntt%3Dcalcium%2Bproperties) [NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp) Nielsen, Kjeld Flemming; Lind, M. David 1992-01-01 Experiment A0139A on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) carried four large containers into orbit five years with crystal growth solutions for lead sulfide, calcium carbonate, and TTF-TCNQ. Although temperature data was lost, the experimental program had been working since the valves in all containers had been opened. All four experiments produced crystals of varying quality. The calcium carbonate crystals had the best appearance. The TTF-TCNQ crystals were packed together near the valve openings of the container. When taken apart, the single crystals showed some unusual morphological properties. X ray investigations as well as conductivity measurements on long duration space grown TTF-TCNQ crystals will be presented. Comparisons will be made with our previous space solution growth experiments. The TTF-TCNQ crystals are no longer of the highest interest, so this activity has been terminated in favor of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate crystallizations. [Extracellular nucleotides inhibit oxalate transport by major health problem in Western countries. Seventy to 80% of kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate, and small changes in urinary oxalate affect risk of kidney stone formation. Intestinal oxalate secretion mediated by the anion exchanger SLC26A6 plays an essential role in preventing hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, indicating that understanding the mechanisms regulating intestinal oxalate transport is critical for management of hyperoxaluria. Purinergic signaling modulates several intestinal processes through pathways including PKC activation, which we previously found to inhibit Slc26a6 activity in mouse duodenal tissue. We therefore examined whether purinergic stimulation with ATP and UTP affects oxalate transport by human intestinal Caco-2-BBe (C2) cells. We measured [14C]oxalate uptake in the presence of an outward Cl gradient as an assay of Cl/oxalate exchange activity, 50% of which is mediated by SLC26A6. We found that ATP and UTP significantly inhibited oxalate transport by C2 cells, an effect blocked by the PKC inhibitor G\u00f6-6983. Utilizing pharmacological agonists and antagonists, as well as PKC- knockdown studies, we observed that ATP inhibits oxalate transport through the P2Y2 receptor, PLC, and PKC-. Biotinylation studies showed that ATP inhibits oxalate transport by lowering SLC26A6 surface expression. These findings are of potential relevance to pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease-associated hyperoxaluria, where supraphysiological levels of ATP/UTP are expected and overexpression of the P2Y2 receptor has been reported. We conclude that ATP and UTP inhibit oxalate transport by lowering SLC26A6 surface expression in C2 cells through signaling pathways including the P2Y2 purinergic receptor, PLC, and PKC-. PMID:23596171 [The Association of Household Food Insecurity defined as 'limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods', which associated with adverse health consequences in human. Another alarming condition, which is related to several comorbidities is kidney stone. This study aimed to determine the association of household food insecurity and developing kidney stones (calcium oxalate) in adults referred to medical centers of Babol. This case-control study included 200 participants 18-65 years of ages (100 cases, 100 controls). An 18-items food insecurity questionnaire (USDA), a valid and reliable 147-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and demographic characteristics were obtained via interviewing. Sixty eight percent of cases and 40% of controls were food insecure, respectively. Food insecurity was significantly associated with the risk of kidney stone (P < .05). Furthermore, body mass index (BMI) and family history of kidney stone were significantly associated with the risk of kidney stones (P < .05). Food insecurity and BMI were significantly associated with the kidney stone, which shows the importance of availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods in prevention of the kidney stone. [Immobilization of oxalate-degrading enzymes into p(HEMA) for inhibiting develop calcium-bearing deposits, called encrustation, that diminish their biocompatibility due to complications, such as chronic abrasion to the lumen of the ureter wall and subsequent infection. A reduction of encrustation, namely calcium oxalate, will improve the lifetime, health care costs, and infection resistance of such devices. The purpose of this research project is to study oxalate-degrading enzymes entrapped into a coating material that will control the interface to the urinary environment for ureteral stents. The coating material was a lightly crosslinked poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (p(HEMA)) matrix in which the active enzymes were entrapped within the bulk material's free volume. The swelling of p(HEMA) films was comparable in ddH2O and urine. This hydrophilic matrix allows oxalate anions to diffuse into the bulk so that enzyme activity against oxalate can lower its local concentration, and thereby reduce the supersaturation of calcium oxalate. herein. Michaelis Menten kinetic models were applied to free and immobilized enzyme activity. A substrate inhibition model was applied to OxO. The free form of OxO had a Vmax of 1.8 +/- 0.1 muM/min-mug, a km of 1.8 +/- 0.1 mM, and a ks of 35.4 +/- 3.7 mM while the immobilized form had a Vmax of 1.2 +/- 0.2 muM/min-mug, a km of 4.1 +/- 0.6 mM, and a ks of 660 +/- 140 mM. The free form of OxDc had a Vmax of 23.5 +/- 1.4 muM/min-mug and a km of 0.5 +/- 0.1 mM while the immobilized form had a Vmax of 5.0 +/- 1.9 muM/min-mug and km of 23.2 +/- 9.1 mM. The enzyme activity was measured to indicate viable application conditions for the coating, such as storing the films in urine over time. The maximum activity was shown at pH 4.2 to 4.5 and activity drops to be negligible by pH 7.0. Storing the enzyme at pH 6.1 exhibited a larger retained activity than storing at pH 4.2, yet storing in urine showed [Precipitation of calcium, magnesium, strontium and barium in Kuo, John 2012-01-01 Precipitation of calcium in plants is common. There are abundant studies on the uptake and content of magnesium, strontium and barium, which have similar chemical properties to calcium, in comparison with those of calcium in plants, but studies on co-precipitation of these elements with calcium in plants are rare. In this study, we compared morphologies, distributional patterns, and elemental compositions of crystals in tissues of four Acacia species grown in the field as well as in the glasshouse. A comparison was also made of field-grown plants and glasshouse-grown plants, and of phyllodes of different ages for each species. Crystals of various morphologies and distributional patterns were observed in the four Acacia species studied. Magnesium, strontium and barium were precipitated together with calcium, mainly in phyllodes of the four Acacia species, and sometimes in branchlets and primary roots. These elements were most likely precipitated in forms of oxalate and sulfate in various tissues, including epidermis, (fibre cells), pith, pith precipitation of calcium, magnesium, strontium and barium was biologically induced, and elements precipitated differed between soil types, plant species, and tissues within an individual plant; the precipitation was also related to tissue age. Formation of crystals containing these elements might play a role in regulating and detoxifying these elements in plants, and protecting the plants against herbivory.

PMID:22848528 [The effects of copper proximity on oxalate production in Fibroporia radiculosa](https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/46082) Katie M. Jenkins; Carol A. Clausen; Frederick Green III 2014-01-01 Copper remains a key component used in wood preservatives available today. However, the observed tolerance of several critical wood rotting organisms continues to be problematic. Tolerance to copper has been linked to the production and accumulation of oxalate, which precipitates copper into insoluble copper-oxalate crystals, thus inactivating structure of paramagnetic copper(II) oxalate (CuCO): formation in a precipitation reaction between a copper(II) solution and an aqueous solution of oxalic acid. The product was identified from its conventional X-ray powder patterns which match that of the copper mineral Moolooite reported to have the composition CuC2O4\u00b70.44H2O. Time resolved in situ investigations of the thermal decomposition of copper(II) oxalate using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction showed that in air the compound converts to Cu2O at 215 \u00b0C and oxidizes to CuO at 345 \u00b0C. Thermo gravimetric analysis performed in an inert Ar-gas reveals that the material contains no crystal water and reduces to pure Cu at 295 \u00b0C. Magnetic susceptibility measurements in the temperature range from 2 K to 300 K show intriguing paramagnetic behaviour with no sign of magnetic order down to 2 K. A crystal structure investigation is made based on powder diffraction data using one neutron diffraction pattern obtained at 5 K ( = 1.5949(1) \u00c5) combined with one conventional and two synchrotron X-ray diffraction patterns obtained at ambient temperature using = 1.54056, 1.0981 and = 0.50483(1) \u00c5, respectively. Based on the X-ray synchrotron data the resulting crystal structure is described in the monoclinic space group P2/c (#14) in the P12/n1 setting with unit cell parameters a = 5.9598(1) \u00c5, b = 5.6089(1) \u00c5, c = 5.1138 (1) \u00c5, = 115.320(1)\u00b0. The composition is CuC2O4 with atomic coordinates determined by FullProf refinement of the neutron diffraction data. The crystal structure consists of a random stacking of CuC2O4 micro-crystallites where half the Cu-atoms are placed at (2a) and the other half at (2b) positions with the corresponding oxalate molecules centred around the corresponding (2b) and (2a) site positions, respectively. The diffraction patterns obtained for both kinds of radiation show considerable broadening of several Bragg peaks caused by highly anisotropic microstructural size and strain [Potential Pharmacologic Treatments for Cystinuria and for Calcium Stones Associated with Hyperuricosuria](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1029395-potential-pharmacologic-treatments-cystinuria-calcium-stones-associated-hyperuricosuria) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search) Goldfarb, David S. Two new potential pharmacologic therapies for recurrent stone disease are described. The role of hyperuricosuria in promoting calcium stones is controversial with only some but not all epidemiologic studies demonstrating associations between increasing urinary uric acid excretion and calcium stone disease. The relationship is supported by the ability of uric acid to 'salt out' (or reduce the solubility of) calcium oxalate in vitro. A randomized, controlled trial of allopurinol in patients with hyperuricosuria and normocalciuria was also effective in preventing recurrent stones. Febuxostat, a nonpurine inhibitor of have advantagesmore \u00bb over allopurinol and is being tested in a similar protocol, with the eventual goal of determining whether urate-lowering therapy prevents recurrent calcium stones. Treatments for cystinuria have advanced little in the past 30 years. Atomic force microscopy has been used recently to demonstrate that effective inhibition of cystine crystal growth is accomplished at low concentrations of L-cystine methyl ester and L-cystine crystal growth. In vitro, L-cystine dimethyl ester had a significant inhibitory effect on crystal growth. The drug's safety and effectiveness will be tested in an Slc3a1 knockout mouse that serves as an animal model of cystinuria.\u00ab less [Inhibition of calcium oxalate monohydrate growth by citrate and the effect of the background electrolyte](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007JCrGr.306..135W) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Weaver, Matthew L.; Hoyer, James J. 2007-08-01 Pathological mineralization is a common phenomenon in broad range of plants and animals. In humans, kidney stone formation is a well-known example that afflicts approximately 10% of the population. Of the various calcium salt phases that comprise human kidney stones, the primary component is calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM). Citrate, a naturally occurring molecule in the urinary system and a common therapeutic agent for treating stone disease, is a known inhibitor of COM. Understanding the physical mechanisms of citrate inhibition requires quantification of the effects of both background electrolytes and citrate on COM step kinetics. Here we report the results of an in situ AFM study of these effects, in which we measure the effect of the electrolytes LiCl, NaCl, KCl, RbCl, and CsCl, and the dependence of step speed on citrate concentration for a range of COM supersaturations. We find that varying the background electrolyte results in significant differences in the measured step speeds and in step morphology, with KCl clearly producing the smallest impact and NaCl the largest. The kinetic coefficient for the former is nearly three times larger than for the latter, while the steps change from smooth to highly serrated when KCl is changed to NaCl. The results on the dependence of step speed on citrate concentration show that citrate produces a dead zone whose width increases with citrate concentration as well as a continual reduction in kinetic coefficient with increasing citrate level. We relate these results to a molecular-scale view of inhibition that invokes a combination of kink blocking and step pinning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the classic step-pinning model of Cabrera and Vermilyea (C-V model) does an excellent job of predicting the effect of citrate on COM step kinetics provided the model is reformulated to more realistically account for impurity adsorption, include an expression for the Gibbs-Thomson effect that is correct for all supersaturations [Capillarity of morphologically equivalent amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) particles within the pores of track etch membranes. The polyaspartic acid stabilized ACC is drawn into the membrane pores by capillary action, and the single-crystal nature of the nanowires is attributed to the limited contact of the intramembrane ACC particle with the bulk solution. The reaction environment then supports transformation to a single-crystal product. Copyright \u00a9 agent for treatment.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10625946) (myo-inositol hexaphosphate), a substance present in blood, urine, interstitial and intracellular fluids, to inhibit crystallization of calcium salts (oxalate and phosphate) is discussed. Its role in preventing calcium renal stone formation is specifically presented and discussed. \"In vitro\" and \"in vivo\" experiments, as well as clinical studies clearly demonstrated that phytate plays an important role as a crystallization inhibitor of calcium salts in biological fluids and becomes a clear alternative in the treatment of calcium oxalate renal lithiasis. [Vibrational analysis Joe, I.; Jayakumar, V. S. 2006-02-01 The compound of therapeutic interest, Bis ( N, N'-diphenyl guanidinium) oxalate, have been crystallized and is subjected to FT IR and Raman spectral studies, along with quantum chemical computations using density functional theory. In the crystal, diphenyl guanidinium ion is found to possess anti anti conformation although syn syn conformer is energetically favored based on the single point energy calculations at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, which shows the counter ion influence on conformation. The optimized geometry at the same level of theory indicates that guanidinium moiety of diphenyl guanidinium ion is planar, possibly induced by the sp 2 hybridized central carbon atom and the twisting of phenyl ring with respect to guanidinium moiety has been observed. The charge delocalization of the planar oxalate ion predicted by XRD is confirmed by the DFT values of bond lengths. The presence of N-HO intermolecular interactions can be observed in IR spectrum by the broadness of the band in the stretching region and its vibrational spectral consequences can be found as the shifting of band positions for amino group and CO group vibrations. The geometry, vibrational spectra, covalent bond orders and atomic charges of guanidinium ion, diphenyl guanidinium ion and of their corresponding neutral species have been used to investigate the effects of charge delocalization leading to Y-aromaticity. The FT IR and Raman spectra 6b, active in diphenyl guanidine molecule, are found to be dormant in their ionic species. [Renal calcinosis and stone formation in mice Tamm-Horsfall or both.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17898038) Mo, Xue-Ru 2007-12-01 Although often supersaturated with mineral salts such as calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate, normal urine possesses an innate ability to keep them from forming harmful crystals. This inhibitory activity has been attributed to the presence of urinary macromolecules, although controversies abound regarding their role, or lack thereof, in preventing renal mineralization. Here, we show that 10% of the mice lacking osteopontin (OPN) and 14.3% of the mice lacking Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) spontaneously form interstitial deposits of calcium phosphate within the renal papillae, events never seen in wild-type mice. Lack of both proteins causes renal crystallization in 39.3% of the double-null mice. Urinalysis revealed elevated concentrations of urine phosphorus and brushite (calcium phosphate) supersaturation in THP-null and OPN/THP-double null mice, suggesting that impaired phosphorus handling may be linked to interstitial papillary calcinosis in THP- but not in OPN-null mice. In contrast, experimentally induced hyperoxaluria provokes widespread intratubular calcium oxalate crystallization and stone formation in OPN/THP-double null mice, while completely sparing the wild-type controls. Whole urine from OPN-, THP-, or double-null mice all possessed a dramatically reduced ability to inhibit the adhesion of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals to renal epithelial cells. These data establish OPN and THP as powerful and functionally synergistic inhibitors of calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate crystallization in vivo and suggest that defects in either molecule may contribute to renal calcinosis and stone formation, an exceedingly common condition that afflicts up to 12% males and 5% females. [Preclinical Evaluation of Antiurolithiatic Activity the present research is to evaluate the antiurolithiatic effect of the various extracts prepared from the fruits of Viburnum opulus L., in regard to its ethnobotanical record. To induce urolithiasis, 70 mg/kg sodium oxalate was injected to the rats which were housed individually in metabolic cages. The test materials were applied during 7 days. Biochemical (urine and serum parameters), histopathological and antioxidant (TBARs, TSH and GSH) assays were conducted. The urine samples were examined by light microscope for the determination of the calcium oxalate crystals. Lyophilized juice of V. opulus (LJVO) and lyophilized commercial juice of V. opulus (LCJVO) exerted potential antiurolithiatic activity which was attributed to its diuretic effect along with the inhibitory action on the oxalate levels and free radical production. We also determined the chlorogenic acid content of the LJVO by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Chlorogenic acid was determined using Supelcosil LC-18 mm, 5 \u00b5m) column and acetonitrile: water: 0.2% o-phosphoric acid as a mobile phase. The chlorogenic acid content of V. opulus was found to be 0.3227 mg/mL in fruit juice. The results obtained in this study have provided a scientific evidence for the traditional usage of V. opulus on passing kidney stones in Turkish folk medicine.

Although partial dissociation of the micelles into 12 nm sized amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP)/protein nanoparticles occurred within a period of 14 days, crystallization of the ACP nanoclusters into bundles of hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanofilaments was not observed until after 12 weeks. The HAP nanofilaments were formed specifically within the partially disrupted protein micelles suggesting a micelle-mediated pathway of mesoscale crystallization. Similar experiments using ACP-containing synthetic micelles prepared from -casein protein alone indicated that co-aligned bundles of HAP nanofilaments were produced within the protein micelle interior after 24 hours at temperatures as low as 35 \u00b0C. The presence of Mg2+ ions in the casein micelles, as well as a possible synergistic effect associated with the multi-protein nature of the native aggregates, could account for the marked inhibition in mesoscale crystallization observed in constructs.Aqueous micelles of the multi-protein calcium phosphate complex, casein, were treated at 60 \u00b0C and pH 7 over several months.

As a first step in gaining a better understanding of the role of matrix in stone fragility, we measured extractible protein in calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) stones that were extensively characterized by micro-computed tomography (micro CT). Stones were scanned using micro CT (Scanco mCT20, 34 microm). They were ground, and the protein extracted using four methods: 0.25M EDTA, 2% SDS reducing buffer, 9M urea buffer, and 10% acetic acid. Protein was measured using NanoOrange. The SDS extracts were also examined using polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PAGE). Extracted protein was highest with the SDS or urea methods (0.28% +/- 0.13% and 0.24% +/- EDTA method (0.17% +/- 0.05%; P < 0.02). Acetic acid extracted little protein (0.006 +/- 0.002%; P < 0.001). Individual stones were significantly different in extractability of protein by the different methods, and SDS-PAGE revealed different protein patterns for individual stones. Extracted protein did not correlate with X-ray-lucent void percentage, which ranged from 0.06% to 2.8% of stone volume, or with apatite content. Extractible stone-matrix protein differs for individual COM stones, and yield is dependent on the extraction method. The presence of X-ray-lucent voids or minor amounts of apatite in stones did not correlate with protein content. The amounts of protein recovered were much lower than reported by Boyce, showing that these methods extracted only a fraction of the protein bound up in the stones. The results suggest that none of the methods tested will be useful for helping to answer the question of whether matrix content differs among stones of differing fragility to lithotripter shockwaves. [Assessment of in vitro oxalate degradation by Lactobacillus species cultured from veterinary probiotics.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26309108) Cho, Jenny G; Gebhart, Connie J; culture Lactobacillus spp from veterinary probiotics and measure their in vitro oxalate-degrading capacity. 2 commercial veterinary probiotics containing Lactobacillus spp. Lactobacillus spp were cultured anaerobically on selective deMan, Rogosa, Sharpe agar medium and subcultured for speciation by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Isolates were inoculated into broth containing sodium oxalate (5 mg/L) and incubated anaerobically for 72 hours. An oxalate-degrading isolate of Lactobacillus acidophilus (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] 53544) was the positive control sample; sterile broth containing a known quantity of sodium oxalate was the negative control sample. Oxalate concentrations were detected with ion chromatography. Oxalate degradation was assessed with Dunnett tests to detect differences in mean oxalate concentration for each isolate, compared with results for the negative control. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus zeae (too closely related to differentiate) were isolated from probiotic 1, and L plantarum was isolated from probiotic 2. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene confirmed 100% homology to type species. Lactobacillus acidophilus (ATCC 53544) and L acidophilus from probiotic 1 significantly decreased oxalate concentrations by 85.3 and 161.9 mg/L, respectively. Lactobacillus plantarum from probiotics 1 and 2 significantly increased oxalate concentrations by 56.1 and 36.1 mg/L, respectively. Lactobacillus casei did not alter oxalate concentrations. Lactobacillus acidophilus isolates significantly reduced oxalate concentrations. In vivo studies are needed to determine whether probiotics containing L acidophilus decrease urine oxalate concentrations and reduce risk of urolith recurrence in dogs with a history of calcium oxalate urolithiasis. [Urine oxalate biological factor for urolithiasis and patients with primary hyperoxaluria (PH) gradually build up calcium oxalate deposits leading to chronic kidney disease. Efforts to improve treatment for PH have focused on reducing urine oxalate excretion and thus decreasing lithogenesis. To determine the efficacy of treatments designed to alter a biochemical parameter it is necessary to know the biological and analytical variation of that parameter. In this study, we estimated the intra-individual biological variation of urine oxalate excretion in patients with PH, and from this determined what would constitute a significant change in the form of a reference change value (RCV). Each patient collected four 24-h urines on consecutive weeks. The intra-individual biological variation of oxalate excretion calculated from these samples ranged from 0 to 36 % with a mean of 14 %. The corresponding RCVs were 4-84 % with a mean of 32 %. This result implies that, on average, a reduction of almost one-third in urine oxalate excretion is required to prove an effect from treatment. The wide range of biological variation between individuals may reflect other, as yet unknown, determinants of oxaluria in PH, as well as inaccuracies in urine collection. The data suggest that it is more appropriate to use individual RCVs established prior to treatment to determine its efficacy: a relatively small fall in urine oxalate excretion may be outside the biological variation of some patients but not of others.

The oxalate content of 25 different samples of loose-packed black teas after brewing at 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min and of ten brands of tea bags after infusion for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min was measured by enzymatic assay. The oxalate concentration resulting from different brewing times ranged from 4.3 to 6.2 mg/240 ml for loose-packed black teas and from 2.7 to 4.8 mg/240 ml for tea bags. There was a stepwise increase in oxalate concentration associated with increased brewing times. [Feasibility of a tetracycline-binding method for detecting synovial fluid basic phosphate Basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals are common components of osteoarthritis (OA) synovial fluid. Progress in understanding the role of these bioactive particles in clinical OA has been hampered by difficulties in their identification. Tetracyclines stain calcium phosphate mineral in bone. The aim of this study was to investigate whether tetracycline staining might be an additional or alternative method for identifying BCP crystals in synovial fluid. A drop of oxytetracycline was mixed with a drop of fluid containing synthetic or native BCP, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD), or monosodium urate (MSU) crystals and placed on a microscope slide. Stained and unstained crystals were examined by light microscopy, with and without a portable broad-spectrum ultraviolet (UV) pen light. A small set of characterized synovial fluid samples were compared by staining with alizarin red S and oxytetracycline. Synthetic BCP crystals in synovial fluid were quantified fluorimetrically using oxytetracycline. After oxytetracycline staining, synthetic and native BCP crystals appeared as fluorescent amorphous aggregates under UV light. Oxytetracycline did not stain CPPD or MSU crystals or other particulates. Oxytetracycline staining had fewer false-positive test results than did alizarin red S staining and could provide estimates of the quantities of synthetic BCP crystals in synovial fluid. With further validation, oxytetracycline staining may prove to be a useful adjunct or alternative to currently available methods for identifying BCP crystals in synovial fluid. [Effect of silk sericin on morphology and structure of calcium carbonate crystal](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013FrMS....7..177Z) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Zhao, Shao; Li, Ze-Hao; Kong, Xiang-Dong 2013-06-01 In this paper, silk sericin was employed to regulate the mineralization of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). CaCO3 composite particles were prepared by the precipitation reaction of sodium carbonate with calcium chloride solution in the presence of silk sericin. The as-prepared samples were collected at different reaction time to study the crystallization process of CaCO3 by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that silk sericin significantly affected the morphology and crystallographic polymorph of CaCO3. With increasing the reaction time, the crystal phase of CaCO3 transferred from calcite dominated to vaterite dominated mixtures, while the morphology of CaCO3 changed from disk-like calcite crystal to spherical vaterite crystal. These studies showed the potential of silk sericin used as a template molecule to control the growth of inorganic crystal. [Hydrothermal growth of cross-linked hyperbranched copper A facile and has been developed for the synthesis of cross-linked hyperbranched copper dendrites using copper oxalate complex as a precursor and oxalic acid as a reducing and structure-directing agent. The synthesized particles are composed of highly branched nanostructures with unusual cross-linked hierarchical networks. The formation of copper dendrites can be explained in view of both diffusion control and aggregation-based growth model accompanied by the chelation-assisted assembly. Oxalic acid was found to play dual roles as reducing and structure-directing agent based on the investigation results. The understanding on the crystal growth and the roles of oxalic acid provides clear insight into the formation mechanism of hyperbranched metal dendrites. [Idiopathic hypercalciuria and formation of calcium renal stones](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5837277) Coe, Fredric L.; Worcester, Elaine M.; Evan, Andrew P. 2018-01-01 The most common presentation of nephrolithiasis is idiopathic calcium stones in patients without systemic disease. Most stones are primarily composed of calcium oxalate and form on a base of interstitial apatite deposits, known as Randall's plaque. By contrast some stones are composed largely of calcium phosphate, as either hydroxyapatite or brushite (calcium monohydrogen phosphate), and are usually accompanied by deposits of calcium phosphate in the Bellini ducts. These deposits result in local tissue damage and might serve as a site of mineral overgrowth. Stone formation is driven by supersaturation of urine with calcium oxalate and brushite. The level of supersaturation is related to fluid intake as well as to the levels of urinary citrate and calcium. Risk of stone formation is increased when urine citrate excretion is <400 mg per day, and treatment with potassium citrate has been used to prevent stones. Urine calcium levels >200 mg per day also increase stone risk and often result in negative calcium balance. Reduced renal calcium reabsorption has a role in idiopathic hypercalciuria. Low sodium diets and thiazide-type diuretics lower urine calcium levels and potentially reduce the risk of stone recurrence and bone diseas PMID:27452364 [Two sodium System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Wang, oxalate and corresponding lanthanide salts by hydrothermal synthesis. They were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectra, and photoluminescent spectra. The crystallographic data reveals that complexes 1 and 2 are isomorphous and isostructural, composed of three-dimensional framework built up of tricapped EuO9 octahedron NaO6 units, oxygen atoms 4,4'-oxybis(benzoate) and oxalate ligand are coordinated to lanthanide ions and sodium ions, resulting into two-dimensional inorganic sheets, which are further linked into three-dimensional network by organic ligands. Thermogravimetric analyses of 1-2 display a considerable thermal stability. Photoluminescent measurements indicated that europium complex 1 displayed strong red emission. [The polymorphic weddellite in inclusions in plant cells are genetically regulated, have an ecological function and are used as taxonomic characters. In Cactaceae, crystals in epidermal and cortical tissues have been reported; however, few studies have conducted chemical and morphological analyses on these crystals, and even fewer have reported non-mineral calcium to determine its systematic value. Cephalocereus apicicephalium, C. totolapensis and C. nizandensis are Cactaceae species endemic to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico with abundant epidermal prismatic crystals. In the present study, we characterize the mineral cell inclusions, including their chemical composition and their morphology, for three species of Cephalocereus. Crystals of healthy branches of the three species were isolated and studied. The crystals were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), their morphology was described using a petrographic and scanning electron microscope (SEM), and their elemental composition was measured with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDXAR). The three species synthesized weddellite with different degrees of hydration depending on the species. The optical properties of calcium oxalate crystals were different from the core, which was calcium carbonate. We observed a large diversity of predominantly spherical forms with SEM. EDXAR analysis detected different concentrations of Ca and significant amounts of elements, such as Si, Mg, Na, K, Cl, and Fe, which may be related to the edaphic environment of these cacti. The occurrence of weddellite is novel for the genus according to previous reports. The morphological diversity of the crystals may be related to their elemental composition and may be a source of phylogenetic characters. Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. [Efficient calcium lactate production by fermentation coupled with crystallization-based in situ product removal.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780270) Xu, Ke; Xu, Ping 2014-07-01 Lactic acid is a platform chemical with various industrial applications, and its derivative, calcium lactate, is an important food additive. Fermentation coupled with in situ product removal (ISPR) can provide more outputs with high productivity. The method used in this study was based on calcium lactate crystallization. Three cycles of crystallization were performed during the fermentation course using a Bacillus coagulans strain H-1. As compared to fed-batch fermentation, this method showed 1.7 times higher average productivity considering seed culture, with 74.4% more L-lactic acid produced in the fermentation with ISPR. Thus, fermentation coupled with crystallization-based ISPR may be a biotechnological alternative that provides an efficient system for production of calcium lactate or lactic acid.

[Net Intestinal Transport of Oxalate Reflects Passive Absorption and SLC26A6-mediated Knauf, Itallie, Christina M.; Anderson, James M. 2011-01-01 Mice the oxalate transporter SLC26A6 develop hyperoxalemia, hyperoxaluria, and calcium-oxalate stones as a result of a defect in intestinal oxalate secretion, but what accounts for the absorptive oxalate flux remains unknown. We measured transepithelial absorption of [14C]oxalate simultaneously with the flux of [3H]mannitol, a marker of the paracellular pathway, across intestine from wild-type and Slc26a6-null mice. We used the anion transport inhibitor DIDS to investigate other members of the SLC26 family that may mediate transcellular oxalate absorption. Absorptive flux of oxalate in duodenum was similar to mannitol, insensitive to DIDS, and nonsaturable, indicating that it is predominantly passive and paracellular. In contrast, in wild-type mice, secretory flux of oxalate in duodenum exceeded that of mannitol, was sensitive to and indicating transcellular oxalate. In secretory flux of oxalate was similar to mannitol, and no net flux of oxalate occurred. Absorptive fluxes of both oxalate and mannitol varied in parallel in different segments of small and large intestine. In epithelial cell lines, modulation of the charge selectivity of the claudin-based pore pathway did not affect oxalate but tight-junction protein ZO-1 enhanced permeability to oxalate and mannitol in parallel. Moreover, formation of soluble complexes with cations did not affect oxalate absorption. In conclusion, absorptive oxalate flux occurs through the paracellular \"leak\" pathway, and net absorption of dietary oxalate depends on the relative balance between absorption and SLC26A6-dependent transcellular secretion.

David 1991-01-01 Experiment AO139A on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) carried four large containers into orbit for five years with crystal growth solutions for lead sulfide, calcium carbonate, and tetra thiafulvalene- tetra cyanoquino methane (TTF-TCNQ). The LDEF was in excellent condition after the long orbital stay, and although the temperature data was lost, the experiment program had been working since the valves in all containers were opened. All four experiments produced crystals; however, they were of varying quality. The calcium carbonate crystals had the best appearance. The TTF-TCNQ crystals were packed together near the valve openings of the container. When taken apart, the single crystals showed some unusual morphological properties. X-ray investigations as well as conductivity measurements on the long duration space grown TTF-TCNQ crystals are presented, and pictures of the calcium carbonate are shown. Comparisons are made with previous space solution growth experiments on the European Spacelab Mission and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. [Crystallization of Calcium Carbonate in a Large Scale Field Study](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..19.2629U) Astrophysics Thomas 2017-04-01 The long term efficiency of geothermal facilities and aquifer thermal energy storage in the carbonaceous Malm aquifer in the Bavarian Molasse Basin is seriously affected by precipitations of carbonates. This is mainly caused by pressure and temperature changes leading to oversaturation during production. Crystallization starts with polymorphic nuclei of calcium carbonate and is often described as diffusion-reaction controlled. Here, calcite crystallization is favoured by high concentration gradients while aragonite crystallization is occurring at high reaction rates. The factors affecting the crystallization processes have been described for simplified, well controlled laboratory experiments, the knowledge about the behaviour in more complex natural systems is still limited. The crystallization process of the polymorphic forms of calcium carbonate were investigated during a heat storage test at our test site in the eastern part of the Bavarian Molasse Basin. Complementary laboratory experiments in an autoclave were run. Both, field and laboratory experiments were conducted with carbonaceous tap water. Within the laboratory experiments additionally ultra pure water was used. To avoid precipitations of the tap water, a calculated amount of {CO_2} was added prior to heating the water from 45 - 110\u00b0C (laboratory) resp. 65 - 110\u00b0C (field). A total water volume of 0.5 L (laboratory) resp. 1 L (field) was immediately sampled and filtrated through 10 - 0.1 [[Calcium kidney stones. stone disease is one of the main causes of hospitalization in Italy. Its prevalence increased in the last century and is probably still increasing. The pathogenesis of the disease is not known, although two main theories have been elaborated. The first hypothesizes that hydroxyapatite deposition in the interstitium of the renal papillae (Randall's plaque) precedes urinary calcium oxalate precipitation on the ulcered surface of the papilla to form a stone. The second presumes the tubular lumen of Bellini's duct to be the site where calcium-oxalate salts precipitate to form the nucleus for stone formation within the urinary tract. These pathogenetic processes may be favored by different dietary and genetic factors. The genes involved are not known, although many studies have been performed. Polymorphisms of genes coding for the vitamin D receptor, calcium-sensing receptor, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and urokinase were found to be associated with kidney stones, but these results have not been replicated. Different nutrients are suspected to predispose patients to calcium kidney stone disease. A high intake of animal proteins, sodium, vitamin C and oxalate has been implicated in stone formation, whereas calcium, alkalis and phytate may have a protective effect. The prevention of calcium stone formation is based on the recognition of risk factors like those already mentioned here. Furthermore, a family history of kidney stones may be useful in identifying subjects predisposed to become calcium stone formers. However, the expectations of the scientific community are turned to the advances in genetics and to the findings of genetic studies, which may provide diagnostic tools and criteria to define the risk profile of the single individual. [The inhibition of calcium carbonate crystal growth of calcite, the most stable calcium carbonate polymorph, in the presence of the cysteine-rich Mdm2 peptide (containing 48 amino acids in the ring finger configuration), has been investigated by the constant composition technique. Crystallization took place exclusively on well-characterized calcite crystals in solutions supersaturated only with respect to this calcium carbonate salt. The kinetic results indicated a surface diffusion spiral growth mechanism. The presence of the Mdm2 peptide inhibited the crystal growth of calcite by 22-58% in the concentration range tested, through adsorption onto the active growth sites of the calcite crystal surface. The kinetic results favored a Langmuir-type adsorption model, and the value of the calculated affinity constant was k(aff)=147x10(4) dm(3)mol(-1), a(ads)=0.29. [Mesoscale multi-protein calcium phosphate complex, casein, were treated at 60\u00b0C and pH 7 over several months. Although partial dissociation of the micelles into 12 nm sized amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP)/protein nanoparticles occurred within a period of 14 days, crystallization of the ACP nanoclusters into bundles of hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanofilaments was not observed until after 12 weeks. The HAP nanofilaments were formed specifically within the partially disrupted protein micelles suggesting a micelle-mediated pathway of mesoscale crystallization. Similar experiments using ACP-containing synthetic micelles prepared from \u00df-casein protein alone indicated that co-aligned bundles of HAP nanofilaments were produced within the protein micelle interior after 24 hours at temperatures as low as 35\u00b0C. The presence of Mg\u00b2(+) ions in the casein micelles, as well as a possible synergistic effect associated with the multi-protein nature of the native aggregates, could account for the marked inhibition in mesoscale crystallization observed in the casein micelles compared the single-component b-casein constructs. [NASA System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) John; Assimos, Dean G. 2007-04-01 Urinary oxalate is derived from the absorption of ingested oxalate and endogenous synthesis. The breakdown of vitamin C may also contribute small amounts to the urinary oxalate pool. The amount of oxalate absorbed is influenced by the oxalate content of the diet, the concentrations of divalent cations in the gut, the presence of oxalate-degrading organisms, transport characteristics of the intestinal epithelium, and other factors associated with the intestinal environment. Knowledge of pathways associated with endogenous oxalate synthesis is limited. Urinary oxalate excretion can be modified using strategies that limit dietary oxalate absorption and the ingestion of oxalogenic substrates such as hydroxyproline. [Role of scanning electron microscopy in identifying drugs M; Sylaja, N; Koshy, Peter 2009-10-01 Several plant preparations are administered for treatment of stone disease without scientific basis. This paper presents the results of in vitro and animal experimental studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in the identification of the therapeutic properties of trial drugs in medicine. In the first set of the study, urinary crystals namely calcium oxalate monohydrate and calcium oxalate dehydrate were grown in six sets of Hane's tubes in silica gel medium. Trial drugs namely scoparia dulcis Lynn, musa sapiens and dolicos biflorus were incorporated in the gel medium to identify the dopant effect of the trial drugs on the size and extent of crystal column growth. The changes in morphology of crystals were studied using SEM. In the second set, six male Wistar rats each were calculogenised by administering sodium oxalate and ethylene glycol and diabetised using streptozotocin. The SEM changes of calculogenisation were studied. The rats were administered trial drugs before calculogenisation or after. The kidneys of the rats studied under the scanning electron microscope showed changes in tissue morphology and crystal deposition produced by calculogenisation and alterations produced by addition of trial drugs. The trial drugs produced changes in the pattern of crystal growth and in the crystal morphology of both calcium oxalate monohydrate and calcium oxalate dihydrate grown in vitro. Elemental distribution analysis showed that the crystal purity was not altered by the trial drugs. Scoparia dulcis Lynn was found to be the most effective anticalculogenic agent. Musa sapiens and dolicos biflorus were found to have no significant effect in inhibiting crystal growth. The kidneys of rats on calculogenisation showed different grades of crystals in the glomerulus and interstitial tissues, extrusion of the crystals into the tubular lumen, collodisation and tissue inflammatory cell infiltration. Scoparia dulcis Lynn exhibited maximum protector effect against the [The effect of pigeon yolk sac fluid on the growth behavior of calcium carbonate crystals.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25681477) Song, Juan; Cheng, Haixia; Shen, Xinyu; Tong, Hua 2015-03-01 Previous experiments have proved that thermodynamically unstable calcium carbonate vaterite can exist for long periods in the yolk sac of a pigeon embryo. The aim of this article was to demonstrate the effect of in vitro mineralization of yolk sac fluid on calcium carbonate by direct precipitation. Experiments were conducted using pigeon yolk sac fluid and using lecithin extracted from pigeon yolk sac fluid as a control to investigate the regulating effects of the organic components in the embryo on the formation of the calcium carbonate precipitate. Multiple characterization methods were employed to study the various morphological patterns, sizes, crystal growth, and crystal phase transformations of the calcium carbonate precipitates as regulated by the yolk sac fluid extracted at different stages of incubation. The experimental results demonstrate that as the incubation proceeds towards the later stages, the composition and environmental features of the yolk sac fluid become more favorable for the formation of relatively unstable calcium carbonate phases with high energies of the vaterite state. The experiments conducted with extracted lecithin as the template for crystal growth yielded similar results. A large amount of organic molecules with polar functional groups carried by the yolk sac fluid have strong effects and can both initially induce the crystallization and regulate the aggregation of calcium carbonate. Furthermore, this regulation process is found to be closely related to the lecithin contained in yolk sac fluid. These observations confirm the changes in yolk sac fluid composition during incubation have significant effects on the production of vaterite, which implicates the calcium transport during embryo growth. \u00a9 2015 Poultry Science Association Inc. [[Does carbonate originate from carbonate-calcium crystal component 2008-09-01 It gives important information in selecting the appropriate treatment for urolithiasis to confirm the component of urinary calculus. Presently component analysis of the urinary calculus is generally performed by infrared spectroscopy which is employed by companies providing laboratory testing services in Japan. The infrared spectroscopy determines the molecular components from the absorption spectra in consequence of atomic vibrations. It has the drawback that an accurate crystal structure cannot be analyzed compared with the X-ray diffraction method which analyzes the crystal constituent based on the diffraction of X-rays on crystal lattice. The components of the urinary calculus including carbonate are carbonate apatite and calcium carbonate such as calcite. Although the latter is reported to be very rare component in human urinary calculus, the results by infrared spectroscopy often show that calcium carbonate is included in calculus. The infrared spectroscopy can confirm the existence of carbonate but cannot determine whether carbonate is originated from carbonate apatite or calcium carbonate. Thus, it is not clear whether calcium carbonate is included in human urinary calculus component in Japan. In this study, we examined human urinary calculus including carbonate by use of X-ray structural analysis in order to elucidate the origin of carbonate in human urinary calculus. We examined 17 human calculi which were reported to contain calcium carbonate by infrared spectroscopy performed in the clinical laboratory. Fifteen calculi were obtained from urinary tract, and two were from gall bladder. The stones were analyzed by X-ray powder method after crushed finely. The reports from the clinical laboratory showed that all urinary culculi consisted of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate, while the gallstones consisted of calcium carbonate. But the components of all urinary calculi were revealed to be carbonate apatite by X-ray diffraction.

H Canyon plans to commence conversion of plutonium metal to low-fired plutonium oxide in 2012 for eventual use in the Mixed Oxide Fuel (MOX) Facility. The flowsheet includes sequential operations of metal dissolution, ion exchange, elution, oxalate precipitation, filtration, and calcination. All processes beyond dissolution will occur in HB-Line. The filtration step produces an aqueous filtrate that may have as much as 4 M nitric acid and 0.15 M oxalate. The oxalate needs to be removed from the stream to prevent possible downstream precipitation of residual plutonium when the solution is processed in H Canyon. In addition, sending the oxalate to the waste tank farm is undesirable.

We present a case of end stage renal failure caused by excessive dietary oxalate intake in a dietary weight loss regimen. Case Presentation: A 51-year-old Caucasian male with the past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, gout, hypertension and morbid obesity was referred to the primary care clinic after being found pale and easily fatigued. The patient had lost 36 kg over a 7-month period by implementing exercise and intense dietary measures that included 6 meals of spinach, kale, berries, and nuts. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 188/93 mm Hg with sunken eyes and dry mucus membranes. Laboratory workup was notable for blood urea nitrogen of 122 mg/dL, creatinine of 12 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 4.4 mL/min/1.73m2. Patient denied any history of renal disease or renal stones, or taking herbal products, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antifreeze (ethylene glycol), or any type of \"diet pills.\" Family history was unremarkable for any renal diseases. After failing intravenous fluid resuscitation, patient was started on maintenance hemodialysis. Abdominal imaging was consistent with chronic renal parenchymal disease with no evidence of nephrolithiasis. Renal biopsy revealed numerous polarized oxalate crystal deposition and diabetic nephropathy class IIA. At this point the patient was instructed to adopt a low oxalate diet. A 24-hour urine collection was remarkable for pH 4.7, citrate <50 mg, and oxalate 46 mg. Importantly, serum oxalate level was undetectable.

Since several bacteria have been shown to metabolize oxalate in vitro, including probiotic bifidobacteria, we focused on the efficiency and possible mechanisms by which bifidobacteria can infuence oxalate handling in vivo, especially in the intestines, and compared these results with the reported effects of Oxalobacter formigenes. to wild-type in the hepatic alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (Agxt/, a mouse model of Primary Hyperoxaluria) that were fed an oxalate-supplemented diet. The administration of B. animalis subsp. lactis led to a significant decrease in urinary oxalate excretion in WT and Agxt/ mice when compared to treatment with B. adolescent-is. Detection of B. animalis subsp. lactis in feces revealed that 3 weeks after oral gavage with the bacteria 64 % of WT mice, but only 37 % of Agxt/ mice were colonized. Examining intestinal oxalate fuxes showed there were no significant changes to net oxalate secretion in colonized animals and were therefore not associated with the changes in urinary oxalate excretion. These results indicate that lactis decreased urinary oxalate excretion by degrading dietary oxalate thus limiting its absorption across the intestine but it did not promote enteric oxalate excretion as reported for O. formigenes. Preventive or therapeutic administration of B. animalis subsp. lactis appears to have some potential to beneficially infuence dietary hyperoxaluria in mice. PMID:25269440 [Lithostathine, the presumed pancreatic stone inhibitor, does not interact protein) is, in addition to albumin, the major nonenzymatic protein of the pancreatic juice. It has been assumed to inhibit calcium carbonate precipitation and therefore to prevent stone formation in the pancreatic ducts. This function is, however, debatable. The assumption is based on the inhibition of in vitro crystal nucleation and growth by lithostathine. Considering that these phenomena occur only under certain critical conditions, we re-examined the question using a protein preparation where the purity and folding have been tested by mass spectroscopy and NMR in the absence of nonprotein contaminants. Under these conditions, we showed conclusively that lithostathine does not inhibit calcium carbonate nucleation and crystal growth. We demonstrated that previous findings on the alleged inhibition can be attributed to the uncontrolled presence of salts in the protein preparation used. Moreover, the affinity of lithostathine to calcite crystals, expressed as the half-life of bound iodinated protein in the presence of unlabeled competitor, was significantly lower than that of bovine serum albumin (8.8 and 11.2 h, respectively). Using glass microspheres instead of crystals did not significantly change the half-life of bound lithostathine (8.0 h). These findings are incompatible with the hypothesis of a specific interaction of lithostathine with calcium carbonate crystals. In conclusion, considering that components of pancreatic juice such as NaCl and phosphate ions are powerful inhibitors of calcium carbonate crystal growth, the mechanism of stone formation in pancreatic ducts must be reconsidered. The presence in normal pancreatic juice of small amounts of the 133-residue isoform of lithostathine (PSP-S1), which precipitates at physiological pH, should be noted, and the possibility should be considered that they form micro-precipitates that aggregate and are progressively calcified. [Oxalate production by fungi growing Jarosz-Wilkolazka, Anna; Gadd, Geoffrey M 2003-07-01 In this report, we have identified oxalic acid as an important metabolite elaborated in the response of wood-rotting fungi to toxic metal stress. The formation of oxalate crystals by white rot fungi (Bjerkandera fumosa, Phlebia radiata Trametes versicolor) and the brown rot fungus Fomitopsis pinicola, grown on media containing high levels of toxic metal ions has been visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray micro-analysis (EDXA) and HPLC. There were no significant differences between the growth of controls (metal-free) and on the 0.5% CaCO(3), Co(3)(PO(4))(2) or Zn(3)(PO(4))(2)-amended plates. ZnO inhibited the growth of all strains. Crystals were not detected in Zn(3)(PO(4))(2)-amended plates. The four examined strains displayed the formation of crystals on ZnO, Co(3)(PO(4))(2) aluminosilicate (CMAS) glass with composition relevant for aerospace applications, like air-breathing engines, were evaluated using differential thermal analysis (DTA) in powder and bulk forms. Activation energy and frequency factor values for crystallization of the glass were evaluated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the onset of crystallization and the phases that developed after heat treating bulk glass at temperatures ranging from 690 to 960 deg for various times. Samples annealed at temperatures below 900 deg remained amorphous, while specimens heat treated at and above 900 deg exhibited crystallinity originating at the surface. The crystalline phases were identified as wollastonite (CaSiO3) and aluminum diopside (Ca(Mg,Al) (Si,Al)2O6). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to examine the microstructure and chemical compositions of crystalline phases formed after heat treatment. [Nephrolithiasis: Molecular Mechanism of Renal Stone Formation and the Critical Role Played by disease is an ailment that has afflicted human kind for many centuries. Nephrolithiasis is a significant clinical problem in everyday practice with a subsequent burden for the health system. Nephrolithiasis remains a chronic disease and our fundamental understanding of the pathogenesis of stones as well as their prevention and cure still remains rudimentary. Regardless of the fact that supersaturation of stone-forming salts in urine is essential, abundance of these salts by itself will not always result in stone formation. The pathogenesis of calcium oxalate stone formation is a multistep process and essentially includes nucleation, crystal growth, crystal aggregation, and crystal retention. Various substances in the body have an effect on one or more of the above stone-forming processes, thereby influencing a person's ability to promote or prevent stone formation. Promoters facilitate the stone formation while inhibitors prevent it. Besides low urine volume and low urine pH, high calcium, sodium, oxalate and urate are also known to promote calcium oxalate stone formation. Many inorganic urinary prothrombin fragment-1, osteopontin) are known to inhibit stone formation. This review presents a comprehensive account of the mechanism of renal stone formation and the role of inhibitors/promoters in calcium oxalate crystallisation. PMID:24151593 Frank 1978-01-01 l-Ascorbic acid functions as a precursor of oxalic acid in several oxalate-accumulating plants. The present study extends this observation to include Rumex crispus L. (curly dock), Amaranthus retroflexus L. (red root pigweed), Chenopodium rhabarbarum L. (rhubarb). Several species with low oxalate content are also examined. When l-[1-14C]ascorbic acid is supplied to young seedlings of R. crispus or H. glomeratus, a major portion of the 14C is released over a 24-hour period as 14CO2 and only a small portion is recovered as [14C]oxalate, unlike cuttings from 2- or 4-month-old plants which retain a large part of the 14C as [14C]oxalic acid and release very little 14CO2. Support for an intermediate role of oxalate in the release of 14CO2 from l-[1-14C]ascorbic acid is seen in the rapid release of 14CO2 by R. crispus and H. glomeratus seedlings labeled with [14C]oxalic acid. The common origin of oxalic acid carbon in the C1 and C2 fragment from l-ascorbic acid is demonstrated by comparison of 14C content of oxalic acid in several oxalate-accumulators after cuttings or seedlings are supplied equal amounts of l-[1-14C]- or l-[UL-14C]ascorbic acid. Theoretically, l-[1-14C]ascorbic acid will produce labeled oxalic acid containing three times as much 14C as l-[UL-14C]ascorbic acid when equal amounts of label are provided. Experimentally, a ratio of 2.7 \u00b1 0.5 is obtained in duplicate experiments with six different species.

To determine the curative effect of infusions prepared from capitulums of Helichrysum graveolens (M. and ssp. barellieri (Ten.) Nyman (HS) on sodium oxalate induced kidney stones. Infusions prepared from the capitulums of HG and HS were tested for their curative effect on calcium oxalate deposition induced by sodium oxalate (70mg/kg i.p.). Following the injection of sodium oxalate for 5 days, plant extracts were administered to rats at two different doses. Potassium citrate was used as positive control. Water intake, urine volume, body, liver and kidney weights were measured; biochemical and hematological analyses were conducted on urine and blood samples. Additionally, histopathological examinations were done on kidney samples. H. stoechas extract showed prominent effect at 156mg/kg dose (stone formation score: 0.33), whereas number of kidney stones was maximum in sodium oxalate group (stone formation score: 2.33). The reduction in the uric acid and oxalate levels of urine samples and the elevation in the urine citrate levels are significant and promising in extract groups. Some hematological, biochemical and enzymatic markers are also ameliorated by the extracts. This is the first report on the curative effect of immortal flowers. Our preliminary study indicated that Helichrysum extracts may be used for treatment of urolithiasis and Helichrysum extracts are an alternative therapy to potassium citrate for patients suffering from kidney stones.

The genetically encoded fluorescent calcium-indicator GCaMP2 was crystallized in the calcium-saturated form. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.0 \u00c5 resolution and the structure was solved by molecular replacement. Fluorescent proteins and their engineered variants have played an important role in the study of biology. The genetically encoded calcium-indicator protein GCaMP2 comprises a circularly permuted fluorescent protein coupled protein calmodulin calmodulin target calmodulin target myosin light-chain kinase and has been used to image calcium transients in vivo. To aid rational efforts to engineer improved variants of GCaMP2, thismore \u00bb protein was crystallized in the calcium-saturated form.

Obesity is a risk factor for kidney stones and a positive correlation of unknown etiology between increased body size, and elevated urinary oxalate excretion has been reported. Here, we used obese ob/ob (ob) mice to elucidate the pathogenesis of obesity-associated hyperoxaluria. These ob mice have significant hyperoxaluria (3.3-fold) compared with control mice, which is not due to overeating as shown by pair-feeding studies. Dietary oxalate removal greatly ameliorated this hyperoxaluria, confirming that it is largely enteric in origin. Transporter SLC26A6 (A6) plays an essential role in active transcellular intestinal oxalate secretion, and ob mice have significantly reduced jejunal A6 mRNA (- 80%) and total protein (- 62%) expression. While net oxalate secretion was observed in control jejunal tissues mounted in Ussing chambers, net absorption was seen in ob tissues, due to significantly reduced secretion. We hypothesized that the obesity-associated increase in intestinal and systemic inflammation, as reflected by elevated proinflammatory cytokines, suppresses A6-mediated Indeed, proinflammatory cytokines (elevated in ob mice) significantly decreased intestinal oxalate transport in vitro by reducing A6 mRNA and total protein expression. Proinflammatory cytokines also significantly reduced active mouse jejunal oxalate secretion, converting oxalate transport from net secretion in vehicle-treated tissues to net absorption in proinflammatory cytokines-treated tissues. Thus, reduced active intestinal oxalate secretion, likely secondary to local and systemic inflammation, contributes to the pathogenesis of obesity-associated hyperoxaluria. Hence, proinflammatory cytokines represent potential therapeutic targets. Copyright \u00a9 2017 International Society of Nephrology. Published by [Changes in urinary risk profile after short-term low sodium and low calcium diet in recurrent Swiss stone 2017-12-04 Kidney stone disease is common in industrialized countries. Recently, it has attracted growing attention, because of its significant association with adverse renal outcomes, including end stage renal disease. Calcium-containing kidney stones are frequent with high recurrence rates. While hypercalciuria is a well-known risk factor, restricted intake of animal protein and sodium, combined with normal dietary calcium, has been shown to be more effective in stone prevention compared with a low-calcium diet. Notably, the average sodium intake in Switzerland is twice as high as the WHO recommendation, while the intake of milk and dairy products is low. We retrospectively analyzed Swiss recurrent kidney stone formers (rKSF) to test the impact of a low-sodium in combination with a low-calcium diet on the urinary risk profile. In patients with recurrent calcium oxalate containing stones, we investigated both, the consequence of a low-sodium diet on urinary volume and calcium excretion, and the influence of a low-sodium low-calcium diet on urinary oxalate excretion. Of the 169 patients with CaOx stones, 49 presented with hypercalciuria at baseline. The diet resulted in a highly significant reduction in 24-h urinary sodium and calcium excretion: from 201 \u00b1 89 at baseline to 128 \u00b1 88 mmol/d for sodium (p < 0.0001), and from 5.67 \u00b1 3.01 to 4.06 \u00b1 2.46 mmol/d (p < 0.0001) for calcium, respectively. Urine volume remained unchanged. Notably, no increase in oxalate excretion occurred on the restricted diet (0.39 \u00b1 0.26 0.39 \u00b1 0.19 mmol/d, p = 0.277). Calculated Psf (probability of stone formation) values were only predictive for the risk of calcium phosphate stones. A diet low in sodium and calcium in recurrent calcium oxalate stone formers resulted in a significant reduction of urinary calcium excretion, but no change in urine volume. In this population with apparently low intake of dairy products, calcium restriction does not [Spectroscopic studies of gel grown zinc doped calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate crystals](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AIPC.1953g0025S) [NASA Astrophysics Suryawanshi, V. R. T. 2018-05-01 The influence of zinc doping on the gel grown calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate crystals was studied using the spectroscopic techniques, which included SEM, FTIR and EDAX. It was found that, zinc ions transform the morphology of brushite crystals from rectangular plate shaped crystals to branching microcrystal patterns. However in FT-IR spectroscopy, as compared to undoped brushite crystals few vibrations were shifted to higher value. The observed changes in the vibrations were due to the impact of zinc ions. EDAX techniques is use to determine the percentage composition of elements present in the doped crystals. It revealed that the sample was of a mixed composition. [Isolation and characterization of mesophilic, oxalate-degrading Streptomyces from plant System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Sahin, Nurettin 2004-10-01 The present work was aimed at the isolation of additional new pure cultures of oxalate-degrading Streptomyces and its preliminary characterization for further work in the field of oxalate metabolism and taxonomic studies. Mesophilic, oxalate-degrading Streptomyces were enriched and isolated from plant rhizosphere and forest soil samples. Strains were examined for cultural, morphological (spore chain morphology, spore mass colour, diffusible and melanin pigment production), physiological (antibiosis, growth in the presence of inhibitory compounds, assimilation of organic acids and enzyme substrates) and chemotaxonomic characters (cellular lipid components and diagnostic cell-wall diamino acid). The taxonomic data obtained were analysed by the simple matching (SSM) and Jaccard (SJ) coefficients, clustering was achieved using the able to utilize sodium-, potassium-, calcium- and ammonium-oxalate salts. Based on the results of numerical taxonomy, isolates were grouped into five cluster groups with a 70% SSM similarity level. Streptomyces rochei was the most common of the cluster groups, with a Willcox probability of P>0.8. Streptomyces antibioticus, S. anulatus, S. fulvissimus, Data (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Manciu, Felicia 2012-10-01 In the present comparative spectroscopic study we try to understand calcium oxalate kidney stone formation as well as its inhibition by using a traditional medicine approach with Larrea Tridentata (LT) herbal extracts and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), which is a chemical extract of the LT bush. The samples were synthesized without and with LT or NDGA using a simplified single diffusion gel growth technique. While the use of infusion from LT decreases the sizes of calcium oxalate crystals and also changes their structure from monohydrate for pure crystals to dihydrate for crystals grown with different amounts of inhibitor, both Raman and infrared absorption spectroscopic techniques, which are the methods of analysis employed in this work, reveal that NDGA is not responsible for the change in the morphology of calcium oxalate crystals and does not contribute significantly to the inhibition process. The presence of NDGA slightly affects the structure of the crystals by modifying the strength of the C-C bonds as seen in the Raman data. Also, the current infrared absorption results demonstrate the presence of NDGA in the samples through a vibrational line that corresponds to the double bond between carbon atoms of the ester group of NDGA. [Bacterially induced mineralization of mineralization has been proposed as a new method for the restoration of limestones in historic buildings and monuments. We describe here the formation of calcite crystals by extracellular polymeric substances isolated from Bacillus firmus and Bacillus sphaericus. We isolated bacterial outer structures (glycocalix and parietal polymers), such as exopolysaccharides (EPS) and capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and checked for their influence on calcite precipitation. CPS and EPS extracted from both B. firmus and B. sphaericus were able to mediate CaCO3 precipitation in vitro. X-ray microanalysis showed that in all cases the formed crystals were calcite. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the shape of the crystals depended on the fractions utilized. These results suggest the possibility that biochemical composition of CPS or EPS influences the resulting morphology of CaCO3. There were no precipitates in the blank samples. CPS and EPS comprised of proteins and glycoproteins. Positive alcian blue staining also reveals acidic polysaccharides in CPS and EPS fractions. Proteins with molecular masses of 25-40 kDa and 70 kDa in the CPS fraction were highly expressed in the presence of calcium oxalate. This high level of synthesis could be related to the binding of calcium ions and carbonate deposition. [Relevance of dietary protein concentration and quality as risk factors for the formation of calcium oxalate for the development of feline calcium oxalate (CaOx) uroliths has not been conclusively clarified. The present study evaluated the effects of a varying dietary protein concentration and quality on critical indices for the formation of CaOx uroliths. Three diets with a high protein quality (10-11 % greaves meal/diet) and a varying crude protein (CP) concentration (35, 44 and 57 % in DM) were compared. Additionally, the 57 % CP diet was compared with a fourth diet that had a similar CP concentration (55 % in DM), but a lower protein quality (34 % greaves meal/diet). The Ca and oxalate (Ox) concentrations were similar in all diets. A group of eight cats received the same diet at the same time. Each feeding period was divided into a 21 d adaptation period and a 7 d sampling period to collect urine. There were increases in urinary volume, urinary Ca concentrations, renal Ca and Ox excretion and urinary relative supersaturation (RSS) with CaOx with increasing dietary protein concentrations. Urinary pH ranged between 6\u00b734 and 6\u00b766 among all groups, with no unidirectional effect of dietary protein. Lower renal Ca excretion was observed when feeding the diet with the lower protein quality, however, the underlying mechanism needs further evaluation. In conclusion, although the observed higher urinary volume is beneficial, the increase in urinary Ca concentrations, renal Ca and Ox excretion and urinary RSS CaOx associated with a high-protein diet may be critical for the development of CaOx uroliths in cats. [Improved calcium sulfate recovery from a reverse osmosis retentate using A temperature crystallization process called eutectic freeze crystallization (EFC) can produce both salt(s) and ice from a reverse osmosis (RO) stream by operating at the eutectic temperature of a solution. The EFC reject stream, which is de-supersaturated with respect to the scaling component, can subsequently be recycled back to the RO process for increased water recovery. This paper looks at the feasibility of using EFC to remove calcium sulfate from an RO retentate stream and compares the results to recovery rates at 0 and 20 \u00b0C. The results showed that there was a greater yield of calcium sulfate obtained at 0 \u00b0C as compared with 20 \u00b0C. Operation under eutectic conditions, with only a 20% ice recovery, resulted in an even greater yield of calcium sulfate (48%) when compared with yields obtained at operating temperatures of 0 and 20 \u00b0C (15% at 0 \u00b0C and 13% at 20 \u00b0C). The theoretical calcium recoveries were found to be 75 and 70% at 0 and 20 \u00b0C respectively which was higher than the experimentally determined values. The EFC process has the added advantage of producing water along with a salt. [Urinary calculi in hypercalcemic states.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2081514) Thomas, W C 1990-12-01 In this brief review of various hypercalcemic disorders and the likelihood of renal calculus formation, it is clearly evident that renal calculi occur much more often in hyperparathyroidism than in the other hypercalcemic states. Dystrophic calcification and nephrocalcinosis are common to all of the hypercalcemic disorders, including hyperparathyroidism, when the hypercalcemia is marked and the limit of solubility of calcium and phosphate in serum is approached. Interestingly, in sarcoidosis there are calcium oxalate crystals in variously distributed sarcoid granuloma, and the renal calculi are composed of calcium oxalate. By contrast, in hyperparathyroidism, the calculi composed of calcium phosphate predominate. This indicates a subtle and as yet undefined alteration in oxalate metabolism in sarcoidosis. An increase in urine pH occurs in hyperparathyroidism, and this enhances formation of crystalline calcium phosphate. However, the striking disparity between the frequency of calculus formation in hyperparathyroidism and that in other hypercalcemic disorders, several of which may be of relatively long duration, suggests that there indeed may be increased promoters of crystal formation in the urine of hyperparathyroid patients. [Determination of thermodynamic parameters for complexation of calcium magnesium with chondroitin sulfate isomers titration calorimetry: calcium Astrophysics System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Rodgers, Allen L.; Jackson, Graham E. 2017-04-01 Chondroitin sulfate (CS) occurs in human urine. It has several potential binding sites for calcium and as such may play an inhibitory role in calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate (kidney stone disease by reducing the supersaturation (SS) and crystallization of these salts. Urinary magnesium is also a role player in determining speciation in stone forming processes. This study was undertaken to determine the thermodynamic parameters for binding of the disaccharide unit of two different CS isomers with calcium and magnesium. These included the binding constant K. Experiments were performed using an isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC) at 3 different pH levels in the physiological range in human urine. Data showed that interactions between the CS isomers and calcium and magnesium occur via one binding site, thought to be sulfate, and that log K values are 1.17-1.93 and 1.77-1.80 for these two metals respectively. Binding was significantly stronger in Mg-CS than in Ca-CS complexes and was found to be dependent on pH in the latter but not in the former. Furthermore, binding in Ca-CS complexes was dependent on the location of the sulfate binding site. This was not the case in the Mg-CS complexes. Interactions were shown to be entropy driven and enthalpy unfavourable. These findings can be used in computational modeling studies to predict the effects of the calcium and magnesium CS complexes on the speciation of calcium and the SS of calcium salts in real urine samples. [Oxalate Acid-Base Cements as a Means of Carbon Storage](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFM.S51C0612E) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Erdogan, S. T. 2017-12-01 Emission of CO2 from industrial processes poses a myriad of environmental problems. One such polluter is the portland cement (PC) industry. PC is the main ingredient in concrete which is the ubiquitous binding material for construction works. Its production is responsible for 5-10 % of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Half of this emission arises from the calcination of calcareous raw materials and half from kiln fuel burning and cement clinker grinding. There have long been efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete. Among the many ways, one is to bind CO2 to the phases in the cement-water paste, oxides, hydroxides, and silicates of calcium, during early hydration or while in service. The problem is that obtaining calcium oxide cheaply requires the decarbonation of limestone and the uptake of CO2 is slow and limited mainly to the surface of the concrete due to its low gas permeability. Hence, a faster method to bind more CO2 is needed. Acid-base (AB) cements are fast-setting, high-strength systems that have high durability in many environments in which PC concrete is vulnerable. They are made with a powder base such as MgO and an acid or acid salt, like phosphates. Despite certain advantages over PC cement systems, AB cements are not feasible, due to their high acid content. Also, the phosphoric acid used comes from non-renewable sources of phosphate. A potential way to reduce the drawbacks of using phosphates could be to use organic acids. Oxalic acid or its salts could react with the proper powder base to give concrete that could be used for infrastructure hence that would have very high demand. In addition, methods to produce oxalates from CO2, even atmospheric, are becoming widespread and more economical. The base can also be an industrial byproduct to further lower the environmental impact. This study describes the use of oxalic acid and industrial byproducts to obtain mortars with mechanical properties comparable to those of PC mortars. It is ... Blood tests to check levels of calcium, phosphate, uric acid, and parathyroid hormone Urinalysis to see crystals and ... to measure acidity and levels of calcium, sodium, uric acid, oxalate, and polyacrylamide or polyacrylic in a potassium persulfate (KPS) as redox initiator in the presence of N,N-methylene-bis-acrylamide as a crosslinking agent. The influence of the grafted chitosan on calcium salts crystallization in vitro was studied using the sitting-drop method. By using polyacrylamide grafted chitosan as substrate, rosette-like CaSO4 crystals were observed. This was originated by the presence of sulfate coming from the initiator KPS. By comparing crystallization on pure chitosan and on grafted chitosan, a dramatic influence of the grafted polymer on the crystalline habit of both salts was observed. Substrates prepared by combining sulfate with chitosan or sulfate with polyacrylamide did not produce similar CaSO4 morphologies. Moreover, small spheres or donut-shaped CaCO3 crystals on polyacrylic acid grafted chitosan were generated. The particular morphology of CaCO3 crystals depends also on other synthetic parameters such as the molecular weight of the chitosan sample and the KPS concentration.

Clausen; Frederick Green 2003-01-01 Accumulation of oxalic acid (OA) by brown-rot fungi and precipitation of copper oxalate crystals in wood decayed by copper-tolerant decay fungi has implicated OA in the mechanism of copper tolerance. Understanding the role of OA in copper tolerance is important due to an increasing reliance on copper-based wood preservatives. In this study, four copper-tolerant brown-... [Surface roughness and lactate crystals that sometimes form on Cheddar cheese surfaces are a significant expense to manufacturers. Researchers have identified several postmanufacture conditions such as storage temperature and packaging tightness that contribute to crystal formation. Anecdotal reports suggest that physical characteristics at the cheese surface, such as roughness, cracks, and irregularities, may also affect crystallization. The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined effects of surface roughness and packaging tightness on crystal formation in smoked Cheddar cheese. Four 20-mm-thick cross-section slices were cut perpendicular to the long axis of a retail block (~300g) of smoked Cheddar cheese using a wire cutting device. One cut surface of each slice was lightly etched with a cheese grater to create a rough, grooved surface; the opposite cut surface was left undisturbed (smooth). The 4 slices were vacuum packaged at 1, 10, 50, and 90kPa (very tight, moderately tight, loose, very loose, respectively) and stored at 1\u00b0C. Digital images were taken at 1, 4, and 8 wk following the first appearance of crystals. The area occupied by crystals and number of discrete crystal regions (DCR) were quantified by image analysis. The experiment was conducted in triplicate. Effects of storage time, packaging tightness, surface roughness, and their interactions were evaluated by repeated-measures ANOVA. Surface roughness, packaging tightness, storage time, and their 2-way interactions significantly affected crystal area and DCR number. Extremely heavy crystallization occurred on both rough and smooth surfaces when slices were packaged loosely or very loosely and on rough surfaces with moderately tight packaging. In contrast, the combination of rough surface plus very tight packaging resulted in dramatic decreases in crystal area and DCR number. The combination of smooth surface plus very tight packaging virtually eliminated crystal formation, presumably by eliminating available [Case Report of a Fatal Antifreeze Ingestion with a Record High Level and Impressive Renal Crystal Deposition.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27747109) Erickson, Heidi L 2016-01-01 Ethylene glycol, methanol, and diethylene glycol are readily available in many household and commercially available products. While these alcohols are relatively nontoxic themselves, their acidic metabolites are toxic and can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Herein we report a lethal case of massive ethylene glycol ingestion in a suicide with a record high level (1254 mg/dL) and images of the histologic examination of the kidneys revealing impressive calcium oxalate crystal deposition. Autopsy findings also showed evidence of mild cerebral edema. [Structural, spectral and birefringence studies of semiorganic (CA5SS) was grown by slow evaporation solution growth technique. The cell parameters and molecular structure of the grown crystal were studied by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis. The presence of various functional groups of the grown crystal was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Fourier transform Raman (FT-Raman) analysis. UV-Visible spectrum shows that CA5SS crystals have high transmittance in the range of 330-900 nm. The refractive index, birefringence and transient photoluminescence properties of the grown crystal were analyzed. The frequency doubling of the grown crystal (CA5SS) were studied and compared with that of KDP. [The role of intestinal oxalate transport in hyperoxaluria and the formation of kidney stones in animals and man](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5358548) Whittamore, Jonathan M.; Hatch, Marguerite 2016-01-01 The intestine exerts a considerable influence over urinary oxalate in two ways, through the absorption of dietary oxalate and by serving as an adaptive extra-renal pathway for elimination of this waste metabolite. Knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for oxalate absorption and secretion by the intestine therefore have significant implications for understanding the etiology of hyperoxaluria, as well as offering potential targets for future treatment strategies for calcium oxalate kidney stone disease. In this review, we present the recent developments and advances in this area over the past 10 years, and put to the test some of the new ideas that have emerged during this time, using human and mouse models. A key focus for our discussion are the membrane-bound anion exchangers, belonging to the SLC26 gene family, some of which have been shown to participate in transcellular oxalate absorption and secretion. This has offered the opportunity to not only examine the roles of these specific transporters, revealing their importance to oxalate homeostasis, but to also probe the relative contributions made by the active transcellular and passive paracellular components of oxalate transport across the intestine. We also discuss some of the various physiological stimuli and signaling pathways which have been suggested to participate in the adaptation and regulation of intestinal oxalate transport. Finally, we offer an update on research into Oxalobacter formigenes, alongside recent investigations of other oxalate-degrading gut bacteria, in both laboratory animals and humans. vivo oxalate degradation urinary oxalate substantially increases the risk of hyperoxaluria, a significant risk factor for urolithiasis. The primary goal of this study was to reduce urinary oxalate excretion employing liposome encapsulated membrane oxalate oxidase was purified from Bougainvillea leaves. The enzyme in its native form was less effective at the physiological pH of the recipient animal. To increase its functional viability, the enzyme was immobilized on to ethylene maleic anhydride (EMA). Rats were injected with liposome encapsulated EMA- oxalate oxidase and the effect was observed on degradation of oxalic acid. Results: The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity with 60-fold purification and 31 per cent yield. The optimum pH of EMA-derivative enzyme was 6.0 and it showed 70 per cent of its optimal activity at pH 7.0. The EMA-bound enzyme encapsulated into liposome showed greater oxalate degradation in 15 per cent casein vitamin B6 deficient fed rats as compared with 30 per cent casein vitamin B6 deficient fed rats and control rats. Interpretation & conclusions: EMA-oxalate oxidase encapsulated liposome caused oxalate degradation in experimental hyperoxaluria indicating that the enzyme could be used as a therapeutic agent in hyperoxaluria leading to urinary stones. PMID:23481063 [Powder of (CPPD) crystals in soft tissues such as cartilage, meniscus and synovial tissue leads to CPPD deposition diseases. The appearance of these crystals in the synovial fluid can give rise to an acute arthritic attack with pain and inflammation of the joints, a condition called pseudo-gout. The growth of CPP crystals has been carried out, in the present study, using the single diffusion gel growth technique, which can broadly mimic in vitro the condition in soft tissues. The crystals were characterized by different techniques. The FTIR study revealed the presence of various functional groups. Powder XRD study was also carried out to verify the crystal structure. The dielectric study was carried out at room temperature by applying field of different frequency from 500 Hz to 1 MHz. The dielectric constant, dielectric loss and a.c. resistivity decreased as frequency increased, whereas the a.c. conductivity increased as frequency increased. [Crystallization of calcium sulfate dihydrate in the presence of some metal ions](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007JCrGr.299..146H) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (CaSO 4\u00b72H 2O gypsum) in sodium chloride solutions in the presence of some metal ions, and over a range of relative super-saturation has been studied. The addition of metal ions, even at relatively low concentration (10 -6 mol l -1), markedly retard the rate of crystallization of gypsum. Retardation effect was enhanced with increase in the additives contents. Moreover, the effect was enhanced as the relative super-saturation decreases. Influence of mixed additives on the rate of crystallization (Cd 2++Arg, Cd 2++H 3PO 4 and Cd 2++PAA) has also been studied. Direct adsorption experiments of these metal ions on the surface of gypsum crystals have been made for comparison. [Effect of urine pH and magnesium on calcium Hypomagnesiuria is in patients with calcium oxalate (CaOx) nephrolithiasis. Clinical trials using Mg supplements as therapy against CaOx stones have shown mixed results. We tested the effect of Mg administration in healthy subjects under conditions of controlled urine pH (UpH) on urinary Ca excretion rate (UCaV) and CaOx 4-phase, double blind, placebo-controlled, metabolic crossover study performed in healthy volunteers. Mg lactate (MgLact 2 ) was used as Mg supplement. High UpH and low UpH were achieved by administration of potassium citrate (K 3 Citrate) and ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl), respectively, with potassium balance maintained by KCl. Eight participants completed 4 phases of study. The interventions successfully modulated 24-h UpH (7.0 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 5.7 \u00b1 0.6 in high vs low pH phases; P<0.001). Administration \u00b1 1.6 mmol/day), high vs low Mg phase; P<0.001], and increased pH both at low (5.6 \u00b1 0.5 to 5.8 \u00b1 0.7; P = 0.02) and high UpH (6.9 \u00b1 0.4 to 7.0 \u00b1 0.3; P = 0.01). At a given urine pH, Mg supplementation marginally increased UCaV, but did not alter UOxV or CaOx saturation. Provision of an alkali load significantly lowered UCaV and saturation of CaOx at any level of UMgV. Compared to changes in UMgV, changes in UpH play a more significant role in determining urine CaOx saturation in healthy subjects. Mg supplements are likely to reduce CaOx saturation if they also raise urine pH. [Crystal CoXyl43, activated by calcium ions, was determined in its apo and complexed forms with xylotriose or l-arabinose in the presence and absence of calcium. The presence of calcium ions dramatically increases the kcat of CoXyl43 for p-nitrophenyl reduces the Michaelis constant for p-nitrophenyl -l-arabinofuranoside. CoXyl43 consists of a single catalytic domain comprised of a five-bladed -propeller. In the presence of calcium, a single calcium ion was observed at the centre of this catalytic domain, behind the catalytic pocket. In the absence of calcium, the calcium ion was replaced with one sodium ion and one water molecule, and the positions of these cations were shifted by 1.3 \u00c5. The histidine-319 side chain, which coordinates to the 2-hydroxyl oxygen atom of the bound xylose molecule in the catalytic pocket, also coordinates to the calcium ion, but not to the sodium ion. The calcium-dependent increase in activity appears to be caused by the structural change in the catalytic pocket induced by the tightly bound calcium ion and coordinating water molecules, and by the protonation state of glutamic acid-268, the catalytic acid of the enzyme. Our findings further elucidate the complex relationship between metal ions and glycosidases. \u00a9 The Authors 2017.

[Perlwapin, an Abalone Nacre Protein with Three Four-Disulfide Core (Whey Acidic Protein) Domains, Inhibits the Growth of Calcium Carbonate Treccani, Laura; Mann, Karlheinz; Heinemann, Fabian; Fritz, Monika 2006-01-01 We have isolated a new protein from the nacreous layer of the shell of the sea snail Haliotis laevigata (abalone). Amino acid sequence analysis showed the protein to consist of 134 amino acids and to contain three sequence repeats of 40 amino acids which were very similar to the well-known whey acidic protein domains of other proteins. The new protein was therefore named perlwapin. In addition to the major sequence, we identified several minor variants. Atomic force microscopy was used to explore the interaction of perlwapin with calcite crystals. Monomolecular layers of calcite crystals dissolve very slowly in deionized water and recrystallize in supersaturated calcium carbonate solution. When perlwapin was dissolved in the supersaturated calcium carbonate solution, growth of the crystal was inhibited immediately. Perlwapin molecules bound tightly to distinct step edges, preventing the crystal layers from growing. Using lower concentrations of perlwapin in a saturated calcium carbonate solution, we could distinguish native, active perlwapin molecules from denaturated ones. These observations showed that perlwapin can act as a growth inhibitor for calcium carbonate crystals in saturated calcium carbonate solution. The function of perlwapin in nacre growth may be to inhibit the growth of certain crystallographic planes in the mineral phase of the polymer/mineral composite nacre. PMID:16861275 [A Zr, Hf) based on eight-fold coordinated metals: Synthesis, crystal structure from single-crystal and powder diffraction data and thermal Pb; M' = Zr, Hf) has been prepared. The crystal structures have been solved from single-crystal and powder diffraction data. The isotypical compounds crystallise with space group P2 1/ c (No. 14). The structures consist of honeycomb layers formed by eight-fold coordinated metals, in a distorted square-based antiprismatic conformation, connected together via oxalates which act as ligands and also as monodentate in a less-common 3-bridging mode. Sheets are built from two shifted honeycomb layers and linked to each other through a hydrogen network. The resulting frameworks of the series display a compact two-dimensional arrangement of polyhedra MO 8 and M'O 8. Weakly-bonded water molecules are located between and within the sheets. Comparisons with the 3D open-framework structures of related metal oxalates are made. The dehydration processes occur in three or four steps. The final products are MO, M'O 2 and PbZrO 3 resulting from the sublimation of PbO in air. The size of PbZrO 3 crystallites, which are on average isotropic, has been evaluated to be 1055 \u00c5 from line-broadening analysis.

L.; Kikuchi, C. 1972-01-01 A study of the niobium hyperfine structure in single crystal calcium tungstate was made by the combination of the technique of electron paramagnetic resonance and electron nuclear double resonance (EPR/ENDOR). The microwave frequency was about 9.4 GHz and the radio frequency from 20MHz to 70 MHz. The rare earth ions Nd(3+), U(3+), or Tm(3+) were added as the charge compensator for Nb(5+). To create niobium paramagnetic centers, the sample was irradiated at 77 deg K with a 10 thousand curie Co-60 gamma source for 1 to 2 hours at a dose rate of 200 K rads per hour and then transferred quickly into the cavity. In a general direction of magnetic field, the spectra showed 4 sets of 10 main lines corresponding to 4 nonequivalent sites of niobium with I = 9/2. These 4 sets of lines coalesced into 2 sets of 10 in the ab-plane and into a single set of 10 along the c-axis. This symmetry suggested that the tungsten ions are substituted by the niobium ions [Relative hyperoxaluria, D; Rodgers, A L 1998-09-01 Long-term or high-dosage consumption of vitamin C may play a role in calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. The present study was undertaken to determine the biochemical and physicochemical risk factors in a male subject who developed haematuria and calcium oxalate crystalluria after ingestion of large doses of ascorbic acid for 8 consecutive days. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected before and during the ascorbic acid ingestion period as well as after the detection of haematuria. A special procedure was implemented for urine collections to allow for oxalate, ascorbate and other urinalysis. Oxalate was determined in the presence of EDTA to prevent in vitro conversion to ascorbic acid, whereas ascorbate itself was determined by manual titration in a redox method using the dye dichlorophenolindophenol. Urinalysis data were used to compute calcium oxalate relative supersaturations and Tiselius risk indices, whereas scanning electron microscopy was used to examine urinary deposits. Oxalate excretion increased by about 350% during ascorbate ingestion before haematuria. Ascorbate concentrations also increased dramatically but appeared to reach a plateau maximum. Increasing calcium excretion was accompanied by decreasing potassium and phosphate values. The calcium oxalate relative supersaturation and Tiselius risk index increased during vitamin C ingestion and large aggregates of calcium oxalate dihydrate crystals were observed by scanning electron microscopy immediately after the detection of haematuria. High percentage metabolic conversion of ascorbate to oxalate in this subject caused relative hyperoxaluria and crystalluria, the latter manifesting itself as haematuria. Clinicians need to be alerted to the potential dangers of large dose ingestion of vitamin C in some individuals. [Crystals seen on CSF microscopy in a rarely identified on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microscopy, their presence can be of significant diagnostic value. We report a case of oxalate crystals seen on CSF microscopy of a 43-year-old woman. The patient presented with headaches, nausea and vomiting. CT of the head showed a small focus of hyper-density, suspicious of haemorrhage, in the right side of the pontine cistern. CSF cell count was within the normal range. Although no organisms were seen on microscopy, copious oxalate crystals were seen. The same crystals were seen on microscopy of CSF collected in a fluoride oxalate container used for glucose analysis. A follow-up contrast-enhanced CT angiogram did not demonstrate any abnormalities. It transpired that excess CSF had been collected into a fluoride oxalate container. This had subsequently been decanted into a plain container for microbiological analysis. Correct specimen collection should be emphasised when teaching lumbar puncture technique.

Init., Pohang 37673 2016-05-09 We demonstrate that a current can be induced and switched in a sub-femtosecond time-scale in an insulating calcium fluoride single crystal by an intense optical field. This measurement indicates that a sizable current can be generated and also controlled by an optical field in a dielectric medium, implying the capability of rapid current switching at a rate of optical frequency, PHz (10{sup 15} Hz), which is a couple of orders of magnitude higher than that of contemporary electronic signal processing. This demonstration may serve to facilitate the development of ultrafast devices in PHz frequency. [Vibrational studies in aqueous solutions. Part II. The acid oxalate ion and oxalic acid](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980JMoSt..65...71S) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Shippey, T. A. 1980-08-01 Assignments for oxalic acid in solution are re-examined. A detailed assignment of the IR and Raman spectra of the acid oxalate ion is presented for the first time. Raman spectroscopy is used to study the first ionization of oxalic acid. [The Relationship between Serum Oxalic Acid, wave velocity (PWV) and central aortic blood pressures are independent predictors of increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Oxalic acid is a uremic retention molecule that is extensively studied in the pathogenesis of calcium oxalate stones. Oxalobacter formigenes, a member of the colon microbiota, has important roles in oxalate homeostasis. Data regarding the colonization by and the exact role of O. formigenes in the pathogenesis of oxalic acid metabolism in HD patients are scant. Hence, we aimed to determine the relationship between fecal O. formigenes colonization, serum oxalic acid and hemodynamic parameters in HD patients with regard to the colo-reno-cardiac axis. Fifty HD patients were enrolled in this study. PWV and central aortic systolic (cASBP) and diastolic (I.E.M. GmbH, Stolberg, Germany). Serum oxalic acid levels were assessed by ELISA, and fecal O. formigenes DNA levels were isolated and measured by real-time PCR. Isolation of fecal O. formigenes was found in only 2 HD patients. One of them had 113,609 copies/ml, the other one had 1,056 copies/ml. Serum oxalic acid levels were found to be positively correlated with PWV (r = 0.29, p = 0.03), cASBP (r = 0.33, p = 0.001) and cADBP (r = 0.42, p = 0.002) and negatively correlated with LDL (r = -0.30, p = 0.03). In multivariate linear regression analysis, PWV was independently predicted by oxalic acid, glucose and triglyceride. This is the first study that demonstrates the absence of O. formigenes as well as a relation between serum oxalic acid and cASBP, cADBP and PWV in HD patients. Replacement of O. formigenes with pre- and probiotics might decrease serum oxalic acid levels and improve cardiovascular outcomes in HD patients. [Studies on the in vivo sensitivity of spindle microtubules to calcium ions and evidence a calcium ions into echinoderm mitosis to determine the calcium sensitivity of microtubules (Mts) in vivo. Spindle birefringence (BR), a measure of the number of aligned Mts in the spindle, is locally, rapidly, and reversibly abolished by small volumes of microinjected CaCl2 (1 mM). Rapid return of BR is followed by anaphase, and subsequent divisions are normal. Similar doses of MgCl2, BaCl2, KCl, NaCl, pH buffers, distilled water, or vegetable oil have no effect on spindle BR, whereas large doses of such agents sometimes cause slow, uniform loss in BR over the course of a minute or more. Of the ions tested, only Sr++ causes effects comparable to Ca++. Ca-EGTA buffers, containing greater than micromolar free Ca++, abolishes BR in a manner similar to millimolar concentrations of injected CaCl2. Caffeine, a potent uncoupler of the Ca++-pump/ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, causes a local, transient depression in spindle BR in the injected region. Finally, injection of potassium oxalate results in the formation of small, highly BR crystals, presumably CA- oxalate, in Triton-sensitive compartments in the cytoplasm. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that spindle Mts are sensitive to levels of free Ca++ in the physiological range, provide evidence for the existence of a strong cytoplasmic Ca++-sequestering system, and support the notion that Mt assembly and disassembly in local regions of the spindle may be orchestrated by local changes in the cytoplasmic free Ca++ concentration during mitosis. An appendix offers the design of a new chamber for immobilizing echinoderm eggs for injection, a new method for determining the volume of the injected solution, and a description of the microinjection technique, which was designed, but never fully described, by Hiramoto (Y.

We assessed their distribution and biochemical and morphologic features in human knee OA cartilage. We prospectively included 20 patients who underwent total knee replacement (TKR) for primary OA. CaC crystal characterization and identification involved Fourier-transform infra-red spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy of 8 to 10 cartilage zones of each knee, including medial and lateral femoral condyles and tibial plateaux and the intercondyle zone. Differential expression of genes involved in the mineralization process between cartilage with and without calcification was assessed in samples from 8 different patients by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry and histology studies were performed in 6 different patients. Mean (SEM) age and body mass index of patients at the time of TKR was 74.6 (1.7) years and 28.1 (1.6) kg/m\u00b2, respectively. Preoperative X-rays showed joint calcifications (chondrocalcinosis) in 4 cases only. The medial femoro-tibial compartment was the most severely affected in all cases, and mean (SEM) Kellgren-Lawrence score was 3.8 (0.1). All 20 OA cartilages showed CaC crystals. The mineral content represented 7.7% (8.1%) of the cartilage weight. All patients showed BCP crystals, which were associated with CPP crystals for 8 joints. CaC crystals were present in all knee joint compartments and in a mean of 4.6 (1.7) of the 8 studied areas. Crystal content was similar between superficial and deep layers and between medial and femoral compartments. BCP samples showed spherical structures, typical of biological apatite, and CPP samples showed rod-shaped or cubic structures. The expression of several genes involved in mineralization, including human homolog of progressive tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, was [Crystallization and preliminary X-ray characterization of the genetically encoded fluorescent indicator Fluorescent proteins and their engineered variants have played an important role in the study of biology.

We investigated the necessity of pre-analytical acidification in both crystallized and non-crystallized urine samples. From 130 urine samples obtained via routine urine analysis, 65 (50%) samples were classified as non-crystallized. All samples were divided into three groups: untreated samples, acidified samples with HCl, and acidified samples after 1h room-temperature incubation. Urine samples were measured for calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and creatinine using Modular P800 and were examined for crystals using light microscopy. In crystallized samples, acidified samples with 1h incubation had significantly higher Ca/Cr, P/Cr, and Mg/Cr than did untreated samples with mean differences of 0.04, 0.03, and 0.01 mg/mg, respectively (P<0.001). In acidified samples that were analyzed immediately, crystallized samples had lower calcium concentrations than those of acidified samples with 1h incubation and a mean difference of 0.21 mg/dl (P = 0.025). None of the sample differences which exceeded the critical difference of urinary Ca, P and Mg was observed. Acidification of urine should be performed before the measurement of Ca, P, and Mg in the presence of urinary crystals. However, the lack of an acidification process does not result in a clinically significant change. \u00a9 2013.

[The crystal structures of the psychrophilic subtilisin S41 Richard L 2009-02-01 We determine and compare the crystal structure of two proteases belonging to the subtilisin superfamily: S41, a cold-adapted serine protease produced by A resolution and Sph, a mesophilic serine protease produced by Bacillus sphaericus, at 0.8 A resolution. The purpose of this comparison was to find out whether multiple calcium ion binding is a molecular factor responsible for the adaptation of S41 to extreme low temperatures. We find that these two subtilisins have the same subtilisin fold with a root mean square between the two structures of 0.54 A. The final models for S41 and Sph include a calcium-loaded state of five ions bound to each of these two subtilisin molecules. None of these calcium-binding sites correlate with the high affinity known binding site (site A) found for other subtilisins. Structural analysis of the five calcium-binding sites found in these two crystal structures indicate that three of the binding sites have two side chains of an acidic residue coordinating the calcium ion, whereas the other two binding sites have either a main-chain carbonyl, or only one acidic residue side chain coordinating the calcium ion. Thus, we conclude that three of the sites are of high affinity toward calcium ions, whereas the other two are of low affinity. Because Sph is a mesophilic subtilisin and S41 is a psychrophilic subtilisin, but both crystal structures were found to bind five calcium ions, we suggest that multiple calcium ion binding is not responsible for the adaptation of S41 to low temperatures. Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc. isolated a 4.785 Da protein from the nacreous layer of the sea snail Haliotis laevigata (greenlip abalone) shell after demineralization with acetic acid. The sequence of 41 amino acids was determined by Edman degradation supported by mass spectrometry. The most abundant amino acids were cysteine (19.5%), histidine (17%), and arginine (14.6%). The positively charged amino acids were almost counterbalanced by negatively charged ones resulting in a calculated isoelectric point of 7.86. Atomic-force microscopy studies of the interaction of the protein with calcite surfaces in supersaturated calcium carbonate solution or calcium chloride solution showed that the protein bound specifically to calcite steps, inhibiting further crystal growth at these sites in carbonate solution and preventing crystal dissolution when carbonate was substituted with chloride. Therefore this protein was named perlinhibin. X-ray diffraction investigation of the crystal after atomic-force microscopy growth experiments showed that the formation of aragonite was induced on the calcite substrate around holes caused by perlinhibin crystal-growth inhibition. The strong interaction of the protein with calcium carbonate was also shown by vapor diffusion crystallization. In the presence of the protein, the crystal surfaces were covered with holes due to protein binding and local inhibition of crystal growth. In addition to perlinhibin, we isolated and sequenced a perlinhibin-related protein, indicating that perlinhibin may be a member of a family of closely related proteins.

Materials and methods The crude aqueous-methanolic extract of Holarrhena antidysenterica (Ha.Cr) was studied using the in vitro and in vivo methods. Results In the in vitro experiments, Ha.Cr demonstrated a concentration-dependent (0.25-4 mg/ml) inhibitory effect on the slope of aggregation.

[Ascorbic Acid Intake and Holmes, Ross P. 2016-01-01 In humans approximately 60 mg of ascorbic acid (AA) breaks down in the body each day and has to be replaced by a dietary intake of 70 mg in females and 90 mg in males to maintain optimal health and AA homeostasis. The breakdown of AA is non-enzymatic and results in oxalate formation. The exact amount of oxalate formed has been difficult to ascertain primarily due to the limited availability of healthy human tissue for such research and the difficulty in measuring AA and its breakdown products. The breakdown of 60 mg of AA to oxalate could potentially result in the formation of up to 30 mg oxalate per day. This exceeds our estimates of the endogenous production of 10 - 25 mg oxalate per day, indicating that degradative pathways that do not form oxalate exist. In this review we examine what is known about the pathways of AA metabolism and how oxalate forms. We further identify how gaps in our knowledge may be filled to more precisely determine the contribution of AA breakdown to oxalate production in humans. The use of stable isotopes of AA to directly assess the conversion of vitamin to oxalate should help fill this void.

This case-control study enrolled 128 patients during a period of 20 months. The cases were CaOx stone formers with a recent stone episode. Controls were matched by sex and age. Dimensions of CS were evaluated in cases and controls by validated self-report questionnaires measuring stressful life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, and satisfaction with life. Blood and urine samples were collected to determine cortisol levels and urinary composition. More relations between CS dimensions and blood and urine parameters were observed in cases than in controls. In cases, the blood cortisol level was related positively with the number of stressful life events (P = .03), intensity of these events (P = .04), and anxiety (P = .04). In addition, urinary magnesium (P = .03) and pyrophosphate (P = .05) levels were positively related with satisfaction with life and burnout, respectively. In contrast, urinary magnesium levels were negatively related with perceived stress (P = .01), anxiety (P = .016), and depression (P = .03). In controls, the number of stressful life events and the intensity of stressful life events was related positively with magnesium (P = .06, P = .02) levels and negatively with blood cortisol levels (P = .03, P = .004). Based on the variation between cases and controls in relations between CS dimensions and biochemical parameters, we hypothesize that CS may trigger a differential biological response in CaOx stone formers and controls, which in turn may promote or protect against CaOx stone formation.

[Struvite crystallization versus amorphous magnesium and calcium phosphate precipitation during treatment of a saline industrial (MgNH(4)PO(4)\u00b76H(2)O, MAP) could be an alternative for the sustainable and economical recovery of phosphorus from concentrated wastewater streams. Struvite precipitation is recommended for those wastewaters which have high orthophosphate concentration. However the presence of a cheap magnesium source is required in order to make the process feasible. For those wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) located near the seashore magnesium could be economically obtained using seawater. However seawater contains calcium ions that could interfere in the process, by promoting the precipitation of amorphous magnesium and calcium phosphates. Precipitates composition was affected by the NH(4)(+)/PO(4)(3-) molar ratio used. Struvite or magnesium and calcium phosphates were obtained when NH(4)(+)/PO(4)(3-) was fixed at 4.7 or 1.0, respectively. This study demonstrates that by manipulating the NH(4)(+)/PO(4)(3-) it is possible to obtain pure struvite crystals, instead of precipitates of amorphous magnesium and calcium phosphates. This was easily performed by using either raw or secondary treated wastewater with different ammonium concentrations.

R. 2015-06-01 Small amounts of unidentified organic compounds have only recently been inferred on Mars despite strong reasons to expect significant concentrations and decades of searching. Based on X-ray diffraction and reflectance spectroscopic analyses we show that solid oxalic acid and its most common mineral salts are stable under the pressure and ultraviolet irradiation environment of the surface of Mars, and could represent a heretofore largely overlooked reservoir of organic carbon in the martian near-surface. In addition to the delivery to Mars by carbonaceous chondrites, oxalate minerals are among the predicted breakdown products of meteoritic organic matter delivered to the martian surface, as well as any endogenic organic carbon reaching the martian surface from the interior. A reinterpretation of pyrolysis experiments from the Viking, Phoenix, and Mars Science Laboratory missions shows that all are consistent with the presence of significant concentrations of oxalate minerals. Oxalate minerals could be important in numerous martian geochemical processes, including acting as a possible nitrogen sink (as ammonium oxalate), and contributing to the formation of \"organic\" carbonates, methane, and hydroxyl radicals. [Conservation of Monuments by Compatible research on innovative nanocomposites with strengthening, hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties have attracted the interest of the scientific community and promising results have been obtained as a result. In this study, stemming from the need for the compatibility of treatments in terms of nanocomposite/substrate, a three-layered compatible treatment providing strengthening, hydrophobic, and self-cleaning properties is proposed. This conservation approach was implemented treating lithotypes and mortars of different porosity and petrographic characteristics of and (c) a self-cleaning layer of TiO nanoparticles from titanium tetra-isopropoxide with oxalic acid as hole-scavenger. After the three-layered treatment, the surface hydrophobicity was improved due to PDMS and nano-TiO in the interface substrate/atmosphere, as proven by the homogeneity and the SiOTi hetero-linkages of the blend protective/self-cleaning layers observed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The aesthetic, microstructural, mechanical and permeabile compatibility of the majority of treated substrates ranged within acceptability limits. The improved photocatalytic activity, as proven by the total discoloration of methylene blue in the majority of cases, was attributed to the anchorage of TiO, through the SiOTi bonds to SiO, in the interface with the atmosphere, thus enhancing photoactivation. [The effect of CaCl2 on growth rate, wood decay and oxalic acid accumulation in Serpula lacrymans and related Jensen; Carol Green 2006-01-01 The dry rot fungus, Serpula lacrymans, is one of the most destructive copper-tolerant fungi causing timber decay in buildings in temperate regions. Calcium and oxalic acid have been shown to play important roles in the mechanism of wood decay. The effect of calcium on growth and decay was evaluated for 12 strains of S. lacrymans and compared to five brown-rot fungi.... [The Relationship between Serum Oxalic Acid, Central wave velocity (PWV) and central aortic blood pressures are independent predictors of increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Oxalic acid is a uremic retention molecule that is extensively studied in the pathogenesis of calcium oxalate stones. Oxalobacter formigenes, a member of the colon microbiota, has important roles in oxalate homeostasis. Data regarding the colonization by and the exact role of O. formigenes in the pathogenesis of oxalic acid metabolism in HD patients are scant. Hence, we aimed to determine the relationship between fecal O. formigenes colonization, serum oxalic acid and hemodynamic parameters in HD patients with regard to the colo-reno-cardiac axis. Methods Fifty HD patients were enrolled in this study. PWV and central aortic systolic (cASBP) and diastolic (I.E.M. GmbH, Stolberg, Germany). Serum oxalic acid levels were assessed by ELISA, and fecal O. formigenes DNA levels were isolated and measured by real-time PCR. Results Isolation of fecal O. formigenes was found in only 2 HD patients. One of them had 113,609 copies/ml, the other one had 1,056 copies/ml. Serum oxalic acid levels were found to be positively correlated with PWV (r = 0.29, p = 0.03), cASBP (r = 0.33, p = 0.001) and cADBP (r = 0.42, p = 0.002) and negatively correlated with LDL (r = 0.30, p = 0.03). In multivariate linear regression analysis, PWV was independently predicted by oxalic acid, glucose and triglyceride. Conclusions This is the first study that demonstrates the absence of O. formigenes as well as a relation between serum oxalic acid and cASBP, cADBP and PWV in HD patients. Replacement of O. formigenes with pre- and probiotics might decrease serum oxalic acid levels and improve cardiovascular outcomes in HD patients. PMID:26195968 [Genome Wide Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes in HK-2 Cells, a Line of Human Kidney Epithelial Cells in Response to Oxalate](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3446971) Koul, is a multi-factorial disease which, in the majority of cases, involves the renal deposition of calcium oxalate. Oxalate is a metabolic end product excreted primarily by the kidney. Previous studies have shown that elevated levels of oxalate are detrimental to the renal epithelial cells; however, oxalate renal epithelial cell interactions are not completely understood. In this study, we utilized an unbiased approach of gene expression profiling using Affymetrix HG_U133_plus2 gene chips to understand the global gene expression changes in human renal epithelial cells [HK-2] after exposure to oxalate. We analyzed the expression of 47,000 transcripts and variants, including 38,500 well characterized human genes, in the HK2 cells after 4 hours and 24 hours of oxalate exposure. Gene expression was compared among replicates as per the Affymetrix statistical program. Gene expression among various groups was compared using various analytical tools, and differentially expressed genes were classified according to the Gene Ontology Functional Category. The results from this study show that oxalate exposure induces significant expression changes in many genes. We show for the first time that oxalate exposure induces as well as shuts off genes differentially. We found 750 up-regulated and 2276 down-regulated genes which have not been reported before. Our results also show that renal cells exposed to oxalate results in the regulation of genes that are associated with specific molecular function, biological processes, and other cellular components. In addition we have identified a set of 20 genes that is differentially regulated by oxalate irrespective of duration of exposure and may be useful in monitoring oxalate nephrotoxicity. Taken together our studies profile global gene expression changes and provide a unique insight into oxalate renal cell interactions and oxalate nephrotoxicity. PMID:23028475 [Laboratory study of the effect of oxalic acid on the cloud condensation nuclei activity of mineral dust aerosol](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AtmEn..46..125G) [NASA Astrophysics Data acids, which make up a significant portion of the atmospheric organic aerosol, are emitted directly through biomass burning as well as produced through the oxidation of volatile organic compounds. Oxalic acid, the most abundant of the dicarboxylic acids, has been shown by recent field studies to be present in mineral dust aerosol particles. The presence of these internally mixed organic compounds can alter the water absorption and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) abilities of mineral particles in the Earth's atmosphere. The University of Iowa's Multi-Analysis Aerosol Reactor System ( MAARS) was used to measure the CCN activity of internally mixed particles that were generated from a mixture of either calcite or polystyrene latex spheres (PSLs) in an aqueous solution of oxalic acid. Although PSL is not a mineral dust component, it is used here as a non-reactive, insoluble particle. CCN measurements indicate that the internally mixed oxalate/calcite particles showed nearly identical CCN activity compared to the original calcite particles whereas oxalic acid/PSL internally mixed particles showed much greater CCN activity compared to PSL particles alone. This difference is due to the reaction of calcite with oxalic acid, which produces a relatively insoluble calcium oxalate coating on the particle surface and not a soluble coating as it does on the PSL particle. Our results suggest that atmospheric processing of mineral dust aerosol through heterogeneous processes will likely depend on the mineralogy and the specific chemistry involved. Increase in the CCN activity by incorporation of oxalic acid are only expected for unreactive insoluble dust particles that form a soluble coating. [The promotion effect of coexisting hygroscopic composition on the reaction between oxalic acid and calcite during humidifying process](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.A21G0146M) [NASA Astrophysics Data (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Ma, Q.; He, H. 2012-12-01 Internally mixed oxalic acid with mineral dust has been frequently detected in field measurements (Sullivan and Prather, 2007; Wang et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2009). Meanwhile, Furukawa and Takahashi (Furukawa and Takahashi, 2011) found that most of the oxalic acid in mineral mixture is present as metal oxalate complexes in the aerosols, however, the formation mechanism of these complexes is not well known. It was reported that cloud process of H2C2O4/CaCO3 mixture could lead to the formation of calcium oxalate (Gierlus et al., 2012). Recently, we used Raman spectroscopy to investigate the hygroscopic behavior of H2C2O4/CaCO3 mixture below saturation condition as well as the effect of coexisting hygroscopic compositions, e.g. Ca(NO3)2, NaCl, NH4NO3, and (NH4)2SO4. It was found that there was no interaction between H2C2O4 and calcite without third component during humidifying process under ambient condition. In contrast, the presence of coexisting Ca(NO)3, NaCl, or NH4NO3 could promote the reaction between H2C2O4 and calcite by providing an aqueous circumstance after deliquescence, resulting in the formation of calcium oxalate hydrates. Moreover, substitution of strong acid (HNO3) by medium acid (H2C2O4) occurred when water vapor was absorbed in Ca(NO3)2/H2C2O4 mixture (Ma and He, 2012). As for (NH4)2SO4, there existed a competition effect between (NH4)2SO4 and H2C2O4 for the reaction with CaCO3. CaCO3 was preferentially reacted with (NH4)2SO4 to form gypsum in the solution, while the residual NH4+ and C2O42- ions were bonded to (NH4)2C2O4 after efflorescence. These results implies a potential formation pathway of metal oxalate complexes in the atmosphere and also suggests that synergistic effect between different constituents in humidifying process of mixed particles should be considered in future hygroscopic behavior studies. [Crystal structure of the epithelial calcium 2016-06-23 Precise regulation of calcium homeostasis is essential for many physiological functions. The Ca(2+)-selective transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPV5 and TRPV6 play vital roles in calcium homeostasis as Ca(2+) uptake channels in epithelial tissues. Detailed structural bases for their assembly and Ca(2+) permeation remain obscure. Here we report the crystal structure of rat TRPV6 at 3.25 \u00c5 resolution. The overall architecture of TRPV6 reveals shared and unique features compared with other TRP channels. Intracellular domains engage in extensive interactions to form an intracellular 'skirt' involved in Ca(2+) selectivity is determined by direct coordination of Ca(2+) by a ring of aspartate side chains in the selectivity filter. On the basis of crystallographically identified cation-binding sites at the pore axis and extracellular vestibule, we propose a Ca(2+) permeation mechanism. Our results provide a structural foundation for understanding the regulation of epithelial Ca(2+) uptake and its role in pathophysiology. [Antiurolithic activity of Origanum vulgare 2011-01-01 Background Origanum vulgare Linn has traditionally been used in the treatment of urolithiasis. Therefore, we investigated the crude extract of Origanum vulgare for possible antiurolithic effect, to rationalize its medicinal use. Methods The crude aqueous-methanolic extract of Origanum vulgare (Ov.Cr) was studied using the in vitro and in vivo methods. In the in vitro experiments, supersaturated solution of calcium and oxalate, kidney epithelial cell lines (MDCK) and urinary bladder of rabbits were used, whereas, in the in vivo studies, rat model of urolithiasis was used for the study of preventive and curative effect. Results In the in vitro experiments, Ov.Cr exhibited a concentration-dependent (0.25-4 mg/ml) inhibitory effect on the slope of nucleation and aggregation and also decreased the number of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals (COM) produced in calcium oxalate metastable solutions. It also showed concentration-dependent antioxidant effect against DPPH free radical and lipid peroxidation induced in rat kidney tissue homogenate. Ov.Cr reduced the cell toxicity using MTT assay and LDH release in renal epithelial cells (MDCK) exposed to oxalate (0.5 mM) and COM (66 g/cm2) crystals. Ov.Cr relaxed high K+ (80 mM) induced contraction in rabbit urinary bladder strips, and shifted the calcium concentration-response curves (CRCs) towards right with suppression of the maximum response similar to that of verapamil, a standard calcium channel blocker. In male Wistar rats receiving lithogenic treatment comprising of 0.75% ethylene glycol in drinking water given for 3 weeks along with ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) for the first 5 days, Ov.Cr treatment (10-30 mg/kg) prevented as well as reversed toxic changes including loss of body weight, polyurea, crystalluria, oxaluria, raised serum urea and creatinine levels and crystal deposition in kidneys compared to their respective controls. Conclusion These data indicating the antiurolithic activity in Ov.Cr, possibly mediated [Comparison of the inhibitory capacity of two groups of pure natural extract on the crystallization of two types of material compound urinary stones in vitro study](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MS%26E...92a2025B) the result of an abnormal precipitation within the urinary tract. This precipitation is most often from the normal constituents of the urine. This is a fairly common condition in the population. She is happy and recurrent etiology is often unknown if hypothetical. In Algeria, as in many countries, a large number of patients use herbal medicines in the treatment of their diseases including urolithiasis. Thus the aim of this study is the most widely used to evaluate the effectiveness of aqueous extracts of medicinal plants, in the treatment of calcium urolithiasis oxalo-and magnesium-amoniaco in vitro. The study also examines the effect of these extracts on the states of crystallization (nucleation, crystal growth, crystal aggregation), followed by photography on polarized light microscope.In this regard, we are devoted to studying the crystallization steps from oxalo-calcium and phospho-calcic prepared as artificial urine and supersaturated aqueous solutions, maintained at 37 \u00b0C to remain close to biological conditions. Extracts of the first group of herbs: Ammodaucus leucotrichus, Ajuga calcium oxalate, we cite the Ammodaucus leucotrichus which acts on the stages of nucleation, growth and the aggregation with a total inhibition. The second group of extracts plants tested on calcium significantly reduce phosphate crystallization in vitro. It is easily proved by FTIR and optical microscope. In conclusion the results of our work allows us to confirm the use of these plants as an aqueous decoction, in the field of urolithiasis. These activities may help to strengthen the body in depressed situations. [Tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I) hydrogen oxalate-oxalic acid-acetonitrile L.; M\u00fcller, Peter 2013-01-01 In the title compound, [Cu(CH3CN)4](C2HO4)\u00b70.5C2H2O4\u00b70.5CH3CN, the CuI ion is coordinated by the N atoms of four acetonitrile ligands in a slightly distorted tetrahedral environment. The oxalic acid molecule lies across an inversion center. The acetonitrile solvent molecule is disordered across an inversion center and was refined with half occupancy. In the crystal, the hydrogen oxalate anions and oxalic acid molecules are linked via O\u2014HO hydrogen bonds, forming chains along [010].

In this method, a homogeneous solution comprising KP, calcium chloride, ammonia, and alcohol) (PVAPS, degree of saponification: 86.5-89.0 mol %) was used as the precursor solution and was exposed to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation for different time periods. Thermogravimetric analysis of the obtained xerogels showed that increasing the UV irradiation time increased the amount of CaCO3 formed and the complete conversion of calcium ions to calcite was achieved after 50 min of UV irradiation. Furthermore, solid phase analyses suggested that nanometer-to-micron-sized calcite crystals were formed and dispersed in the obtained PVAPS matrix. [Novel organic NLO material bis(N-phenylbiguanidium(1+)) oxalate - A combined X-ray diffraction, DSC and vibrational spectroscopic study of bis(N-phenylbiguanidium(1+)) oxalate are reported, and their characterization is discussed in this paper. The non-centrosymmetric bis(N-phenylbiguanidium(1+)) oxalate (I), which was obtained from an aqueous solution at 313 K, belongs to the monoclinic space group Cc (a = 6.2560(2) \u00c5, 96.249(1)\u00b0, V = \u00c53, Z = 4, R = 0.0314 for 4738 observed reflections). The centrosymmetric bis(N-phenylbiguanidium(1+)) oxalate (II) was obtained from an aqueous solution at 298 K and belongs to the monoclinic space group P21/n (a = 6.1335(3) \u00c5, 95.728(2)\u00b0, V = \u00c53, Z = 4, R = 0.0420 for 2396 observed reflections). The cooling of the centrosymmetric phase (II) leads to the formation of bis(N-phenylbiguanidium(1+)) oxalate (III) (a = 6.1083(2) \u00c5, 93.151(2)\u00b0, V = \u00c53, Z = 4, R = 0.0345 for 2367 observed reflections and a temperature of 110 K), which also belongs to the monoclinic space group P21/n. The crystal structures of the three characterized phases are generally based on layers of isolated N-phenylbiguanidium(1 +) cations separated by oxalate anions and interconnected with them by several types of N-H...O hydrogen bonds. The observed phases generally differ not only in their crystal packing but also in the lengths and characteristics of their hydrogen bonds. The thermal behaviour of the prepared compounds was studied using the DSC method in the temperature range from 90 K up to a temperature near the melting point of each crystal. The bis(N-phenylbiguanidium(1+)) oxalate (II) crystals exhibit weak reversible thermal effects on the DSC curve at 147 K (heating run). Further investigation of this effect, which was assigned to the isostructural phase transformation, was performed using FTIR, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis in a wide temperature range. [Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for analysis of To compare the results of a chemical method of kidney stone analysis with the results of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Kidney stones collected between June and October 2015 were simultaneously analyzed by chemical and FT-IR methods. Kidney stones (n=449) were collected from patients from 1 to 81 years old. Most stones were from adults, with only 11.5% from children (aged 3-16 years) and 1.5% from children aged <2 years. The male to female ratio was 4.6. In adults, the calcium oxalate stone type, calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM, n=224), was the most common crystal, followed by uric acid and calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD, n=83). In children, the most frequently occurring type was predominantly COD (n=21), followed by COM (n=11), ammonium 22 stones showed ammonium urate (n=2), COM (n=2), and carbonate apatite (n=1) in five stones, while uric acid crystals were detected (n=13) by FT-IR. While chemical analysis identified 3 stones as uric acid and the rest as calcium oxalate only. Agreement between the two methods was moderate, with a kappa statistic of 0.57 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.64). Disagreement was noted in the analysis of 77 stones. FT-IR analysis of kidney stones can overcome many limitations associated with chemical analysis. [Stone clearance after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy in patients with solitary pure calcium oxalate stones smaller than 1.0 cm in the proximal ureter, with special study was to assess stone-free rates following extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) of pure calcium (CaOx) stones in the proximal ureter. The investigators retrospectively examined 53 patients with 5-10 mm pure CaOx stones in the proximal ureter from the medical archives of 593 consecutive patients treated with ESWL. The compositions of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and dihydrate (COD) in a given stone were determined by infrared spectrometry. Stone size, attenuation number and stone-to-skin distance computed tomography (CT). ESWL success was evaluated by stone-free status after the first single session. On average, calculi were 8.0 \u00d7 5.3 mm in size, with an SSD of 11.0 cm. The mean CT attenuation value was 740.1 HU. Attenuation numbers correlated significantly with stone diameter (r = 0.49), but had no correlation with the stone content of COM or COD. A negative correlation was observed between COM and COD content (r = -0.925). With regard to patients' physical characteristics and COM and COD content, no differences were found between study subgroups with stone-free and residual status (n = 38 and 15, respectively). There were also no differences in clinical features between patient subgroups with COM- or COD-predominant stones (n = 22 and 31, respectively). The findings indicated that the differences in COM and COD content of CaOx stones had no impact on stone clearance after ESWL and that a favorable stone-free rate of the stones treated with ESWL may be achieved independently of CaOx hydration. [Transformation A; Alexandra 2010-09-21 Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is a metastable phase often observed during low temperature inorganic synthesis and biomineralization. ACC transforms with aging or heating into a less hydrated form, and with time crystallizes to calcite or aragonite. The energetics of transformation and crystallization of synthetic and biogenic (extracted from California purple sea urchin larval spicules, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) ACC were studied using isothermal solution calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. Transformation and crystallization of ACC can follow an energetically downhill sequence: more metastable hydrated ACC less metastable biogenic anhydrous ACC vaterite aragonite calcite. In a given reaction sequence, not all these phases need to occur. The transformations involve a series of ordering, dehydration, and crystallization processes, each lowering the enthalpy (and free energy) of the system, with crystallization of the dehydrated amorphous material lowering the enthalpy the most. ACC is much more metastable with respect to calcite than the crystalline polymorphs vaterite or aragonite. The anhydrous ACC is less metastable than the hydrated, implying that the structural reorganization during dehydration is exothermic and irreversible. Dehydrated synthetic and anhydrous biogenic ACC are similar in enthalpy. The transformation sequence observed in biomineralization could be mainly energetically driven; the first phase deposited is hydrated ACC, which then converts to anhydrous ACC, and finally crystallizes to calcite. The initial formation of ACC may be a first step in the precipitation of calcite under a wide variety of conditions, including geological CO(2) sequestration. [Novel Peptide with Specific Calcium-Binding Capacity from Calcium Wang, Shaoyun 2016-01-01 Peptide-calcium can probably be a suitable supplement to improve calcium absorption in the human body. In this study, a specific peptide Phe-Tyr (FY) with calcium-binding capacity was purified from Schizochytrium sp. protein hydrolysates through gel filtration chromatography and reversed phase HPLC. The calcium-binding capacity of FY spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy showed that carboxyl groups, amino groups, and amido groups were the major chelating sites. FY-Ca exhibited excellent thermal stability and solubility, which were beneficial to be absorbed and transported in the basic intestinal tract of the human body. Moreover, the calcium bioavailability in Caco-2 cells showed that FY-Ca could enhance calcium uptake efficiency by more than three times when compared with CaCl2, and protect calcium ions against dietary inhibitors, such as tannic acid, oxalate, phytate, and Zn2+. Our findings further the progress of algae-based peptide-calcium, suggesting that FY-Ca has the potential to be developed as functionally nutraceutical additives. PMID:28036002 [The comparability of oxalate excretion and oxalate:creatinine ratio in the investigation of primary hyperoxaluria: review of data from a referral Christopher; Rumsby, Gill 2015-01-01 Urine oxalate measurement is an important investigation in the evaluation of renal stone disease. Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a rare inherited metabolic disease characterised by persistently elevated urine oxalate, but the diagnosis may be missed in adults until renal failure has developed. Urine oxalate results were reviewed to compare oxalate:creatinine ratio and oxalate excretion, and to estimate the potential numbers of undiagnosed PH. Urine oxalate results from August 2011 to April 2013 were reviewed. Oxalate excretion and oxalate:creatinine ratio were evaluated for 24 h collections and ratio alone for spot urine samples. Oxalate:creatinine ratio and oxalate excretion were moderately correlated (R=0.63) in 24-h urine collections from patients aged 18 years and above. Sex-related differences were found requiring implementation of male and female reference ranges for oxalate:creatinine ratio. Of samples with both ratio and excretion above the reference range, 7% came from patients with confirmed PH. There were 24 patients with grossly elevated urine oxalate who had not been evaluated for PH. Oxalate:creatinine ratio and oxalate excretion were discordant in many patients, which is likely to be a result of intra-individual variation in creatinine output and imprecision in the collection itself. Some PH patients had urine oxalate within the reference range on occasion, and therefore it is not possible to exclude PH on the finding of a single normal result. A significant number of individuals had urine oxalate results well above the reference range who potentially have undiagnosed PH and are consequently at risk of renal failure. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

Only calcite, the most stable polymorph, was crystallized at hydraulic activity under 10 \u00b0C, whereas aragonite also started to crystallize over 10 \u00b0C. The crystallization of PCC is more dependent on the hydraulic activity of limestone than CaO content, a factor commonly used to classify limestone ores according to quality. The results could be effectively applied to the determination of polymorphs in synthetic PCC for eco-friendly paper manufacture.

[Enteric oxalate elimination is induced and oxalate is normalized in a mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria following intestinal colonization Oxalobacter colonization of rat intestine was previously shown to promote enteric oxalate secretion and elimination, leading to significant reductions in urinary oxalate excretion (Hatch et al. Kidney Int 69: 691-698, 2006). The main goal of the present study, using a mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), was to test the hypothesis that colonization of the mouse gut by Oxalobacter formigenes could enhance enteric oxalate secretion and effectively reduce the hyperoxaluria associated with this genetic disease. Wild-type (WT) mice and mice deficient in liver alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (Agxt) exhibiting hyperoxalemia and hyperoxaluria were used in these studies. We compared the unidirectional and net fluxes of oxalate across isolated, short-circuited large intestine of artificially colonized and noncolonized mice. In addition, plasma and urinary oxalate was determined. Our results demonstrate that the cecum and distal colon contribute significantly to enteric urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 50% (to within the normal range observed for WT mice). Moreover, plasma oxalate concentrations in Agxt mice were also normalized (reduced 50%). Colonization of WT mice was also associated with marked (up to 95%) reductions in urinary oxalate excretion. We conclude that segment-specific effects of Oxalobacter on intestinal oxalate transport in the PH1 mouse model are associated with a normalization of plasma oxalate and urinary oxalate excretion in otherwise hyperoxalemic and PMID:21163900 [Continuous structural evolution of calcium carbonate particles: double-hydrophilic copolymers, each a nonionic block and an anionic block comprising pendent aromatic sulfonate groups, were used as additives to modify the crystallization of CaCO3. Marked morphological changes in the CaCO3 particles were observed depending on the reaction conditions used. A poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) diblock copolymer was particularly versatile in effecting a morphological change in calcite particles, and a continuous structural transition in the product particles from polycrystalline to mesocrystal to single crystal was observed with variation in the calcium concentration. The existence of this structural sequence provides unique insight into the mechanism of polymer-mediated crystallization. We propose that it reflects continuity in the crystallization mechanism itself, spanning the limits from nonoriented aggregation of nanoparticles to classical ion-by-ion growth. The various pathways to polycrystalline, mesocrystal, and single-crystal particles, which had previously been considered to be distinct, therefore all form part of a unifying crystallization framework based on the aggregation of precursor subunits. [Calcium activation of frog Podolsky, R. J.; Tice, Lois W. 1. Skinned muscle fibres were prepared from the tonus bundle of the frog iliofibularis muscle and the contractile response elicited by applied calcium ions was studied. The fibre type was determined by electron microscopy. 2. Fast fibres shortened many times more rapidly than slow fibres, indicating that the slow contraction of slow fibres is an inherent property of the contractile mechanism. 3. The extent of spread of contraction following local calcium application was much greater in slow than in fast fibres, a difference which is consistent with the relative sparsity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in slow fibres. 4. The ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of slow fibres to accumulate calcium was demonstrated by the in situ immobilization of calcium when oxalate solutions were added calculi in Zhang, Haiying; Li, Ning; Li, Kun; Li, Peng 2014-12-01 Renal calculi formation is one of the most common urological disorders. Urinary stone disease is a common disease, which affects 1012% of the population in industrialized countries. In males, the highest prevalence of the disease occurs between the age of 20 and 40 years, while in females, the highest incidence of the disease occurs later. Previous studies have shown that longterm exposure to oxalate is toxic to renal epithelial cells and results in oxidative stress. In the present study, a methanolic extract of aerial parts of Urtica dioica was screened for antiurolithiatic activity against ethylene glycol and ammonium chlorideinduced calcium oxalate renal stones in male rats. In the control rats, ethylene glycol and ammonium chloride administration was observed to cause an increase in urinary calcium, oxalate and creatinine levels, as well as an increase in renal calcium and oxalate deposition. Histopathological observations revealed calcium oxalate microcrystal deposits in the kidney sections of the rats treated with ethylene glycol and ammonium chloride, indicating the induction of lithiasis. In the test rats, treatment with the methanolic extract of Urtica dioica was found to decrease the elevated levels of urinary calcium, oxalate and creatinine, and significantly decrease the renal deposition of calcium and oxalate. Furthermore, renal histological observations revealed a significant reduction in calcium oxalate crystal deposition in the test rats. Phytochemical analysis of the Urtica dioica extract was also performed using liquid chromatographyelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection, to determine the chemical composition of the extract. The eight chemical constituents identied in the extract were protocatechuic acid, salicylic acid, luteolin, rutin, of calcium carbonate: role of the e.g. from Sycon raphanus, are composed of almost pure calcium carbonate. In order to elucidate the formation of those structural skeletal elements, the function of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), isolated from this species, during the in vitro calcium carbonate-based spicule formation, was investigated. It is shown that the recombinant sponge CA substantially accelerates calcium carbonate formation in the in vitro diffusion assay. A stoichiometric calculation revealed that the turnover rate of the sponge CA during the calcification process amounts to 25 CO2s(-1) \u00d7 molecule CA(-1). During this enzymatically driven process, initially pat-like particles are formed that are subsequently transformed to rhomboid/rhombohedroid crystals with a dimension of ~50 m. The CA-catalyzed particles are smaller than those which are formed in the absence of the enzyme. The Martens hardness of the particles formed is ~4 GPa, a value which had been determined for other biogenic calcites. This conclusion is corroborated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which revealed that the particles synthesized are composed predominantly of the elements calcium, oxygen and carbon. Surprising was the finding, obtained by light and scanning electron microscopy, that the newly formed calcitic crystals associate with the calcareous spicules from S. raphanus in a highly ordered manner; the calcitic crystals almost perfectly arrange in an array orientation along the two opposing planes of the spicules, leaving the other two plane arrays uncovered. It is concluded that the CA is a key enzyme controlling the calcium carbonate biomineralization process, which directs the newly formed particles to existing calcareous spicular structures. It is expected that with the given tools new bioinspired materials can be fabricated. Copyright \u00a9 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. [Crystal structure analysis reveals Pseudomonas PilY1 as an essential calcium-dependent regulator of bacterial surface motility](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1002712-crystal-structure-analysis-reveals-pseudomonas-pily1-essential-calcium-dependent-regulator-bacterial-surface-motility) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search) Orans, Jillian; Johnson, Michael D.L.; Coggan, Kimberly A. pathogens require the 'twitching' motility produced by filamentous type IV pili (T4P) to establish and maintain human infections. Two cytoplasmic ATPases function as an oscillatory motor that powers twitching motility via cycles of pilus extension and retraction. The regulation of this motor, however, has remained a mystery. We present the 2.1 {angstrom} resolution crystal structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa pilus-biogenesis factor PilY1, and identify a single site on this protein required for bacterial translocation. The structure reveals a modified {beta}-propeller fold and a distinct EF-hand-like calcium-binding site conserved in with retractile that preventing calciummore \u00bb binding by PilY1 using either an exogenous calcium chelator or mutation of a single residue disrupts Pseudomonas twitching motility by eliminating surface pili. In contrast, placing a lysine in this site to mimic the charge of a bound calcium interferes with motility in the opposite manner - by producing an abundance of nonfunctional surface pili. Our data indicate that calcium binding and release by the unique loop identified in the PilY1 crystal structure controls the opposing forces of pilus extension and retraction. Thus, PilY1 is an essential, calcium-dependent regulator of bacterial twitching motility.\u00ab less [Kidney Stones in To investigate potential differences in stone composition with regard to the type of Primary Hyperoxaluria (PH), and in relation to the patient's medical therapy (treatment na\u00efve patients versus those on preventive medication) we examined twelve kidney stones from ten PH I and six stones from four PH III patients. Unfortunately, no PH II stones were available for analysis. The study on this set of stones indicates a more diverse composition of PH stones than previously reported and a potential dynamic response of morphology and composition of calculi to treatment with crystallization inhibitors (citrate, magnesium) in PH I. Stones formed by PH I patients under treatment are more compact and consist predominantly of calcium-oxalate monohydrate (COM, whewellite), while calcium-oxalate dihydrate (COD, weddellite) is only rarely present. In contrast, the single stone available from a treatment na\u00efve PH I patient as well as stones from PH III patients prior to and under treatment with alkali citrate contained a wide size range of aggregated COD crystals. No significant effects of the treatment were noted in PH III stones. In disagreement with findings from previous studies, stones from patients with primary hyperoxaluria did not exclusively consist of COM. Progressive replacement of COD by small COM crystals could be caused by prolonged stone growth and residence times in the urinary tract, eventually resulting in complete replacement of calcium-oxalate dihydrate by the monohydrate form. The noted difference to the na\u00efve PH I stone may reflect a reduced growth rate in response to treatment. This pilot study highlights the importance of detailed stone diagnostics and could be of therapeutic relevance in calcium-oxalates urolithiasis, provided that the effects of treatment can be reproduced in subsequent larger studies. PMID:23940605 [Transformation and crystallization energetics A.; Alexandra 2010-01-01 Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is a metastable phase often observed during low temperature inorganic synthesis and biomineralization. ACC transforms with aging or heating into a less hydrated form, and with time crystallizes to calcite or aragonite. The energetics of transformation and crystallization of synthetic and biogenic (extracted from California purple sea urchin larval spicules, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) ACC were studied using isothermal solution calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. Transformation and crystallization of ACC can follow an energetically downhill sequence: more metastable hydrated ACC anhydrous ACCvaterite aragonite calcite. In a given reaction sequence, not all these phases need to occur. The transformations involve a series of ordering, dehydration, and crystallization processes, each lowering the enthalpy (and free energy) of the system, with crystallization of the dehydrated amorphous material lowering the enthalpy the most. ACC is much more metastable with respect to calcite than the crystalline polymorphs vaterite or aragonite. The anhydrous ACC is less metastable than the hydrated, implying that the structural reorganization during dehydration is exothermic and irreversible. Dehydrated synthetic and anhydrous biogenic ACC are similar in enthalpy. The transformation sequence observed in biomineralization could be mainly energetically driven; the first phase deposited is hydrated ACC, which then converts to anhydrous ACC, and finally crystallizes to calcite. The initial formation of ACC may be a first step in the precipitation of calcite under a wide variety of conditions, including geological CO2 sequestration. PMID:20810918 [Isolation of oxalic acid tolerating fungi and in the pathogenesis by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; it lowers the pH of nearby environment and creates the favorable condition for the infection. In this study we examined the degradation of oxalic acid through oxalate oxidase and biocontrol of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. A survey was conducted to collect the rhizospheric soil samples from Indo-Gangetic Plains of India to isolate the efficient fungal strains able to tolerate oxalic acid. A total of 120 fungal strains were isolated from root adhering soils of different vegetable crops. Out of 120 strains a total of 80 isolates were able to grow at 10 mM of oxalic acid whereas only 15 isolates were grow at 50 mM of oxalic acid concentration. Then we examined the antagonistic activity of the 15 isolates against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. These strains potentially inhibit the growth of the test pathogen. A total of three potential strains and two standard cultures of fungi were tested for the oxalate oxidase activity. Strains S7 showed the maximum degradation of oxalic acid (23 %) after 60 min of incubation with fungal extract having oxalate oxidase activity. Microscopic observation and ITS (internally transcribed spacers) sequencing categorized the potential fungal strains into the Aspergillus, and Trichoderma. Trichoderma sp. are well studied biocontrol agent and interestingly we also found the oxalate oxidase type activity in these strains which further strengthens the potentiality of these biocontrol agents. [[Secondary hyperoxaluria and the case of a 3-year-old boy admitted to the pediatric emergency department for ethylene glycol poisoning. During hospitalization, he presented dysuria associated with crystalluria. Blood tests showed metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap. A renal ultrasound performed a few weeks later revealed bilateral medullary hyperechogenicity. Urine microscopic analysis showed the presence of weddellite crystals. Secondary nephrocalcinosis due to ethylene glycol intoxication was diagnosed. Hyperhydration and crystallization inhibition by magnesium citrate were initiated. Despite this treatment, persistent weddellite crystals and nephrocalcinosis were seen more than 2years after the intoxication. Ethylene glycol is metabolized in the liver by successive oxidations leading to its final metabolite, oxalic acid. Therefore, metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap is usually found following ethylene glycol intoxication. Calcium oxalate crystal deposition may occur in several organs, including the kidneys. The precipitation of calcium oxalate in renal tubules can lead to nephrocalcinosis and acute kidney injury. The long-term renal prognosis is related to chronic tubulointerstitial injury caused by nephrocalcinosis. Treatment of ethylene glycol intoxication is based on specific inhibitors of alcohol dehydrogenase and hemodialysis in the most severe forms, and should be started promptly. Copyright \u00a9 2013.

[Apo And Calcium-Bound Crystal Structures of Alpha-11 Giardin, An Unusual Annexin From 'Giardia Lamblia'](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/909751-apo-calcium-bound-crystal-structures-alpha-giardin-unusual-annexin-from-giardia-lamblia) E.T.; Svard, alpha-giardin family in the intestinal protozoan, Giardia lamblia. This gene family shares an ancestry with the annexin super family, whose common characteristic is calcium-dependent binding to membranes that contain acidic phospholipids. Several alpha giardins are highly expressed during parasite-induced diarrhea in humans. Despite being a member of a large family of proteins, little is known about the function and cellular localization of alpha-11 giardin, although giardins are often associated with the cytoskeleton. It has been shown that Giardia exhibits high levels of alpha-11 giardin mRNA transcript throughout its life cycle; however, constitutivemore \u00bb over-expression of this protein is lethal to the parasite. Determining the three-dimensional structure of an alpha-giardin is essential to identifying functional domains shared in the alpha-giardin family. Here we report the crystal structures of the apo and Ca{sup 2+}-bound forms of alpha-11 giardin, the first alpha giardin to be characterized structurally. Crystals of apo and Ca{sup alpha-11 giardin diffracted to 1.1 crystal structure of selenium-substituted apo alpha-11 giardin reveals a planar array of four tandem repeats of predominantly {alpha}-helical domains, reminiscent of previously determined annexin structures, making this the highest-resolution structure of an annexin to date. The apo alpha-11 giardin structure also reveals a hydrophobic core formed between repeats I/IV and II/III, a region typically hydrophilic in other annexins. Surprisingly, the Ca{sup 2+}-bound structure contains only a single calcium ion, located in the DE loop of repeat I and coordinated differently from the two types of calcium sites observed in previous annexin structures. The apo and Ca{sup 2+}-bound alpha-11 giardin crystallized in [Calcium Carbonate Crystal Growth in Porous Media, in the presence of Water Miscible and Non-Miscible Organic of sparingly soluble salts (scaling) within porous media is a major problem encountered in many industrial and environmental applications. In the oil industry scaling causes severe operational malfunctions and, therefore, increasing the total operating and maintenance cost [1]. The most common types of sparingly soluble salts located in oil fields include carbonate and sulfate salts of calcium, strondium and barium[1,2]. Multiple phase flow and tubing surface properties are some of the factors affecting scale formation [3]. The main purpose of the present work was the investigation of the precipitation mechanisms of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) through in situ mixing of two soluble salt solutions in a flow granular medium, in the presence of water miscible organic fluid (ethylene glycol) or non-miscible organic fluid (n-dodecane). All series of experiments were carried out in a two dimensional porous medium made of Plexiglas. For all solutions used in the experiments, the contact angles with the surface of the porous medium and the interfacial tensions were measured. During the experiments, the calcium carbonate crystal growth was continuously monitored and recorded through an optical microscope equipped with a digital programmed video camera. The snap-shots were taken within specific time intervals and their detailed procession gave information concerning the crystal growth rate and kinetics. The pH of the effluent was measured and fluids samples were collected for calcium analysis using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). In all experiments effluent calcium concentration decreased as a function of time, suggesting that CaCO3 precipitation took place inside the porous medium. Crystals of the precipitated salt were identified using Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) and the morphology of the crystals was examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The induction time for precipitation of CaCO3 crystals in the presence of n-dodecane was significantly [Two novel FeII-oxalate architectures: Solvent-free synthesis, structures, thermal and magnetic [NASA Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Li, Jin-Hua; Li; Wang, Guo-Ming 2015-10-01 Two novel FeII-oxalate framework with the formulas of [NH4][FeIILi3(C2O4)3] (1) and [NH4]2[FeII(C2O4)2]\u00b7H2O (2) have been prepared by an oxalic acid flux approach and structurally characterized by IR, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction. Heterometallic compound 1 displays a three-dimensional (3D) framework with a pto topology, while homometallic compound 2 features a pillar-layer architecture with a hms topology. Thermal analysis indicates that the two compounds can be stable up to 300 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C, respectively. Magnetic investigations suggest that the FeII ions in 1 and 2 exhibit weak magnetic exchange interactions. [Probiotics and Other Key Determinants of Al-Wahsh, Ismail A. 2011-01-01 Oxalate is a common component of many foods of plant origin, including nuts, fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes, and is typically present as a salt of oxalic acid. Because virtually all absorbed oxalic acid is excreted in the urine and hyperoxaluria is known to be a considerable risk factor for urolithiasis, it is important to understand the factors that have the potential to alter the efficiency of oxalate absorption. Oxalate bioavailability, a term that has been used to refer to that portion of food-derived oxalate that is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), is estimated to range from 2 to 15% for different foods. Oxalate bioavailability appears to be decreased by concomitant food ingestion due to interactions between oxalate and coingested food components that likely result in less oxalic acid remaining in a soluble form. There is a lack of consensus in the literature as to whether efficiency of oxalate absorption is dependent on the proportion of total dietary oxalate that is in a soluble form. However, studies that directly compared foods of varying soluble oxalate contents have generally supported the proposition that the amount of soluble oxalate in food is an important determinant of oxalate bioavailability. Oxalate degradation by oxalate-degrading bacteria within the GIT is another key factor that could affect oxalate absorption and degree of oxaluria. Studies that have assessed the efficacy of oral ingestion of probiotics that provide bacteria with oxalate-degrading capacity have led to promising but generally mixed results, and this remains a fertile area for future studies. PMID:22332057 [Patho-physiological evaluation of Duranta erecta disorder of the urinary system affecting 10-15% of the general population. In recent years, search for new antilithiatic drugs from natural sources has assumed greater importance. This study was performed to investigate the anti-urolithiatic activity of methanolic extract of Duranta erecta leaves by in vitro and in vivo analysis. The study was designed to determine presence of phytochemicals in D. erecta, its yield in percentage, antioxidant activity against 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and anti-microbial property against few bacteria. In vitro analysis was carried out study anti-urolithiatic property of D. erecta by nucleation assay and synthetic urine assay for inhibition of calcium oxalate and calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals formation. An in vivo experiment was performed on Wistar rats for confirmation of anti-urolithiatic property of D. erecta in animal model. D. erecta has the presence of primary and erecta gave a very good yield (60%). D. erecta proved its antioxidant potential by 93.51% inhibition of DPPH radical at a concentration of 1000 g/mL where ascorbic showed 94.71% of DPPH radical at the same concentration. In vitro tests like nucleation assay and synthetic urine assay showed that D. erecta inhibits formation of calcium oxalate and calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. It also showed the anti-microbial property by formation of zone of inhibition against few bacteria. An in vivo experiment on Wistar rat animal model confirmed the anti-urolithiatic property of D. erecta L. leaves extract. Based on the results, we reported that D. erecta may treat calcium oxalate crystal deposition in the kidney by preventing hyperoxaluria-induced peroxidative damage to the renal tubular membrane surface (lipid peroxidation). It has anti-microbial potential so it may also [Toxic thought to be a key factor of the early pathogenic stage in a wide range of necrotrophic fungi. We have recently published that oxalic acid induces Programmed Cell Death (PCD) in Arabidopsis thaliana cells. This cell death results from an early anionic efflux which is a prerequisite for the synthesis of ethylene and the PCD. Complementary experiments have been carried out by using seedlings of A. thaliana. The effects of millimolar concentrations of oxalic acid were analysed on A. thaliana seedlings. A treatment with a 3 mM oxalic acid solution does not alter the development of the plants but induces the transcription of defence related genes which are anion channel dependant. Moreover, our results suggest that a pre-treatment of the seedlings with oxalic acid is able to confer the resistance of A. thaliana against Sclerotium rolfsii. Regarding our results, we suggest that oxalic acid plays two distinct roles, depending on the concentration: a high concentration of oxalic acid induces a large PCD and then contribute to the progression of the fungi. However, at low concentration it is able to induce the establishment of a resistance of the plant against the fungi. PMID:19704845 [Prediction of calcium level in melamine-related urinary calculi with Chen 2012-06-01 The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between CT-attenuation and stone calcium level in melamine-related urinary calculi (MRUC). A total of 25 MRUC with known composition and calcium level were included (11 uric acid stones, 2 calcium oxalate stones and 12 mixture stones of uric acid and calcium oxalate). Of all, 18 renal stones accepted alkalization therapy except for 5 lower urinary tract stones and 2 stones of unknown position. With well-matched composition, 61 adult urinary stones were included as controls. Every stone was scanned by helical CT (80 kV/120 kV, 300 mA, pitch 0.625 mm) and the highest CT-attenuation value measured. CT-attenuation values of MRUC increased gradually from uric acid stones, mixture stones to calcium oxalate stones, but were always lower than the values of controls. Furthermore, a strong positive correlation was found between stone CT-attenuation value and stone calcium level (n = 25, r (80kV) = 0.883, p = 0.000; r (120kV) = 0.855, p = 0.000). Compared with alkalization-therapy-alone group, stone CT-attenuation values and stone calcium level in the comprehensive-therapy group were significantly greater (CT(80kV) 1,057 \u00b1 639 vs. \u00b1 61 HU, 0.001; CT(120kV) 783 \u00b1 476 vs. 162 Ca 19.83 1.30 \u00b1 1.51%, p = 0.000). Fisher's exact test suggested that the stones with higher CT-attenuation values tended to resist alkalization when 400 HU served as the cutoff value (P (80kV) = 0.002, P (120kV) = 0.000). In conclusion, the study was the first to illustrate that the CT-attenuation value could reflect calcium level in MRUC and found that stones with higher CT-attenuation value were not amenable to alkalization because they probably contained greater calcium. For those patients, we believe that comprehensive therapy will be the best choice.

In fact, the composition, macrostructure and microstructure of the calculus will clearly depend on the factors that have induced it. For this reason, the appropriate study and classification of the renal calculi simplifies the diagnosis and allows a more effective therapeutic approach since it can be oriented to directly correct the etiological factors responsible for stone formation. In this article, we review the main etiological factors involved in the formation of each type of calculus and the prophylactic measures that can be adopted for proper correction. The most frequent kidney stones have been classified into the following types: Occasionally, however, the calculus is not available for study, in which case the only way forward is to use all available information (clinical history, life habits, radiological data), together with basic biochemical information, to identify and correct all etiological factors related to renal lithiasis that have been identified.

The porous surface of nanostructured TiO2 provides an ideal substrate for CaP crystallization. The compositions of CaP coatings are studied using X-ray absorption near-edge structures (XANES) at the Ca K-edge. Using detection modes with different probing depths, both the surface of the CaP coating and the CaP-TiO2 interface are simultaneously analyzed. Calcium phosphate (CaP) species, such as hydroxyapatite (HAp), octacalcium phosphate (Ca8(HPO4)2(PO4)4\u00b75H2O, OCP), brushite (CaHPO4\u00b72H2O, DCPD), and amorphous calcium (ACP), found in the CaP coatings. TiO2 nanotubes of amorphous and anatase phases are comparatively studied to determine their effect on the efficiency of CaP formation and the phase transformation among CaP species in prolonged deposition time. It is found the composition of CaP coating has a strong dependency on the crystal structure of TiO2 substrate and the kinetics (deposition time).

Zinc oxalate nanoparticles in different size and shapes were electrodeposited by electrolysis of a zinc plate anode in sodium oxalate aqueous solutions. It was foundmore \u00bb that the size and shape of the product could be tuned by electrolysis voltage, oxalate ion concentration, and stirring rate of electrolyte solution. A Taguchi orthogonal array design was designed to identify the optimal experimental conditions. The morphological characterization of the product was carried out by scanning electron microscopy.

The TG-DTA studies of the nanoparticles indicated that the main thermal degradation occurs in two steps over a temperature range of 350-430 \u00b0C.

Usually, CaP coatings on metallic substrates are crystallized by annealing at temperatures of at least 400-600 degrees C. For polymeric substrates, this annealing is not possible due to the low melting temperatures. In this work, we present a more suitable method for obtaining crystalline coatings on polymeric substrates, namely laser crystallization. We were successful in obtaining hydroxyapatite coatings on polyethylene. Because of the UV transmission characteristics of the CaP coatings, the use of a low wavelength (157 nm) F(2) laser was necessary for this. As a result of the laser treatment, the CaP coating broke up into islands. The cracks between the islands became larger and the surface became porous with increasing laser energy. The mechanism behind the formation of this morphology did not become clear. However, the fact that crystalline CaP coatings can be obtained on polymeric substrates in an easy way, possibly allows for the development of new products. [[Calcium and magnesium concentrations in the cortex, medulla, and papilla of human kidney from 32 so-called healthy patients and from eleven patients with calcium-oxalate lithiasis were determined by atom-absorption spectralphotometry. A positive calcium gradient with the highest calcium concentration in the papilla was found in all kidneys. Compared to the control group, that calcium concentration in the lithiasic kidneys was reduced by 50% in the papilla, but in the cortex and medulla, the levels were the same. A relative depletion of calcium in the papilla in hypercalciuria goes against the theory that the papilla is the main center of development of calcium-containing stones. The magnesium concentration was practically the same in cortex, medulla, and papilla, and no significant difference was found between lithiasic and healthy kidneys. These findings underline the central role of calcium in the genesis of calcium-containing stones. [Mineralogy and chemistry of urinary stones: patients from North Jordan.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18064405) Abboud, Iyad Ahmed 2008-10-01 Urinary stone diseases are increasing in the Middle East. The majority of urinary stone cases are found in the northern part of the country. Stone samples taken from patients living in the Irbid area were collected from Princess Basma Hospital. The present study concentrates on the mineralogical and chemical composition of the urinary stones and on the effective environmental factors that assist in developing the different types of urinary stones. Using X-ray diffraction techniques, the mineralogical composition of the urinary stones was found to be as follows: oxalate, cholesten, and uric acid, with cystine stones occuring more frequently than the others. Cholesten and calcium oxalate stones are the most dominant types of stones. Calcium oxalate is the most common type of oxalate stone. Calcium oxalate is represented in: whewellite, wheddellite, and calcium carbonate oxalate hydrate minerals, in addition to other minerals such as brushite, ammonium phosphate, vaterite, valleriite, and bobierrite from other types of stones. Bobierrite (phosphate group) is a new mineral reported in urinary stones, and this has not been determined in any previous study worldwide. Apatite (calcium phosphate) is deduced using scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The SEM technique determined crystal forms and systems, shapes, morphological features, and the names of the minerals forming urine stones, while optical properties are studied by polarizing microscope. X-ray fluorescence technique determined the concentrations of major and some trace elements. It revealed that Ca is the main constituent of the urinary stones, especially those composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. The concentration of trace elements was Ba = 1.57, P = 3.61, Fe = 1.78, S = 2.08, Zr = 4.63, Mo = 3.92, Cu = 1.89, Co = 1.56, and F = 4.2% and was higher in the urinary stones of Jordanian patients than in foreigners in the country.

At the Savannah River Site (SRS), oxalic acid is currently considered the preferred agent for chemically cleaning the large underground Liquid Radioactive Waste Tanks. It is applied only in the final stages of emptying a tank when generally less than 5,000 kg of waste solids remain, and slurrying based removal methods are no-longer effective. The use of oxalic acid is preferred because of its combined dissolution and chelating properties, as well as the fact that corrosion to the carbon steel tank walls can be controlled. Although oxalic acid is the preferred agent, there are significant potential downstream impacts. Impacts include:more \u00bb (1) Degraded evaporator operation; (2) Resultant oxalate precipitates taking away critically needed operating volume; and (3) Eventual creation of significant volumes of additional feed to salt processing. As an alternative to dealing with the downstream impacts, oxalate decomposition using variations of ozone based Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) were investigated. In general AOPs use ozone or peroxide and a catalyst to create hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radicals have among the highest oxidation potentials, and are commonly used to decompose organics. Although oxalate is considered among the most difficult organic to decompose, the ability of hydroxyl radicals to decompose oxalate is considered to be well demonstrated. In addition, as AOPs are considered to be 'green' their use enables any net chemical additions to the waste to be minimized. In order to test the ability to decompose the oxalate and determine the decomposition rates, a test rig was designed, where 10 vol% ozone would be educted into a spent oxalic acid decomposition loop, with the loop maintained at 70 C and recirculated at 40L/min. Each of the spent oxalic acid streams would be created from three oxalic acid strikes of an F-area simulant (i.e., Purex = high Fe/Al concentration) and H-area simulant (i.e., H area modified Purex = high Al/Fe concentration) after [Equilibrium aluminium hydroxo-oxalate phases H conditions necessary for initial clay formation have been studied in different model systems comprising different organic acids besides Si and Al. In the present paper the solid phases and the precipitation boundary characterizing the subsystem H +-Al 3+-oxalic acid (H 2L) are discussed. pH and tyndallometric measurements were performed in an ionic medium of 0.6 M Na(Cl) at 25 \u00b0C. The two phases Al 3(OH) 7(C 2O 4) \u00b7 3H 2O (phase II) determine the precipitation boundary. The following formation constants for the two phases were deduced: lg1 in the range [ Al] tot 10 -4.4moldm-3,[ H2C2O4] tot 10 -4.9moldm-3 and at pH < 6.8, thus being a possible precipitate in oxalic-rich natural waters. The more soluble sodium phase is unlikely to exist in natural waters. The two phases are metastable relative to crystalline gibbsite and may be considered as the first precipitation step in the transition from aqueous Al oxalates down to stable Al hydroxide. Model calculations illustrating these competing hydrolysis-complexation reactions are discussed in terms of predominance and speciation diagrams. The solid phases have been characterized by X-ray analysis of powders, TGA and IR spectra, and tentative structures are proposed. Phase I seems to be an octahedral layer structure, in which 3/5 of the octahedral sites between two close packed oxygen sheets are occupied by Al 3+ and the oxalate ion acts as a bridge ligand between two aluminium atoms. Phase II forms a more open sheet structure and has ion exchange properties. Powder data for a phase crystallized from the studied solution after a year are also presented. This phase, Na 4Al 2(OH) 2(C 2O 4) 4 \u00b7 10H 2O, supports the results from the equilibrium analysis of recent solution data by SJ\u00f6BERG and \u00d6HMAN (1985), who have found the dinuclear [Analytical precision of the Urolizer for the determination of the BONN-Risk-Index (BRI) for calcium oxalate urolithiasis and evaluation of the influence of 24-h urine storage at moderate temperatures on BRI.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19222375) Berg, Wolfgang; Bechler, Robin; Laube, Norbert 2009-01-01 Since its first publication in 2000, the BONN-Risk-Index (BRI) has been successfully used to determine the calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystallization risk from urine samples. To date, a BRI-measuring device, the \"Urolizer\", has been developed, operating automatically and requiring only a minimum of preparation. Two major objectives were pursued: determination of Urolizer precision, and determination of the influence of 24-h urine storage at moderate temperatures on BRI. 24-h urine samples from 52 CaOx stone-formers were collected. A total of 37 urine samples were used for the investigation of Urolizer precision by performing six independent BRI determinations in series. In total, 30 samples were taken for additional investigation of urine storability. Each sample was measured thrice: directly after collection, after 24-h storage at T=21 degrees C, and after 24-h cooling at T=4 degrees C. Outcomes were statistically tested for identity with regard to the immediately obtained results. Repeat measurements for evaluation of Urolizer precision revealed statistical identity of data (p-0.05). 24-h storage of urine at both tested temperatures did not significantly affect BRI (p-0.05). The pilot-run Urolizer shows high analytical reliability. The innovative analysis device may be especially suited for urologists specializing in urolithiasis treatment. The possibility for urine storage at moderate temperatures without loss of analysis quality further demonstrates the applicability of the BRI method. [Total and soluble oxalate content of some Indian spices.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22492273) Ghosh Das, Sumana; Savage, G P 2012-06-01 Spices, such as cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander and turmeric are used all over the world as flavouring and colouring ingredients in Indian foods. Previous studies have shown that spices contain variable amounts of total oxalates but there are few reports of soluble oxalate contents. In this study, the total, soluble and insoluble oxalate contents of ten different spices commonly used in Indian cuisine were measured. Total oxalate content ranged from 194 (nutmeg) to 4,014 (green cardamom) mg/100 g DM, while the soluble oxalate contents ranged from 41 (nutmeg) to 3,977 (green cardamom) mg/100 g DM. Overall, the percentage of soluble oxalate content of the spices ranged from 4.7 to 99.1% of the total oxalate content which suggests that some spices present no risk to people liable to kidney stone formation, while other spices can supply significant amounts of soluble oxalates and therefore should be used in moderation. [Severe periodontitis in a patient with hyperoxaluria and oxalosis: a case report and excessive urinary oxalate excretion that can be primary or secondary. Hyperoxaluria can result in chronic renal disease and renal failure. Calcium oxalate crystals can be deposited in oral tissues, and the disease can be associated with severe periodontitis and tooth loss. The periodontal condition of a 38-year-old patient with a diagnosis of hyperoxaluria and end-stage renal disease is presented. The patient's periodontal status was monitored over a period of several weeks, and extracted teeth were submitted for histopathologic evaluation. The patient was diagnosed with generalized severe periodontitis and external root resorption. Initial periodontal treatment consisting of oral-hygiene instructions and scaling and root planing was performed. However, despite an initial decrease of soft tissue inflammation, the patient's periodontal condition deteriorated, and eventually, all teeth had to be extracted. The deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the periodontal tissues was confirmed histologically. Long-standing hyperoxaluria can be associated with severe periodontitis and external root resorption resulting in tooth loss. The pathogenetic mechanisms of hard tissue destruction are still unclear. [Atmospheric production of oxalic acid/oxalate and nitric acid/nitrate in the dominant dicarboxylic acid (DCA), and it constitutes up to 50% of total atmospheric DCAs, especially in non-urban and marine atmospheres. A significant amount of particulate H 2Ox/oxalate (Ox) occurred in the coarse particle fraction of a dichotomous sampler, the ratio of oxalate concentrations in the PM 10 to PM 2.5 fractions ranged from 1 to 2, with mean\u00b1sd being 1.4\u00b10.2. These results suggest that oxalate does not solely originate in the gas phase and condense into particles. Gaseous H 2Ox concentrations are much lower than particulate Ox concentrations and are well correlated with HNO 3, HCHO, and O 3, supporting a photochemical origin. Of special relevance to the Bay Region Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (BRACE) is the extent of nitrogen deposition in the Tampa Bay estuary. Hydroxyl radical is primarily responsible for the conversion of NO 2 to HNO 3, the latter being much more easily deposited. Hydroxyl radical is also responsible for the aqueous phase formation of oxalic acid from alkenes. Hence, we propose that an estimate of rad OH can be obtained from H 2Ox/Ox production rate and we accordingly show that the product of total oxalate concentration and NO 2 concentration approximately predicts the total nitrate concentration during the same period. [Comprehensive physicochemical studies of a new hybrid material: hydrogen oxalate (AMNPO), and its deuterium analogue have been synthesized and characterized by means of FT-IR, FT-Raman, DSC and single crystal X-ray studies. The DSC measurements and temperature dependence of the IR and Raman spectra in the range 4-295 K show that it undergoes a reversible phase transition at 240 K. At room temperature it crystallizes in noncentrosymmetric space group P21. The unit-cell is built of the 2-amino-4-methyl-3-nitropyridinium cations and oxalate monoanions which are connected via the Nsbnd HO and Osbnd HO hydrogen bonds. The geometrical and hydrogen bond parameters are similar for non-deuterated (at 120 and 293 K) and deuterated compounds (at 90 K). The phase transition is probably a consequence of order-disorder transition inside of hydrogen network. The 6-311G(2d,2p) basis set with B3LYP functional have been used to discuss the structure and vibrational spectra of the studied compound. [A comparison of leaf crystal macropatterns in the two sister genera Piper the first large-scale study comparing leaf crystal macropatterns of the species-rich sister genera Piper and Peperomia. It focuses on identifying types of calcium oxalate crystals and their macropatterns in leaves of both genera. The Piper results are placed in a phylogenetic context to show evolutionary patterns. This information will expand knowledge about crystals and provide specific examples to help study their form and function. One example is the first-time observation of Piper crystal sand tumbling in chlorenchyma vacuoles. Herbarium and fresh leaves were cleared of cytoplasmic content and examined with polarizing microscopy to identify types of crystals and their macropatterns. Selected hydrated herbarium and fresh leaf punches were processed for scanning electron microscopy and x-ray elemental analysis. Vibratome sections of living Piper and Peperomia leaves were observed for anatomical features and crystal movement. Both genera have different leaf anatomies. Piper displays four crystal types in chlorenchyma-crystal sand, raphides, styloids, and druses, whereas Peperomia displays raphides, and prisms. Because of different leaf anatomies and crystal types between the genera, macropatterns are completely different. Crystal macropattern evolution in both is characterized by increasing complexity, and both may use their crystals for light gathering and reflection for efficient photosynthesis under low-intensity light environments. Both genera have different leaf anatomies, types of crystals and crystal macropatterns. Based on Piper crystals associated with photosynthetic tissues and low-intensity light, further study of their function and association with surrounding chloroplasts is warranted, especially active crystal movement. [Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525 Containing an Artificial combinations. Pf (pKCN2) transformant containing oah alone accumulated 19 mM oxalic acid intracellularly but secreted 1.2 mM. However, in the presence of an artificial oxalate operon containing oah and FpOAR (pKCN4) secreted 13.6 mM oxalate in the medium while 3.6 mM remained inside. This transformant solubilized 509 M of phosphorus from rock phosphate in alfisol which is 4.5 fold higher than the secreted 4.8 mM and 5.4 mM oxalic acid, released 329 M and 351 M P, respectively, in alfisol. The integrants showed enhanced root colonization, improved growth and increased P content of Vigna radiata plants. This study demonstrates oxalic acid secretion in P. fluorescens by incorporation of an artificial operon constituted of genes for oxalate synthesis and transport, which imparts mineral phosphate solubilizing ability to the organism leading to enhanced growth and P content of V. radiata in alfisol soil.

In this paper, a combined transport-kinetics model for growth of calcium oxalate crystals is presented. The model is used to parametrically investigate the growth of renal calculi in urine with a focus on the coupled effects of transport and surface reaction on the ionic concentrations at the surface of the crystal and their impact on the resulting growth rates. It is shown that under nominal conditions of low solution supersaturation and low Damkohler number that typically exist on Earth, the surface concentrations of calcium and oxalate approach their bulk solution values in the urine and the growth rate is most likely limited by the surface reaction kinetics. But for higher solution supersaturations and larger Damkohler numbers that may be prevalent in the microgravity environment of Space, the calcium and oxalate surface concentrations tend to shift more towards their equilibrium or saturation values and thus the growth process may be limited by the transport through the medium. Furthermore, parametric numerical studies suggest that changes to the renal biochemistry of astronauts due in space may promote development of renal calculi during long duration space expeditions. [Pre-treatment of soybean plants with calcium stimulates ROS responses and Fouad 2018-01-01 high incidence of white mold caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in a variety of field crops and vegetables, different control strategies are needed to keep the disease under economical threshold. This study assessed the effect of foliar application of a calcium formulation on disease symptoms, oxalic acid production, and on the oxidative stress metabolism in soybean plants inoculated with each of two isolates of the pathogen that have contrasting aggressiveness (HA, highly-aggressive versus WA, weakly-aggressive). Changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in soybean plants inoculated with S. sclerotiorum isolates were assessed at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h post inoculation (hpi). Generation of ROS including hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), anion superoxide (O 2 - ) and hydroxyl radical (OH) was evaluated. Inoculation with the WA isolate resulted in more ROS accumulation compared to the HA isolate. Pre-treatment with the calcium formulation restored ROS production in plants inoculated with the HA isolate. We also noted a marked decrease in oxalic acid content in the leaves inoculated with the HA isolate in presence of calcium, which coincided with an increase in plant ROS production. The expression patterns of genes involved in ROS detoxification in response to the calcium treatments and/or inoculation with S. Sclerotiorum isolates were monitored by RT-qPCR. All of the tested genes showed a higher expression in response to inoculation with the WA isolate. The expression of most genes tested peaked at 6 hpi, which preceded ROS accumulation in the soybean leaves. Overall, these data suggest that foliar application of calcium contributes to a decrease in oxalic acid production and disease, arguably via modulation of the ROS metabolism.

[Increased dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids alter serum fatty acid concentrations and lower risk of urine stone formation in cats.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29073223) Hall, Jean A; Brockman, Jeff A; Jen M; Dennis E 2017-01-01 The lifespan of cats with non-obstructive kidney stones is shortened compared with healthy cats indicating a need to reduce stone formation and minimize chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of increasing dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on urine characteristics. Domestic-short-hair cats (n = 12; mean age 5.6 years) were randomized into two groups and fed one of two dry-cat foods in a cross-over study design. For one week before study initiation, all cats consumed control food that contained 0.07% arachidonic acid (AA), but no eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Group 1 continued eating control food for 56 days. Group 2 was fed test food for 56 days, which was control food plus fish oil and high-AA oil. Test food contained 0.17% AA, 0.09% EPA and 0.18% DHA. After 56 days, cats were fed the opposite food for another 56 days. At baseline and after each feeding period, serum was analyzed for fatty acid concentrations, and urine for specific gravity, calcium concentration, relative-super-saturation for struvite crystals, and a calcium-oxalate-titrimetric test was performed. After consuming test food, cats had increased (all P<0.001) serum concentrations of EPA (173%), DHA (61%), and AA (35%); decreased urine specific gravity (P = 0.02); decreased urine calcium concentration (P = 0.06); decreased relative-super-saturation for struvite crystals (P = 0.03); and increased resistance to oxalate crystal formation (P = 0.06) compared with cats consuming control food. Oxalate crystal formation was correlated with serum calcium concentration (r = 0.41; P<0.01). These data show benefits for reducing urine stone formation in cats by increasing dietary PUFA.

PMID:29073223 [Evolution of post-ESWL residual lithiasis depending on wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is one of the most commonly used procedures for removal of renal calculi from the upper urinary tract, but complete expulsion of the fragments generated is not always achieved. This can lead to new lithiasic episodes, and it is considered that 10-26% of fragmented calculi can undergo regrowth. This in vitro study investigated the influence of fragment and urinary composition on post-ESWL growth of fragments, with the aims of establishing the effect and importance of these parameters, and identifying effective prophylactic measures. Fragments collected from patients immediately following expulsion after ESWL treatment were selected for regrowth experiments. The particles included 24 calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) fragments, 48 calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD), 24 hydroxyapatite (HAP), and 16 uric acid. In all treatments, calculi fragments showed a considerable capacity to induce growth of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. Under normocalciuria conditions, new COM crystals formed; both COM and COD crystals developed under hypercalciuria conditions at a urinary pH < 6.0; and in hypercalciuric conditions and urinary pH > 6.0 both HAP and brushite (BRU) crystals were formed. The highest growth rates were observed for COD calculi fragments under hypercalciuria conditions and at a urinary pH of 6.5, followed by growth on COM and HAP fragments under the same conditions; growth rates under other conditions tested were similar but 10-fold lower. With regard to the role of crystallization inhibitors, phytate exhibited inhibitory effects under all assay conditions. However, citrate had little effect, even at the highest concentration tested (1,000 mg/L). This study demonstrates the importance of avoiding heterogeneous nucleant retention (pre-existing solid microparticles) in renal cavities, as these can act as very efficient inducers of the formation of new calculi, the composition of which is mainly dependant on the urine [Crystal structures of the GCaMP calcium sensor reveal the mechanism of fluorescence signal change and aid rational design.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19098007) Akerboom, L; Eric R 2009-03-06 The genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP2 shows promise for neural network activity imaging, but is currently limited by low signal-to-noise ratio. We describe x-ray crystal structures as well as solution biophysical and spectroscopic characterization of GCaMP2 in the calcium-free dark state, and in two calcium-bound bright states: a monomeric form that dominates at intracellular concentrations observed during imaging experiments and an unexpected domain-swapped dimer with decreased fluorescence. This series of structures provides insight into the mechanism of Ca2+-induced fluorescence change. Upon calcium binding, the calmodulin (CaM) domain wraps around the M13 peptide, creating a new domain interface between CaM and the circularly permuted enhanced green fluorescent protein domain. Residues from CaM alter the chemical environment of the circularly permuted enhanced green fluorescent protein chromophore and, together with flexible inter-domain linkers, block solvent access to the chromophore. Guided by the crystal structures, we engineered a series of GCaMP2 point mutants to probe the mechanism of GCaMP2 function and characterized one mutant with significantly improved signal-to-noise. The mutation is located at a domain interface and its effect on sensor function could not have been predicted in the absence of structural data. [Tris(2-aminoethyl)amine based tripodal urea receptors for oxalate: the encapsulation of divalent oxalate (C2O4(2-)) in a semi-aqueous medium. A single crystal X-ray diffraction study shows that the receptor with 3-cyanophenyl functionality captures a staggered conformer whereas the 3-fluorophenyl functionalized receptor encapsulates a less stable planar conformer. [Late of primary hyperoxaluria after rare autosomal recessive inborn error of the glyoxylate metabolism that is based on absence, deficiency or mislocalization of the liver-specific peroxisomal enzyme alanine:glyoxylate and/or nephrocalcinosis and often early end-stage renal disease (ESRD) accompanied by systemic calcium oxalate crystal deposition. In this report, we describe an adult female patient with only one stone passage before development of ESRD. With unknown diagnosis of PH, the patient received an isolated kidney graft and developed an early onset of graft failure. Although initially presumed as an acute rejection, the biopsy revealed calcium oxalate crystals, which then raised a suspicion of primary hyperoxaluria. The diagnosis was later confirmed by hyperoxaluria, elevated plasma oxalate levels and mutation of the AGXT gene, showing the patient to be compound heterozygous for the c.33_34InsC and c.508G > A mutations. Plasma oxalate levels did not decrease after high-dose pyridoxine treatment. Based on this case report, we would recommend in all patients even with a minor history of nephrolithiasis but progression to chronic renal failure to exclude primary hyperoxaluria before isolated kidney transplantation is considered. [Characterisation of calcium phosphate crystals on calcified human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells vascular calcification (VC) remains the leading cause of death in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD). The process of VC seems likely to be a tightly regulated process where vascular smooth muscle cells are playing a key role rather than just a mere passive precipitation of calcium phosphate. Characterisation of the chemical and crystalline structure of VC was mainly led in patients or animal models with CKD. Likewise, Mg2+ was found to be protective in living cells although a potential role for Mg2+ could not be excluded on crystal formation and precipitation. In this study, the crystal formation and the role of Mg2+ were investigated in an in vitro model of primary human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HAVSMC) with physical techniques. In HAVSMC incubated with increased Ca x Pi medium, only calcium phosphate apatite crystals (CPA) were detected by Micro-Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (\u00b5FTIR) and Field Effect Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) at the cell layer level. Supplementation with Mg2+ did not alter the crystal composition or structure. The crystal deposition was preferentially positioned near or directly on cells as pictured by FE-SEM observations and EDX measurements. Large \u00b5FTIR maps revealed spots of CPA crystals that were associated to the cellular layout. This qualitative analysis suggests a potential beneficial effect of Mg2+ at 5 mM in noticeably reducing the number and intensities of CPA \u00b5FTIR spots. For the first time in a model of HAVSMC, induced calcification led to the formation of the sole CPA crystals. Our data seems to exclude a physicochemical role of Mg2+ in altering the CPA crystal growth, composition or structure. Furthermore, Mg2+ beneficial role in attenuating VC should be linked to an active cellular role. [Sulfate but not thiosulfate reduces calculated and measured urinary ionized calcium and supersaturation: implications for the treatment and thiosulfate (S2O3(2-)) can potentially bind with calcium and decrease kidney stone risk. We modeled the effects of these species on the concentration of ionized calcium (iCa) and on supersaturation (SS) of calcium oxalate (CaOx) and calcium phosphate (CaP), and measured their in vitro effects on iCa and the upper limit of stability (ULM) of these salts. Urine data from 4 different types of stone patients were obtained from the Mayo Nephrology Clinic (Model 1). A second data set was obtained from healthy controls and hypercalciuric stone formers in the literature who had been treated with sodium thiosulfate (STS) (Model 2). The Joint Expert Speciation System (JESS) was used to calculate iCa and SS. In Model 1, these parameters were calculated as a function of sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations. In Model 2, data from pre- and post STS urines were analyzed. ULM and iCa were determined in human urine as a function of sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations. Calculated iCa and SS values for all calcium salts decreased with increasing sulfate concentration. Thiosulfate had no effect on these parameters. In Model 2, calculated iCa and CaOx SS increased after STS treatment, but CaP SS decreased, perhaps due to a decrease in pH after STS treatment. In confirmatory in vitro experiments supplemental sulfate, but not thiosulfate, significantly increased the calcium needed to achieve the ULM of CaP and tended to increase the oxalate needed to reach the ULM of CaOx. Sulfate also significantly decreased iCa in human urine, while thiosulfate had no effect. Increasing urinary sulfate could theoretically reduce CaOx and CaP stone risk. Although STS may reduce CaP stone risk by decreasing urinary pH, it might also paradoxically increase iCa and CaOx SS. As such, STS may not be a viable treatment option for stone disease.

[Oxalate Content of the Li, Wanying; Savage, Geoffrey P. 2015-01-01 The total, soluble and insoluble oxalate contents of the leaves, stems and buds of Good-King-Henry (Blitum Bonus-Henricus) were extracted and measured using HPLC chromatography. The large, mature leaves contained 42% more total oxalate than in the small leaves and the soluble oxalate content of the large leaves was 33% higher than the smaller leaves. Cooking the mixed leaves, stems and buds in boiling water for two minutes significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the total oxalate when compared to the raw plant parts. Pesto sauce made from mixed leaves contained 257 mg total oxalate/100 g fresh weight; this was largely made up of insoluble oxalates (85% of the total oxalate content). Soup made from mixed leaves contained lower levels of total oxalates (44.26 \u00b1 0.49 mg total oxalate/100 g fresh insoluble oxalate made up 49% of the oxalate contents. The levels of oxalates in the Good-King-Henry leaves were high, suggesting that the leaves should be consumed occasionally as a delicacy because of their unique taste rather than as a significant part of the diet. However, the products made from Good-King-Henry leaves indicated that larger amounts could be consumed as the oxalate levels were reduced by dilution and processing.

(JN) [Uric acid lithiasis Calculi in the Sudan contain Uric Acid, 20 per cent in the pure form and 37 per cent mixed with other constituents mainly calcium oxalate. The peak age presentation of urolithiasis is 30-40 years with more prediliction to males than females. An earlier study documented a high incidence of hyperuricaemia in Sudanese people. It is probable that \"voluntary dehydration\" and hyperuricaemia acting together may help in the formation of uric acid stones on the surface of which other crystals mainly calcium oxalate may be deposited to form the bigger calculi which are commonly encountered in this country. [Urinary oxalate to creatinine values for urinary oxalate to creatinine ratios in healthy children aged 6-15 years and to investigate the relationship between their nutritional habits and oxalate excretion. Random urine specimens from 953 healthy children aged 6-15 years were obtained and analyzed for oxalate and creatinine. Additionally, a 24-h dietary recall form was prepared and given to them. The ingredient composition of the diet was calculated. The children were divided into three groups according to age: Group I (69 years, n = 353), Group II (10-12 years, n = 335), and Group III (13-15 years, n = 265). The 95th percentile of the oxalate to creatinine ratio for respectively. The oxalate to creatinine ratio was significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 and Group 3. Urinary oxalate excretion was positively correlated with increased protein intake and negatively correlated with age. A significant positive correlation was determined between urinary oxalate excretion and the proline, serine, protein, and glycine content of diet. Dietary proline intake showed a positive correlation with the urine oxalate to creatinine ratio and was found to be an independent predictor for urinary oxalate. These data lend support to the idea that every country should have its own normal reference values to determine the underlying metabolic risk factor for kidney stone disease since regional variation in the dietary intake of proteins and other nutrients can affect normal urinary excretion of oxalate. [Oxalate quantification in hemodialysate to Background Patients with primary hyperoxaluria (PH) overproduce oxalate which is eliminated via the kidneys. If end stage kidney disease develops they are at high risk for systemic oxalosis, unless adequate oxalate is removed during hemodialysis to equal or exceed ongoing oxalate production. The purpose of this study was to validate a method to measure oxalate removal in this unique group of dialysis patients. Methods Fourteen stable patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PH on hemodialysis were included in the study. Oxalate was measured serially in hemodialysate and plasma samples in order to calculate rates of oxalate removal. Hemodialysis regimens were adjusted according to a given patient's historical oxalate production, amount of oxalate removal at dialysis, residual renal clearance of oxalate, and plasma oxalate levels. Results After a typical session of hemodialysis, plasma oxalate was reduced by 78.4\u00b17.7%. Eight patients performed hemodialysis 6 times a week, two patients 5 times a week and three patients 3 times a week. Combined oxalate removal by hemodialysis and the kidneys was sufficient to match or exceed endogenous oxalate production. After a median period of 9 months, pre-dialysis plasma oxalate was significantly lower than initially (75.1\u00b133.4 mmol/L vs. 54.8\u00b146.6 mmol/L, P=0.02). Conclusion This methodology can be used to individualize the dialysis prescription of PH patients to prevent oxalosis during the time they are maintained on hemodialysis, and to reduce risk of oxalate injury to a transplanted kidney.

On the basis of the differential solubilities of gypsum and anhydrite, a method was developed to remove calcium from the scheelite leaching solution by adding anhydrite as an inoculating crystal. The effects of the reaction time, concentration of the CaSO4 inoculating crystals, and temperature were investigated. With an addition of CaSO4 inoculating crystals at a concentration of 60 g/L, the Ca2+ concentration of the scheelite leaching solution decreased to a low level of approximately 0.76 g/L after 10 h at 70\u00b0C. [Isolation and characterizations of oxalate-binding proteins in the kidney](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22210176-isolation-characterizations-oxalate-binding-proteins-kidney) EAH Sepharose 4B beads were applied. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer 38 forms of 26 unique oxalate-binding kidney proteins were identified. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer 25/26 (96%) of identified proteins had 'L-x(3,5)-R-x(2)-[AGILPV]' domain. -- Abstract: Oxalate-binding proteins are thought to serve as potential modulators of kidney stone formation. However, only few oxalate-binding proteins have been identified from previous studies. Our present study, therefore, aimed for large-scale identification of oxalate-binding proteins in porcine kidney using an oxalate-affinity column containing oxalate-conjugated EAH Sepharose electrophoresis (2-DE) tomore \u00bb resolve the recovered proteins. Comparing with those obtained from the controlled column containing uncoupled EAH-Sepharose 4B (to subtract the background of non-specific bindings), a total of 38 protein spots were defined as oxalate-binding proteins. These protein spots were successfully identified by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) and/or tandem MS (MS/MS) as 26 unique proteins, including several nuclear proteins, mitochondrial proteins, oxidative stress regulatory proteins, metabolic enzymes and others. Identification of oxalate-binding domain using the PRATT tool revealed 'L-x(3,5)-R-x(2)-[AGILPV]' as a functional domain responsible for oxalate-binding in 25 of 26 (96%) unique identified proteins. We report herein, for the first time, large-scale identification and characterizations of oxalate-binding proteins in the kidney. The presence of positively charged arginine residue in the middle of this functional domain suggested its significance for binding to the negatively charged oxalate. These data will enhance future stone research, particularly on stone [Effect of cocrystallization techniques on compressional superior stability to humidity over caffeine, but compressional behavior is not studied yet. To compare compressional properties of caffeine/oxalic acid 2:1 cocrystal obtained by different cocrystallization techniques. Cocrystal was obtained by solvent precipitation and ultrasound assisted solution cocrystallization (USSC) and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Compaction study was carried out at different compaction forces. Compact crushing strength, thickness and elastic recovery were determined. Compaction was in order, caffeine > solvent precipitation cocrystal > USSC cocrystal. Caffeine exhibited sticking and lamination, where solvent precipitation compacts showed advantage. Caffeine and solvent precipitation compacts showed sudden drop in compactability, higher elastic recovery with severe lamination at 20,000 N. This was due to overcompaction. Crystal habit of two cocrystal products was same, but USSC cocrystals were difficult to compact. Uniform needle shaped USSC cocrystals must be difficult to orient in different direction and fracture during compression. Elastic recovery of USSC cocrystals was also more compared to other powders indicating less fracture and poor bonding between particles resulting in poor compaction. Cocrystal formation did not improve compressional property of caffeine. Cocrystals exposed to different crystallization environments in two techniques may have resulted in generation of different surface properties presenting different compressional properties. [Nanoscale Confinement Controls the Crystallization of feature of biomineralization processes is that they take place within confined volumes, in which the local environment can have significant effects on mineral formation. Herein, we investigate the influence of confinement on the formation mechanism and structure of calcium phosphate (CaP). This is of particular relevance to the formation of dentine and bone, structures of which are based on highly mineralized collagen fibrils. CaP was precipitated within 25-300 nm diameter, cylindrical pores of track etched and anodised alumina membranes under physiological conditions, in which this system enables systematic study of the effects of the pore size in the absence of a structural match between the matrix and the growing crystals. Our results show that the main products were polycrystalline hydroxapatite (HAP) rods, together with some single crystal octacalcium phosphate (OCP) rods. Notably, we demonstrate that these were generated though an intermediate amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) phase, and that ACP is significantly stabilised in confinement. This effect may have significance to the mineralization of bone, which can occur through a transient ACP phase. We also show that orientation of the HAP comparable, or even superior to that seen in bone can be achieved through confinement effects alone. Although this simple experimental system cannot be considered, a direct mimic of the in vivo formation of ultrathin HAP platelets within collagen fibrils, our results show that the effects of physical confinement should not be neglected when considering the mechanisms of formation of structures, such as bones and teeth.

Copyright \u00a9 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH Apart from digestive enzymes, pancreatic juice contains several proteins that are not directly involved in digestion. One of these, lithostathine, has been reported to exhibit calcite crystal inhibitor activity in vitro. As pancreatic juice is supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate, it was hypothesized that lithostathine stabilizes pancreatic juice. Lithostathine is cleaved by trace amounts of trypsin, resulting in a C-terminal polypeptide and an N-terminal undecapeptide, which has been identified as the active site of lithostathine regarding crystal inhibition. We produced rat lithostathine in a baculovirus expression system. In order to test its functional activity, the protein was purified using a nondenaturing multi-step procedure. In the low micromolar range, recombinant rat lithostathine in vitro exhibited calcite crystal inhibitor activity, confirming earlier reports. Limited tryptic proteolysis of recombinant lithostathine was performed, and the two cleavage products were separated; the C-terminal polypeptide was precipitated by centrifugation, and the N-terminal undecapeptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Only the C-terminal peptide displayed measurable calcite crystal inhibitory activity. Furthermore, synthetic undecapeptides with identical sequence to the N-terminal undecapeptides of rat or human lithostathine were inactive. However, when tested in the same in vitro assays, other pancreatic or extra-pancreatic proteins show inhibitory activity in the same concentration range as lithostathine, and inorganic phosphate is active as well. Based on these findings it seems unlikely that lithostathine is a physiologically relevant calcite crystal inhibitor. The name \"lithostathine\" is therefore inappropriate, and the protein's key function remains to be elucidated. [Modification by food of the calcium absorbability and physicochemical effects of calcium citrate](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20050000597&hterms=healthy+diet&qs=Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall%26Ntk%3DAll%26N%3D0%26No%3D40%26Ntt%3Dhealthy%2Bdiet) [NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp) Wabner, C. L.; Pak, C. Y. 1992-01-01 The food-calcium (Ca) interaction was examined in 12 healthy women (mean age 38 years) maintained on a constant metabolic diet. They underwent three phases of study, comprised of control (no Ca), Ca citrate (1 g Ca/day) during meals, and Ca citrate separately from meals. Each phase was 7 days in length and two 24-hour urine samples were collected on days 6 and 7. The rise from the control phase in urinary Ca was slightly more prominent when Ca citrate was given with meals than without (68 and 62%, respectively). The fall in urinary phosphorus was equivalent at about 25% between Ca citrate phases. The rise in urinary citrate and pH and the decline in urinary ammonium were more prominent when Ca citrate was given with meals; however, the changes were small or nonsignificant. The urinary saturation of Ca oxalate, brushite or monosodium urate did not differ between the two Ca citrate phases. There was a nonsignificant rise in serum iron during Ca citrate phases. The results suggest that: 1) dissolution and absorption of Ca citrate might be slightly greater when given with food than without; 2) that the ability of Ca citrate to attenuate crystallization of stone-forming Ca salts in urine is not modified by food; and 3) that Ca citrate may not impair iron absorption from food. [Urinary oxalate to creatinine reference values for urinary oxalate to creatinine ratios in healthy children aged 6-15 years and to investigate the relationship between their nutritional habits and oxalate excretion. Materials and methods: Random urine specimens from 953 healthy children aged 6-15 years were obtained and analyzed for oxalate and creatinine. Additionally, a 24-h dietary recall form was prepared and given to them. The ingredient composition of the diet was calculated. The children were divided into three groups according to age: Group I (69 years, n = 353), Group II (10-12 years, n = 335), and Group III (13-15 years, n = 265). Results: The 95th percentile of the oxalate to creatinine ratio respectively. The oxalate to creatinine ratio was significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 and Group 3. Urinary oxalate excretion was positively correlated with increased protein intake and negatively correlated with age. A significant positive correlation was determined between urinary oxalate excretion and the proline, serine, protein, and glycine content of diet. Dietary proline intake showed a positive correlation with the urine oxalate to creatinine ratio and was found to be an independent predictor for urinary oxalate. Conclusions: These data lend support to the idea that every country should have its own normal reference values to determine the underlying metabolic risk factor for kidney stone disease since regional variation in the dietary intake of proteins and other nutrients can affect normal urinary excretion of oxalate.

The genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP2 shows promise for neural network activity imaging, but is currently limited by low signal-to-noise ratio. We describe x-ray crystal structures as well as solution biophysical and spectroscopic characterization of GCaMP2 in the calcium-free dark state, and in two calcium-bound bright states: a monomeric form that dominates at intracellular concentrations observed during imaging experiments and an unexpected domain-swapped dimer with decreased fluorescence. This series of structures provides insight into the mechanism of Ca{sup 2+}-induced fluorescence change. Upon calcium binding, the calmodulin (CaM) domain wraps around the M13 peptide, creating a new domain interface between CaMmore \u00bb and the circularly permuted enhanced green fluorescent protein domain. Residues from CaM alter the chemical environment of the circularly permuted enhanced green fluorescent protein chromophore and, together with flexible inter-domain linkers, block solvent access to the chromophore. Guided by the crystal structures, we engineered a series of GCaMP2 point mutants to probe the mechanism of GCaMP2 function and characterized one mutant with significantly improved signal-to-noise. The mutation is located at a domain interface and its effect on sensor function could not have been predicted in the absence of structural data.\u00ab less [Oxalate exposure provokes HSP 70 response in LLC-PK1 cells, a line of renal epithelial cells: protective role of HSP We investigated the effects of oxalate on immediate early genes (IEGs) and stress protein HSP 70, commonly induced genes in response to a variety of stresses. LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to oxalate. Gene transcription and translation were monitored by Northern and Western blot analysis. RNA and DNA synthesis were assessed by [(3)H]-uridine and [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation, respectively. Oxalate exposure selectively increased the levels of mRNA encoding IEGs c-myc and c-jun as well as stress protein HSP 70. While expression of c-myc and c-jun was rapid (within 15 min to 2 h) and transient, HSP 70 expression was delayed (approximately 8 h) and stable. Furthermore, oxalate exposure resulted in delayed induction of generalized transcription by 18 h and reinitiation of the DNA synthesis by 24 h of oxalate exposure. Moreover, we show that prior induction of HSP 70 by mild hypertonic exposure protected the cells from oxalate toxicity. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate rapid IEG response and delayed heat-shock response to oxalate toxicity and protective role of HSP 70 against oxalate toxicity to renal epithelial cells. Oxalate, a metabolic end product, induces IEGs c-myc and c-jun and a delayed HSP 70 expression; While IEG expression may regulate additional genetic responses to oxalate, increased HSP 70 expression would serve an early protective role during oxalate stress. [Transcellular oxalate and Cl absorption in mouse intestine is mediated by the DRA anion exchanger Slc26a3, and DRA deletion Jonathan M. 2013-01-01 Active transcellular oxalate transport in the mammalian intestine contributes to the homeostasis of this important lithogenic anion. Several members of the Slc26a gene family of anion exchangers have a measurable oxalate affinity and are expressed along the gut, apically and basolaterally. Mouse Slc26a6 (PAT1) targets to the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, and its deletion results in net oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria. Apical exchangers of the Slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the Slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (DRA)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. We evaluated the role of DRA in intestinal oxalate and Cl transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (WT) and DRA knockout (KO) mice. In WT mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and Cl absorption to varying degrees. In KO mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. In KO mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in WT mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. We conclude that DRA mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and Cl absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions. The large reductions in urinary oxalate excretion underscore the importance of transcellular intestinal oxalate absorption, in general, and, more specifically, the importance of the DRA exchanger in oxalate homeostasis. PMID:23886857 [Comprehensive hydrogen oxalate (AMNPO), and its deuterium analogue have been synthesized and characterized by means of FT-IR, FT-Raman, DSC and single crystal X-ray studies. The DSC measurements and temperature dependence of the IR and Raman spectra in the range 4-295 K show that it undergoes a reversible phase transition at ~240 K. At room temperature it crystallizes in noncentrosymmetric space group P21. The unit-cell is built of the 2-amino-4-methyl-3-nitropyridinium cations and oxalate monoanions which are connected via the N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds. The geometrical and hydrogen bond parameters are similar for non-deuterated (at 120 and 293 K) and deuterated compounds (at 90K). The phase transition is probably a consequence of order-disorder transition inside of hydrogen network. The 6-311G(2d,2p) basis set with B3LYP functional have been used to discuss the structure and vibrational spectra of the studied compound. Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. [Natural Abundance 43Ca NMR as a Tool for Exploring Calcium Biomineralization: Renal Stone Formation and Growth](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1222164-natural-abundance-nmr-tool-exploring-calcium-biomineralization-renal-stone-formation-growth) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search) Bowers, Geoffrey M.; Kirkpatrick, Robert J. 2011-12-07 Renal stone diseases are a global health issue with little effective therapeutic recourse aside from surgery and shock-wave lithotripsy, primarily because the fundamental chemical mechanisms behind calcium biomineralization are poorly understood. In this work, we show that natural abundance 43Ca NMR at 21.1 T is an effective means to probe the molecular-level Ca2+ structure in oxalate-based kidney stones. We find that the 43Ca NMR resonance of an authentic oxalate-based kidney stone cannot be explained by a single pure phase of any common Ca2+-bearing stone mineral. Combined with XRD results, our findings suggest an altered calcium oxalate monohydrate-like Ca2+ coordination environmentmore \u00bb for some fraction of Ca2+ in our sample. The evidence is consistent with existing literature hypothesizing that nonoxalate organic material interacts directly with Ca2+ at stone surfaces and is the primary driver of renal stone aggregation and growth. Our findings show that 43Ca NMR spectroscopy may provide unique and crucial insight into the fundamental chemistry of kidney stone formation, growth, and the role organic molecules play in these processes.\u00ab less [SM50 Repeat-Polypeptides Self-Assemble into Discrete Matrix Subunits and Promote Appositional Calcium Carbonate Crystal Growth during Sea enamel and echinoderm sea urchin tooth SM50, are both characterized by elongated polyproline repeat domains in the center of the macromolecule. To determine the role of polyproline repeat polypeptides in basal deuterostome biomineralization, we have mapped the localization of SM50 as it relates to crystal growth, conducted self-assembly studies of SM50 repeat polypeptides, and examined their effect on calcium carbonate and apatite crystal growth. Electron micrographs of the growth zone of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sea urchin teeth documented a series of successive events from intravesicular mineral nucleation to mineral deposition at the interface between tooth surface and odontoblast syncytium. Using immunohistochemistry, SM50 was detected within the cytoplasm of cells associated with the developing tooth mineral, at the mineral secreting front, and adjacent to initial mineral deposits, but not in muscles and ligaments. Polypeptides derived from the SM50 polyproline alternating hexa- and hepta-peptide repeat region (SM50P6P7) formed highly discrete, donut-shaped self-assembly patterns. In calcium carbonate crystal growth studies, SM50P6P7 repeat peptides triggered the growth of expansive networks of fused calcium carbonate crystals while in apatite growth studies, SM50P6P7 peptides facilitated the growth of needle-shaped and parallel arranged crystals resembling those found in developing vertebrate enamel. In comparison, SM50P6P7 surpassed the PXX24 polypeptide repeat region derived from the vertebrate enamel protein amelogenin in its ability to promote crystal nucleation and appositional crystal growth. Together, these studies establish the SM50P6P7 polyproline repeat region as a potent regulator in the protein-guided appositional crystal growth that occurs during continuous tooth mineralization and eruption.

We report the first two cases. These patients developed nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and backache within hours of ingesting large quantities of sour carambola juice; then acute renal failure followed. Both patients needed hemodialysis for oliguric acute renal failure, and pathologic examinations showed typical changes of acute oxalate nephropathy. The renal function recovered 4 weeks later without specific treatment. Sour carambola juice is a popular beverage in Taiwan. The popularity of star fruit juice is not compatible with the rare discovery of star fruit-associated acute oxalate nephropathy. Commercial carambola juice usually is prepared by pickling and dilution processes that reduce oxalate content markedly, whereas pure fresh juice or mild diluted postpickled juice for traditional remedies, as used in our cases, contain high quantities of oxalate. An empty stomach and dehydrated state may pose an additional risk for development of renal injury. To avoid acute oxalate nephropathy, pure sour carambola juice or mild diluted postpickled juice should not be consumed in large amounts, especially on an empty stomach or in a dehydrated state. [Oxalate modulates thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) production in supernatants of homogenates from rat brain, liver this paper was to investigate the mechanism(s) involved in the sodium oxalate pro-oxidative activity in vitro and the potential protection ((PhSe)(2)) and diphenyl ditelluride ((PhTe)(2)) from brain, liver and kidney. Oxalate causes a significant increase in the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive species) production up to 4mmol/l and it had antioxidant activity from 8 to 16mmol/l in the brain and liver. Oxalate had no effect in kidney homogenates. The difference among tissues may be related to the formation of insoluble crystal of oxalate in kidney, but not in liver and brain homogenates. (PhSe)(2) and (PhTe)(2) reduced both basal and oxalate-induced TBARS in rat brain homogenates, whereas in liver homogenates they were antioxidant only on oxalate-induced TBARS production. (PhSe)(2) showed a modest effect on renal TBARS production, whereas (PhTe)(2) did not modulate TBARS in kidney preparations. Oxalate at 2mmol/l did not change deoxyribose degradation induced by Fe(2+) plus H(2)O(2), whereas at 20mmol/l it significantly prevents its degradation. Oxalate (up to 4mmol/l) did not alter iron (10micromol/l)-induced TBARS production in the brain preparations, whereas at 8mmol/l onwards it prevents iron effect. In liver preparations, oxalate amplifies iron pro-oxidant activity up to 4mmol/l, preventing iron-induced TBARS production at 16mmol/l onwards. These results support the antioxidant effect of organochalcogens against oxalate-induced TBARS production. In addition, our results suggest that oxalate pro- and antioxidant activity in vitro could be related to its interactions with iron ions.

Spherulitic crystals and films, seemingly formed from a molten state, were produced. These structures served as nucleating surfaces for the radial formation of calcium oxalate minerals. The composite calcium phosphate-calcium oxalate assemblies are similar to the core-shell structures found in certain kidney stones. [Response to Background and objectives Bariatric surgery (BS) may be associated with increased oxalate excretion and a higher risk of nephrolithiasis. This study aimed to investigate urinary abnormalities and responses to an acute oxalate load as an indirect assessment of the intestinal absorption of oxalate in this population. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Twenty-four-hour urine specimens were collected from 61 patients a median of 48 months after BS (post-BS) as well as from 30 morbidly obese (MO) participants; dietary information was obtained through 24-hour food recalls. An oral oxalate load test (OLT), consisting of 2-hour urine samples after overnight fasting and 2, 4, and 6 hours after consuming 375 mg of oxalate (spinach juice), was performed on 21 MO and 22 post-BS patients 12 months after BS. Ten post-BS patients also underwent OLT before surgery (pre-BS). Results There was a higher percentage of low urinary volume (<1.5 L/d) in hyperoxaluria (P=0.13 and P=0.36, respectively) were more frequent in BS versus MO patients. The OLT showed intragroup (P<0.001 for all periods versus baseline) and intergroup differences (P<0.001 for post-BS versus MO; P=0.03for post-BS versus pre-BS). The total mean increment in oxaluria after 6 hours of load, expressed as area under the curve, was higher in both post-BS versus MO and in post-BS versus pre-BS participants (P<0.001 for both). Conclusions The mean oxaluric response to an oxalate load is markedly elevated in post-bariatric surgery patients, suggesting that increased intestinal absorption of dietary oxalate is a predisposing mechanism for enteric hyperoxaluria. PMID:23024163 Calcium Phosphate Crystals on Calcified Human Aortic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells including vascular calcification (VC) remains the leading cause of death in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD). The process of VC seems likely to be a tightly regulated process where vascular smooth muscle cells are playing a key role rather than just a mere passive precipitation of calcium phosphate. Characterisation of the chemical and crystalline structure of VC was mainly led in patients or animal models with CKD. Likewise, Mg2+ was found to be protective in living cells although a potential role for Mg2+ could not be excluded on crystal formation and precipitation. In this study, the crystal formation and the role of Mg2+ were investigated in an in vitro model of primary human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HAVSMC) with physical techniques. Methodology/Principal Findings In HAVSMC incubated with increased Ca x Pi medium, only calcium phosphate apatite crystals (CPA) were detected by Micro-Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (\u00b5FTIR) and Field Effect Scanning Electron Microscope (FE \u2014 SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) at the cell layer level. Supplementation with Mg2+ did not alter the crystal composition or structure. The crystal deposition was preferentially positioned near or directly on cells as pictured by FE \u2014 SEM observations and EDX measurements. Large \u00b5FTIR maps revealed spots of CPA crystals that were associated to the cellular layout. This qualitative analysis suggests a potential beneficial effect of Mg2+ at 5 mM in noticeably reducing the number and intensities of CPA \u00b5FTIR spots. Conclusions/Significance For the first time in a model of HAVSMC, induced calcification led to the formation of the sole CPA crystals. Our data seems to exclude a physicochemical role of Mg2+ in altering the CPA crystal growth, composition or structure. Furthermore, Mg2+ beneficial role in attenuating VC should be linked to an active cellular role.

No preliminary isolation of oxalate was required and recoveries ranging from 95-110 per cent were obtained. Spinach, rhubarb, peanuts, chocolates, parsley and tea were found to contain high levels of oxalate as previously described by others. On the other hand the oxalate content of beetroot was found to be five times as high as previously reported, but coca-cola and beer were almost free from oxalate. Cereals and meat were either low or deficient in oxalate.

M.; Hoenigman, J. R.; Moddeman, W. E. 1981-11-01 The potential use of secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to analyze biological samples for calcium isotopes is discussed. Comparison of UTI and Extranuclear based quadrupole systems is made on the basis of the analysis of CaO and calcium metal. The Extranuclear quadrupole based system is superior in resolution and sensitivity to the UTI system and is recommended. For determination of calcium isotopes to within an accuracy of a few percent a high resolution quadrupole, such as the Extranuclear, and signal averaging capability are required. Charge neutralization will be mandated for calcium oxide, calcium nitrate, or calcium oxalate. SIMS is not capable of the high precision and high accuracy results possible by thermal ionization methods, but where faster analysis is desirable with an accuracy of a few percent, SIMS is a viable alternative. [DETERMINATION OF OXALATE ION A pellet method using standard addition and FT-IR was used to estimate oxalate ion doping levels in electrosynthesized polypyrrole. The method is useful for materials where removal of analyte from an insoluble material is problematic. Here, electrosynthesized oxalate doped polypyrrole is dispersed in potassium bromide. Spikes of sodium oxalate are added and the mixtures pressed into pellets. The oxalate carbonyl absorption peak is then used to quantify the amount of oxalate present in the polypyrrole. The mass fraction of oxalate dopant in polypyrrole was determined to be 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 % and coincides with the original synthesis solution composition. PMID:25598749 [Neurotoxic effects of carambola in rats: the role Chien-Liang; Chung, Hsiao-Min 2002-05-01 Carambola (star fruit) has been reported to contain neurotoxins that cause convulsions, hiccups, or death in uremic patients, and prolong barbiturate-induced sleeping time in rats. The constituent responsible for these effects remains uncertain. Carambola contains a large quantity of oxalate, which can induce depression of cerebral function and seizures. This study was conducted to investigate the role of oxalate in carambola toxicity in rats. The effects on barbiturate-induced sleeping time and death caused by intraperitoneal administration of carambola juice were observed in Sprague-Dawley rats. To obtain a dose-dependent response curve and evaluate the lethal dose, rats were treated with serial amounts of pure carambola juice diluted with normal saline in a volume of 1:1. To test the role of oxalate in the neurotoxic effect of carambola, either 5.33 g/kg carambola after oxalate removal or 5.33 g/kg of pure carambola juice diluted with normal saline were administered intraperitoneally, while the control group was given normal saline before pentobarbital injection. The effects of carambola and oxalate-removed carambola on barbiturate-induced sleeping time were compared with those of saline. To assess the lethal effect of oxalate in carambola, we gave rats chemical oxalate at comparable concentrations to the oxalate content of carambola. Carambola juice administration prolonged barbiturate-induced sleeping time in a dose-dependent manner. The sleeping time of rats that received normal saline and 1.33 +/- 38.8 minutes, respectively. The three higher-dose groups had longer sleeping times than controls (p < 0.05 or 0.005). This effect was eliminated after the removal of oxalate from carambola juice. Four of eight rats in the 10.67-g/kg group and all rats in the 21.33 g/kg and chemical oxalate groups died after seizure.

This research aims to conduct association analysis and identify SNP markers associated with oxalate concentration in spinach germplasm. A total of 310 spinach genotypes including 300 USDA germplasm accessions and ... determination in human plasma was elaborated. The principle of the method depends on the oxalate isolation from deproteinized plasma, following determination by the calorimetric oxalate oxidase-peroxidase-indamine system. This method protects against internal oxalate losses and excludes an interference of contaminations. Results, obtained by this method, were reliable and ideally suited for use as real normal values (less than or equal to 6 microM) of oxalate content in the plasma of healthy individuals. The elaborated method, which can assay plasma oxalate accurately in normal individuals as well as in hyperoxalemic conditions is superior to those previously used. The procedure of semi-micromethod does not require expensive equipments and apparatus: it is simple and easy to perform in every laboratory and takes little time. [The microgenesis of some renal calculi.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7014516) E 1981-05-01 We studied calcium oxalate stone formation in rats in which calculogenesis was induced by a diet deficient in pyridoxine (vitamin B6). We studied the sequence of stone formation using both a gross specimen transillumination technique, which is described, and histologic methods. A characteristic regional distribution of calculi is described and illustrated. Histologic studies reveal the interstitial site of calcium oxalate microlith formation. The progressive movement of these crystals through the tubular wall into the tubular lumen is described and illustrated. The formation of Randall's plaques is described and illustrated, as is a characteristic \"geode\" formation in the calyceal fornix. The significance of these findings is discussed and a new concept of stone formation proposed. [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Altay, Arzu The properties of ceramic materials are determined not only by the composition and structure of the phases present, but also by the distribution of impurities, intergranular films and second phases. The phase distribution and microstructure both depend on the fabrication techniques, the raw materials used, the phase-equilibrium relations, grain growth and sintering processes. In this dissertation research, various approaches have been employed to understand fundamental phenomena such as grain growth, impurity segregation, second-phase formation and crystallization. The materials system chosen was alumina intentionally doped with calcium. Atomic-scale structural analyses of grain boundaries in alumina were carried on the processed samples. It was found that above certain calcium concentrations, CA6 precipitated as a second phase at all sintering temperatures. The results also showed that abnormal grain growth can occur after precipitation and it is not only related to the calcium level, but it is also temperature dependent. In order to understand the formation mechanism of CA6 precipitates in calcium doped alumina samples, several studies have been carried out using either bulk materials or thin films The crystallization of CA2 and CA6 powders has been studied. Chemical processing techniques were used to synthesize the powders. It was observed that CA2 powders crystallized directly, however CA6 powders crystallized through solid The results of energy-loss near-edge spectrometry confirmed that gamma-Al2O3 can dissolve calcium. Calcium aluminate/alumina reaction couples have also been investigated. All reaction couples were heat treated following deposition. It was found that gamma-Al2O3 was formed at the interface as a result of the interfacial reaction between the film and the substrate. gamma-Al 2O3 at the interface was stable at much higher temperatures compared to the bulk gamma-Al2O3 formed prior to the CA6 crystallization.

In order to evaluate its toxicity, plants of Brachiaria brizantha were cultivated on nutritive solution of Hoagland during 90 days and submitted to different concentrations of Pb. The content of macro and micronutrients was evaluated and there was a reduction on root content of Ca, besides the lowest dosages of Pb had induced an increase of N, S, Mn, Cu, Zn and Fe. The cell ultrastructure of leaves and roots were analyzed by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). Among the main alterations occurred there were invaginations on cell walls, the presence of crystals on the root cells, accumulation of material on the interior of cells and vacuolar compartmentalization. On the leaves the degradation of chloroplasts was observed, as well as the increase of vacuoles. Structures for the formation of oxalate crystals were proposed through molecular modeling and thermodynamic stability. Calculi suggest the formation of highly stable metal-oxalate complexes.

Uranous oxalate, together with plutonium being carried thereby, is dissolved in an aqueous alkaline solution. Suitable alkaline reagents are the carbonates and oxulates of the alkali metals and ammonium. An oxidizing agent selected from hydroxylamine and hydrogen peroxide is then added to the alkaline solution, thereby oxidizing uranium to the hexavalent state. The resulting solution is then acidified and a source of uranous ions provided in the acidified solution, thereby forming a second plutoniumcarrying uranous oxalate precipitate. [Preventive effects of the global problem. Despite the availability of numerous methods, no definite therapeutic agent has been yet introduced for the prevention or treatment of kidney stones. In this study, we evaluated the possible preventive effects of aqueous extract of Cichorium intybus L. (chicory) flowers on ethylene glycol-induced renal calculi in rats. Materials and Methods: A total of 24 Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups and were treated for 30 days. Group A received drinking tap water, while groups B, C, and D were administered with 1% ethylene glycol for induction of calcium oxalate stone formation. Rats in groups C and D received intraperitoneal injections of the aqueous extract of chicory flowers (50 and 200 mg/kg, respectively) since the first day of the experiment. The urine volume, urine pH, and urinary levels of oxalate, citrate, calcium, uric acid, and creatinine as well as serum levels of calcium, uric acid, and creatinine were measured. After 30 days, the rats' kidneys were removed and prepared for histological evaluation of calcium oxalate deposits. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's test, was performed, using SPSS version 20. Results: The number of calcium oxalate crystals was significantly higher in group B (ethylene glycol-only treated animals), compared to group A (control), group C (50 mg/kg of aqueous extract), and group D (200 mg/kg of aqueous extract) (p<0.05). On day 30, the urine level of citrate, oxalate (p>0.05), and creatinine (p<0.05), as well as urine pH (p<0.05) decreased in groups C and D, compared to group B. Also, urine calcium level, urine uric acid (p>0.05), and urine volume (p<0.05) were higher in group D, compared to group B. In addition, the serum level of calcium, creatinine (p<0.05), and uric acid (p<0.001) decreased in groups C and D. Conclusion: The aqueous extract of chicory flower (50 mg/kg) could reduce the number of calcium oxalate deposits in the urine and reduce [Effect of heat treatment on the structure of incorporated oxalate species and photoluminescent properties of porous alumina films formed focuses on the use of IR spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectral measurements for studying the treatment temperature effect on the compositional and luminescent properties of oxalic acid alumina films. In line with the recent researches we have also found that heat treatment of porous alumina films formed in oxalic acid leads to considerable changes in their photoluminescence properties: upon annealing the intensity of photoluminescence (PL) increases reaching a maximum at the temperature of around 500 \u00b0C and then decreases. IR spectra of as-grown and heat-treated films have proved that PL emission in the anodic alumina films is related with the state of 'structural' oxalate species incorporated in the oxide lattice. These results allowed us to conclude that PL behavior of oxalic acid alumina films can be explained through the concept of variations in the bonding molecular orbitals of incorporated oxalate species including - and protein from composed of calcium carbonate with a small amount of organic matrix, are involved in the functioning of the inner ear. Starmaker (Stm) from zebrafish (Danio rerio) was the first protein found to be capable of controlling the formation of otoliths.

Stm-l possesses an elongated and pliable structure that is able to adopt a more ordered and rigid conformation under the influence of different factors. An in vitro assay of the biomineralization activity of Stm-l indicated that Stm-l affected the size, shape and number of calcium carbonate crystals.

The detection of BCP crystals in the synovial fluid of patients with OA is fraught with challenges due to the submicroscopic size of BCP, the complex nature of the matrix in which they are found and the fact that other crystals can co-exist with them in cases of mixed pathology. Routine analysis of joint crystals still relies almost exclusively on the use of optical microscopy, which has limited applicability for BCP crystal identification due to limited resolution and the inherent subjectivity of the technique. The purpose of this Critical Review is to present an overview of some of the main analytical tools employed in the detection of BCP to date and the potential of emerging technologies such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman microspectroscopy for this (HC-1) Promotes Enteric Oxalate Secretion in the Small and in urinary oxalate excretion was previously reported in a mouse model of Primary Hyperoxaluria, and in wild type (WT) mice colonized with a wild rat strain (OXWR) of Oxalobacter (Am J Physiol 300: G461-G469, 2011). Since a human strain of the bacterium is more likely to be clinically used as a probiotic therapeutic, we tested the effects of HC-1 in WT. Following artificial colonization of WT mice with HC-1, the bacteria were confirmed to be present in the large intestine and, unexpectedly, detected in the small intestine for varying periods of time. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether the presence of HC-1 promoted intestinal secretion in the more proximal segments of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, we determined whether HC-1 colonization led to reductions in urinary oxalate excretion in these mice. The results show that the human Oxalobacter strain promotes a robust net secretion of oxalate in the distal ileum as well as in the caecum and distal colon and these changes in transport correlate with the beneficial effect of reducing renal excretion of oxalate. We conclude that OXWR effects on intestinal oxalate transport and oxalate homeostasis are not unique to the wild rat strain and that, mechanistically, HC-1 has significant potential for use as a probiotic treatment for hyperoxaluria especially if it is also targeted to the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.

The present study localized calcium in heart atrium, ventricle, and bulbus arteriosus as well as in erythrocytes of zebrafish Danio rerio using an oxalate-pyroantimonate technique combined with transmission electron microscopy. Intracellular calcium stores were detected in caveolae, mitochondria, and the nuclei of several zebrafish cardiac cell types. Melanin pigmentation containing calcium stores was detected in the pericardial cavity. Melanin might be an extracellular source of calcium for heart beating and/or a lubricant to prevent friction during beating process. Calcium deposits were also detected in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus of erythrocytes as well as in blood plasma. Possible exchange of calcium between erythrocytes and blood plasma was observed. Interactions of such calcium stores and possible contribution of extracellular calcium stores such as melanin pigmentation to supply calcium for vital functions of heart cells should be addressed in future studies.

Randomized complete block design. 31 dogs and 8 cats. Aliquots of each urine sample were analyzed within 60 minutes of collection or after storage at room or refrigeration temperatures (20 vs 6 degrees C [68 vs 43 degrees F]) for 6 or 24 hours. Crystals formed in samples from 11 of 39 (28%) animals. Calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals formed in vitro in samples from 1 cat and 8 dogs. Magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) crystals formed in vitro in samples from 2 dogs. Compared with aliquots stored at room temperature, refrigeration increased the number and size of crystals that formed in vitro; however, the increase in number and size of MAP crystals in stored urine samples was not significant. Increased storage time and decreased storage temperature were associated with a significant increase in number of CaOx crystals formed. Greater numbers of crystals formed in urine aliquots stored for 24 hours than in aliquots stored for 6 hours. Storage time and temperature did not have a significant effect on pH or specific gravity. Urine samples should be analyzed within 60 minutes of collection to minimize temperature- and time-dependent effects on in vitro crystal formation. Presence of crystals observed in stored samples should be validated by reevaluation of fresh urine.

Two randomized crossover stable iron isotope absorption studies. Zurich, Switzerland. Sixteen apparently healthy women (18-45 years, <60 kg body weight), recruited by poster advertizing from the staff and student populations of the ETH, University and University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland. Thirteen subjects completed both studies. Iron absorption was measured based on erythrocyte incorporation of (57)Fe or (58)Fe 14 days after the administration of labelled meals. In study I, test meals consisted of two wheat bread rolls (100 g) and either 150 g spinach with a native OA content of 1.27 g (reference meal) or 150 g kale with a native OA content of 0.01 g. In study II, 150 g kale given with a potassium oxalate drink to obtain a total OA content of 1.27 g was compared to the spinach meal. After normalization for the spinach reference meal absorption, geometric mean iron absorption from wheat bread rolls with kale (10.7%) did not differ significantly from wheat rolls with kale plus 1.26 g OA added as potassium oxalate (11.5%, P=0.86). Spinach was significantly higher in calcium and polyphenols than kale and absorption from the spinach meal was 24% lower compared to the kale meal without added OA, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P>0.16). Potassium oxalate did not influence iron absorption in humans from a kale meal and our findings strongly suggest that OA in fruits and vegetables is of minor relevance in iron nutrition.

Denise 2016-01-01 Gut microbes are essential for the degradation of dietary oxalate, and this function may play a role in decreasing the incidence of kidney stones. However, many oxalate-degrading bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics and the use of oxalate-degrading probiotics has only led to an ephemeral reduction in urinary oxalate. The objective of the current study was to determine the efficacy of using whole-community microbial transplants from a wild mammalian herbivore, Neotoma albigula, to increase oxalate degradation over the long term in the laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus. We quantified the change in total oxalate degradation in lab rats immediately after microbial transplants and at 2- and 9-month intervals following microbial transplants. Additionally, we tracked the fecal microbiota of the lab rats, with and without microbial transplants, using high-throughput Illumina sequencing of a hyper-variable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Microbial transplants resulted in a significant increase in oxalate degradation, an effect that persisted 9 months after the initial transplants. Functional persistence was corroborated by the transfer, and persistence of a group of bacteria previously correlated with oxalate consumption in N. albigula, including an anaerobic bacterium from the genus Oxalobacter known for its ability to use oxalate as a sole carbon source. The results of this study indicate that whole-community microbial transplants are an effective means for the persistent colonization of oxalate-degrading bacteria in the mammalian gut.

The neutron-irradiated uranium is dissolved in acid and thorium oxalate is precipitated in ihe solution formed, whereby the fission products are carried on the thorium oxalate. The separated thorium oxalate precipitate is then dissolved in an aqueous oxalate solution and the solution formed is acidified, limiting ihe excess acidity to a maximum of 2 N, whereby thorium oxalate precipitates and carries lanthanum-rareearth- and alkaline-earth-metal fission products while the zirconium-fission-product remains in solution. This precipitate, too, is dissolved in an aqaeous oxalate solution at elevated temperature, and lanthanum-rare-earth ions are added to the solution whereby lanthanum-rare-earth oxalate forms and the lanthanum-rare-earth-type and alkalineearth-metal-type fission products are carried on the oxalate. The precipitate is separated from the solution. Dorozhkin, Sergey V. 2011-01-01 The present overview is intended to point the readers' attention to the important subject of calcium orthophosphates. This type of materials is of special significance for human beings, because they represent the inorganic part of major normal (bones, teeth and antlers) and pathological (i.e., those appearing due to various diseases) calcified tissues of mammals. For example, atherosclerosis results in blood vessel blockage caused by a solid composite of cholesterol with calcium orthophosphates, while dental caries and osteoporosis mean a partial decalcification of teeth and bones, respectively, that results in replacement of a less soluble and harder biological apatite by more soluble and softer calcium hydrogenphosphates. Therefore, the processes of both normal and pathological calcifications are just an in vivo crystallization of calcium orthophosphates. Similarly, dental caries and osteoporosis might be considered an in vivo dissolution of calcium orthophosphates. Thus, calcium orthophosphates hold a great significance for humankind, and in this paper, an overview on the current knowledge on this subject is provided.

The traditional view holds that perforin monomers assemble into pores in the target cell membrane via a calcium-dependent process and facilitate translocation of cytotoxic proteases into the cytoplasm to induce apoptosis. Although many studies have examined the structure and role of perforin, the mechanics of pore assembly and granzyme delivery remain unclear. Here we have employed quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to investigate binding and assembly of perforin on lipid membranes, and show that perforin monomers bind to the membrane in a cooperative manner. We also found that cholesterol influences perforin binding and activity on intact cells and model membranes. Finally, contrary to current thinking, perforin efficiently binds membranes in the absence of calcium. When calcium is added to perforin already on the membrane, the QCM-D response changes significantly, indicating that perforin becomes membranolytic only after calcium binding. \u00a9 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. [A study of calcium intake and sources of calcium in adolescent boys and girls from two socioeconomic strata, Adequate intake of calcium is important for skeletal growth. Low calcium intake during childhood and adolescence may lead to decreased bone mass accrual thereby increasing the risk of osteoporotic fractures. Our aim was to study dietary calcium intake and sources of calcium in adolescents from lower and upper economic strata in Pune, India. We hypothesized that children from lower economic strata would have lower intakes of calcium, which would predominantly be derived from non-dairy sources. Two hundred male and female adolescents, from lower and upper economic stratum were studied. Semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate intakes of calcium, phosphorus, oxalic acid, phytin, energy and protein. The median calcium intake was significantly different in all four groups, with maximum intake in the upper economic strata boys (893 mg, 689-1295) and lowest intake in lower economic strata girls (506 mg, 380-674). The median calcium intake in lower economic strata boys was 767 mg (585-1043) and that in upper economic strata girls was 764 mg (541-959). The main source of calcium was dairy products in upper economic strata adolescents while it was dark green leafy vegetables in lower economic strata adolescents. The median calcium intake was much lower in lower economic strata than in the upper economic strata both in boys and girls. Girls from both groups had less access to dairy products as compared to boys. Measures need to be taken to rectify low calcium intake in lower economic strata adolescents and to address gender inequality in distribution of dairy products in India. [Effects of Juice Processing on Oxalate Contents in Carambola Juice Products.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28584897) Huynh, Nha K; Nguyen, Ha V H 2017-09-01 Effects of processing methods including pressing, enzyme-assisted extraction, lactic acid fermentation by Lactobacillus acidophilus, and alcohol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae on total and soluble oxalate contents of carambola juices were studied. In comparison with pressing, the use of enzyme increased juice yields (15.89-17.29%), but resulted in higher total oxalate (1.60-1.73 times) and soluble oxalate contents (1.16-1.49 times). In addition, extension of enzyme incubation periods led to an increase in soluble oxalate contents in the products (p < 0.05). On the other hand, alcohol fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae from 1 to 5 weeks reduced 37-58% of total oxalate and 39-59% of soluble oxalate contents. Prolonged fermentation also demonstrated better reduction of oxalate contents. Meanwhile, lactic acid fermentation using Lactobacillus acidophilus had no effects on total and soluble oxalate contents in carambola juices. These results suggested that carambola juice products should only be consumed moderately, and that alcohol fermentation could be a potential method to reduce oxalate contents in foods in order to prevent the risks of forming kidney stones. [The identity of the active site of oxalate decarboxylase and the importance of the stability of active-site oxalate into carbon dioxide and formate. It requires manganese and, uniquely, dioxygen for catalysis. It forms a homohexamer and each subunit contains two similar, but distinct, manganese sites termed sites 1 and 2. There is kinetic evidence that only site 1 is catalytically active and that site 2 is purely structural. However, the kinetics of enzymes with mutations in site 2 are often ambiguous and all mutant kinetics have been interpreted without structural information. Nine new site-directed mutants have been generated and four mutant crystal structures have now been solved. Most mutants targeted (i) the flexibility (T165P), (ii) favoured presence (162-163 or 162-164) of a lid associated with site 1. The kinetics of these mutants were consistent with only site 1 being catalytically active. This was particularly striking with D297A and H299A because they disrupted hydrogen bonds between the lid and a neighbouring subunit only when in the open conformation and were distant from site 2. These observations also provided the first evidence that the flexibility and stability of lid conformations are important in catalysis. The deletion of the lid to mimic the plant oxalate oxidase led to a loss of decarboxylase activity, but only a slight elevation in the oxalate oxidase side reaction, implying other changes are required to afford a reaction specificity switch. The four mutant crystal structures (R92A, E162A, 162-163 and S161A) strongly support the hypothesis that site 2 is purely structural.

R. 1970-01-01 1. that of the non-pigmented Pseudomonas oxalaticus. 2. During growth on oxalate, oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, formate dehydrogenase reductase. This is consistent with oxidation of oxalate to carbon dioxide taking place via oxalyl-CoA, formyl-CoA and formate as intermediates, and also reduction of oxalate to glyoxylate taking place via oxalyl-CoA. 3. The pink-pigmented organisms, when grown on oxalate, contain l-serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase and reductase but converse of this obtains in oxalate-grown Ps. oxalaticus. This indicates that, in contrast with Ps. oxalaticus, synthesis of C3 compounds from oxalate by the pink-pigmented organisms occurs by a variant of the `serine pathway' used by Pseudomonas AM1 during growth on C1 compounds. 4. Evidence in favour of this scheme is provided by the finding that a mutant of Pseudomonas AM1 that lacks hydroxypyruvate reductase is not oxalate. PMID:5472155 thorium oxalate morphology elements are widely used in research and industry mainly due to their low solubility in aqueous solution and easy conversion to oxide. Although thorium oxide is worldwide mostly produced by the oxalate precipitation and conversion route, the powder morphology obtained through this process is known to inhibit the packing and sintering step of the pellet production. The presented work investigates the effects of oxalate precipitation conditions on the final powder morphology. Among the precipitation conditions considered are: pH of the thorium feed solution, concentration, temperature and the order of addition (thorium solution in oxalic acid solution and vice versa) known as reverse/direct strike. Herein, we show that the morphology of the final oxalate depends significantly on the above mentioned precipitation parameters. [[Formation of oxalate in oxaliplatin injection diluted peripheral neuropathy characterized by sensory paresthesias, which are markedly exacerbated by exposure to cold temperatures, and is a dose-limiting factor in the treatment of colorectal cancer.Oxalate is eliminated in a series of nonenzymatic conversions of oxaliplatin in infusion solutions or biological fluids.Elimination of oxalate from oxaliplatin has been suggested as one of the reasons for the development of acute neuropathy.In this study, we developed a high-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC)-based method to detect oxalate formation, and investigated the time dependent formation of oxalate in oxaliplatin diluted with infusion solutions.The results obtained showed that the amount of oxalate in the solution corresponded to 1.6% of oxaliplatin 8 h after oxaliplatin dilution with a 5% glucose solution. On the other hand, oxalate formation from oxaliplatin diluted with a saline solution was ten-fold higher than that from oxaliplatin diluted with the 5% glucose solution.Most patients who were intravenously injected with oxaliplatin experienced venous pain.As a preventive measure against venous pain, dexamethasone was added to the oxaliplatin injection.We measured the amount of oxalate formed in the dexamethasone-containing oxaliplatin injection diluted with a 5% glucose solution.The amount of oxalate formed when dexamethasone was added did not differ significantly from that formed when dexamethasone was not added.Thus, there are no clinical problems associated with the stability of oxaliplatin solutions. [Oxalobacter formigenes-Derived Bioactive Factors Stimulate is a major risk factor for kidney stones and has no specific therapy, although Oxalobacter formigenes colonization is associated with reduced stone risk. O. interacts with colonic excretion, via an unknown secretagogue. The difficulties in sustaining O. formigenes colonization underscore the need to identify the derived factors inducing colonic oxalate secretion. We therefore evaluated the effects of O. formigenes culture conditioned medium (CM) on apical 14C-oxalate uptake by human intestinal Caco-2-BBE cells. Compared with control medium, O. formigenes CM significantly stimulated oxalate uptake (>2.4-fold), whereas CM from Lactobacillus acidophilus did not. Treating the O. formigenes CM with heat or pepsin completely abolished this bioactivity, and selective ultrafiltration of the CM revealed that the O. formigenes-derived factors have molecular masses of 10-30 kDa. Treatment with the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 or the anion exchange CM-induced oxalate transport. Knockdown of the oxalate transporter SLC26A6 also significantly restricted the induction of oxalate transport by CM. In a mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria type 1, rectal administration of O. formigenes CM significantly O. formigenes-derived bioactive factors stimulate oxalate transport in intestinal cells through mechanisms including PKA activation. The reduction in urinary oxalate excretion in hyperoxaluric mice treated with O. formigenes CM reflects the in vivo retention of biologic activity and the therapeutic potential of these factors. PMID:27738124 [A neodymium(III)-ammonium two ligands oxalate and carbonate, has been prepared hydrothermally as single crystals. The Nd atoms form a tetranuclear unit across the inversion centre at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Starting from this tetranuclear unit, the oxalate ligands serve to develop a three-dimensional network. The carbonate group acts as a bis-chelating ligand to two Nd atoms, and is monodentate to a third Nd atom. The oxalate groups are all bis-chelating. The two independent Nd atoms are ninefold coordinated and the coordination polyhedron of these atoms is a distorted monocapped antiprism. [Production and degradation of oxalic acid by brown rot fungi](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5381807-production-degradation-oxalic-acid-brown-rot-fungi) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search) Espejo, E.; Agosin, E. 1991-07-01 Our results show that all of the brown rot fungi tested produce oxalic acid in liquid as well as in semisolid cultures. Gloeophyllum trabeum, which accumulates the lowest amount of oxalic acid during decay of pine holocellulose, showed the highest polysaccharide-depolymerizing activity. Semisolid cultures inoculated with this fungus rapidly converted 14}C-labeled oxalic acid to CO{sub 2} during cellulose depolymerization. other brown rot fungi also oxidized {sup 14}C-labeled oxalic acid, although less rapidly. In contrast, semisolid cultures inoculated with the white rot fungus Coriolus versicolor did not significantly catabolize the acid and did not depolymerize the holocellulose during decay.more \u00bb Semisolid cultures amended with desferrioxamine, a specific iron-chelating agent, were unable to lower the degree of polymerization of cellulose or to oxidize {sup 14}C-labeled oxalic acid to the extent or at the rate that control cultures did. These results suggest that both iron and oxalic acid are involved in cellulose depolymerization by brown rot fungi.\u00ab less [The chemistry of aminoguanidine derivatives - preparation, crystal structure, thermal properties, and molecular docking studies of aminoguanidinium salts of several OOC-CONHNHC(NH2)NH2 (2) (AmgH)HOOC-CH2-COO (3) and O3S-CH2-CONHNHC(NH2)NH2 (4), respectively. For the first time, we studied the salt-forming ability of aminoguanidine with several carboxylic acids, such as oxamic, oxalic, malonic and sulphoacetic acids. We also compared the structural and thermal properties of these salts. Oxamic and malonic acids form only mono-aminoguanidinium salts, acid mainly forms di-aminoguanidinium oxalate. In addition, oxalic acid forms guanylhydrazido-oxalic acid which exists as zwitter ion. Unlike other acids, sulfoacetic acid readily forms only the zwitter ionic salts (2-guanylhydrazido-oxo-methanesulfonic acid) rather than the usual simple salt. This result may be a result of the highly acidic nature of the sulfonic group, which favors acid catalyzed condensation. More significantly, for the first time, the ability guanylhydrazido-oxalic acid (2) and 2-guanylhydrazido-oxo-methanesulfonic acid (4) to inhibit human butyrylcholinesterase (human BChE) receptor has been studied with a molecular docking approach. The binding of the compounds to human BChE was examined as it is crucial to understanding the biological significance of aminoguanidine derivatives. The compounds were identified and characterized by analytical, FT-IR spectroscopic and thermal studies. Furthermore, the structures of compounds 1, 2 and 4 were confirmed by single X-ray diffraction studies. Compounds 1 and 2 crystallized in a monoclinic crystal system with P21/c and Cc space groups, respectively, whereas compound 4 crystalized in an orthorhombic system with a Pbca space group. All the compounds (1-4) underwent endo- followed by exothermic decomposition in the temperature range from 130 to 600 \u00b0C to yield gaseous products.

[Function and X-Ray crystal structure of Escherichia coli YfdE](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3720670) Mullins, Elwood A.; Sullivan, Kelly L.; Kappock, T. Joseph 2013-01-01 Many food plants accumulate oxalate, which humans absorb but do not metabolize, leading to the formation of urinary stones. The commensal bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes consumes oxalate by decarboxylated by formyl-CoA:oxalate CoA-transferase (FCOCT) are widespread among bacteria, including many that have no apparent ability to degrade or to resist external oxalate. The EvgA acid response regulator activates transcription 30% identical to YfdW. YfdW and YfdU are necessary and sufficient for oxalate-induced protection against a subsequent acid challenge; neither of the other genes has a known function. We report the purification, in vitro characterization, 2.1-\u00c5 crystal structure, and functional assignment of YfdE. YfdE an orthologue from the reversible conversion of acetyl-CoA oxalate to oxalyl-CoA and acetate. The annotation of CoA-transferase linked oxalate catabolism and the oxalate-induced acid tolerance response. FCOCT and ACOCT active sites contain distinctive, conserved active site loops (the glycine-rich loop and the GNxH loop, respectively) that appear to encode substrate specificity. PMID:23935849 [Effects of vitamin E ingestion on plasma and urinary risk factors for calcium oxalate urolithiasis in two population groups having different stone-risk profiles: vitamin E supplementation reduces calciuria and oxaluria and that it may also prevent oxalate-mediated peroxidative injury, all of which reduce the risk of calcium oxalate urolithiasis. In view of the significant difference in stone occurrence in black (B) and white (W) South Africans, we undertook to investigate the effects of vitamin E supplementation in subjects from these two groups. Five healthy males from each group ingested one capsule (400 IU) of vitamin E daily for 60 days. Blood and 24 h urine samples were collected at baseline and on day 60; 24 h dietary questionnaires were simultaneously completed. Urine composition was determined by routine analyses. Urinary and plasma TBARS were determined using a commercially available assay kit while plasma vitamin E was determined by reverse phase HPLC. Plasma vitamin E increased significantly in W but not in B. Urinary and plasma TBARS did not increase in either group. Urinary citrate increased significantly in both groups but the percentage increase in W (169%) was greater than that in B (82%). No other urinary parameter changed significantly. The increase in plasma vitamin E in W but not in B suggests either that the mechanism by which it is packaged into chylomicrons, which are secreted into the systemic circulation, is suppressed in the latter group or that it is differentially absorbed in the two groups. Similarly, to explain the greater increase in citraturia in W compared to B, we speculate that inhibition of lipogenesis of arachidonic acid by vitamin E, ultimately leading to an increase in citraturia, occurs to a lesser extent in B than in W. [Crystal growth of calcite from calcium bicarbonate solutions at constant PCO2 and 25\u00b0C: a test of calcite Plummer, Niel; Busenberg, E. 1981-01-01 A highly reproducible seeded growth technique was used to study calcite crystallization from calcium bicarbonate solutions at 25\u00b0C and fixed carbon dioxide partial pressures between 0.03 and 0.3 atm. The results are not consistent with empirical crystallization models that have successfully described calcite growth at low PCO2 (< 103 atm). Good agreement was found between observed crystallization rates and those calculated from the calcite dissolution rate law and mechanism proposed by Plummer et al. (1978). [Cocrystal Screening of Ibuprofen with Oxalic Acid and Citric Acid via Grinding A. Ahmad 2018-05-01 Ibuprofen is a Class II Biological Safety Class (BSC) drugs used for relief of arthritis, as an analgesic and possesses the effect of antiplatelet. The major problem involves in ibuprofen is it has a low solubility and high permeability thus causes an unsatisfactory therapeutic effect to humans. Thus, in this work, alteration of ibuprofen's physicochemical properties is conducted by means of cocrystallization technique. Co-crystallizations of ibuprofen were prepared with selected coformers using dry grinding and liquid assisted grinding (LAG) techniques in different molar ratios while ethanol and propanol were used as a solvent. The new crystalline forms were identified and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Analysis for (IBP-CA) system, co-crystal was successfully formed in 1:2, 1:3, 2:1 and 3:1 molar ratios for neat grinding method although the co-crystal produced is unstable. Meanwhile, for Ibuprofen-Oxalic acid (IBP-OA) system, the co-crystal formation was identified only in 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 molar ratios for the neat grinding method. LAG method shows that co-crystal formation was unsuccessful in both solvents for IBP-CA, while IBP-OA co-crystal was formed in the molar ratio 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 in ethanol, and 2:1 and 3:1 in propanol. [Inhibition of calcium carbonate crystal growth by organic additives using the constant composition method in conditions of recirculating cooling circuits](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017JCrGr.472...35C) used in power plants are subject to mineral crystallization which can cause scaling on the surfaces of equipment and construction materials reducing their heat exchange efficiency. Precipitated calcium carbonate is the predominant mineral scale commonly observed in cooling systems. Supersaturation is the key parameter controlling the nucleation and growth of calcite in these systems. The present work focuses on the precipitation of calcite using the constant composition method at constant supersaturation, through controlled addition of reactants to a semi-batch crystallizer, in order to maintain constant solution pH. The determination of the thermodynamic driving force (supersaturation) was based on the relevant chemical equilibria, total alkalinity and calculation of the activity coefficients. Calcite crystallization rates were derived from the experiments performed at supersaturation levels similar to those found in industrial station cooling circuits. Several types of seeds particles were added into the aqueous solution to mimic natural river water conditions in terms of suspended particulate matters content, typically: calcite, silica or illite particles. The effect of citric and copolycarboxylic additive inhibitors added to the aqueous solution was studied. The calcium carbonate growth rate was reduced by 38.6% in the presence of the citric additive and a reduction of 92.7% was observed when the copolycarboxylic additive was used under identical experimental conditions. These results are explained by the location of the adsorbed inhibitor at the crystal surface and by the degree of chemical bonding to the surface.

[Evidence for a cytoplasmic pathway of oxalate biosynthesis in Aspergillus G.; to 8 g/liter was induced in Aspergillus niger by shifting the pH from 6 to 8. This required the presence of P/sub i/ and a nitrogen source and was inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide.

The putative enzyme that was responsible for this oxaloacetate hydrolase (EC 3.7.1.1), which was induced de novo pH shift. Subcellular fractionation of oxalic acid-forming mycelia of A. niger showed that this enzyme is located in the cytoplasm of A. niger. The results are consistent with a cytoplasmic pathway of oxalate formation which does not involve the tricarboxylic acid cycle.\u00ab less [HOW DO STONES FORM? IS UNIFICATION OF THEORIES ON STONE FORMATION POSSIBLE?](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5683182) Bird, Victoria Y.; Khan, Saeed R. 2017-01-01 Summary There are two basic pathways for formation of calcium based kidney stones. Most idiopathic calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones are formed in association with sub-epithelial plaques of calcium phosphate (CaP), known as Randall's plaques, on renal papillary surfaces. Crystal formation and retention within the terminal collecting ducts, the ducts of Bellini, leading to the formation of Randall's plugs, is the other pathway. Both pathways require supersaturation leading to crystallization, regulated by various crystallization modulators produced in response to changing urinary conditions. High supersaturation, as a result of a variety of genetic and environmental factors, leads to crystallization in the terminal collecting ducts, eventually plugging their openings into the renal pelvis. Stasis behind the plugs may lead to the formation of attached or unattached stones in the tubular lumen. Deposition of crystals on the plug surface facing the pelvic or tubular urine may result in stone formation on the Randall's plugs. Kidneys of idiopathic stone formers may be subjected to oxidative stress as a result of increased urinary excretion of calcium/oxalate/phosphate and/or decrease in the production of functional crystallization inhibitors or in relation to co-morbidities such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, or acute kidney injury. We have proposed that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes dedifferentiation of epithelial/endothelial cells into osteoblast type cells and deposition of CaP in the basement membrane of renal tubules or vessels. Growth, aggregation and melding of CaP crystals leads to the formation of plaque which grows by further calcification of interstitial collagen and membranous vesicles. Plaque becomes exposed to pelvic urine once the covering papillary epithelium is breached. Surface layers of CaP are replaced by CaOx through direct transformation or demineralization of CaP and mineralization of CaOx.

The high-temperature phase is isostructural nm 3, Z=4 and D x=3.45 Mg m -3. The crystal structure was refined with a split-atom model, in which the oxygen atoms are distributed over two partially occupied sites. Below the stable temperature range of eulytite, the crystal underwent a martensitic transformation, which is accompanied by the formation of platelike surface reliefs. The inverted crystal is triclinic x=3.24 Mg m -3. The crystal grains were composed of pseudo-merohedral twins. The adjacent twin domains were related by the pseudo-symmetry mirror planes parallel to {101\u00af} with the composition surface {101\u00af}. When the eulytite was cooled relatively slowly from the stable temperature range, the decomposition reaction of Ca 3Y(PO 4) 3 -Ca 3(PO 4) 2+YPO 4 occurred. [Reflectance spectroscopy of oxalate minerals and relevance to Solar System carbon inventories](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016Icar..278....7A) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Applin, M.; Cloutis, Edward A. 2016-11-01 The diversity of oxalate formation mechanisms suggests that significant concentrations of oxalic acid and oxalate minerals could be widely distributed in the Solar System. We have carried out a systematic study of the reflectance spectra of oxalate minerals and oxalic acid, covering the 0.2-16 m wavelength region. Our analyses show that oxalates exhibit unique spectral features that enable discrimination between oxalate phases and from other commonly occurring compounds, including carbonates, in all regions of the spectrum except for the visible. Using these spectral data, we consider the possible contribution of oxalate minerals to previously observed reflectance spectra of many objects throughout the Solar System, including satellites, comets, and asteroids. We find that polycarboxylic acid dimers and their salts may explain the reflectance spectra of many carbonaceous asteroids in the 3 m spectral region. We suggest surface concentration of these compounds may be a type of space weathering from the photochemical and oxidative decomposition of the organic macromolecular material found in carbonaceous chondrites. The stability and ubiquity of these minerals on Earth, in extraterrestrial materials, and in association with biological processes make them useful for many applications in Earth and planetary sciences.
