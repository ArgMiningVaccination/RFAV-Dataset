Aim This study assessed the ef fectiveness of spiritual healing for asthma. Design of study Randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Setting Aber deen, Scotland. Method This was a single-blind, three-armed randomised, contr olled trial of spiritual healing for asthma, comparing the ef fectiveness of five sessions of spiritual healing with placebo (delivered by an actor), and with a control group receiving normal car eonly.The primary outcome measure was the Juniper Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). Secondary outcomes were forcedexpiratory flow in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (Hospital Anxiety Depr ession Scale), SF-36 and MYMOP (Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile). Baseline and follow-up data wer ecollected. Results Eighty-eight adult patients receiving pharmacological treatment for asthma participated. AQLQ scores improved significantly from baseline and the end of treatment in all groups (spiritual healing P=0.008; 'sham' healing P=0.001 and contr ol P=0.01) but there was no significant difference between groups ( P= 0.57). These improvements were maintained at follow-up 1 for two of the gr oups (spiritual healing P=0.016; sham healing P=0.001 and control P=0.09) but none of the groups showed an improvement at follow-up 2(spiritual healing P=0.161; sham healing P=0.016 and control P=0.11). Similar proportions of patients in each group showed a clinically important improvement inAQLQ scor e. Analysis of AQLQ scor es at end of treatment and both follow-up periods indicated no significance between group differences. No consistentchanges wer eseen in secondary outcome measures, possibly due to the small sample size. Conclusion Spiritual healing does not appear to have any specific affect on patient asthma related quality of life.

INTRODUCTION The costs of poorly controlled asthma are high.1 Many patients with asthma experience significant morbidity and lifestyle limitation, and tolerate ahigher rate of symptoms than would berecommended by guidelines. 1-3There is increasing interest in factors that may facilitate the management of asthma, r educe the r equir ement for pharmacotherapy and help patients achieve a higher level of control, thus improving quality of life andactivity levels, as well as r educing the emotional burden of disease. 4 The uptake of complementary ,or alter native, medicine by the public is high and incr easing,5 reflecting that patients are progressively expressing their pr eferences for tr eatments.6Complementary and alter native medicine (CAM) has become increasingly topical in respiratory medicine.7 However, the British Thoracic Society (BTS)/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN)guidelines 8state that currently available evidence does not allow any evidence-basedrecommendations for the use of herbal and traditional Chinese medicine, ionisers, acupuncture,homeopathy or hypnosis for asthma.

However, only ifrigorous, scientific standards are applied to theevaluation of CAM, and conclusive evidence ofeffectiveness sought, will the medical profession beencouraged to adopt CAM as standard health care. 9 Well-controlled studies with outcome measures other than lung function are required to provideevidence of the effectiveness of CAM. Spiritual healing is a non-invasive complementary therapy that has been available in the UK since1977. Spiritual healing has been used in thetreatment of restricted neck movement, 10chronic pain11and anxiety.12Asystematic review of distant healing (prayer, mental healing, therapeutic touch orspiritual healing) found that approximately 57% ofthe trials reviewed showed a positive treatmenteffect, concluding that the evidence thus far meritsfurther study. 13There is some evidence of positive benefits of spiritual healing in quality of life, as wellas in physical dimensions. 14,15However, these studies lack control groups or have othermethodological limitations and, thus, theirconclusions are limited. Spiritual healing has notbeen evaluated in r eference to its ef fectiveness in patients with asthma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of spiritual healing in asthma in a thr ee- arm (contr ol, 'sham' and spiritual healing) pragmatic randomised contr olled trial. Design This was a randomised, controlled trial of spiritual healing in asthma. The study was pragmatic, single-blind and thr ee-armed, comparing the ef fectiveness of five sessions of spiritual healing with placebo, or sham treatment. The control group received normalcareplus nurse-collected outcome data at the same intervals. Clinical, psychological and quality of life outcomes were compared across groups. Baselineand follow-up data wer ecollected. Questionnaire data was collected from all participants at week 0 (baseline 1) and week 2(baseline 2) in or der to resolve the issues of spontaneous improvement in health status. 15Data was then collected in week 4 (first weekly treatment),week 8 (last [fifth] tr eatment, T5), week 12 (short-term follow-up 1) and week 26 (long-term follow-up 2). Recruitment The study was conducted in Aber deen, Scotland. Subjects were responders to press advertisementsand advertisements in GP surgeries. Eligibility criteriawerean age >18 years, a diagnosis of asthma for more than 1 year, receiving pharmacologicaltreatment for asthma, and patient-reported asthma confirmed by the patient's GP . Participants continuedwith their individually prescribed treatment as usualwith spiritual healing as an additional treatment.Permission for inclusion in the study was soughtfrom the patient's GP . Participants were randomised into one of the three groups, stratified by sex and age. An independentresearcher was given a list of consenting patientsand, using computer -generated random numbers in blocks of three, allocated a group to each patient. Participants were blind as to whether or not theywerereceiving spiritual healing or sham healing. All participants had their FEV1 and PEF measured by an independent nurse, blinded to treatment and controlgroupings of the participants, at each time point in the study. Questionnaires were completed at these points, and on each visit for tr eatment and data collection. All three groups provided outcome data at the same intervals. Treatment The tr eatment offered was 'spiritual healing' defined as: '... the use of prayer ,healing, meditation and laying on of hands, by the \"healer\" with the intention of promoting self-healing, a sense of wellbeing,peace and r estoration of the balance of body, mind and spirit of the participant' (National Federation of Spiritual Healers, http://www.nfsh.org.uk/). Treatment and measur ement wer eundertaken at a private CAM suite in central Aberdeen. A single healer with 16 years experience and a diploma inspiritual healing undertook the healing sessions. Thehealer used the same verbal explanation and guidedvisualisation for all cases. The procedure in theplacebo gr oup was identical other than the intervention (sham healing) was deliver ed by an actor who had been trained by the healer to duplicate his actions. Sessions lasted for 40 minutes. How this fits in Patients are turning to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the absence of evidence of effectiveness. There are few rigorous studies of CAM forasthma and the BTS/SIGN guidelines currently state that there is insufficientevidence for provision of homeopathy, acupuncture, etc, for asthma. Thisrandomised controlled trial of spiritual healing for asthma did not find anyevidence for effectiveness, indicating that this particular CAM should not becurrently recommended. However, our results suggest that additional input fromaprofessional interested in the patient's asthma may lead to improvements in patient-reported quality of life. These gains are not maintained once additionalcontact ends. Original Papers 445JA Cleland, DB Price, AJ Lee, et al British Journal of General Practice, June 2006 446Outcome measures The primary outcome measur ewas the Juniper Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)16where,based on the results of previous studies examining asthma management, a clinically relevant improvement is an increase of more than or equal to0.5 in individual AQLQ mean scores. The primary timepoints for comparison were time of randomisation(baseline 2) and end of treatment (T5). Based on 95%confidence, 90% power and a clinically relevant(within and between group) 0.5 increase on the Juniper AQLQ 16using a standard deviation of change in overall AQLQ of 0.64 reported by Juniper et al,pre- study study power calculation indicated that asample size of 35 was required per group. Secondary outcome measures were selected in order to reflect the wider dimensions of the impact of asthma: The SF-36 General Health Questionnaire: 17awell- validated measure of general health used inprevious studies of spiritual healing. 10 The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADs):18awell-validated, widely-used measure of mental health status also used in pr evious studies of spiritual healing.10 The Measur ofile (MYMOP):19this assesses patients' per ceptions of their current health status and medication use. Ithas been used in studies of complementarymedicine in UK primary car e. 20 Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Peak expiratory flow (PEF). Basic demographic data, information on other treatments and any previous experience of spiritual healing was also collected. Analysis SPSS for Windows was used for data processing and analysis (SPSS for Windows, SPSS Inc.,Chicago, IL.). The statistical analysis was performed.During analysis, the study groups were anonymisedin order to minimise biased reporting. Groups wereexamined at baseline 2 for demographiccharacteristics, clinical status and for scores on thequestionnaire measures. Changes from baseline 2 inoutcome measur es to end of treatment (T5) and both follow-ups, within each of the three groups, wereassessed using either McNemar's test or paired t- tests wher eappropriate, depending on whether categorical or continuous. Analysis of covariancewas used to examine between gr oup dif ferences in asthma quality of life at follow-up 1 and follow-up 2 after adjustment for baseline 2 dif ferences. An intention to tr eat analysis was performed thr oughout. For primary outcomes, a P-value of 0.05 was used to denote statistical significance, while a value of 0.01was used for secondary outcomes.Group AQLQ mean score Spiritual healing Sham healing Control Improvement change 0.5 End of tr eatment 42.0 (10) 43.0 (12) 28.6 (8) Follow up 1 41.0 (9) 61.0 (14) 40.9 (9) Follow up 2 38.0 (8) 32.0 (9) 34.6 (9) Maintenance change > -0.5 to <0.5 End of tr eatment 50.0 (12) 50.0 (14) 60.7 (17) Follow up 1 50.0 (11) 26.0 (6) 40.9 (9) Follow up 2 38 (8) 54.0 (15) 46.2 (12) Deterioration change -0.5 End of tr eatment 8.0 (2) 7.0 (2) 10.7 (3) Follow up 1 9.0 (2) 13.0 (3) 18.2 (4) Follow up 2 24.0 (5) 14.0 (4) 19.2 (5) Missing data End of treatment 11.0 (3) 6.0 (2) 9.7 (3) Follow-up 1 19 (5) 23 (7) 29.0 (9) Follow-up 2 22 (6) 7.0 (2) 16.1 (5) Net improversb End of as %.

Original Papers RESULTS Recruitment took place between October 2001 and October 2003. Three hundred and nine patientsresponded to the study advertisements of whom286were eligible. Eleven were ruled out as possible participants by their GP . 101 patients attendedbaseline 1: and 93 attended baseline 2. Ninety-two patients were randomised. Four dropped out afterT1 and thus were not included in the currentanalysis. Groups appeared well matched in terms of age, sex, whether or not they had previous experience of spiritual healing, smoking status, or clinical and health outcome measures at baseline (Table 1). Mean change in AQLQ scores from baseline Examination of the distribution of individual AQLQ scores at baseline 2, end of treatment and bothfollow-ups indicated that the untransformed datawas more normally distributed than that resultingfrom log or square root transformations and, hence,the untransformed data was utilised. Each groupreported a significant improvement in mean (95%CI) asthma quality of life scores between baseline 2and end of treatment (spiritual healing = 0.64 [0.18to These impr ovements wer emaintained at follow-up healing= 0.67 [0.14 P=0.001), but dropped to non- significance at follow-up 2 in all gr oups (spiritual healing P=0.161; sham healing P=0.061 and control P=0.115). Clinical important differences in AQLQ scores Numbers of patients in each group for whom AQLQ scores wer eavailable at end of tr eatment, short- term follow up and long-term follow up are indicated in Table 2. A similar proportion of patientsin the spiritual healing and sham healing groups showed deterioration, no change or impr oved overall mean AQLQ scor es at the end of tr eatment (Figure 1 and Table 2).

The proportion of patients reporting improved AQLQ scores at follow-up 2 wassimilar in all three groups ( P=0.62). Sham healing exhibited the greatest number of net improverscores (per cent showing improvement minus those showing deterioration in AQLQ scores) although, asstated, there were no statistically significantdifferences between groups at the end of treatment,or at either follow-up. Table 3 shows the results of the between groups analyses of AQLQ scores at end of treatment andfollow-up visits following adjustment for baseline 2values. Although all groups showed an improvementin scor es, there was no significant difference between groups at any of the three time points (all P>0.05). Other differences between groups at end of treatment and follow-up The change in median PEF scores from baseline 2 to end of treatment did not differ significantly by group( P=0.32). Each gr oup r eported impr oved scores on the SF36 General Health sum of scores between baseline 2 and each of end of treatment, follow-up 1and 2. However ,it should be noted that ther ewas wide variation in SF36 scores within all three groups at each time point. At follow-up 1 (week 12), the contr ol gr oup reported more severe symptoms and symptom impact on the MYMOP than did the sham healingand spiritual healing groups ( P=0.02). The earlier 'end of treatment' (week 8) median score showed asimilar trend ( P=0.05). This difference was not maintained at follow-up 2, week 26 ( P=0.44). The spiritual healing group reported fewer numbers ofparticipants reaching 'caseness' on anxiety onfollow-up 1 ( P=0.03) but this change was not seen at the end of treatment ( P=1.0) or follow-up 2 ( P= 0.06). The group had FEV1 at follow-up 1 compared tobaseline ( P=0.01), but this change was not seen at the end of treatment ( P=0.58), nor maintained at follow-up 2 ( P=0.27). The sham healing group also had significantly poorer results on PEF at follow-up1compared to baseline ( P=0.01), but this change was not seen at the end of treatment ( P=0.72), nor maintained at follow-up 2 ( P=0.72). DISCUSSION Summary of main findings This study found no evidence for statistically significant or clinically valuable impacts fr om spiritual healing for asthma. When compared to sham healing and the control group, spiritualhealing had no better impact on clinical outcomedata, quality of life scores, and self-reported mental and general health status in patients with asthma.The main finding of interest of this study was that allthree groups showed significant improvements inAQLQ and SF36 scores at the end of the main trial.The small sample size of the study limits conclusions but we suggest that the data seems todemonstrate a 'Hawthorne effect' 21where ongoing, regular (additional to normal) contact withhealthcare professionals/researchers who areinterested in the patient and their asthma, isassociated with an improvement in patient healthand quality of life ratings. Thus, it may be that it isnot who provides the complementary input, or whatthe natur eof that input is, that matters. Rather the additional input itself, in this case due to clinical trial participation, may af fect patient outcomes in a beneficial manner .Alternatively, it may be that those volunteering to take part in the study could have been at a low point in terms of individual asthmarelated quality of life and some improvement fromthe point of recruitment may have been expectedwithout intervention. Strengths and limitations of the study This was a pragmatic, single-blind randomised controlled trial of an area of treatment (CAM) oftencriticised for poorly designed and methodologicallyunsound studies. In addition, this is the first r eported pragmatic randomised controlled trial of spiritual healing for chr onic disease management that includes an appropriate placebo group (sham healing). As recommended by the British Thoracic Society, weadopted outcome measures other than lung function.Apossible limitation of this study was the use of one spiritual healer. While this could be argued to allow forconsistency in terms of delivery of spiritual healing, amore robust design would have been to use a numberof healers in order to control for the effect of anindividual, rather than the effect of a technique.Another limitation was the small sample size. This mayreflect that spiritual healing appeals to fewer patientsthan some other CAM therapies which are moreorganised and regulated, and have a research base aswell as being available in parts of the NHS(acupuncture, chiropractice, herbal medicine,homeopathy, and osteopathy). In addition, patientswere recruited from only one area of Scotland; thismay have limited recruitment and generalisability. Comparison with existing literature This is the first reported evaluation of spiritual healing for asthma in a primary car esetting and this is one of the few studies of CAM using robust, controlled and randomised methodology. Our results are similar tothose of pr eviously published well-designed studiesBritish Jour nal of General Practice, June 2006of other CAM therapies for asthma in that we have found no evidence for the use of a specific form ofCAM, spiritual healing. CAM studies reporting patientimprovements have been criticised for poormethodological quality: our finding that all threegroups demonstrated similar improvements supports the need for robust, randomised trials of CAMtreatments for asthma, so the effects of trialparticipation can be separated from those of thetreatment under scrutiny. Implications for clinical practice and future research The majority of alternative medicine users appear to be turning to complementary medicine so largelybecause they find these healthcare alternatives to bemore congruent with their own values, beliefs, andphilosophical orientations toward health and life. 13,22 Our results indicate that it may not be the complementary therapy per se that is the key topatient preferences for CAM. Rather the effect seemsnon-specific: the patient-centr ed and holistic consultation, diagnosis and treatment inherent in CAM may be the basis for patients turning to suchtreatments. Bearing in mind that this is a small study with low numbers, our results do not provide support for theNHS provision of spiritual healing for asthma. However, future qualitative research exploring patient views of CAM consultations, and comparingthese with traditional medicine consultations, mayidentify the key differences which are of importanceto patients.
