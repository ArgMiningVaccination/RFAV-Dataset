The following vaccines are recommended starting at age 9 years to protect preteens and teens from these diseases: Why get these vaccines? Immunization helps prevent the spread of diseases and protects families and your community. These vaccines are recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) ( https://www.aap.org/ immunization ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ( https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ schedules ). These vaccines are safe. Before being licensed, each vaccine was carefully studied by scientific experts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continually monitors the safety of all vaccines, which are held to the highest standards. It is normal and expected to have minor vaccine side effects. Most side effects are mild (eg, sore arm). Serious side effects (eg, severe allergic reaction) are rare. Catch-up If your teen did not receive one or more of these vaccines between ages 9 to 12, they should receive the vaccines now.IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE Disease Vaccine Recommended Schedule Meningococcal sepsis and meningococcal meningitisMeningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) At ages 11-12 Teens need a booster dose at age 16.

PRETEENS AND TEENS NEED VACCINES TO... TEACH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM HOW TO RECOGNIZE A VIRUS OR BACTERIA SO THEIR BODY KNOWS HOW TO RESPOND IF THEY ARE EXPOSED TO THE GERMS. PROTECT THEM FROM GERMS THAT CAN SPREAD EASILY PERSON TO PERSON. HELP THE IMMUNE SYSTEM BUILD UP ITS OWN LONG-TERM PROTECTION TO DISEASES. KEEP THEM SAFE AND HEALTHY AS THEY GROW. FLU VACCINE Why vaccinate against flu? The main reason for preteens and teens to get an influenza vaccine is to protect them. Flu can be serious\u2014 even active, healthy teens can have serious complications that require hospitalization. The vaccine provides protection from critical and life- threatening illness from influenza. Even in seasons when the vaccine is not an exact match with the circulating strains, it prevents serious complications. Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza in people at high risk of complications if they get infected. For most people, flu can cause \u00bbFever \u00bbCough \u00bbSore throat \u00bbHeadache \u00bbChills \u00bbMuscle aches \u00bbFatigue Flu can be deadly. Each flu season, about 37 to 199 children and teens die from influenza. About 80% were not fully vaccinated. Flu vaccine There are 2 types of seasonal flu vaccines. \u00bbInactivated (killed) vaccine that is given by an injection (shot) \u00bbLive attenuated (weakened) vaccine that is sprayed into the nose (nasal spray) Everyone 6 months and older , including preteens and teens, should receive a flu vaccine every year . A flu vaccine is needed every year because \u00bbFlu viruses change most years. \u00bbYearly vaccination helps keep immunity up. Without vaccination, immunity can fade within a year . It takes about 2 weeks to be fully protected after getting the flu vaccine. \u00bbIt is best to get vaccinated before flu begins to spread and as soon as the vaccine is available (in late summer or early fall) \u00bbFlu can circulate from early fall through late spring and sometimes later . Your preteen or teen should still get the vaccine if they missed getting it at the start of the season. Flu vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.Common side ef fects of the flu vaccine Flu vaccines have been given to hundreds of millions of people for more than 50 years and have a very good safety record. Side effects following inactivated flu shot can include \u00bbSoreness, redness, and swelling where the shot is given \u00bbFever , muscle aches, and headache Side effects following live intranasal flu spray can include \u00bbRunny nose or nasal congestion, wheezing, and headache \u00bbVomiting, muscle aches, fever , sore throat, and cough are other possible side effects \u00bbIf these problems occur , they usually begin soon after vaccination and are mild and short-lived Severe side effects are extremely rare Flu vaccine does not give people the flu Some people get a flu-like illness shortly after they get the flu vaccine. There are a few reasons for this. \u00bbYou may be infected by a virus other than flu. The flu vaccine only prevents illnesses caused by flu viruses. \u00bbYou may have been infected by a flu virus before the vaccine took effect. It takes about 2 weeks after you receive the vaccine for your body to build protection against the flu. \u00bbYou may be infected by a strain of the flu virus that is different from those in this year's vaccine. Flu vaccines vary in how well they work, and some vaccinated individuals can still get sick. But the flu vaccine still reduces severity of illness in these situations.Use the accompanying family-friendly page to start the conversation about the flu vaccine.FLU VACCINE FLU VACCINES CAN'T GIVE YOU THE FLU.

Many people don't realize it, but the flu can be a very serious illness. Even active and healthy kids and teens can become sick with flu and experience serious complications. Getting your child vaccinated is the best way to prevent them from severe influenza disease and is especially important for those at high risk for complications. HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINE About human papillomavirus HPV stands for human papillomavirus. HPV can cause genital warts and several types of cancers that affect the \u00bb Back of the throat, base of the tongue, and tonsils \u00bbAnus \u00bbCervix, vulva, and vagina \u00bbPenis All of these cancers can be deadly. HPV is spread by intimate skin-to-skin contact or by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the virus, even if they don't have signs or symptoms. It only takes one encounter or one partner to transmit the infection. Exposure to this virus is very common. \u00bbExperts estimate that almost all sexually active people will acquire HPV at some point in their lives. \u00bb Of new HPV cases, 3 out of 4 are found in people at ages 15 to 24 years. \u00bb About 13 million people in the United States, including teens, become infected each year . In most people, the virus goes away on its own, but if it lasts it can lead to cancer and other diseases. Each year more than 46,000 people are diagnosed with HPV related cancers. There is no medicine to cure an HPV infection. Why vaccinate against HPV? Getting HPV vaccine can prevent your preteen or teen from getting many of the strains of HPV that cause cancers. The vaccine that is currently available also prevents genital warts. This vaccine works and is long-lasting. HPV vaccine The AAP recommends starting the series between 9 and 12 years. HPV vaccination is recommended for all individuals through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. Some adults 27 through 45 years old also may be eligible for the HPV vaccine. Why is HPV given at ages 9 to 12? To work, HPV vaccine must be given before a person is exposed. Every visit after the age of 9 is an opportunity to provide the vaccine to preteens and teens. Almost no 9- to 12-year-olds have HPV infection. After receiving human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, preteens make more infection-fighting antibodies than teens. That is why only 2 doses of the vaccine, instead of 3, are recommended at ages 9 to 12. Early vaccination prevents substantially more cases of precancer (abnormal cells that lead to cancer) than late vaccination. Current evidence shows that protection from HPV vaccination does not wear off! The dosing schedule is as follows: All recommended doses of the HPV vaccine are needed for the body to build up enough immunity to protect against infection. This is also true of many of the vaccines that babies get. Common side ef fects of the HPV vaccine HPV vaccine is very safe. Since the vaccine was licensed in 2006, no serious safety concerns have been linked to HPV vaccination. Vaccine side ef fects Mild to moderate side effects \u00bbPain, redness, or swelling where the shot was given \u00bbFever Mild (100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) Severe side ef fects Serious illnesses do not happen more commonly in people who received the vaccine compared with those who did not.ScheduleRecommended ForDoseRoutine Timing of DoseMinimum Intervals 2-dose Persons beginning human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination before their 15th birthday1st Today Minimum interval between the first and second dose is 5 months 2nd 6-12 mo after first dose 3-dose Persons beginning HPV vaccination at age 15 and those who are immunocompromised1st Today The following minimum intervals should be maintained: Between doses 1 and 2: 4 wk Between doses 2 and 3: 12 wk Between doses 1 and 3: 5 mo2nd 1-2 mo after first dose 3rd 6 mo after first dose Use the speaking points on this page and share the accompanying infographics with families.HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINE Here's Why Your Preteen Needs the HPV Vaccine PRE-TEENS PRODUCE MORE ANTIBODIES AFTER HPV VACCINATION.

The bacteria can lead to \u00bb Meningitis: an infection of the brain and spinal cord \u00bbMeningococcal sepsis: a very serious blood infection Anyone can get meningococcal disease, but among young people it is most common in babies and people aged 16 to 23 years. Meningococcal disease can lead to \u00bbDeath \u00bbBlindness \u00bbDeafness \u00bbLoss of limbs \u00bbOther long-term problems Even if treated soon after infection, 10 to 15 people out of 100 will die. About 10 to 20 out of every 100 survivors will have a long-term disability. Rates of meningococcal disease have declined in the United States. In 2019, there were about 371 total cases reported. (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/surveillance/index.html ). There are two meningococcal vaccines, MenACWY and MenB, that protect against different strains of meningococcal disease. There are other causes of meningitis that are not prevented by meningococcal vaccines. They include other meningococcal strains that are not in the vaccine, other bacteria (such as Haemophilus influenzae type b and streptococci), fungi, and viruses. Meningococcal ACWY vaccine This routinely recommended vaccine (MenACWY) protects preteens and teens from 4 meningococcal bacteria (strains A, C, W , and Y). Preteens at ages 11 to 12 years should receive the vaccine. The recommended meningococcal vaccine protects preteens and teens from the strains of meningococcus that cause about 3 out of 4 cases of meningococcal disease. However , even people who are vaccinated need to take the signs of meningitis seriously because meningococcal vaccines do not prevent every form of meningitis. Booster dose \u00bb One dose of meningococcal ACWY vaccine protects a person, but immunity wanes over time. \u00bb Your teen will need a booster dose when they are 16. \u00bb This will keep your teen fully protected during the rest of the years when they are at highest risk of getting meningococcal disease.Common side ef fects of the MenACWY vaccine Redness or pain may develop where the shot is given. This lasts 1 to 2 days. A small percentage of people who receive the shot will develop a mild fever . Serious reactions are very rare. Meningococcal B vaccine Protection against meningococcal B disease requires a specific vaccine called meningococcal B vaccine (MenB). MenB protects people from one strain of meningococcus (strain B) that causes about one-third of meningococcal disease in the United States. In recent years, there have been many college outbreaks of meningococcal B disease, but overall the disease is rare. MenB provides protection against most strains that cause meningococcal B disease. The preferred age for vaccination is 16 through 18 years. It may be given to people who are 16 years old through 23 years old if they are not at increased risk. High-risk people, too: MenB is recommended routinely for people 10 years or older who are at increased risk for infections from meningococcal B disease. More than half of the people who get a MenB vaccine have mild side effects following vaccination: \u00bbSoreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given \u00bbFeeling tired (fatigue) \u00bbHeadache \u00bbMuscle or joint pain \u00bbFever or chills \u00bbNausea or diarrhea Severe side effects are rare. The two MenB vaccine brands are different. The same vaccine brand must be used for all doses in a series. MenB schedule : For protection, more than 1 dose of a MenB vaccine is needed. The number of doses and the interval between them depend on the brand. MenB vaccine can be given at the same time as MenACWY vaccine, if indicated, but at different anatomic sites if feasible. \u00bb How long does protection last? For most people protection lasts 24 to 48 months after vaccination.Use the speaking points on this page with the accompanying family-friendly infographics.MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINES MENINGOCOCCAL BACTERIA CAN CAUSE INFECTIONS LIKE:Bacteremia or septicemia Bloodstream infections Meningitis An infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord THERE ARE VACCINES AVAILABLE TO HELP PROTECT YOUR CHILD.MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE ACTS FAST AND IS LIFE-THREATENING , SO PRETEENS AND TEENS NEED VACCINES AND BOOSTERS ON TIME TO STAY PROTECTED.

Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is the booster dose. Preteens need to receive this vaccine at ages 11 to 12 years to boost their immunity so they will be better protected against these diseases. The Tdap vaccine takes the place of the tetanus diphtheria booster dose that used to be given to teens. Recently, there have been several outbreaks of pertussis (whooping cough) throughout the United States. \u00bbThis is in part because the effect of the childhood vaccine wears off over time. If a child did not get the vaccine at ages 11 to 12, they should get it now. Vaccinating preteens and teens not only protects them from whooping cough but also protects any babies around them who might be too young to be protected by the DTaP vaccine (eg, baby sister or brother). Common side ef fects of the Tdap vaccine Redness or pain where the shot was given Headache Tiredness Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or stomach ache Mild fever of at least 100.4\u00b0F or 38\u00b0CUse the conversation starters here with the accompanying infographics for families.TETANUS, DIPHTHERIA, PERTUSSIS VACCINE Babies and younger children are vaccinated against these diseases with the DTaP vaccine, but immunity decreases over time.

Each year , up to 400 million people around the world are infected with dengue. Most people have no symptoms or mild disease. Some people experience sudden onset of fever with nausea, vomiting, a rash, and eye, muscle, joint, or bone aches and pains. A smaller number of people will have severe disease which is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention. In rare cases, dengue can have serious side effects and lead to death. Dengue vaccine Dengue vaccine is NOT recommended for travelers. Dengue vaccine is recommended for children 9-16 years old who \u00bbhave a history of dengue infection in the past confirmed by a laboratory test. \u00bblive in an area where dengue is common, including the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and freely associated states including the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. Three doses are required: \u00bbSecond dose given 6 months after the first. \u00bbThird dose given 6 months after the second. Common side ef fects of the dengue vaccine Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot is given, tiredness or weakness, fever , headache, fatigue, or muscle pain can happen after dengue vaccination. If a person who has never had dengue in the past gets dengue vaccine, they are at increased risk of severe disease if they become infected with dengue in the future. Severe reactions are rare. Pair this page with the infographics page when talking with families about dengue vaccine.DENGUE VACCINE Dengue can cause sudden fever with nausea, vomiting, a rash, and eye, muscle, joint, or bone aches and pains. Preteens and teens are at higher risk of serious illness and hospitalization. People who had dengue before are at more risk of severe dengue if they are infected again. It is a medical emergency and requires immediate care. In rare cases, dengue can be deadly. 400 MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE INFECTEDEACH YEAR UP TO DENGUE VACCINE WHO CAN GET IT? 9 16TO YEAR OLDS WHO:have laboratory evidence of previous dengue infection.

No. We know vaccines are safe\u2014including when multiple shots are given together . Researchers continue to study vaccines alongside other vaccines. Millions of children have safely received vaccines together . Children are exposed to many germs every day. Their immune systems fight those germs, also called antigens, to keep the body healthy. The number of antigens that children fight every day (2,000-6,000) is much more than the number of antigens in any combination of vaccines on the current schedule (150 for the whole schedule). So, children's immune systems are not overwhelmed by vaccines. Why does my child still need a vaccine if these diseases are mostly gone? Many diseases are not as common as they once were because of vaccines. However , the bacteria and viruses that cause them still exist and can still make children very sick. That is why children still need the vaccine to be protected. It is because of vaccines that children rarely get serious diseases like tetanus, measles, rubella, meningitis and polio. Can the shots be spread out over a longer period of time? It's not a good idea, for several reasons. Children need to get their vaccines on schedule so they can benefit from all the protection that vaccines give. The recommended schedule is designed to protect children when they are most vulnerable to the diseases vaccines prevent. In addition, the recommended schedule is designed to work best with a child's immune system at certain ages and at specific time intervals between doses. Any length of time without immunizations is a time without protection against vaccine-preventable diseases. Pain Even though shots may hurt, getting a vaccine is much better than having a serious disease such as cancer or meningitis. To reduce pain, stroke or apply pressure to the skin before the shot. Fainting Preteens or teens should sit or lie in the office for 15 minutes after getting a shot to prevent injury from falling caused by fainting. Vaccination at sick visits Vaccination during a mild illness is safe and effective. It does not put any extra burden on the immune system. Even when a preteen or teen isn't feeling well, it is smart to get any vaccines that are due when in the office. \u00bbFamilies are busy and it is hard to find time to come back another time to get a vaccine. \u00bbReceiving the vaccine today reduces the Amount of time a preteen or teen is still at risk for the serious disease Chance of missing the vaccine altogether Time missing school, work, or other activities (if another visit is needed) Safety All vaccines routinely recommended for preteens and teens have been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration and found to be safe and effective. The safety of each vaccine continues to be checked after it is licensed. The Vaccine Information Statements explain the side effects that can occur after receiving a vaccination. What is the cost of these vaccines? For those who do not have insurance, vaccines can be provided for free through the Vaccines for Children Program. Talk with the pediatrician's practice manager about your insurance coverage for vaccines. How long do these immunizations last? The flu vaccine changes most years and is probably only effective for about a year . That's why this vaccine is recommended every ye ar. Data suggest human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination protects for at least 10 years without any evidence of waning immunity. The protection that the meningococcal ACWY vaccine offers wanes after about 5 years. This is why teens should get a booster dose at age 16. Experts continue to study how long immunity from tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine lasts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that preteens get 1 dose of Tdap followed by Td every 10 years.Use these FAQs to answer questions and share the accompanying infographics with families during discussions about vaccines for preteens and teens.HELPFUL FACTS ABOUT ADOLESCENT VACCINES VACCINATION CO$TS You're covered.
