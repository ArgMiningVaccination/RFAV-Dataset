Continuous listening, even at normal volume, damages hair cells in the inner ear that relay sound impulses to the brain. Technology has brought significant advances in battery life, allowing iPods to play for hours without recharging. Eventually, the ear becomes desensitized to higher volume settings or hazardous noise levels. Expo - sure to 85 decibels over a sustained period of time causes hearing loss, says the National Institutes of Health. MP3 players have maximum sound output levels ranging from 115 to 130 decibels\u2014comparable to the sound level of a jet engine. To minimize the risk of hearing loss: Turn down the volume. Don't listen continuously. Stop listening if you develop tinnitus (ring - ing in the ears). Visit the Apple website for free volume-limiting iPod software at: www. apple.com/ipod/download/. Although not as trendy as earbuds that go inside the ear, consider noise-canceling headphones that block background sounds, allowing the volume to be lower.New warnings urge patients to stay on a combination of aspirin and blood thinners after placement of a drug-eluting (coated) stent to avert life-threat - ening clots that can block blood flow to the heart. More than a million Ameri - cans annually receive the stents. \"Anti-clotting medications help prevent a clot from forming in the coronary artery,\" says Paul Thompson, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's Division of Cardiology. \"Patients may need life-long drug therapy with a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix).\" Drug-eluting stents are mesh tubes that prop open narrowed arteries in the heart while slowly releasing medication to prevent the build-up of scar tissue inside the stent. While the drug coating has been shown to be success - ful in preventing the artery from re-narrowing, blood clots are slightly less likely in bare metal stents, prompting calls for more research. (See http:// www.fda.gov/cdrh/news/010407.html.) In the meantime, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interven - tions stresses careful patient selection, meticulous stent implantation, and consistent use of medications to avoid the rare, but serious, complication that can lead to a heart attack.Stents Sequel Sound Advice 2PIONEERING PROCEDURES Hoping for a Heart People with irreparably diseased or damaged hearts don't need to travel out of town and wait months in another city until a donor heart becomes available. Hartford Hospital patients can take advantage of a life-saving portable apparatus called a Thoratec ventricular assist device (VAD) that serves as a \"bridge to transplant\" for patients with life-threatening cardiac problems. \"Heart transplant candidates can be bridged with a mechanical pump that can assume the function of the left, right or both sides of the heart,\" explains Jonathan A. Hammond, M.D., director of the VAD program at the hospital. When a sudden heart attack strikes, coronary artery blockage may be so extensive that only a new heart can permanently fix the problem. The VAD does the work of the heart's pumping chambers to limit organ deterioration until a donor heart can be found. Last summer, Robin Sutherland arrived at Hartford Hospital after suffering a massive heart attack while working out at a local gym. At 39, she had no obvious cardiac risk factors. \"When I heard the words 'massive heart attack' I thought I was done,\" she says. \"Then they told me I needed a trans - plant. They gave me a VAD, started cardiac rehab and things went so well that I was able to go home while awaiting my new heart. I had never heard of that miracle device.\" \"Donor organs are a precious commodity,\" says James E. Dougherty, M.D., medical director of the Cardiac Transplant Program. \"Waiting out of state means potentially uprooting the family for months. The VAD can allow people on trans - plant lists to grow stronger while waiting for a new heart.\" More than 93,000 Americans are on lung, heart, kidney, liver, pancreas and intestine waiting lists, 200 people in the Hartford area alone. Hartford Hospital's partnership with LifeChoice Donor Services, the local organ procure - ment organization, has resulted in a rapid rise in availabil - ity of transplanted organs in recent years. \"We would like to raise community awareness about excellent outcomes in heart transplantation,\" says Dr. Dougherty. \"Over the last three years we've had a 94 per - cent survival rate, which is amazing when you consider that without a heart transplant none of these patients would have survived.\"Robin Sutherland, 39, of Bloomfield suffered a massive heart attack last July and received her new heart in October. After surgeons implanted a mechanical pump called a ventricular assist device (VAD) in her chest, she was able to begin cardiac rehab to strengthen her body before undergoing the transplant operation. She still maintains her training regimen three times a week at the HealthTrax in Avon. \"The doctors wanted a perfect match,\" she says of her donor organ. \"It's a blessing to have received this heart.\" 3Dr. Albert Kozar, D.O., a specialist in sports medicine, with members of the University of Hartford Hawks women's basketball team.

Any assault on the immune system triggers a flood of white blood cells and chemicals to repel the foreign \"intruder\"\u2014bacteria, virus, allergen or irritant. A pulled muscle, strained joint or torn ligament releases a protective inflamma - tory cascade to speed healing. When under attack, the body immediately mobilizes to fight infection or injury. Sometimes the normally protective process goes awry. An \"autoimmune\" disease results when the body battles a non-existent threat and the over-reactive defense system damages its own tissues. Autoimmune disorders like lupus, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis overwhelmingly afflict women, especially during the childbear - ing years. In pregnant women, an inflammatory response caused by a chronic infection can lead to pre-term labor. Scientists are studying how inflammation\u2014marked by redness, heat, swelling and pain\u2014sets the stage for chronic diseases like asthma, psoriasis, diabetes, cancer, atheroscle - rosis, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Researchers want to discover how infection, aging, hormones, obesity and metabolic syndrome spur inflammation. Infection with disease-causing microbes often results in a powerful inflammatory response. The protective cellular reaction turns toxic when thrown into overdrive by a persistent assault by bacteria. Under siege, the immune system strikes back by releasing a torrent of T-cells and other specialized blood cells to stop the infection, and these circulating compounds travel far and wide through every organ of the body. The inflammatory cells speed to injured areas where they destroy in - vaders and clean up dead and dying cells. Inflam - mation is a vital tool for survival. When it goes wrong, the inflammatory response turns on itself. For poorly understood reasons, the body's initial defensive healing response can spark a body-wide inflammatory over-reaction. Designed to fight infection, heal damage and store energy, the body's metabolic and immune pathways are interdependent. Obesity creates a chronic low- level inflammation that predisposes individuals to airway inflammation, heart disease and other inflammatory disorders. Scientists are continuing to gather evidence that inflammation precedes and predicts diabetes.Tendonitis Americans are facing an \"-itis\" epidemic. Re - searchers are investigating how rampaging inflam - mation leads to persistent autoimmune conditions like sinusitis, tendonitis, gastritis, rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. \"The pain - ful and acute inflammatory response of tendon itis stimulates normal healing,\" says Albert Kozar, D.O. \"Tendon osis, by contrast, is a chronic degenerative process that can develop within six to 12 weeks after an injury. Although there is less swelling and pain, the damaged tendon remains weak and vulnerable to repeat injury. Once inflammation becomes chronic, we may need to re-injure the tendon, muscle or ligament in a controlled way so that the body's own inflammatory process can promote healing.\" As an osteopathic physician, Dr. Kozar em - braces a holistic philosophy that focuses on the musculoskeletal system\u2014the nerves, muscles, and bones. \"We prescribe physical therapy\u2014lots of repetitions at low resistance\u2014to break up scar tissue and stimulate production of healing cells called fibroblasts,\" says Dr. Kozar. \"Injecting an in - jured elbow or shoulder with cortisone, a powerful anti-inflammatory steroid, helps with pain but may weaken the tendon. Prolotherapy involves inject - ing a dextrose (sugar water) solution into the ligament or tendon where it attaches to the bone. Localized inflammation increases the blood supply and flow of nutrients and stimulates the tissue to repair itself.\" Periodontal Disease An estimated 80 percent of all American adults have some degree of chronic infection and inflam - mation in the gums and underlying tissues. As the infection progresses, periodontal disease inflames the gums and plays a role in bone loss. Deep pock - ets form between the teeth and gums, loosening the teeth. Under attack, the body mobilizes its response, flooding the body with disease-fight - ing inflammatory compounds. Increased levels of \"cytokines\" involved in defending the body against infection have been linked to coronary heart dis - ease, major depression, aging and cancer. Amid research showing that bacterial infec - tion and resulting inflammation raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, scientists are studying new evidence linking periodontal disease with pancre - atic cancer, which kills 33,000 people a year in the United States. Once regarded as a localized infection, chronic inflammation of the gums may have far-reaching Inflammation is a vital tool for survival. When it goes wrong, the inflammatory response turns on itself. 5PHYSICIAN PROFILE effects throughout the body. Researchers are studying links between periodontal disease and autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular problems, metabolic syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's Disease An estimated 4.5 million people suffer from Alzheimer's disease in the United States, a number that is rising with the aging population. By 2050, nearly 19 million Americans will be 85 years or older. While the interplay of age, genetics, environmental influences and inflam - mation in Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood, it is known that chronic infection, environmental triggers, diabetes, stress or a history of depression affect the immune system and contribute to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. \"We know that certain individuals have genetic vulnerabilities,\" says Karen Blank, M.D., medical director of the Memory Disorders Center at the Institute of Living. \"Researchers are studying how periodontal disease, metabolic syndrome and insulin-resistance raise the risk for cognitive decline and dementia.\" When genes go awry, toxic fragments of beta-amyloid protein trigger neurological damage in the brain. \"Regulation of amyloid is in - fluenced by insulin,\" adds Dr. Blank. \"In the aging American population, insulin-resistance is rising along with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The 'silver tsunami' of Baby Boomers is bringing higher numbers of individu - als with the very problems associated with Alzheimer's disease.\" Dementia may be related to a chronic inflammatory reaction in areas of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease. \"Individuals with high levels of inflammatory markers in the blood have considerably in - creased risk of cognitive impairment,\" says Dr. Blank. \"Elevated plasma levels of inflammatory proteins have been linked to Alzheimer's disease and dementia. It's not known whether the inflammatory markers signal a process that contributes to cognitive impairment, or whether the inflammatory response itself causes and perpetuates brain damage.\" Heart Disease \"Over the last 10 years we have learned that inflammation plays a role in coronary artery disease,\" says Paul Thompson, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's Division of Cardiology. \"We don't know yet whether the inflammation lets cholesterol invade the artery wall or whether artery-clogging fatty deposits elicit an inflammatory response. Inflam - mation triggers an outpouring of white blood cells that eat away at the plaque, causing it to bleed and clot.\" The risk of having a heart attack may be related to inflammation caused by bacterial or viral infection. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory marker in the blood that may be predictive of cardio - vascular disease, stroke and peripheral arterial disease. People with elevated levels of CRP are at increased risk of diabetes, hypertension and recurrent coronary events. High levels of CRP have been linked with heart disease risk in patients with chest pain or a previous heart attack. Several tests for inflammatory markers in the blood measure specific enzymes and proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism. \"New Karen Blank, M.D., M.A., is medical director of the Memory Disorders Center at the Institute of Living (IOL). Areas of research interest include dementia and memory disorders, late life depression and geriatric psychiatry. She earned her Board certification from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in psychiatry in 1984 and in geriatric psychiatry in 1992. Before graduating from George Washington University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C., Dr. Blank earned her bachelor's (summa cum laude) and master's degrees from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. She did her internship and psychiatric resi - dency at Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic at the New York Hospital-Cor - nell Medical Center. She is an associate professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the University of Connecticut and a fellow of the American Psychiatric Association. In her life outside of the hospital, Dr. Blank spends her time caring for her two teenage sons, reading and cooking. She is in her third year of learning cello and partici - pates in a Suzuki orchestra. Karen Blank, M.D., M.A. 6tests are being developed and marketed heavily,\" says Dr. Thompson. \"I tell my patients not to get blown about by every gust of wind, but to pay attention to the way the trees grow. CRP testing isn't for everybody.\" Arthritis Blood tests to measure levels of CRP and rheumatoid factor may have predictive value in identifying patients at risk for joint-damaging inflam - mation. Arthritis or other chronic joint pain affects nearly 70 million people in the United States. The most common inflammatory condition in the United States, arthritis afflicts an estimated 46 million adults. The disease strikes women more often than men and is the leading cause of disability among Americans. To prevent potentially crippling joint dam - age in patients with rheumatoid arthritis\u2014the autoimmune disease that affects joints and other parts of the body\u2014specialists often begin early, aggressive treatment with a combination of drugs. But not all patients with arthritis have the progressive form of the disease. An estimated 25 million Americans have osteoarthritis, the most common type of degenerative joint disease. As the disease progresses, sufferers lose more and more of the cartilage layer that cushions joints. \"Osteoarthritis creates a painful inflammatory response in the joint, not necessarily involving the tendons and surrounding tissues or the bursa of the shoulder,\" says James T. Mazzara, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in treating shoulders and knees. \"If all else fails, knee and shoulder replacements can be considered for the painful arthritic joint that has not responded to nonsurgical treatment.\" Studies suggest that pain and stiffness often resolve on their own in as many as half of newly diagnosed arthritis patients. \"Localized inflam - mation results from 'wear and tear' arthritis,\" says Dr. Mazzara. When ste - roid injections don't quiet the inflammation, he may insert a tiny camera and operating instruments into the joint to remove irritating debris, a technique called arthroscopy. \"Stretching and strengthening can help, but injured tendons need time to heal. We can prescribe therapy and medica - tions for pain and inflammation.\" Recent news about risks associated with prescription cox-2 inhibi - tors has led to concern about overuse of medications called non-steroi - dal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). While Vioxx is no longer on the market, a similar drug called Celebrex is among the top-selling drugs among seniors. Over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen are commonly used for pain and swelling caused by muscle strain, although taking them too soon after an injury may delay healing. Research shows that NSAIDs appear to significantly reduce the age- related prevalence of Alzheimer's disease\u2014but only when taken long before the onset of symptoms. One of the most powerful NSAIDs is aspi - rin, which helps prevent heart attacks and strokes when taken regularly. Now a study suggests the analgesic also may prevent the development of asthma in adults, possibly by suppressing airway inflammation. In a healthy body, circulating antibodies attack and destroy invading pathogens. In an autoimmune disease, the body turns on itself as circu - lating antibodies seek, attack, and destroy normal cells. Across America, as the increasingly sedentary and obese population ages, the body is under siege\u2014and the enemy is ourselves.

Pain and pres - sure worsen at night, disrupting sleep with heart - burn or choking sensations. When the valve at the bottom of the esophagus functions inadequately, undigested food and stomach acid are regurgitated, eroding the esophageal lining and causing morning hoarseness. While the condition can usually be con - trolled with medication, surgery may be necessary. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a widespread complaint, afflicting nearly 20 million Americans who take heartburn medications at least twice weekly. Up to 60 million people in the United States suffer from sporadic heartburn. While half the people with GERD experience burning and indiges - tion, the other half have atypical symptoms, includ - ing chest pain, laryngitis, asthma, nocturnal cough or recurrent sinus infections. The Bravo wireless pH monitoring system allows acid reflux monitor - ing for up to 48 hours to evaluate potential causes of chest pain that may originate in the esophagus. Uncontrolled symptoms occasionally lead to severe bronchospasm or coronary artery disease. \"We're seeing a GERD epidemic in Westernized countries,\" says Kiran Sachdev, M.D., of Connecticut GI, PC, who specializes in disorders of the esopha - gus. \"Drugs for stomach ulcers totally eradicate H. pylori bacteria, which some researchers believe may be protective against GERD. Sedentary lifestyles and rising rates of obesity also contribute to the disease.\" Since pH monitoring began in the 1970s, the role of stomach acid in GERD has become contro - versial. Researchers have shown that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like Nexium, Prevacid and or Zantac. \"The problem is not just over-production of acid but breakdown in barriers to acid,\" explains Dr. Sachdev. \"Forty percent of patients have non- acid reflux. This is a new concept in reflux disease and reflects a large percentage of patients who have been under-diagnosed in the past.\" Initial diagnosis involves a technique called endoscopy to identify potentially dangerous erosion and damage to the lining of the esophagus. Dr. Sachdev snakes an endoscope\u2014a flexible tube with a light and miniature camera\u2014down the throat to the stomach. If she sees red epithelial cells instead of pale squamous cells, she removes a small piece of suspicious tissue for a biopsy to rule out precan - cerous changes called \"Barrett's esophagus\" that precede a specific kind of esophageal cancer. Rare until the 1970s, the incidence of esopha - geal cancer has soared over the past 30 years and is now the fastest-rising cancer in adults. Esophageal cancer strikes men more frequently than women. \"Barrett's esophagus raises the risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus by 40- to 60-fold,\" says Dr. Sachdev. \"The asymptomatic condition is increasing rapidly in white men, along with the rise in obesity and GERD.\" At Hartford Hospital, state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment helps physicians detect esophageal cancer in its pre-malignant stages. Dr. Sachdev employs a novel technique called \"narrow band imaging\" to look for precursor lesions in the esophageal lining. Using red-blue-green filters to enhance the diagnostic capability of the endoscope, she generates high-reso - lution images of the vessels and mucosa to pinpoint cancerous changes in Barrett's esophagus lining. Another innovative diagnostic test is the addi - tion of Multichannel Intraluminal Impedance (MII) to the conventional pH probe that detects and analyzes reflux, characterizing it as acid or nonacid. The new equipment overcomes the limitations of the exist - ing pH probe that has been the \"gold standard\" in detecting acid reflux for 30 years. A flexible plastic tube passed down the esophagus into the stomach measures the pressures generated by the esophageal muscle at rest and during swallows. Colorful waves sweep across the computer screen, allowing Dr. Sa - chdev to analyze impedance (resistance to the flow of current), motility (muscular contractions of the esophagus), and transit dynamics, among other tests. While the risk of developing cancer is low even in someone with Barrett's esophagus, new surveil - lance protocols let physicians monitor and biopsy any changes in cellular architecture. Esophageal adeno - carcinoma is often incurable because the disease is frequently discovered at a late stage when treat - ments are ineffective. The five-year survival rate is just 13 percent. With early detection, therapy can begin before the cancer has a chance to grow and spread.Rare until the 1970s, the incidence of esophageal cancer has soared over the past 30 years and is now the fastest-rising cancer in adults. 9 | in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & Breakthroughs Senior Health Goes Online Ask a Nurse Community ProgramsHealth Concerns Physician Services Mental Health Home Services Where to Live Yolks on You Why eat egg white-only omelettes?

Don't microwave items containing metal and make sure the sponge or scrubber is wet, not dry.Days of Wine and Cheese Red wine helps obese mice live longer, healthier lives, says the National Institute on Aging. Researchers fed three different diets to middle-aged mice for a year (the mouse equivalent of progressing to old age). Resveratrol\u2014an antioxidant found in red wine, peanuts and blueberries\u2014reduced the risk of death by nearly one-third in obese mice fed a fatty diet.Adult children, particularly those who live out of state, often worry about the care of their elderly parents. Doctors, home care, rehab, dementia, assisted living, hospice\u2014the \"sandwich generation\" really has its hands full. With that in mind, Hartford Hospital, VNA HealthCare, Eastern Rehabilitaiton Network, the Institute of Living, Jefferson House and other affiliated organizations have formed Senior Health Solutions.

Defeated and disgraced, scorned by family and friends who don't understand, alco - holics suffer from a lonely and often fatal disease. Those who can't stop drinking endure a lifelong struggle shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental fac - tors that influence relapse and recovery. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser - vices Administration (SAMHSA), alcohol abuse or dependence afflicts an estimated 22.2 million American adults, both male and female. Nearly seven million drug users in the United States also meet the criteria for chemical dependency, but only about 20 percent receive treatment. Up to 13 percent of the population experiences at least one bout of uncontrolled or binge drinking at some point in their lives. \"In keeping with our mission as a psychiatric hospital, we treat alcohol and/or drug abusers who have a dual diagnosis of mental illness,\" explains Julian Offsay, M.D., an addiction psychiatrist at the Institute of Living (IOL). \"Most chemically dependent individuals have significant personality difficulties, such as major depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or bipolar disorder.\" The Addiction Recovery Services Program at the IOL pro - vides intensive outpatient treatment for patients who are referred from the community, court and probation systems, or as a step-down from inpatient treatment. The program of - fers group counseling, education and support for those with substance abuse problems, and also provides medication management for patients with both substance abuse and psychiatric problems. The alcoholism drug Campral helps restore normal brain chemistry in alcohol-dependent people who stop drinking. \"We can prescribe medications to reduce the severity of post- acute withdrawal symptoms,\" says Dr. Offsay. \"Because of subtle changes in brain chemistry, many people experience anxiety, depression, disturbed sleep, mood swings or trouble concentrating when they suddenly become alcohol-free.\" Why do some people become alcoholics or addicts? Scien - tists believe that chemical dependency is a blend of biological tendencies and environmental influences, coupled with the addictive potential of mood-altering chemicals. Those who begin drinking at an early age are at greater risk of chronic, relapsing alcohol dependence. Studies show that of those who go on to develop alcoholism, nearly half meet the diagnostic criteria for alcoholism by age 21. \"Unfortunately, there has been stigma attached to addic - tion because of illicit drug use,\" says program manager Sandy Moehle, L.C.S.W. \"People need to understand that substance abuse is not just about willpower. Addiction is as prevalent in suburban, middle class areas as it is in the inner cities, and it cuts across all socioeconomic levels. Health professionals should not be afraid to ask about alcohol and drug use as part of any routine assessment or evaluation.\" According to the American Journal of Psychiatry , women who abuse alcohol exhibit brain damage sooner and may experience even more severe long-term effects than men. Women are more likely to die from suicide, alcohol-related accidents, circulatory disorders and cirrhosis of the liver than are male alcoholics. \"Most people are surprised to learn that the ratio of men to women is about 50:50 in our program,\" Ms. Moehle explains. \"People use alcohol or drugs to help them cope with stress in their lives. Brain chemistry sets certain individuals up for addiction, and the disease takes on a life of its own.\" \"Our treatment model is abstinence-based,\" adds Dr. Offsay. \"We encourage patients to utilize community-based 12-Step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous for additional help and support. Patients attend small group sessions three to five days a week for a month or so, where they learn about recovery and relapse prevention, while family members attend weekly educational sessions.\" The Program for Professionals provides continuing care for those employed in occupations where confidentiality is a concern. \"Our group of six met in an intimate setting,\" says Jennifer (a pseudonym), who attended the outpatient professionals' program four times a week on the advice of a therapist at a local university. \"The IOL counselors pushed me to attend AA meetings to meet sober people my age who are in recovery. After taking a semester off, I'm back in college. I didn't realize I could ask for help until I nearly destroyed my future.\"When Drinking Becomes A Disease 11Call the Health/Physician Referral Service at (860) 545-1888 or (800) 545-7664 for information about any program.

Calories: 273 Carbohydrate: < 2 g Total fat: 14.7 g (> 50% is heart-healthy monounsaturated fat) Protein: 31.4 g This recipe is a good source of B vitamins: thiamine, niacin, and B6 and an excellent source of vitamin B12 (274% of daily needs). It also contains high levels of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and Vitamin A.As they swim upstream, as much as 100 miles a day, wild salmon boost their levels of omega-3 essential fatty acids. Salmon is high in two omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These heart-healthy compounds affect blood pressure, blood clotting, inflammation, immune function and coronary spasms. The American Heart Association says omega-3 fatty acids help to protect against heart attack, stroke, cancer, and inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Wild Alaskan sockeye, Chinook and Coho salmon are less fatty and more nutritious than farmed salmon, which may contain antibiotics, artificial coloring or chemical contaminants. Salmon contains less mercury than many other kinds of fish and shellfish. As dwindling ocean stocks have become increasingly tainted with high levels of mercury, the Environmental Protection Agency has warned pregnant women and children to avoid swordfish and limit consumption of tuna. Fish oil supplements are a safe way to obtain omega-3 oils. \"Long-chain es - sential fatty acids offer anti-inflammatory benefits at high enough doses,\" says Albert J. Kozar, D.O., \"but you usually need to take a couple of teaspoonfuls to reach 2.7 grams of fish oil daily. English walnuts and flax seed oil are alterna - tives to fish oil, but these contain short-chain fatty acids, which the body can't use as efficiently. Check labels and choose brands highest in EPA and DHA.\" Baked Salmon V era Cruz Ingredients 2 pounds salmon (wild caught) 2 cloves chopped garlic 4 plum tomatoes, chopped 4 tablespoons cilantro, chopped (1 tablespoon reserved) 1 tablespoon olive oil "}
