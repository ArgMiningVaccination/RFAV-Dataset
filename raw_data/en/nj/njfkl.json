Increases Muscle Growth, Strength & Metabolism Improves Mood & Self-Esteem All Natural Formula Manufactured In The USA How Do Testosterone Boosters Work on Low T-Levels? Each testosterone booster works differently. While it's impossible to lump all of them into one category, they do share some similarities. For example, TestoGen and Prime Male have more in common with each other than they do with testosterone injections or testosterone replacement therapy. Many testosterone boosters contain D-aspartic acid, an amino acid that has shown remarkable results in rats. While scientists haven't tested D-aspartic acid as frequently in humans, it has [shown promise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5340133/) . The secret is that the compound elevates T levels in two ways. First, D-aspartic acid directly influences the body to create more testosterone. The amino acid goes to the source and stimulates testosterone production. Second, it tells the brain to release more luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland, which has the same effect. Early trials in humans have shown that D-aspartic acid [can raise T-levels 42% in 12 days](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2774316/) . All users need to do is take three grams per day. Results also indicate that the compound is even more effective on infertile men, elevating their testosterone levels 30% to 60%, according to a 2012 study. It's worth noting that none of the products in this article contain testosterone. Using medical-grade testosterone requires FDA-regulation and a doctor's permission. These solutions help your body produce more testosterone in the same way that someone might drink coffee to [curb their appetite](https://www.outlookindia.com/outlook-spotlight/best-appetite-suppressant-pills-in-2023-top-6-strongest-over-the-counter-otc-hunger-control-supplements-news-243851) or increase their focus.

Enhanced Mood: Things in life are better when your T-levels are high. A test boost can improve your energy, mood, and focus, making it easier to conquer whatever life throws at you. Conversely, low T-levels can correlate with lower life satisfaction, including depression and irritability. Better Energy Levels: Testosterone provides the fuel you need to get through the day, whether you're on the go or conquering home workouts. It also keeps you in shape. A steady supply of energy makes it easier to handle long days without succumbing to fatigue and irritability. Improve Blood Circulation: Heart health is essential to your overall well-being. Testosterone assists in red blood cell production, helping your body circulate oxygen for peak performance. A well-functioning circulatory system can reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Common Ingredients in the Best Testosterone Boosters 1. D-Aspartic Acid D-aspartic acid might be the most important ingredient in testosterone boosters. The amino acid can boost free testosterone levels, unlocking users' ability to enhance their strength and energy levels. Early research has shown that it can increase testosterone production by 42% in as little as two weeks. 2. Zinc Magnesium Aspartate Zinc magnesium aspartate is a nutritional supplement that combines zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6. The compound plays a crucial role in supporting metabolism, digestion, and the immune system. It can also increase T-levels, making it a popular performance enhancer for bodybuilders and athletes. 3. Vitamin D Vitamin D is a vitamin that your body produces naturally following exposure to sunlight. Studies have found that people who have low levels of vitamin D tend to have low T-levels. According to a randomized controlled trial from Hormone and Metabolic Research, taking the vitamin can increaseT-levels up to 20%. 4. Vitamin B6 Researchers have found a consistent link between vitamin B6 levels and testosterone. A man with low vitamin B6 likely has T-levels and vice versa. The vitamin stimulates the hypothalamus, creating a natural test boost. 5. Tribulus Terrestris People have used tribulus terrestris to increase T-levels for centuries. The herb can enhance and have positive effects on users' blood glucose levels and cholesterol. 6. Ashwagandha Ashwagandha, also known as withania somnifera, is an herb commonly found in Indian medicine. The compound helps people manage their stress levels and mood swings. According to a 2009 study from Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, individuals that take five grams of ashwagandha per day over three months experience a 10% to 22% jump in testosterone production. How to Increase Testosterone Naturally Testosterone plays a crucial role in day-to-day well-being. The hormone can help men increase their muscle strength, energy and mitigate mood swings. If you feel that your performance is lacking in any of these categories, you should consider elevating your natural hormone levels. While T-boosters can improve your testosterone levels, you can help yourself with a couple of lifestyle changes. For example, exercising can increase testosterone while enhancing your fitness and strength. The best exercises involve resistance training, such as weight lifting, which has long- and short-term health benefits. A healthy diet works wonders for your hormone levels. Focus on eating a balanced diet that walks the line between overeating and calorie restriction. An optimized intake of carbohydrates can aid you to maintain high testosterone, energy, and muscle. It's also crucial to avoid certain activities. For example, high-stress levels can undercut your energy and testosterone. You may also experience flu-like symptoms and gain weight due to a compromised immune system. If you're not getting high-quality sleep at night, you're also hurting your T-levels. Deep sleep gives your body the time to recover and repair small muscle tears that occur during workouts. Getting at least 7.5 hours of sleep each night can also provide an energy boost and better overall health. Can You Buy Test Boosters Over-the-Counter? Yes, you can purchase natural testosterone boosters over-the-counter, but they're likely not as effective as the options on this list. That's because they do not contain optimized doses. The companies that manufacture those supplements have to submit their products to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for review. For example, there are pills at your local pharmacy with fenugreek, zinc, and D-aspartic acid. None of them have the concentrations you need to elevate your T-levels dramatically. The FDA looks at the ingredients, potency, and side effects of these different products and ensures that they fall within the appropriate standards set forth by federal law. Note that the FDA doesn't have the authority to regulate health supplements. On the one hand, this lack of oversight benefits users. Consumers can get products that they couldn't purchase in a regulated market. On the other hand, the lack of FDA presence forces consumers to assume each test booster's risks. There's no organization to approve what goes on the product label. In theory, a company could exaggerate the benefits of its supplement and face little to no blowback. Do Testosterone Boosting Supplements Have Side Effects? Every product that you put in your body has potential side effects. For example, if you drink too much water, you may experience excess urination, confusion, and low energy levels. Testosterone supplements are no different. Before you purchase natural testosterone supplements, make sure to read the product label. Look for anything in products that may trigger an allergic reaction. If you're unsure about the ingredients or currently take medication for other conditions, talk with your doctor. Two products to watch out for include DHEA and tongkat ali (Eurycoma longifolia). Manufacturers have historically used these substances in testosterone boosting products. However, research has revealed that DHEA and tongkat ali may cause severe health consequences. DHEA or dehydroepiandrosterone is a hormone made in your adrenal glands. While the compound has anti-aging properties, its risks outweigh its benefits. Some of the symptoms of using DHEA include mood swings, high blood pressure, and stunted growth. Tongkat ali or eurycoma longifolia is an herbal remedy from Southeast Asia. It offers stress relief and fertility benefits but has potentially deadly side effects. Tongkat ali supplements often contain mercury. Consuming even small doses of this metal can cause mercury poisoning, a condition that leads to motor and cognitive issues, shortness of breath, and organ failure. Each product we choose for our list uses all-natural ingredients. These organic substances reduce the chance for adverse reactions compared to synthetic compounds. Some T-boosters, like TestoGen, claim to have no known side effects. Final Thoughts - Which Testosterone Booster Is Right for You? Plenty of reasons exist why a man might need a natural testosterone booster. Perhaps he has low energy levels and stamina. Maybe he wants to add muscle mass while shaving off excess body fat. If you're a man over the age of 30 who wants to get healthier, there's a testosterone supplement for you. Remember that all testosterone booster supplements do slightly different things. One may boost your muscle size while another enhances your performance. Make sure to select a product with health benefits tailored to your preferences and desired results. If you have unusually low T-levels, you may have a medical condition such as hypogonadism. These conditions require FDA-approved treatments that can boost your testosterone levels by a minimum of 300%. If you have any doubts about the proper treatment, talk with your primary care physician about taking testosterone boosters.
