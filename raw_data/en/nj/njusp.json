Chelation is when a substance binds or grabs toxins for removal. There are many natural chelators found in foods. Good fats such as nuts and avocados, garlic, onions, dark leafy greens, chlorella, and food-grade activated charcoal are all excellent chelators. Your metabolism and the metabolic function of plants play a significant role in helping to flush your body of toxins as well. Exercise, dry-brushing, drinking a lot of water, and the internal use of essential oil helps metabolize toxins from your body. Keep internal essential oil use to under 12 drops per day and focus on using flushing oils such as lime, lemon, grapefruit, cilantro, parsley, rosemary, or fennel. Remember to drink plenty of water, exercise, and get your rest! Choose one of the following detox methods for seven days. Add essential oils as needed.

The Red Drink was developed by Dr. Peter Minke and is one of the most popular recipes in all of Young Living\u00ae. It supports mobility, liver cleansing, nail and hair growth, as well as supports a healthy immune system! What is not to love! The legendary Ningxia wolfberry (also known as the goji berry) has long been sought after for its rich nutritional content. With documented use dating back to the Ming Dynasty, it is one of the earliest known superfruits utilized in ancient Chinese health practices. Residents of the Ningxia region of northern China, where the wolfberry grows, have especially enjoyed the astonishing wellness-supporting benefits of the wolfberry that grows in the area. However, due to the Ningxia region's physical and political isolation, knowledge of this remarkable superfruit remained relatively hidden from Western culture.
