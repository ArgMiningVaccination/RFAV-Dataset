The aims of the QMRA were to assess: the expected reduction of Salmonella cases in humans (or pig meat at retail) by a reduction (e.g. 5- or 10-fold) of Salmonella prevalence in slaughter pigs (based on bacteriology or serology at slaughter); the sources of infection for fattening pigs at farm level; the reduction of the prevalence in slaughter pigs by the most important potential treatments or control measures at farm level; the impact of transport, lairage and slaughter processes on contamination of carcasses; the expected reduction of Salmonella cases in humans (or pig meat) by the most important control measures during transport, at lairage or during the slaughter process. In order to facilitate the investigation of interventions at different points of the food chain, a farm-to-consumption framework was adopted, so that we could model the prevalence of infection / contamination and the microbial load from the farm to the point of consumption (exposure). The probability of infection, or illness, could then be estimated by applying a dose-response model using the estimated amount of Salmonella bacteria ingested at consumption as an input. Numerous QMRAs have been developed or are currently underway for Salmonella in pigs within the EU; including QMRAs for the UK (Hill et al. 2003; VLA, 2009); Belgium (Delhalle et al., 2009); Denmark (Alban et al., 2002; Hurd et al., 2008), Ireland (Barron et al., 2009) and the Netherlands (van der Gaag et al., 2004). However, EFSA requested a QMRA for Salmonella in Pigs that characterised the variability between European Union (EU) Member States (MSs) and, in particular, the inclusion of variability between MSs in their pig farms, slaughterhouses and consumption patterns; this presented numerous challenges. These challenges have been overcome by the development of a generic model with a clearly defined set of parameters that may vary between MSs, the values of which can be easily input for any specific EU MS. To demonstrate the parameterisation and use of the model, four MSs were selected as case studies: MS1, MS2, MS3 and MS4. These MSs were selected by performing a cluster analysis for the EU using criteria relating to pig production and consumption patterns to group the MSs into 'clusters'. Based on which MSs had the most available data, one MS was selected from each cluster. Three product types are included in the QMRA: pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage. These products were chosen to represent a range of different production/preparation practices and consumption patterns, which will affect the Salmonella levels within these products at consumption and hence the probability of human illness. Exposure Assessment & Hazard Characterisation The exposure assessment was split into 4 modules: Farm; Transport & Lairage; Slaughter & Processing and Preparation & Consumption. The output from one module is the input to the next and so collectively they model the entire farm-to-consumption chain. Efforts were made to take into account the natural variation of Salmonella infection and/or contamination in the modelling. This was done by, wherever possible, allowing for stochastic variation of parameter values. Consequently, as much as possible, variability within and between QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as author(s). In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the author(s) in the context of a gran t agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the author(s). The present document is published complying with the transparency principle to which the European Food Safety Authority is subject. It may not be considered as an output adopted by EFSA.

Within the Farm module, the management of farms within the EU and the associated transmission of Salmonella between pigs are mathematically described. The model considers the production of pigs destined for meat production (i.e. slaughter pigs) over a period of 500 days, thereby following batches of pigs from birth to depopulation for slaughter. The consideration of a 500 day time interval allows for the model to capture the extent of the within-farm variation and dynamics over time. Between-farm variation is described by the consideration of different farm management systems, such as size (\"large\" or \"small\" farms), type of production (all-in-all-out / continuous), housing (slatted/solid flooring), feed (wet/dry) and sourcing of pigs (breeder-finisher/breeder-weaner/grower- finisher). By allowing for such variation in the farm management structure it is anticipated that a large proportion of EU pig farms can be described by the model. On top of the management model the transmission model describes the infection dynamics of Salmonella within and between batches of pigs. The model considers the introduction of Salmonella via a number of sources, in particular, sows (infecting piglets), feed and environmental contamination (e.g. rodents etc), as well as the infection of other pigs via new stock (specifically modelled through mixing at the point of weaning). Modelling the farm in such detail produces a complex model, but one which was able to investigate specific farm interventions agreed with the EFSA Working Group and the EC. The primary output of the Farm module is the prevalence of lymph-node positivity and the prevalence/magnitude of pigs actively shedding Salmonella within a batch of pigs, at the time of depopulation for slaughter. The Transport part of the Transport & Lairage module considers the process of transporting finisher pigs to the slaughterhouse (the same framework is also used for the transport of weaners from breeder farms to grower-finisher farms within the Farm module). The number of pigs to be slaughtered by a random slaughterhouse on a particular day, which for both the small and large slaughterhouse models will vary, is determined and batches of slaughter- age pigs are selected at random from the output of the Farm module until enough pigs have been selected. The model then mathematically describes the management of these pigs as well as the infection dynamics of Salmonella during transport. The transmission model is similar in structure to the Farm model, except for a few modifications such as the inclusion of increased shedding of Salmonella due to stress, and the assumption that cross- contamination between transport pens will not occur over such a short timeframe. Management factors such as transport time and number of pigs per pen in the truck are included in the model as well as the probability of pigs becoming stressed and the possible carry-over of Salmonella from previous batches of transported pigs. The Lairage part of the module takes a similar structure to the Transport part, but with the necessary amendments to the management parameters. The outputs of the Transport & Lairage module are: the Salmonella infection status per individual pig (positiv e/negative) at the point of slaughter and the number of Salmonella within an infected pig's faeces. At this point we also model the Salmonella contamination status per individual pig (positive/negative) at the point of slaughter and introduce an estimate for the external contamination per pig measured in colony-forming units of Salmonella (CFU) per cm 2 of skin. Using the output from the Lairage module, the Slaughter & Processing module predicts the prevalence and number of Salmonella present in/on the product at the end of processing. Both large and small slaughterhouses are modelled, where it is assumed that small slaughterhouses use less dedicated machinery and do not have a continuous slaughter line. At each processing stage several processes may increase or decrease the Salmonella concentration on the carcass. The model mathematically describes this by considering the immediate effect of the processing stage (e.g. singeing destroys a number of organisms on QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as author(s).

Examples of the slaughterhouse environment include the scald tank, knife and polishing machine. Such a highly mechanistic approach allows interventions to be modelled at a very high resolution and to describe between-pig variability during a production day. The output of the slaughterhouse module is the prevalence and level of contamination on the half-carcasses produced for that day. The cutting plant processes the half carcasses and delivers the food product. This model describes the processing of 10,000 portions of each type of product (pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage) produced from half-carcasses, which were randomly sampled from half-carcasses produced per MS, respecting the proportion of production from large and small slaughterhouses. These products are then delivered to retail. The prevalence and level of contamination within each portion are the input for the Preparation & Consumption module. In the Preparation & Consumption module, the 10,000 portions of each product type are modelled. This module describes the impact of transport, storage and meal preparation on the prevalence and contamination of Salmonella, for the three product types. The module includes the possibility of Salmonella growth during transport and storage using time and temperature parameters. In relation to meal preparation, both cross-contamination between pork products and salad (for pork cuts and minced meat only) and inadequate cooking (minced meat only) are considered. Routes of cross-contamination modelled include via the chopping board, knife, hands and tap. The final output of the module is the number of Salmonella on/in each portion of each product at the point of consumption. The number of Salmonella on each portion of each product is fed into a dose-response model that predicts the probability of illness given consumption of that portion (hazard characterisation). This probability is then used in a binomial trial to predict if that particular serving will result in illness or not. The proportion of illness given 10,000 servings per product type was then calculated and interpreted as the probability of illness. Therefore, the average probability of illness over all 10,000 servings for each MS, for each of the three product types (pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage) can be estimated.

For all four MSs the average probability of illness is between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 10 million servings across all three product types. MS2 and MS4 are predicted to have a higher probability of illness. For all of the MSs (except MS4), the product with the highest probability of illness per serving is fermented sausage; for MS4 it is minced meat. The lowest risk per serving is associated with pork cuts (MS1, MS2); minced meat (MS3) and fermented sausage (MS4). The total number of cases attributable to the three product types was estimated to be about 1000 (MS1); 25000 (MS2); 1500 (MS3) and 30000 (MS4). It is recognised that the number of predicted cases seem to be an overestimation and this is discussed below. In MS1 and MS3, the highest number of cases was attributable to pork cuts and in MS2 and MS4 to minced meat products. The model results suggest that a high prevalence in slaughter pigs will result in a large number of cases, but the complex system involved post-slaughter means that the number of cases is not directly proportional to the slaughter pig prevalence in a country. Although, what is (probably) more important is the total burden of Salmonella entering/exiting the slaughterhouse/retail establishment, which is dependent on not only the slaughter pig prevalence but also the contamination level of the slaughtered pig/carcass/end product. The validity of the model was assessed by comparing predicted results from the model with observed (microbiological/epidemiological) results at two points in the farm-to-consumption pathway (prevalence of lymph-node positive pigs at post-lairage and the prevalence/enumeration of contaminated portions at retail) and also the number of human salmonellosis cases. Like model results, the observed data to which the model is being compared are uncertain due to, for example, restricted test sensitivity, imperfect sampling design, inclusion of imported products in retail surveys and the under-reporting of human cases from epidemiological data.

The QMRA predicts a MS1, MS2, MS3 MS3 and MS4 respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that, at this point of the farm-to-consumption pathway, the QMRA is producing realistic estimates for MS1, MS2 and MS4. It is unclear why the model is maybe underestimating the prevalence in MS3, but it is likely to be attributable to the model not capturing a specific aspect of MS3 at the farm and in particular within the small farm model, as MS3 has a much larger proportion of small farms than the other MSs. Table 3 provides the predicted prevalence and microbial load at the point of retail. At the point of retail, data for validation were only available for MS1 and MS2 and these compared reasonably well to the QMRA predictions. Although it was not possible to obtain data for all product types in each MS, EFSA, 2009 provides ranges of Salmonella prevalence across different EU MSs. For pork cuts the prevalence ranged from 0%-6.1%, for minced meat 1.3% - 5.9% and for ready-to-eat minced meat/minced meat products (which includes fermented sausages) of 0%-3.3%. The model predictions are in the same order of magnitude, with the results from all four MSs falling within or slightly below these observed intervals. Across a number of EU MSs, studies show that contamination on retail cuts is comparatively low (scaling up to the unit of a serving commonly less than 10 CFU/portion) (Prendergast et al. , 2009). The average number of Salmonella contaminating the three product types was predicted by the QMRA to range from 1-11CFU/portion for all MS/product-type combinations. It was therefore concluded that the QMRA is producing realistic enough results at the point of retail to differentiate between MSs and provide a baseline from which to conduct an intervention analysis.

This overestimation could be attributable to a number of factors. Given that the QMRA output compares reasonably to observed prevalence and microbial load data at the point of retail, factors within the Preparation & Consumption module and hazard characterisation are the most likely cause of this over-estimation. Such factors include the uncertainty associated with the consumption data, the effect of immunity, the dose-response model and many other parameters used to mathematically describe cross-contamination and cooking within the Preparation & Consumption module. In addition, the consideration of all Salmonella spp. within the QMRA, with no account taken for differences between Salmonella serovars in their ability to grow/survive in the environment or to infect humans (virulence), could have a significant impact on the estimation of the number of cases 2. It is quite common for QMRAs to overestimate the number of cases (e.g. Hartnett, 2001; Nauta et al., 2001, 2005; Havelaar et al 2008). Considering this, for any QMRA, it is important to place more emphasis on the relative risks (e.g. the intervention analysis) than the absolute risk (Havelaar et al., 2007). The number of salmonellosis cases reported by each MS will not all be attributable to pork, nor will the three pork products considered here include all pork-related cases. The proportion of human Salmonella cases in the EU that are due to the consumption of contaminated pork/pig-meat products is unknown. In order to estimate this proportion, we originally intended to develop a source attribution model based on the microbial subtyping approach 3 (Hald et al., 2004; Pires & Hald, 2009) using MS-specific animal and food data from the EU baseline surveys and human data as reported by the MS to The European Surveillance System (TESSy). It was, however, necessary to abandon this approach, since MS-specific data on the distribution of serovar and phage types in humans was not available. As an alternative, we made descriptive comparisons of animal, food and human data, which were supplemented with results from a spatial analysis and an outbreak data analysis. The conclusion that follows should, therefore, be considered as a guesstimate as it is based on very simple deductions. Results from the descriptive and spatial analysis were discussed in an attempt to make inferences about the most important sources of human salmonellosis in the EU. Based on this, it is assessed that 10-20% of human infections in the EU are attributable to the pig reservoir. This \"guesstimate\" is, however, believed to vary considerably between MSs depending on, for instance, Salmonella prevalence in pigs and pork, consumption patterns and preferences, pig production systems and the relative importance of other sources, such as eggs and chicken. The \"guesstimate\" is to some extent supported by the outbreak data analysis that indicated that meat products, particularly pork and beef, were important sources of S. Typhimurium infections, and this is furthermore in concordance with a recent 2 Within the mandate, EFSA were asked \"to consider all serovars in pigs that are of human health significance\". EFSA, 2006 concluded that \"all Salmonella serovars in pork are to be regarded as a hazard for public health\" and recognised that there will be variability between strains in their behaviours across the food chain. It was therefore deemed acceptable by EFSA (as stated in the call for proposals) for the QMRA to consider all types similarly and hence that a QMRA for Salmonella spp. would be appropriate. 3 The principle of the subtyping method is to compare the distribution Salmonella subtypes in different sources (e.g., animals, food) with the distribution of subtypes in humans. The microbial subtyping approach is enabled by the identification of strong associations between some of the dominant subtypes and a specific reservoir or source, providing a heterogeneous distribution of subtypes among the sources. The approach utilises a collection of temporally and spatially related isolates from various sources, and thus it is facilitated by integrated foodborne disease surveillance programs that is focused on the collection of isolates from the major food animal reservoirs of foodborne diseases (Pires et al. , 2009). This method typically focuses on sporadic cases and attributes infections to the reservoir level, meaning that the original infectious source is identified, whereas the route from reservoir (primary production) to consumer is not described.

(2008) and Pires (2009). In order to obtain more reliable and quantitative estimates for the importance of different sources to human salmonellosis in the EU, it is recommended to develop a model for the attribution of human salmonellosis based on the microbial subtyping approach. This will require MS-specific data on the distribution of Salmonella subtypes in the most important sources and in humans. Particularly, the latter data have been very difficult to obtain, which is considered most unfortunate as these data are essential for understanding the trends and sources of human salmonellosis. During the development of the QMRA, many data gaps/deficiencies were identified. These were investigated as part of an uncertainty analysis, where we assessed the effect that parameters (with a particular lack of information) have on the model output and, in particular, the probability of illness. The MSs MS1 and MS2 were chosen for the uncertainty analysis as MS1 is a MS with a low baseline prevalence at the point of slaughter, whereas MS2 has a high baseline prevalence. From this analysis, it is concluded that the following parameters were both highly uncertain and influential on the probability of illness. Farm: Prevalence of feed contamination (MS1) Prevalence of infection within the breeder herd (MS1 & MS2) Maximum mass of faeces ingested per day (finishers) (MS2) Transport & Lairage: Probability of pigs being stressed during transport (MS1 & MS2)* Dose-response parameter (MS1) dehairing (MS1 & MS2) Preparation & Consumption: Minced meat storage time in fridge (MS1 & MS2)* Portion sizes of pork cuts, minced meat patties and fermented sausages (MS1 & MS2) pH of fermented sausage (MS1 & MS2). Those marked with an asterisk (*) were also identified as important in the sensitivity analysis, where the impact of the variability associated with the module parameters that are described by distributions on the primary module output (e.g. for stress during transport this is the lymph node positive prevalence post transport) was investigated. In addition to the above analysis, the uncertainty analysis also indicated that the travel time between retail and home had a large impact on the final risk, which is the main reason for the high number of predicted cases within MS4. It is therefore recommended that further data generation is undertaken in order to provide improved estimates for the parameters listed above and also for the travel time between retail store and home. The identification of such data gaps is a positive feature of any risk assessment model and many risk managers utilise such information to direct future research. Intervention analysis A key part of the QMRA was the investigation of interventions. In this respect, EFSA provided a number of scenarios that the QMRA needed to address. Each of these is considered below: QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as author(s).

The major effect of reducing slaughter pig prevalence was to reduce the number of infected pigs with high infection/contamination loads entering the slaughterhouse, hence eventually reducing the number of highly-contaminated servings consumed by consumers. For MS2 and MS4, the broadly linear relationship shows that factors that would be expected to introduce a non-linear relationship into the model, such as cross-contamination at the slaughterhouse, growth during retail storage and dose-response, although accounted for in the model, seem to have limited importance for the assessed relationship between pig prevalence 4 and human incidence. Indeed, data from the EFSA baseline survey support a modest linear relationship at a MS level, at least for infection and carcass contamination at evisceration. However, the results indicate that for low prevalence countries (MS1 & MS3) a 5-10% decrease in slaughter prevalence may result in a larger percentage reduction in human cases. Figure 2: Effect of reducing Salmonella prevalence in slaughter pigs by 5 to 99% for each product type and for each case study MS (pork cuts - blue, minced meat - green and fermented sausage - red). Small variations in the downward trend can be seen, for MS1 and MS3 in particular; these are due to sampling error within the Monte-Carlo simulations (due to the low Salmonella prevalence in slaughter pigs). 4 This is based on lymph node prevalence QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as author(s).

The results are shown in Figure 3. The effect is striking - for MSs with a higher breeding pig herd prevalence (MS2, MS4) switching breeding pig herd prevalence to zero (hence assuming that the breeding pig herd cannot be re-infected from the finishing herd) removes the vast majority of infections at depopulation of the fattening herds. Conversely, removing feed or external contamination from the model does little to change the national fattening pig prevalence in MS2 and MS4. The reverse trend is true in MSs with low breeding pig herd prevalence (MS1, MS3) as feed contamination seems to be the most important factor for the national fattening pig prevalence in these MSs. The results from the model suggest that breeding pig herd prevalence is a strong indicator of national fattening pig prevalence - i.e. if a relatively low number of breeding pig herds are positive, national fattening pig prevalence will be relatively lower than in MSs with more infected breeding pig herds. Finally, results from the model also indicate that external sources of contamination appear to have a general low impact on the fattening pig prevalence. The reduction of the prevalence in slaughter pigs by the most important potential treatments or control measures at farm level Evidence that specific farm and transport intervent ions consistently work is sparse. This is presumably due to the more complex environment in which these interventions will have to be applied (relative to the abattoir) and the difficulty in standardising experiments to trial interventions. Hence, while the evidence for consistent effects is sparse, some farm interventions may well be effective. This was the conclusion of Denagamage et al. 2007 for vaccination, but no quantitative effect was able to be shown. Figure 3: Relative impact on predicted Salmonella prevalence of slaughter pigs for each MS if each source of infection is turned off. This lack of evidence for a consistent and/or quantitative effect meant that specific farm interventions could not be modelled. Therefore, in order to provide some assessment of QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as author(s).

Modifying the pig dose-response relationship to Salmonella exposure, perhaps by changing feed type, adding organic acids to feed/water, or vaccination, could have a significant effect in reducing slaughter pig prevalence within a MS, which would subsequently reduce number of cases. However, a large increase in this dose-response relationship - broadly speaking increasing the resistance of ALL of a MS's pigs such that an extra half-log to a log dose is needed to cause the same previous probability of infection - would be needed to see significant change in MS slaughter pig prevalence. This type of effect has rarely been seen in the literature and it is debatable whether such an effect could be achieved consistently at a national herd level. A similar conclusion can be reached for increased cleaning - significant reductions could be achieved in a MS's slaughter pig prevalence if cleaning efficiency was increased so that an extra 1-2 logs was consistently removed from the pen environment before repopulation, but so far these improvements have only been trialled on a small scale. Reducing feed contamination appears to be an effective measure in reducing slaughter pig prevalence and human cases and for large scale producers would translate into a widespread decrease in pig exposure to Salmonella from feed. The effect was greater in MSs with a low prevalence (MS1) of positive breeding pig herds than in MSs with relatively high breeding pig herd prevalence (MS4). The results of the farm intervention analysis suggest that farm interventions could achieve a significant decrease in fattening pig prevalence (and hence ultimately a reduction in human cases). The choice(s) of intervention will among other things depend on the farm production type and the breeder (supplier) herd prevalence. However, the significant reductions that would be required to achieve the same effect as slaughterhouse interventions would probably be unlikely for any single farm intervention The impact of transport, lairage and slaughter processes on contamination of carcasses Due to the unavailability of data on the contamination of pig skin, it was not possible to model the cross-contamination of the exterior of pigs during Transport & Lairage. Therefore the contamination on the skin was estimated at the point of slaughter (using data from Davies et al. , 1999) and used as an input to the Slaughter & Processing module. Within the Slaughter & Processing module, cross-contamination has been extensively modelled. The QMRA results predict that, for all four MSs, the evisceration step in a large slaughterhouse model greatly increases both the microbial load and also the prevalence of carcass contamination. This increase is due to the possibility of the gut being punctured during evisceration, therefore allowing the carcass (and subsequent carcasses on the line) to become highly contaminated. The increase in prevalence is also attributable to house flora 5, although the microbial load transferred from this source to the carcass is assessed to be low. In addition, the load and prevalence is increased during the dehairing phase (primarily due to faecal leakage) in MS2 and MS4, which had the higher infection prevalence 5 House flora is defined as the Salmonella contamination of the equipment, machines or other objects in the slaughterhouse that is never completely removed. It therefore acts as a permanent source of potential contamination of carcasses.

In the small slaughterhouses, the microbial load decreased over each phase but there was a small increase in the prevalence of contamination during the combined step of trimming/singeing. The expected reduction of Salmonella cases in humans (or pig meat) by the most important control measures during transport, at lairage or during the slaughter process. Transport interventions (logistic transport, increased cleaning), even assuming 100% uptake and 100% compliance/effectiveness, were assessed to have an insignificant effect in reducing the probability of human illness. The effects of reducing concentrations on carcasses pre-chill by some decontamination step are shown in Figure 4. Marked reductions can be achieved by applying some decontamination measure, or reducing faecal leakage, at the slaughterhouse. An intervention that could consistently achieve a 1 log decontamination of carcasses pre-chill could reduce the number of cases up to 20-40% in low-prevalence MSs (MS1, MS3, MS4), but further reductions (up to 2 logs) would be needed in other MSs with higher prevalence (i.e. MS2), as the initial contamination levels are predicted to be higher. Further reductions can be achieved by further reducing concentrations on carcasses at pre-chill (e.g. a reduction of 3 logs) with all case study MSs predicted to achieve a very high reduction (95-100%) in their number of cases Practical non-chemical interventions have been shown to produce reductions in the order of 1-2 logs (e.g. Christiansen et al., 2009 and James, 2009). If such interventions are shown to be as effective when scaled up and applied across a MS's slaughterhouses, it is concluded that a control measure that reduces Salmonella concentrations on carcasses pre-chill would be a viable option for reducing the number of human salmonellosis cases. The consideration of multiple interventions. A comprehensive review of Salmonella in pigs (EFSA, 2006), which explored possible interventions across the farm-to-consumption pathway, concluded that it was not possible to control Salmonella with the adoption of just one measure. In other words, the control of the Salmonella can only be achieved by the introduction of multiple interventions across the farm-to-consumption pathway. In order to investigate the impact of multiple interventions we considered three combinations of interventions: 1. Change to wet feed and 1 log decontamination pre-chill 2. 1 log modification of dose-response with 1 log decontamination pre-chill 3. 3 day downtime6 with 1 log decontamination pre-chill 6 Time between depopulation and re-population of a pen.

For each MS, a log reduction of 2 logs appears to be sufficient to reduce cases approximately 60-80%. The analysis was carried out for MS4 only and, as predicted by EFSA, 2006, it is concluded that a combination of interventions can, if applied judiciously, produce reductions greater than the sum of the individual interventions alone. The major reason for this is that both interventions (e.g. changing farms to wet feed and applying a 1-log decontamination step pre-chill) will affect the contamination level of carcasses. We also predict similar results for MS1, MS2 and MS3 although, of course, the impact of the combination of interventions that achieve the greatest reductions will be dependent on the situation within a particular MS, in particular the contamination levels of carcasses. Summary of the intervention analysis In summary, the farm and transport interventions are likely to vary in their ability to change slaughter pig prevalence by a sufficient amount to change numbers of salmonellosis cases. However, a combination of farm interventions applied across a large proportion of farms is likely to have a cumulative effect in reducing slaughter pig prevalence. Probably of extreme importance, but not investigated here, is the rate of uptake and correct application of interventions by farmers - if this is not universal across a MS the effect in reducing human illness will be reduced. The model results lead us to suggest that those MSs with a high breeding pig herd prevalence should focus on these herds in order to reduce the burden of infected new stock entering the weaning/growing/finishing stages However, from the results of the intervention analysis we predict that it may be more effective for MSs with a low breeding pig herd prevalence to focus their attentions on feed and other sources of infection.

For high breeding prevalence MSs, reducing infection in breeders would seem to be an important control measure as has been successfully implemented by the poultry industry. However, the hypothetical reductions and multiple interventions investigated here suggest that MSs can achieve larger reductions by targeting farm and slaughterhouse together. Reducing the prevalence at farm level is also considered important for preventing the transmission of Salmonella from pigs to other livestock species such as laying hens and broilers, where the prevention and control efforts are focused on the farm. Conclusion The farm-to-consumption QMRA developed and described here estimates the risk of salmonellosis and number of cases for three product types: pork cuts, minced meat and fermented ready-to-eat sausages. The QMRA characterises the variability between EU and in particular, the variability between pig farms, slaughterhouses and consumption patterns. This was achieved by developing a generic EU model with a clearly defined set of parameters that may vary between MSs, the values of which can be easily input for any specific MS model. In addition to describing the variability between MSs, the model was designed to maximise the potential for the ability to investigate current and future interventions, which has resulted in a highly mechanistic model. Consequently, it is our opinion that this QMRA is at the forefront of methodological development at the current time. Using the QMRA to perform an intervention analysis we have shown, theoretically, that large reductions in the number of pig-meat attributable cases of Salmonella within a MS can be achieved via intervention at either the farm and/or slaughterhouse level.

In 2007 151,995 confirmed cases of human salmonellosis were reported in the EU, of which the most common serovars (81% of cases) are Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium (EFSA, 2009). S. Enteritidis is primarily associated with the consumption of poultry and eggs; S. Typhimurium is found in a range of food-producing animals, including pigs, poultry, cattle and sheep. The proportion of human Salmonella cases in the EU that are due to the consumption of contaminated pork/pig-meat products is unknown. However, it is known that the most common serovar for pigs is S. Typhimurium and hence it is widely believed that pork/pig-meat products are an important source of Salmonella infection in humans. The proportion of pigs/pig-meat products that are positive for Salmonella varies between EU countries. For example, the baseline survey for slaughter pigs carried out in the EU in 2006/2007 identified that the proportion of pigs with Salmonella -positive lymph nodes varied between EU Member States (MSs); it ranged from 0% to 29% (EFSA, 2008). For countries that provided data to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 0 - 8.9% of samples at cutting/processing plants were contaminated with Salmonella and similarly 0 - 6.1% of retail samples (EFSA, 2009). The control of Salmonella and other specified foodborne agents, which may pose a public health risk, is considered under Commission Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 (EC, 2003). As part of this regulation, the Commission will set targets for the reduction of Salmonella at the level of primary production and where appropriate at other stages of the food chain. For poultry the target setting has already commenced and National Control Plans have been implemented. For example all MSs have been provided with a targeted reduction for Salmonella in laying flocks, which is dependent on the MSs Salmonella prevalence in the baseline survey. The provisions within EC 2160/2003 also require the setting of targets for Salmonella in pigs and therefore EFSA has been consulted on this matter. As a consequence of this, EFSA requested a \"quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) on Salmonella in slaughter and breeder pigs\". Quantitative microbiological risk assessment evaluates the level of exposure and the subsequent risk to human health due to a specific pathogen (in this case Salmonella ). The assessment process can incorporate elements of the food chain at a high resolution, and is particularly useful to evaluate the effect of interventions on human health or other end-points (e.g. point of sale). It can also be used to estimate the number of human cases that have resulted from a specific pathogen from a particular source, although the technique is considered less accurate in predicting actual public health outcomes, because of the limited availability of dose-response information. The strength of QMRA relates to its ability to assess the impact of control strategies or interventions on the risk to public health. Therefore results can be used to provide decision-makers and industry with information on which to base policies and codes of practice relating to food safety. To date QMRAs have mainly been developed on a national basis, often as a request from a MS Government department. In order to facilitate the investigation of interventions at different points of the food chain most QMRAs take a farm-to- consumption approach; therefore modelling the prevalence of infection / contamination and the microbial load from the farm to the point of consumption (exposure). The probability of infection or illness can then be estimated by applying a dose-response model. Numerous QMRAs have been developed or are currently QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors. The present document is published complying with the transparency principle to which the European Food Safety Authority is subject. It may not be considered as an output adopted by EFSA. EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 2underway for Salmonella in pigs within the EU; including QMRAs for MS2 (Hill et al. 2009; al. 2009); Denmark (Alban et al. 2002; Hurd et al. 2008), Ireland (Barron et al., 2009) and the Netherlands (van der Gaag et al. 2004). However the QMRA requested by EFSA is the first EU QMRA for Salmonella in Pigs, which represents numerous challenges. In particular, the variability between MSs in their pig farms, slaughter houses and consumption patterns needed to be considered. This report documents the EFSA Salmonella in Pigs QMRA. The QMRA follows the framework as set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), the international standard-setting organisation for foods in international trade, and the EU Scientific Committee for Food (CAC, 1999). Therefore, the components of the QMRA are: Hazard Identification; Exposure Assessment; Hazard Characterisation and Risk Characterisation. The challenge of modelling the EU has been overcome by developing a generic model with a clearly defined set of parameters that may vary between countries, the values of which can be easily input for any specific EU MS. To demonstrate the parameterisation and use of the model, four MSs have been selected as case studies. The QMRA is a farm-to-consumption model. The model is stochastic and highly mechanistic, i.e. mathematically describing each process at each stage of the food chain in detail, which allows flexibility for the consideration of interventions. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of this report provide some context for the QMRA. Chapter 2 (Aims and Objectives of the QMRA) lists the issues/interventions identified by the EC for which the QMRA was designed and will address. In Chapter 3 (Hazard Identification and Characterisation of Salmonella in pork and pork products), the hazard posed by Salmonella to human health is characterised. Factors related to the pathogen, the human host and the vehicle (i.e. fresh pork meat) that may affect survival of Salmonella and lead to human illness are described. As described above, the QMRA is stochastic and therefore incorporates random chance into the model. Chapter 4 (Model Framework) describes how the generic EU model has been designed to be able to be applicable to all MSs and also the farm-to-consumption structure of the QMRA. The methodology used is described in Chapter 5 (Modelling Methodology) and, in particular, an explanat ion of the notation used throughout the report is given. The selection of the case studies MSs is detailed in Chapter 6. Here, the cluster analysis carried out to identify grouping of MSs within the EU and the criteria used to do this is described. Four clusters were identified and therefore 4 MSs were selected as case studies (MS1, MS2, MS3 and MS4), thus providing examples of how the QMRA can be parameterised. Although not possible to model all MSs, other MSs could parameterise the model with their own data and evaluate their own risk as required. Chapters 7 - 10 describe the exposure assessment, in particular the probability of infection / contamination and, where possible microbial load from the farm to the point of consumption. Chapter 7 outlines the Farm model, which describes the transmission of Salmonella on both breeder and grower-finisher pig farms. This allows for the investigation of the role of breeder farms on the prevalence of slaughter pigs. The output of this model is the within batch prevalence of Salmonella for slaughter-age pigs. To allow for differences between MSs, both large and small pig herds are considered. The Transport & Lairage model is described in Chapter 8 and models the pigs from the time of leaving the farm to the point of slaughter. The model assesses the probability of further infection occurring both within and between slaughter batches of pigs. Chapter 9 describes the Slaughter & Processing part of the QMRA. A mechanistic model, similar to that developed for Campylobacter in broilers (Nauta et al, 2005), has been developed which mathematically describes the possibility of cross-contamination within and between batches. Again, to reflect the QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors. The present document is published complying with the transparency principle to which the European Food Safety Authority is subject. It may not be considered as an output adopted by EFSA. EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 3differences in EU MSs, both a large and small slaughterhouse model have been developed. The endpoint of the Slaughter & Processing model is the Salmonella prevalence and microbial load on half-carcass after chilling (large slaughterhouse) and after splitting (small slaughterhouse). The further processing of the pork is modelled in Chapter 9 (Cutting Plant). Within this section of the model, the 3 pork product types to be considered are prepared; these are pork cuts; minced pork patties and fermented ready-to-eat sausage. The product types were selected to incorporate differences in product and consumption patterns within the EU. Finally, the preparation and consumption of the three pork product types by the consumer is considered in Chapter 10 (Preparation & Consumption). This model again considers the possibility of cross-contamination within the kitchen environment and also the possibility of under-cooking the product; both of which may result in human exposure to Salmonella . The outcome from the exposure assessment is the probability of exposure and also the number of salmonellae ingested per serving. Chapter 11 reviews the possible dose-response models for Salmonella and describes how this information is combined, using the selected dose-response model, to obtain a risk of illness per serving. Combining this information with consumption data provides an estimate for the number of cases. The results of th is analysis for the case study MSs are provided in Chapter 12 as well as the results for the uncertainty analysis. Model validation is an important aspect for any model and this is also described in this section, in particular the outputs from the model at the point of slaughter, at retail and also the number of human cases are compared to the relevant data. An essential component of the QMRA was to investigate the impact of interventions. A comprehensive review of Salmonella in pigs (EFSA, 2006), which explored possible interventions across the farm-to-consumption pathway, concluded that it was not possible to control Salmonella with the adoption of just one measure. In other words, the control of the Salmonella can only be achieved by the introduction of multiple interventions across the farm-to-consumption pathway. Farm-to-consumption QMRAs can assess the impact of such multiple controls and this approach was adopted. The selected interventions, methods of analysis and results are presented in Chapter 13. As mentioned previously, the proportion of human Salmonella cases in the EU that are due to the consumption of contaminated pork/pig-meat products is unknown. As part of this project, we aimed to investigate this using a microbial subtyping attribution model for Salmonella (Hald et al., 2004). Although it was not possible to investigate this as thoroughly as initially hoped due to the unavailability of the human data from ECDC during the time span of the project, a comparison and interpretation has been carried out for the available serovar data as well as an attribution model based on outbreak data, with particular emphasis on pigs and pork. This work is detailed in Chapter 14 (Source Attribution). The methods and results are considered further in the discussion (Chapter 15). Here particular emphasis is placed on the results of the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis and also the identified data deficiencies/g aps. Finally, conclusions are given in Chapter 16.

The objectives of the call are as follows:- A QMRA model that covers the whole food chain is required, beginning with a baseline model for the farm-to-fork chain, including risk characterisation. While slaughter (fattening) pigs are the main object of this risk assessment, the role of piglets as a source of Salmonella also needs to be considered. During transport and lairage, cross-contamination might occur both between-animal and between-batches (i.e. between herds) due to carry-over of Salmonella on surfaces from one day to the next. The model will concentrate on primary production through to raw pig meat and raw pig meat products arriving in the kitchen. The model will also include module(s) accounting for preparation and consumption of raw pig meat and raw pig meat products, and a dose response model, thus allowing numbers of human cases to be assessed. As a consequence of the objectives provided the VLA/RIVM/Food-DTU consortium have worked towards a full farm-to-consumption QMRA, which takes into consideration at every stage possible the opp ortunity of cross-contamination. To describe the cross-contamination the model needed to be highly mechanistic, which although it leads to a more complex model will allow a better examination of interventions for Salmonella in pigs. EFSA also provided details of the objectives raised by the EC and, in particular, are in the EC's Terms of Reference. These are as follows: 1. The expected reduction of Salmonella cases in humans (or pig meat at retail) by a reduction (e.g. 5- or 10-fold) of Salmonella prevalence in slaughter pigs (based on bacteriology or serology at slaughter) 2. The sources of infection for slaughter pigs at farm level 3. The reduction of the prevalence in slaughter pigs by the most important potential treatments or control measures at farm level. 4. The impact of transport, lairage and slaughter processes on contamination of carcasses. 5. The expected reduction of Salmonella cases in humans (or pig meat) by the most important control measures during transport, at lairage or during the slaughter process. Objectives 1, 3 and 5 are considered as part of an Intervention Analysis (Chapter 13). Within this section, both hypothetical interventions (e.g. 5-fold, 10-fold reductions, etc.) and specified reductions (e.g. increase cleaning) are considered. The Farm model (Chapter 7) considers different introductory sources of Salmonella (Objective 2) including weaners, feed and exte rnal contamination (e.g. rodents, birds, etc.). Finally, Objective 4 is considered in Chapter 8 (Transport & Lairage) and Chapter 9 (Slaughter & Processing) and, in particular, infection within and between batches is considered at Transport & Lairage and cross-contamination is considered between pigs on the slaughter line, between batches processed on the same day and between batches processed on different days.

Within the EU, at the farm level, there may be large variation in terms of size of farms, type of farms, size of slaughterhouses and slaughter methods. Finally, differences in the pork products consumed within the EU need to be taken into account. However this needed to be balanced with limited resources and time and, certainly, there was insufficient time to produce a QMRA for each MS. To address this issue a generic model has been developed for the EU (see Chapter 4). To demonstrate its use a number of MSs were selected as case studies. In terms of the variation in pork products consumed a small number of products were selected to represent differences in the processing of products. Information on how much of each selected product type is consumed in each MS is included as a parameter within the model. In the call, EFSA highlighted that, between countries, there are differences in the Salmonella serotypes that are present in slaughter pigs. In particular, many serotypes present in pigs may not be Salmonella of public health significance. However, since EFSA 2006 concluded that \"all Salmonella serovars in pork are to be regarded as a hazard for public health\" a QMRA for Salmonella spp. was developed. It is recognised that there will be variability between strains in their behaviours across the food chain however due to the expected data gaps in the variability of serotypes to survive / grow / persist in the farm-to-consumption chain EFSA deemed it acceptable to assume that all Salmonella behave similarly. It is important to note that the application of this simplifying assumption will result in the risk of illness (and hence also number of cases) being too high. However, given that one of the main emphasises is the reduction in risk of illness/number of human cases from the reduction of Salmonella in slaughter pigs or changes at Transport, Lairage or Slaughter, this approach is still valid. Approaches to address the above aims and objectives given above were identified by the VLA/RIVM/Food-DTU project proposal, submitted June 2007.

Illness can range from a mild to severe gastroenteritis and in some people, invasive disease, which can be fatal. Long term sequelae such as reactive arthritis can also result from Salmonella infections. In 2007, 151,995 human cases of Salmonella were reported in the EU (EFSA, 2009), of which the most common serovars were Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium. S. Enteritidis is primarily associated with the consumption of poultry products, particularly eggs. S. Typhimurium is found in a range of food-producing animals, including pigs, poultry, cattle and sheep. The proportion of human Salmonella cases in the EU that are due to the consumption of contaminated pork products is unknown. However, it is known that the most common serovar for pigs is S. Typhimurium and it is widely believed that pork products are an important source of these infections in humans. A comprehensive review of Salmonella in pigs (EFSA, 2006), which explored possible interventions across the farm-to-consumption pathway, concluded that it was not possible to control Salmonella with the adoption of just one measure, i.e. control of the hazard can only be achieved by the introduction of multiple interventions across the farm-to-consumption pathway. Activities in EU towards management of salmonellosis, therefore calls for evaluation of disease contribution from all parts of the pork-production chain. Modelling of the entire food chain (feed, food animal production, transport, slaughter, processing, retail and consumption patterns) will support decision makers to produce science-based recommendation, best procedures, and to implement legislation to regulate production across the EU. Mathematical sensitivity analysis can be employed to evaluate intervention strategies and subsequently be used as a base for cost/benefit analysis. Ultimately, the use of modelling tools should support food safety intervention in a more cost efficient way. The aim of this project is to develop a quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) for Salmonella in pigs for the EU. The model will be used to evaluate the effect of interventions on human health and other end-points (e.g. point of sale), and to estimate the number of human Salmonella cases that can be attributed to fresh pork products. The technique is, however, considered less accurate in predicting actual public health outcomes, because of the limited availability of dose-response information. Hazard identification and hazard characterisation are two of the corner stones of a QMRA. In the following, the hazard posed by Salmonella to human health is characterised including a description of factors related to the public health outcome due to exposure to Salmonella . This will serve as the hazard identification and the first general part of the hazard characterisation (the dose-response relationship is also part of Hazard Characterisation, but this is considered in Chapter 11).

Furthermore, relevant data sources (e.g. national or international databases) are presented. 3.2 The Organism 3.2.1 Classification and subtyping of Salmonella Salmonella is a genus of gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacteria that can infect people, birds, reptiles, and other animals. Currently the genus Salmonella is divided into two species: S. enterica and S. bongori. Recently a third species, S. subterranea was identified (Shebolina et al., 2004). It was recognised in 2005, and the CDC may incorporate this species in the nomenclature system in near future. The species S. enterica consist of six subspecies: S. enterica , S. salamae, S. arizonae, S. diarizonae, S. houtenae and S. indica whereas no subspecies has been assigned to S. bongori or S. subterranea (Su and Chiu, 2007). Based on the combination of bacterial surface-antigens the genus Salmonella is subdivided into 2,541 serovars (also called serotypes) (Popoff & Le Minor, 2001) For convenience the serovars are denominated by genus and serovar only (e.g. Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium Salmonella Typhimurium to Popoff et al. e nterica . Most zoonotic serovars associated with human illness are in this group. Table 3.1: Current Salmonella nomenclature (Su & Chiu, 2007).

All Salmonella serovars are considered potentially pathogenic for humans, but the degree of host adaptation varies, which affects the pathogenicity. Some serovars of S. enterica subspecies enterica: S. Typhi , S. Paratyphi and S. Sendai, are highly adapted to man (M\u00f8lbak et al., 2006). They cause severe systemic illness in humans characterised by fever and abdominal symptoms (enteric/ (para)typhoid fever (Miller et al ., 1995). These serovars are usually not pathogenic to animals and are not considered to have a zoonotic potential. Therefore human infections with these serovars should not be included in a risk assessment on Salmonella in slaughter and breeder pigs. For the purpose of this study the serovars denominated \"non-typhoid QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Non-typhoid, ubiquitous serotypes, such as S. Typhimurium, affect both humans and a wide range of animals, where they usually cause gastrointestinal infections of varying severity. The ability of the zoonotic serovars to infect animals and eventually infect humans via food seems to vary (Hald et al., 2006). Certain zoonotic serovars appear to be more animal species specific e.g. S. Cholerasuis in pigs, S. Dublin in cattle, S. Abortus-ovis in sheep, and S. Gallinarum in poultry. They frequently cause disease in infected animal populations of the associated animal species but are only occasionally identified in cases of human infections where they may produce no, mild or serious disease (Acha & Szyfres, 1987; M\u00f8lbak et al., 2006). The non-host-adapted serotypes are those with principal zoonotic significance. For some of the more common Salmonella serovars a subtyping system based on lysis of Salmonella from a panel of Salmonella bacteriophages (phage-typing) is available. Thus, phage typing is routinely used for the serotypes S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium into phage types (PT) in S. Enteritidis or definitive types (DT) in S. Typhimurium. Genetic typing methods (e.g. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) or Multi-Locus Variable-Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA)) are able to further differentiate Salmonella . Also plasmid profiling (typing of the transferable gene structures, plasmids) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be used to characterise Salmonella isolates. Subtyping of Salmonella is used in epidemiological investigations. The high differentiation of strains obtained from genotyping is particularly useful in the investigation of outbreaks, as it helps to define groups of cases that have been infected from the same strain from the same source. (M\u00f8lbak et al., 2006). 3.2.2 Growth and inactivation Reduction of Salmonella or prevention of its growth throughout the farm-to- consumption chain are important factors in modelling the infection risk to humans because these factors have potential as control measures against human salmonellosis. The normal habitat of non-typhoid Salmonella is the gut of warm blooded animals. But also the oviduct of laying hens may harbour Salmonella (particularly S. Enteritidis) (Humphrey, 1999) and most Salmonella in the non- enterica Salmonella species are considered reptile-associated. The optimal environment and the range of physical and chemical parameters for growth of Salmonella reflects the adaption of the bacteria to the habitat. Different physical and chemical measures may be used alone or in combinations (e.g. \u00c1lvarez et al., 2003) to control Salmonella at different points in the farm-to-feed chain through prevention or inhibition of the multiplication and spread of the bacteria or through reduction or elimination of existing contamination. The efficiency of these to factors to control Salmonella is time-dependent and Salmonella show some serovar variation in growth ecology which has to be considered when e.g. hurdle effects are discussed. (Bell & Kyriakides, 2002; ICMSF, 1996). QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Most serotypes fail to grow at temperatures below 7 \u00b0C. The resistance to heat depends on other parameters as water activity (a w). Salmonella do not survive pasteurisation but is relatively resistant to freezing. (Bell & Kyriakides, 2002). In the pigs and pork production chain, reduction or kill of Salmonella through heat treatment is used for e.g. heat treatment of animal feed, hot-water wash of contaminated carcasses and heat treatment in processing and preparation of food. Optimal growth temperatures in the gut of animals and humans or in improperly stored food may promote growth of the bacteria, and refrigeration of carcasses, during processing and storage or in prepared food limits the growth of Salmonella . The optimal pH range for growth of Salmonella is 7.0-7.5 and the range for growth is 3.8-9.5. Most serovars will not grow below pH 4.5 (Bell & Kyriakides, 2002; ICMSF, 1996). Reducing pH can be used to control the growth of Salmonella. Thus, organic acids are used as feed additive or in marinated food, and a low pH may be achieved in properly fermented wet feed and through fermentation of food (e.g. salami). A low pH in the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans is a strong barrier against Salmonella infections. It is achieved from secretion of gastric acid and fermentation of carbohydrates in the contents of stomach and gut resulting in lowered pH from an increase in short-chain organic acids, and in particular their un-dissociated forms which are toxic to Salmonella (Hansen 2004). Feeding pigs with meal feed, fermented wet feed and coarsely grinded feed (compared to pelleted, dry and finely grinded feed) improves the fermentation in the gut of the pig, and is able to reduce Salmonella infections at the herd level. The optimal water activity for Salmonella growth is a w 0,99 and Salmonella growth stops at a water activity below approximately 0.94 depending on pH and temperature. The low water activity is utilised as a control measure for microbial growth and persistence in e.g. dry storing of feed or food, and in desiccation of surfaces in the farm and farm environment, in slaughterhouses, processing plants and kitchens. Besides from desiccation low water activity can also be achieved from e.g. high salinity or sugar contents in food. But even very low water activity (in e.g. chocolate, black pepper and peanut butter) may not eliminate Salmonella and sufficient cell numbers to cause infection in animals and humans can and do survive for log time periods (Bell & Kyriakides, 2002; ICMSF, 1996). Other de-contamination procedures as gamma-irradiation, UV-irradiation or ultrasonic waves are able to reduce or eliminate bacterial contamination as well and may be considered for decontamination of e.g. animal feed, food and surfaces. Only few chemical disinfectants are effective when applied to surfaces in e.g. farms, where the presence of some organic matter often is unavoidable (e.g. strongly alkaline disinfectants and aldehydes). Fo r disinfection of cleaned surfaces in slaughterhouses, cutting plans, retail and in the kitchen more harmless disinfectants may be used (e.g. hypochlorite, iodine and quaternary ammonium compounds).

Infected animals will carry Salmonella in the faeces and the usual route of infection is through faecal-oral transmission. The epidemiology of Salmonella is, therefore, primarily due to direct or indirect faecal contamination of live animals, food or humans (D'Aoust, 1989). For slaughter animals including pigs, the c ontamination or cross-contamination of carcasses is basically a question of redistributing the Salmonella bacteria from the positive animals during slaughter and further processing. The majority of human infections is believed to be acquired through the foodborne route, where exposure often occurs when the bacteria are introduced in food preparation areas and are allowed to multiply in food e.g. due to inadequate storage temperatures, or because of inadequate cooking or cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food. The organism may also be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or faecally contaminated environments. Person-to-person transmission does also happen occasionally. Humans are normally infected by oral uptake of Salmonella through contaminated food. The infective dose varies depending on strain virulence, food type involved and age and immune status of the patient. For non-adapted serotypes, there are grounds to believe that the concept of an infective dose of 10 5 to 107, as determined from volunteer-feeding studies no longer applies. From outbreak data it has been shown that as few as 10 cells can cause disease (D'Aoust, 1989; Hennessy et al., 1996; M\u00f8lbak et al., 2006). Furthermore, outbreak data suggest that the infective dose is lower in foods with a high fat content due to the protection of cells from the effect of the gastric acid (Kapperud et al., 1990; Hedberg et al., 1992; Hennessy et al., 1996; M\u00f8lbak et al., 2006). The infection may be subclinical i.e. without symptoms or lead to disease (salmonellosis). Salmonellosis is caused by different virulence factors leading to diarrhoea due to increased secretion or impaired fluid uptake in the gut, phagocytosis of the bacteria into gut cells and systemic intoxication due to enterotoxins released from the bacterial cell wall during die-off of the bacteria. (M\u00f8lbak et al ., 2006). Following an incubation period ranging from 6 to 48 hours, the first clinical symptoms appear. They are usually characterised by gastroenteritis including diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, fever, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and malaise (M\u00f8lbak et al., 2006). Remission usually occurs within 3-4 days, but the symptoms may last for 10 days or longer (Miller et al., 1995).

Case-fatality rates between 0.7% and 1.3% have been reported from the US (Cohen and Tauxe, 1986), and 1.2% in Denmark (Fisker, et al ., 2003). A recent Danish population study based on registry data, however, estimated the 1-year mortality rate to 3.1%, suggesting that the mortality rate may be underestimated. Sequela such as reactive arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, which occur as a triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis and urethritis, and eythema nodosum are well-known late-onset complications seen in a subset of patients. Reactive arthritis occurs at an average of 10 days after the onset of diarrhoea in 2-15% of salmonellosis cases (M\u00f8lbak et al., 2006). The excreta of infected persons will contain large numbers of Salmonella spp. at the time of onset of illness. Those numbers decrease with the passing of time. The intermittent faecal shedding that follows the acute phase of gastroenteritis may be of short duration (4-5 weeks) or may persist for more than a year (chronic carriers) (D'Aoust, 1991b; Miller et al ., 1995; M\u00f8lbak et al ., 2006). Some serovar-related differences occur as 90% of cases infected with S. Typhimurium are culture negative at nine weeks, whereas more than 20% with other serotypes are still shedding at 20 weeks (Miller et al., 1995). It is estimated that between 0.2 and 0.6% of cases with non-typhoid salmonellosis develops a chronic carrier state (M\u00f8lbak et al ., 2006). Human carriers are of special concern in the food-manufacturing and food-service industries, because of the risk of contamination of foods. Several outbreaks caused by food handlers have been described (e.g. Hedberg et al ., 1991; Anonymous, 1999a; Maguire et al., 2000; Ethelberg et al., 2004). Demographic and societal factors contributing to human salmonellosis Despite the many efforts to prevent and control food borne salmonellosis during the last twenty years, this pathogen continues to be one of leading causes of human gastroenteritis. There exist many factors that contribute to this development. Among these are characteristics of the population, the increasing globalisation of the food trade and changes in industrial structure, and changes in consumer behaviours. Populations with increased susceptibility Children and elderly people are considered to be more at risk of an infection with Salmonella than the average adult (D'Aoust, 1989). It is generally accepted, that immunocompromised people suffering from underlying diseases e.g. cancer, AIDS or chronic bowel disorders, are more prone to an infection than people in good health (D'Aoust, 1989; Berends et al ., 1998). People receiving antacids have also been reported as having an increased risk of infection due to the increased pH-level in the ventricle (Miller et al., 1995). Since the group of both elderly and chronically diseased people is growing, this may also contribute to the explanation of the continuing high level of human salmonellosis (Altekruse et al., 1998). The emergence of multi-drug resistant Salmonella types e.g. S. Typhimurium DT104, is of special concern in humans that at the time of exposure are undergoing treatment with antibiotics due to another infectious disease. The increased risk of infection in already debilitated patients has been demonstrated in several investigations, among these in an American case-control study reporting the risk factors associated with S. Typhimurium DT104 infections (Glynn et al ., 1998). Consequently, the emergence of resistant Salmonella in combination with the use of antibiotics in humans contributes to an increased incidence of human salmonellosis. Compared with patients infected with susceptible Salmonella strains, patients with multi-drug resistant infections are also more likely to have a protracted course of QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Salmonella infections are generally self-limiting, requiring no or only symptomatic treatment such as fluid and electrolytic replacement. However, antibiotic treatment may be required in vulnerable patients or in patients with extra-intestinal infections or severe or protracted gastroenteritis. Because most resistant Salmonella strains, including the typical penta-resistant S. Typhimurium DT104, are sensitive to fluoroquinolones, fluoroquinolones are routi nely used for empiric treatment. However, infections caused by strains with reduced susceptibility to quinolones may result in reduced effect of treatment (M\u00f8lbak et al., 1999). Globalisation of food trade and consolidation of food industries A rapidly growing international trade in live animals (incl. breeding animals), animal feed stuffs, raw materials and processed foods has facilitated the introduction of new Salmonella types in importing countries and resulted in an increasing length and complexity of the food chain (D'Aoust, 1994). Concurrently, there has been an increase in the consolidation of food industries, including the primary production, and mass distribution. This trend toward greater geographic distribution of products from large centralised food processors carries a risk for more widespread outbreaks affecting more people (Gray & Mossel, 1992; Altekruse et al ., 1998). The dissemination of S. Enteritidis in the table-egg industry is an evident example of this (Thorns, 2000; EFSA, 2006). Consumer behaviours There is an increasing tendency for consumers to eat more meals outside the home. This results in an increase of meals prepared for large-scale production, where improper holding temperatures, delayed serving, improper heat treatment e.g. due to a sudden demand for a special dish, or preparation of food in premises that are too small, are reported as frequently observed risk factors associated with outbreaks (Bryan, 1988; Anonymous, 2000). In addition, subclinically infected food handlers may play an important role in outbreaks from foodservice establishments (D'Aoust, 1989; Anonymous, 2000). Outbreaks that occur outside the home accounted for almost 80% of reported outbreaks in USA around 1990 (Altekruse et al., 1998). Consumers have also changed their shopping habits towards less frequent, but more large-scale purchases, which consequently result in the storage of foods in the home for relatively long periods in conditions, which are also often less than ideal. So, even though, deep-freezers and refrigerators are common facilities in the modern home, their use may lead to decreased awareness of the perishability of foods (Gray and Mossel, 1992). Besides contaminated raw materials, the most important factors contributing to outbreaks in households are reported to be improper cooling, inadequate cooking, cross-contamination and preparation of food several hours before consumption (Bryan, 1988; Michanie et al., 1988; Anonymous, 1999b). Traditionally, foods implicated in foodborne outbreaks have been poultry products including eggs, red meats and unpasteurised milk. In recent years, however, new types of food previously thought to be safe are considered to be hazardous. These include in particular fresh produce, which may partly be as a response to health promotion increasing the consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables that may be contaminated with animal faeces during growth, harvest and distribution. Increasing numbers of foodborne outbreaks have been traced back to these kinds of products. In particular, alfalfa sprouts has been implicated in large multi-state or -national outbreaks (Mahon et al ., 1997; et al ., 1999), and sprouts are QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

International travel has also increased rapidly during the 20th century. In countries with a low prevalence of Salmonella in their domestic livestock and food this fact influences the national human statistics markedly. In Sweden and Norway, for instance, it is estimated that approximately 70-80% of all human Salmonella infections are acquired abroad (Kapperud & Hasseltvedt, 1999; EFSA, 2007a). Overall, around 50% of human Salmonella cases in EU were reported to be acquired domestically and 7% abroad in 2006. For 43% of the cases there was no available travel information (EFSA, 2008a). If travel-associated cases constitute a considerable proportion of cases this is likely to impact the expected effect of national intervention strategies and the information is therefore important from a risk assessment point of view. Unfortunately, only few countries have a systematic registration of travel history. Finally, the recent food scares (e.g. BSE and dioxin) has shown that the widespread announcement of these stories in the media has a big influence on the behaviour of consumers for shorter or longer periods (Mitchell & Greatorex, 1992). This factor is important to consider when interpreting the trends in human food borne infections. 3.3.2 Disease incidence and burden of human salmonellosis Statistics for the incidence of human salmonellosis (and other foodborne infections) are notoriously difficult to compare between countries and sometimes even within a country, as they depend on the definition of a case, the diagnostic method used and how the information is collected and analysed. In addition, the subjective reactions of the patients and general practitioners will influence whether a case will be diagnosed and reported. First the patient has to feel ill enough to consult a doctor, who secondly must decide to take a diagnostic sample. Thirdly, the diagnostic laboratory must recover the pathogenic organism from the sample. Finally, the result has to be reported to a central database containing data from all (or almost all) national diagnostic laboratories. Based on this, it is clear that only a minor proportion of the actual number of cases is reported and that the size of this proportion varies greatly between countries. This is also confirmed by the results of the so-called disease burden studies conducted in several countries in order to estimate the true burden of disease (Wheeler et al., 1999; Mead et al., 1999; Gallay et al., 2000; de Wit et al., 2001a, 2001b; van Pelt et al., 2003). The studies suggest that for every reported case of salmonellosis, between 3.8 and 38 persons in the population fell ill (M\u00f8lbak et al., 2006). Human salmonellosis is the second ranking foodborne disease in EU and most European countries, only exceeded by campylobacteriosis. A large proportion of the observed difference between, for instance, Portugal, Germany and Czech Republic is undoubtedly a result of differences in reporting systems rather than a true difference in incidence rates. Still, a considerable proportion may be due to differences in food preferences and preparation, and the prevalence of Salmonella in animals and foods in the MSs. But even though, the actual figures cannot be compared, it is possible to compare the trends and distributions of serovars. In 2007, the reported number of confirmed cases and incidence of human salmonellosis in EU MSs were 151,995 cases, corresponding to an incidence of 31.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (EFSA, 2009). Germany accounted for 36.4% of all reported cases, whereas the incidence was greatest in the Czech Republic (171.6 cases per 100,000).

Within each reporting MS, statistically significant and decreasing trends (2004-2007) were observed in Austria, Spain and Poland. The two most common Salmonella serovars have for many years been S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium, representing 81% of all known types in 2007, compared to 85.7% in 2006. Poultry are the main reservoir of S. Enteritidis and poultry products, especially table-eggs, are recognised as the primary source of human S. Enteritidis infections (EFSA, 2007a). S. Typhimurium is endemic in domestic livestock in most countries (EFSA, 2007a; Thorns, 2000). In contrast to S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium is not related to a particular animal reservoir, but can infect many different hosts. However, the different subtypes (phage types) of S. Typhimurium are often heterogeneously distributed in the various animal reservoirs making it possible to assess the major sources of these infections as described later on in this report (Chapter 14). On this basis, it is estimated that most S. Typhimurium infections are caused by consumption of meat, particularly pork. The geographical distribution of human S. Typhimurium infections is presented in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Laboratory confirmed cases of Salmonella Typhimurium incidences in humans in EU, 2006 ( Salmonella Atlas: www.epigis.dk ) The cost of human salmonellosis to the society has been estimated in a study in the United States of America and in Denmark. It was found that the burden in the US was an estimated 1.4 million infections, which results in 168 000 visits to physicians, 15 000 hospitalisations and 580 deaths annually in a population of 300 million (84 % health care coverage; U.S. Census 2004). As the cost of individual cases can be estimated to be in the range of USD 40 for uncomplicated cases to USD 4.6 million for cases ending with hospitalisation and death the total annual cost is estimated to be 3 billion Dollars. Danish estimates show that the annual cost is USD 15.5 million equivalent to 0.009% of gross domestic national product. To evaluate the cost effectiveness of the Danish Salmonella control programme the cost was compared to the resulting reduction of cases concluding that the benefit amounts to USD 25.5 million annually (WHO, 2005).

In the following, each major step in the farm-to-consumption continuum will be presented focusing on potential sources of Salmonella, factors important for the transmission of Salmonella from one step to the next, and options for interventions.

Arrows indicate sources of introduction of Salmonella into the production chain. 3.4.2 Farm Modern swine production is developing into a specialised industry, where the production steps are optimised by separation of age groups on different farms. Some farmers specialise in the genetic improvement of breeding stock, delivering young breeding animals (gilts and young boars) to sow herds. The sow herds are supplying weaners to finishing farms, where the slaughter pigs are produced. In farrow-to- finishing herds, the age groups are usually separated in segregated farm buildings with an all-in/all-out production. In contrast, the traditional swine production is predominantly run as farrow-to-finish operations, often on a family farm basis, where all the steps mentioned above is integrated at one single farm (Figure 3.3).

Sectioned rearing in a modern pig production unit. Traditional production sites will have integrated sow and slaughter pig herds. Sources and transmission of Salmonella in pig herds Pigs are reared at farms either practicing batch-production with thorough cleaning and disinfection prior to introduction of new batches of pigs or continuous production where new pigs successively are introduced to the unit after removal of pigs for slaughter. One of the most important routes for introduction of Salmonella into a pig herd is by purchase of infected pigs or by establishment of new herds from an infected source. In continuous production systems, pathogens such as Salmonella are more readily transferred from older to younger pigs thus contributing to the maintenance of infections in the herd. Salmonella can also be introduced by the feedstuff and feed, and in particular protein containing feedstuff. Feedstuff of animal or igin are more often contaminated with Salmonella serovars that are prevalent further up the food production chain ( S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis), whereas Salmonella serotypes coming from feed components with vegetable origin often are of more diverse types (Berends, 1996; Davies, 1997) as are serovars in feedstuff originating from countries outside EU e.g. soy beans and products hereof from South America (Hald et al. , 2006).

Inadequate biosecurity may therefore contribute to maintain a herd infection, and boots, clothing and tools can be vectors for introduction of infection unless properly cleaned or changed before entry to the herd. Other vehicles of introduction are cars, tools, pets (cats, dogs with access to the herd) and wildlife such as rodents, birds, and insects (Lo Fo Wong & Hald, 2000). Once introduced, Salmonella may establish and multiply in the gastrointestinal tract of susceptible pigs. From here it can be passed on to pen mates, neighbour pens and eventually to the entire herd. Sows may pass the infection on to their offspring, but often piglets weaned to cleaned and disinf ected pens avoid the infection (Dahl et al., 1997). If continuous production is practiced, transfer of Salmonella via faecal material may maintain the infection in the herd. As Salmonella can survive in the herd environment, insufficient cleaning of pens and equipment between batches can lead to transmission of Salmonella to the following batches of pigs. (Lo Fo Wong et al. ., 2002). When the slaughter pigs reach the preferred weight (60-120 kg) in 4-5 months, they are transported by truck to the slaughterhouse. Intervention against Salmonella in slaughter pig herds Purchase of Salmonella negative pigs is of particular importance in herds with low Salmonella infection level or no Salmonella infection. Batch (all in/all out) production enables the farmer to break infection chains between batches by cleaning and disinfecting the production sites prior to introducing new pigs. Feed can be formulated and treated to reduce survival and multiplication of Salmonella, once ingested, in the gastrointestinal tract by lowering pH and increasing the concentration of short-chain organic acids (Hansen, 2004). This may be obtained from coarse grinding of the feed, from using meal feed as opposed to pelleted feed, adding not heat treated grains to the feed ration or from feeding fermented wet feed to the pigs. Adding organic acids to the water or feed to achieve reduction of Salmonella in the gut has some effect as well. To reduce infection risk, codes for good farming practice should be followed: ensure daily routines starting in lower risk areas towards high risk areas i.e. from sections with young animal to older animals where the likelihood of an animals having been exposed to infection is higher. Other measures are to wash and disinfect hands continuously between infected and non-infected areas and clean/disinfect or change boots and change clothes on entry to barns To avoid in-farm spread by rearing pigs in smaller groups and avoiding physical contact between groups through sectioning and closed pen separations. To prevent Salmonella entering the feed and subsequently the herd, measures can be taken to transport and store the feed and feedstuff in clean environments, and implement heat treatment of the grain and/or acidification of the feed. Ensure high biosecurity by controlling the entrance of rodents, birds, insects, etc. and restrict traffic by personnel and pets.

The Salmonella counts in faecal material from pigs may vary from below detectable levels in carrier animals (with no proliferation of Salmonella in the gut) to typical counts below 1010 cfu/g in subclinically infected animals and counts exceeding 1010 cfu/g in animals with salmonellosis. Monitoring the prevalence of Salmonella at the farm level has the advantage of avoiding between farm infection/cross-contamination, which can occur when sampling pigs or carcasses at the slaughterhouse. It is, however, often more laborious and resource intensive, and therefore typically applied only in breeding and multiplying herds with no continuous flow of pigs for slaughter. Pen-faecal samples and/or blood samples are the preferred material collected at the farm. Once a herd is detected as infected, identification of the Salmonella serovar(s) and its distribution in the herd may point to the source of infection. On a national or regional basis, mapping of spread and shifts in Salmonella serovars in the primary production is important to assess the coverage of serological surveillance tools based on detection of antibodies against Salmonella. Finally, knowledge about the serovar distribution in pig herds may provide useful information for assessing the role of pigs and pork in human salmonellosis and for trace-back in investigations of human outbreaks. In the last decade, monitoring programmes have been established in a number of EU MSs. Still only 9 MSs reported having monitoring of Salmonella in slaughter pigs at farms or slaughterhouses in 2006 (EFSA, 2007a). Most of these countries take measures as a consequence of infection or isolation of Salmonella in pig herds. Even less MSs reported to have monitoring of Salmonella in breeding and multiplying herds. 3.4.3 Transport and lairage Sources and transmission of Salmonella at transport and lairage Pigs are transported to the slaughterhouse in trucks either by professional transport companies or by the farmer. After arrival to the slaughterhouse pigs are held in pens in the lairage for varying length of time. Transportation time may be relatively long in areas with more industrialised pig production, where large centralised slaughterhouses receive animals from distant farms. In high intensity production farms slaughter pigs are usually transported by truck separately from pigs from other farms. In less intensive production systems or in farm-slaughterhouse setups, pigs may have shorter transport distances, but as one truck may pick up pigs from several farms, the time spent on the truck may be prolonged. Poorly managed logistics may also prolong transportation time as well as the time spent in lairage. The holding time in the lairage, preferably without any further mixing of pigs is important to ensure that the meat quality is not affected by transportation stress. On the other hand, the lairage is a potential source of Salmonella exposure to the pigs, and increasing holding time will increase the risk of exposure and infection/contamination of the pigs.

Several studies have reported a significant increase in the number of pigs excreting Salmonella upon arrival at the slaughterhouse (Williams & Newell, 1970; Berends et al. , 1996; Rajkowski et al. , 1998). The reason for this increased shedding has not been entirely revealed. One explanation may be that Salmonella negative slaughter pigs during transportation to the slaughterhouse, may be infected from previously contaminated trucks that have not been thoroughly cleaned, or from Salmonella infected pigs loaded on the same truck (Williams & Newell, 1970; Rajkowski et al. , 1998). There is no doubt that transportation of the pigs induces a stressful condition. During transportation, pigs are subjected to many stress factors e.g. noise, smells, mixing with \"unfamiliar\" pigs from other rearing pens or farms, high stocking densities, long duration of transport, change of environmental temperature and a general change of environment (Warriss et al. , 1992). The stress is known to increase defecation in the pigs and thus add to contamination of the environment from infected pigs. But stress may as well induce carriers to shed Salmonella at a higher rate or increase the susceptibility of Salmonella -free pigs to infection (Williams & Newell, 1970; Gronstal et al. , 1974; Mulder, 1995). The influence of stress on the shedding of Salmonella is still a subject for discussion. Intervention against Salmonella at transport and lairage Physical separation of herds (and faecal material) during transport and lairage will prevent the spread of Salmonella between herds Clean trucks for transport and pens at lairage prior to introduction of new pigs. Reduce transportation time and holding time in the lairage. Reduction of physical and psychical stress, by careful handling and transport, by transport and holding of pigs in groups with familiar individuals. The effect of reduced stress remain to be thoroughly documented. 3.4.4 Slaughterhouse Practices of pig slaughtering differs both within and between MSs, from small slaughterhouses with a few employees to large slaughterhouses that are highly automated; slaughtering thousands of animals per day. Evidently, practices and use of equipment varies significantly as do codes of practice, preventive measures, and monitoring schemes.

Figure 3.4 illustrates the principal construction and flow of in a typical pig slaughterhouse. \u00b4From the lairage, the pigs are led to the stunning unit, after which they are bled and submerged in the scalding tank, where superficial skin destruction will loosen the hairs to enable the following dehairing process. The scalding may reduce the Salmonella counts on the carcass surface somewhat, but even at recommended temperatures Salmonella can be isolated from scalding water (Chau et al. ., 1977; Gill & Bryant, 1992; Gill & Bryant, 1993; Hald et al. ., 2003). In particular if the temperature of the water drops below the recommended 62 \u00b0C, the water will contribute to cross-contamination of inner and outer surfaces of the carcass. At even lower temperatures the water may even serve as a growth media for Salmonella (M\u00f8lbak et al. ., 2006). Salmonella in larger coherent masses of faecal or other organic material released into the scalding water may not be killed even at proper water temperatures. The dehairing machines are prone to contamination and are difficult to clean. The dehairing process can result in transfer of bacteria from an infected animal to an otherwise clean animal. At singeing, the outer surface of the carcass is exposed to high temperatures resulting in superficial decontamination and destruction of the skin. Certain areas of the carcass will be less exposed to the heat than others. Following singeing the carcass will be scraped in the polishing device constructed to remove the superficially burnt skin. The dehairing and polishing may result in release of contaminated fluids and faeces from rectum, the oral cavity and the respiratory tract out onto the surface of the carcass, and the equipment may add to cross-contamination of the following carcasses. In a study of European slaughterhouses, Hald et al. (2003) found the polishing process to be significantly associated with carcass contamination, and the study indicated that Salmonella may persist in the polishing machine for longer periods of time. During the evisceration- and pluck removal processes, interior and exterior surfaces of the carcass will frequently be contaminated with intestinal contents either direct or indirectly from the tongue and tonsil area even if the procedures have been performed correctly. Hald et al. . (2003) found the pluck removal to be a significant risk factor for carcass contamination especially if the scalding tank was contaminated. The use of special measures to avoid contamination of the carcass from rectum during evisceration has proven very efficient. Splitting of the carcass, may also contribute to contamination and cross- contamination. The saw and screens around it are difficult to clean, and considerable amounts of wet organic matter (saw \"dust\") is a potential source for growth and spread of Salmonella unless handled properly. Any handling at the slaughterhouse, even trimming and traditional manual meat inspection will contribute to the contamination level on pig carcasses. In general, the contamination level on carcasses tend to be low or modest, but where accidents (e.g. puncture of intestines) have occurred, high levels of faecal contamination may be present on a number of carcasses following the accident. Traditional small slaughterhouses tend to have more manual handling by slaughter personnel and more contact with surfaces (e.g. carcasses lying on tables or floor vs. hanging).

Some MSs have special slaughter procedures e.g. de-hiding and decapitation. After dressing, the carcasses are chilled and stored at low temperatures. Many larger slaughterhouses use blast chilling of the carcasses, resulting in a superficial freezing of the skin. This freezing is not likely to influence the counts of Salmonella on the carcasses, as it is short lasting and Salmonella is relatively resistant to freezing. Intervention against Salmonella at the slaughterhouse Batch-type slaughter, separating herds on the slaughter line. Logistic slaughter with special/separate handling of pigs from high risk Salmonella herds (high shedding) Temperature monitoring and alarm for scalding water and during cold storage. Singeing at 1300-1500 \u00b0C Cleaning and disinfection of equipment between batches and carcasses (knives, robots, conveyer belts etc.). Controlling contamination from evisceration processes: use of bung bags or similar device when removing intestinal system, careful evisceration to avoid accidental puncture of the intestine and separation of the plucks from the rest of the cutting process. Removal of the head before splitting of the carcass to avoid cross- contamination from the oral cavity in particular for animals from highly infected herds. Bacteriological end-point monitoring of Salmonella on carcasses, and procedures to follow up in case of increasing carcass prevalence at slaughterhouses Training of slaughterhouse personnel Monitoring of Salmonella at the slaughterhouse Data from monitoring of Salmonella at the slaughterhouses may be used for detection of animal or herd infection status, for controlling slaughter hygiene, for tracing of foodborne outbreaks, and to obtain a serovar collection from pigs or pork. According to EFSA (2007a), approximately half of the EU MSs have implemented bacteriological monitoring programmes for Salmonella in pigs and pig meat at slaughterhouses or cutting plants. At slaughter Salmonella from gut contents of infected animals will frequently contaminate the inner and outer surface of the carcass, and Salmonella may be isolated from tonsils and gastrointestinal lymph nodes, and from meat samples after cutting. By far the majority of monitoring schemes are based on culture for Salmonella in surface/carcass swabs. But also culture of lymph nodes or meat samples as well as serological monitoring for herd status are used routinely. Depending on the purpose of sampling and the slaughterhouse design, different points of sampling may be preferred. The faeces of the pigs at the start of slaughter - indicate the introduction of Salmonella to the slaughterhouse, but do not provide information about the level of contamination and cross-contamination and thus the bacteriological status of the end product. The skin of the pigs at the start of slaughter - does primarily reflect the infection in the intestine of the pig and in the herd of origin, but also cross- contamination during transport and lairage. Lymph nodes - indicate that the pigs have been infected with Salmonella , but does not provide information about actual faecal shedding QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

May also serve as an indicator of consumer exposure. Meat juice - can identify Salmonella carrier pigs or pigs already cleared of infection. In early phases of infection animals may be sero-negative despite considerable faecal shedding. Serology is mainly recommended for determining herd infection status. 3.4.5 Processing and retail Sources and transmission of Salmonella at processing and retail Though the processing and retail levels of pork production are very much depending on the quality of raw materials and products that entering, they too have a responsibility towards the quality of the end product and prevent contaminated products to reach the consumer. Three main factors which influence the microbiologically quality of meats are handling, time and temperature. Hygienic and sensible handling of raw materials is vital to successfully avoid cross-contamination between products, whereas time and temperature abuses may create situations that support survival and propagation of microorganisms that may be present in foods. At the processing and retail levels, large quantities of raw meat of different origin are handled closely together. There may be half carcasses and different size cuts of various pathogenic status present during processing and, moreover, meat from different types of production animals, creating numerous opportunities for cross- contamination or spread of pathogenic microorganisms. Temperatures experienced during storage and display will affect the product storage/shelf life. If the temperature of meat and meat products is kept sufficiently low (below 6 \u00b0C) during storage and transport to and from the whole sale, growth of Salmonella can be kept to a minimum. However, retail display is possibly the weakest link in the commercial cold chain (James & Bailey, 1990), adding to the concern that Salmonella may proliferate to hazardous numbers during periods of temperature abuse in display cases. Pork that is processed into special products may be preserved in order to enhance the microbiological stability. Such preservation approaches include acidification, fermentation, curing, smoking, heating, etc. Important parameters on which these preservation methods are based include: control of initial numbers of bacteria, pH, water activity, microbial competition/intera ction, preservatives, oxidation reduction potential, temperature and radiation (Genigeorgis & Sofos, 1999). Preservation of the pork products is done to extend the shelf life, but the shelf life will also depend on the initial bacterial load, since the probability of e.g. Salmonella to survive in a hostile environment and grow to infective levels is a function of the initial numbers present. So for processed ready-to-eat products, it is imperative that the raw materials are of good microbiological quality. For fresh pork products, there are no preservation (except for cooling) or decontamination steps at the processing and retail levels. This means that the amount of contaminated fresh product in a batch of cuts and carcasses at best will QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Whereas the consumer level has been described as the last line of defence two decades ago (WHO, 1980), it is important to realise that the retail level is the last 'check-point' at which contaminated end products can be identified. Intervention against Salmonella at processing and retail. As fresh pork products (per definition) are not decontaminated in any way, only preventive measures are optional for minimising the Salmonella contamination in the meat. Storage below 6 \u00b0C at all times (transport from slaughterhouse/cutting plant, storage and display) Limit storage time and shelf life according to the risk of breaks in the cooling chain Maintain clean environment Maintain high hygienic standards amongst personnel Educating the people handling the food Monitoring Salmonella at processing and retail Most processing plants and many retailers have established HACCP programmes, with standardised hygienic routines and processing procedures, and regular monitoring of e.g. storage and display temperatures. Product and equipment samples may be taken to monitor the effect of the hygienic precautions and/or to observe increases in Salmonella contaminated products. The number of samples to be taken depends on the prevalence of Salmonella and the level of safety required. 3.4.6 Preparation and consumption The final step in the production chain is when the consumer brings the product home, stores the product and handles the product during preparation of meals. Retail is the last step where reduction and prevention of contamination can be controlled by food authorities. The responsibility for proper and safe handling of the food in the final steps of the production chain is handled over to the consumer. Sources and transmission of Salmonella at preparation of food Salmonella prevalence at the consumer level depends on the Salmonella status of the meat at retail. If the meat is contaminated at the retail level and brought to home without proper cooling during transport and in-house storage growth may result in Salmonella concentrations above the human response level. With the exception of minced meat, only the surface of the meat is contaminated Salmonella as opposed to the normally sterile inner parts of the meat. If the meat undergoes sufficient heat treatment of the surfaces during cooking, the risk for acquiring a Salmonella infection from the meat is negligible. An exception is minced meat, for which thorough heat treatment is recommended. Cross-contamination from pork products to ready-to-eat food e.g. salads or bread can occur in the household by transmission of Salmonella via raw meat juice from surfaces, equipment, and personnel carrying the bacteria, especially in kitchens where large amounts of food are being prepared and with continuously ongoing food preparation without cleaning at frequent intervals.

Controlled temperature during thawing Re-cooling of leftovers immediately after the meal Separate meat used for food meant for raw consumption and other medium or high risk products (e.g. minced meat) 3.4.7 Monitoring and surveillance of Salmonella The basis for control programmes is monitoring the prevalence of the agent at different part of the farm-to-consumption chain. Monitoring provides information on the current status as well as trends in MSs and the EU and is an effective tool to evaluate implemented interventions. Additionally, monitoring and especially surveillance systems are used to detect disease problems and infections rapidly and respond in a timely fashion. Monitoring also produce data for scientists to design efficient surveillance systems, evaluate existing systems and ultimately produce recommendations based on solid evidence. Data generated from monitoring of different aspects of food production are used in the present project to parameterise the mathematical models being developed. Detection methods Two monitoring options are available for evaluation of the prevalence of Salmonella : bacteriology and immunology (EFSA, 2006). The bacteriological methods express the ac tual infection status of the animal, including transmission or recent contamination. The actual infectious agent or agents will be isolated, which makes further characterisation of e.g. serovar and antimicrobial resistance profiles possible, and combined with enumeration methods, the microbial load (e.g. cfu/g) can be determined. However, the analytical procedure is laborious. The sensitivity of bacteriological culture can vary according to the type and contamination level of the material from which culture is attempted. The examination of individual faecal samples from pigs can have poor sensitivity. For faecal samples the sensitivity has been reported to vary between 9% (cotton swabs) and 78% (25g faeces) (Funk et al., 2000) and 10-80% (Hurd et al., 2001). Compared to faeces, lymph nodes and meat have a lower level of competitive flora, and Salmonella will, even when present in low numbers, be more readily isolated from such materials. The immunological methods express a previous exposure to the infectious agent by detecting specific antibodies against Salmonella . The method can identify carriers or animals already cleared of infection. It detects only those serogroups included in the test and therefore newly emerging serovars may not be detected. The method can be automated, and it is less laborious, and Salmonella antibodies in pigs can be detected in blood serum (Nielsen et al., 1995) as well as meat juice (Nielsen et al., 1998). The sensitivity at individual level has been reported to be 80-90% (Nielsen et al., 1995; Chow et al., 2004), but depends on many factors, as described above. In reality the sensitivity may, however, be lower. For example, for modelling purposes, the minimum sensitivity of the Danish Salmonella mix-ELISA was assumed to be as low as 50% (Alban et al., 2002). The specificity of the ELISA test is defined as its ability to correctly identify as sero-negative, i.e. not infected, those pigs that do not have antibodies against the Salmonella serogroups incorporated in the test. It can be assumed that the specificity of the Salmonella -ELISAs is high at the scientific cut-off (van der Heijden et al., 1998). Both methods need to be characterised and harmonised to enable comparison of data from different sources (e.g. MSs).

Results obtained using bacteriological methods and immunological methods, for the reasons stated above, cannot be compared directly. Conventional bacteriological isolation methods are costly and time consuming. Therefore, much effort has been made to develop rapid methods for the detection of Salmonella . In general, the principle of such alternative methods is to enable a rapid screening of all samples by which means the suspect positive samples can be identified. The screening performed in these alternative methods can be either immunologically based or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based. In the former test only certain serovars will be detected, while in the latter all serovars will be detected. Before use, however, alternative methods have to be formally validated in relation to the specific material to be sampled and tested in the course of the investigations/surveillance. DNA microarray-based methods potentially address identification of family, genus, species, subspecies, strain and genotypic characterisation, as well as the presence of several crucial genetic markers such as those coding for antibiotic resistance and virulence. 3.4.8 Prevalence at different stages of production Occurrence of Salmonella is monitored by sampling at different locations throughout the production process and the findings are reported to EFSA on an annual basis. Table 3.1 shows the reported number of samples taken from fresh pig meat in 2006 in EU MSs. The majority of samples are taken at the slaughterhouses (carcass samples), cutting plants, and at retail. The MSs listed in the table are the only countries that reported figures for 2006. Table 3.2 lists the results from samples of minced meat taken at the processing plant or at retail. For a substantial number of samples, the sampling location was not stated. By comparing the reported serovar distributions, it can be seen that several serovars are commonly found in both pigs (Table 3.5), pork (Table 3.6), and humans (Table 3.7). However, to make interpretation of the role of pigs and pork as a source to human salmonellosis, serovar data on other major sources such as poultry and poultry products are needed. In Chapter 14, available serovar data from food-animals, food and humans were analysed with the purpose to estimate role of pork. 3.4.9 Diversity of pork production in the EU The structure of pig producing units varies greatly in the EU. Some MSs have almost entirely large pig producing farms illustrated in Figure 3.5 (EuroStat 2007b). It is evident from the figure that for example Poland and Romania belongs to a category with many small holding and from the raw data it can furthermore be seen that Poland also has a number of very large holdings indicating that Poland not only has small scale non-intensive production but also intensively driven units. An evolution from many small holding towards larger and more intensive units has been the trend for most countries during the last decades, particularly the countries with very high production figures (EFSA 2006, EuroStat 2008, Fowler 2004). It should be expected that MSs with low intensive production systems will join this trend unless development be skewed by subsidies. Some MSs are major producers of pork products in the EU, mainly large countries and countries specialised in pig production.

It seems like there are different structures of import amongst eastern and western countries. Countries in the east tend to have a higher degree of import from other eastern countries whereas EU 15 mostly imports from Germany and Netherland or a neighbour. This trend may be due to traditions, import restrictions or to a \"neighbour effect\". Even though this pattern might be true there is a large trade between east and west.

In Chapter 6, we attempt to address this by grouping MSs by their production systems and figures (a cluster analysis), thus simplifying modelling procedures. 3.5 Data Sources Human salmonellosis is a notifiable disease in all EU MSs, but there is a great variation in when and how cases should be reported to central registers. Some MSs only report cases that have had more than one week of diarrhoea or are hospitalised cases whereas other MSs report more readily. There are as many sampling locations as there are steps in the food production chain and differences in testing locations and procedures complicates the comparison and use of data. This is a challenge to the parameterisation of the risk models which must be taken into account when employing the models for decision making and a factor to consider in variation and sensitivity/uncertainty analysis.

Aggregation and comparison of MS specific prevalence is difficult because case definitions, reporting requirements, surveillance systems, and microbiological methods are not necessarily consistent across the EU. The data base provides data on: Total number of cases Incidence Age groups 25-44, 44-64, > 65) Seasonality (monthly number of cases) Travel associated cases (including country of origin when possible) Distribution of cases according to serovars Distribution of cases according to phage types TESSy data are aggregated cases of salmonellosis that has been approved by each MS, while Enter-Net data may come directly from reference laboratories or from epidemiologists. Enter-Net Enter-Net is a laboratory and epidemiologic surveillance network for Salmonella (and other Zoonoses). The objective is to increasingly integrate Enter-Net into TESSy. The database provides data on: Total number cases Incidence Age groups 25-44, 44-64, > 65) Seasonality (monthly number of cases) Travel associated cases (including country of origin when possible) Distribution of cases according to serovars Distribution of cases according to phage types Antimicrobial resistance in S.Typhimurium Enter-net has been the most used reporting system but TESSy is likely to be the system used in the future because less variables have to be entered and the software reporting platform is easy to use. Resource: http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/Activities/surveillance/ENTER_NET/index.html BSN (Basic Surveillance Network) BSN started in 2000 and provides easy access to case based data on salmonellosis and a list of 40 diseases.

Each year, EFSA prepare a Community Summary Report (CSR) presenting and discussing the trends and sources of zoonotic diseases in EU (e.g. EFSA 2007a; EFSA 2009). There are differences in how the MSs monitor and report findings of Salmonella making it difficult to compare data between MSs and often also from year to year within the same MS. Guidelines on harmonising the reporting have recently been drafted by EFSA (EFSA 2007b). Currently, data input for monitoring programmes coming from samples taken at different locations in the food chain depends on the sampling protocol in the respective MS: routine sampling at slaughterhouses, notifiable diseases reported by veterinarians, sampling in the transport and lairage link, self testing at retailers etc. Furthermore, monitoring efforts can be scaled up and down at any part of the food chain should increased Salmonella prevalences occur. Feed Data on Salmonella in feed stuffs in MSs is derived from different surveillance programmes and not all MSs report each year. Data are, therefore, not comparable between MSs and cannot be considered as national prevalences. Results, including the serovar, of sampling both feeding material and compound feeding stuff are included The results generally indicates that fish meal and oil seeds like soybean, rape, sunflower and products thereof, probably are the most likely sources of Salmonella in animal feed. Animals Data on Salmonella prevalence at different stages of the pork production is provided in the CSRs and includes samples taken from faeces, blood, meat juice, litter, feed, lymph nodes, pen faecal samples, and carcass swabs, and represent both fattening herds at farm level and fattening herds at slaughter. Food Salmonella in foodstuffs is reported to EFSA from MS monitoring programmes. The reporting is mandatory as of 2008. Data are taken from different sources across the EU: official monitoring, targeted sampling, random sampling, monitoring, targeted and routine sampling, and own control in the industry. Samples are: part of product (minced meat, fresh meat), surface swabs from the meat, and environmental swabs. The database provides data on serovar and phage types. 3.5.3 Consumption data The EuroStat database provides numbers on amount of consumed pork and products thereof in terms of production numbers. The database provides data on: Pigs meat kg/head \"Other fresh or chilled pig meat\" dried or smoked\" (Kg) \"Pig meat in brine, dried or smoked\" (Kg) \"Preparation of pork (incl. fats)\" Amount consumed (kg) (EuroStat, 2007d) QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

The report from the slaughter pig baseline survey was published in 2008 (EFSA, 2008b; EFSA 2008c), whereas the draft report from the breeding pig survey was still under preparation when finishing this report. However, the preliminary results were made available for the project and were used in the QMRA. Data call A call for data specifically targeting the data required for this risk assessment was developed by the project team and published on the EFSA website in March 2008. The call was advertised widely via EFSA, EU and project networks, e.g. via MS zoonoses representatives. The call was published at: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/efsa_locale-1178620753812_1178696473049.htm . Further clarification on the call for data was provided at the data workshop and ultimately over half of EU MSs (15/27) provided full responses, including published and unpublished data, papers, opinion and statistics. With the exception of two MS, all responses were submitted online using the EFSA website. The project team then used the information, data and questionnaires within the project, collaborating with respondents to clarify issues or elicit further opinion. Data workshop A data workshop organised by the project consortium was held in Copenhagen in April 2008. Invited experts identified or brought with them available data on, for instance farming and production practices, prevalence and concentrations figures in pigs and pork, and data on human consumption of pork products. During the workshop Excel spread sheets provided for the working groups were filled in with available data or by expert opinions as given by the participants. Details of the outcome and discussions can be found in the Workshop proceedings, which were distributed to all participants after the workshop and can be obtained by request to the consortium. Literature Relevant research, surveys and interventions studies published in the international peer-reviewed literature were used as appropriate. Expert opinion Expert opinion was used when no other relevant data was available. Experts were scientists attending the workshop held in April 2008 and scientists employed at the institutes in the consortium, but not directly part of the work. Due to time constraints, no formal expert elicitation was undertaken. 3.6 References Acha, P.N. and Szyfres, B., (Eds.), (1987). Zoonoses and communicable diseases common to man and animals.

In particular, special attention is given to the inputs and outputs of each module. The model uses Monte Carlo sampling as a means for dealing with variability in the parameters. Thus, several iterations are run until the results (probabilities of illness) have converged. It should be kept in mind that the discussion of Section 4.1 concerns one iteration only, the final result is the average of the results of many iterations (Section 4.1.7). In the following sections we briefly describe how the modules are linked together, starting at the farm and resulting in a probability of illness. 4.1 The QMRA Modules 4.1.1 Farm Inputs The Farm module has no specific inputs related to Salmonella infection. However, it does have several parameters that determine the dynamics and sources of infection. Such parameters, however, are not what we consider to be inputs. The major input to each iteration of the farm model is the farm type (e.g. whether it uses wet feed, solid flooring), which is randomly sampled from a multinomial distribution, using the relative weighting of farm types taken from the EFSA baseline surveys and other data. This is determined for both the small and large farm models. Model Each iteration of the large and small farm model represents one farm, and the production of batches of slaughter-age pigs. A farm is run for 500 days, during which several opportunities arise for infection of the pigs (via sows, feed or external contamination). This infection of pigs may then lead to transmission of infection to other pigs. The model is described in detail in Chapter 7. Unit The basic unit is the lymph-node positive status of the pigs (together with the associated magnitude of shedding). Outputs For each iteration of the small and large farm model, the model output is the lymph- node status and the concentration of Salmonella in the faeces for each individual pig within the 72 large farm and 3 small farm batches sent to slaughter from each farm during each iteration. Thus, we have a two-dimensional array of numbers (which we refer to as the farm matrices ). The Farm module has an extremely long running time, in the order of days. Therefore, it was decided to run the farm model outside of the main code by default. The resulting farm matrices are written to a file, and may be read by the following modules.

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 444.1.2 Transport & lairage Inputs The Transport & Lairage module couples the farm to the slaughterhouse. For each iteration of the model, a days worth of pigs to be slaughtered in a \"large\" and \"small\" slaughterhouse are selected, where size relates to the number of pigs slaughtered per day (a small slaughterhouse slaughters up to 400 pigs a day while a large slaughterhouse slaughters more than 400 and as many as 15000 pigs a day, see Chapter 9). We assume (due to lack of data to the contrary) that pigs from large farms will go to large slaughterhouses and pigs from small farms will go to small slaughterhouses. The model accounts for variation between slaughterhouses. The farm matrices, as described above, are usually pre-calculated. Model For each iteration the model is first run for the small slaughterhouse and then independently for the large slaughterhouse. The selected slaughterhouse (large or small) is assigned a specified number (or 'capacity') of pigs to be slaughtered (determined by MS slaughterhouse capacity data). The model then randomly selects batches of pigs from the output of the Farm module, until the capacity of the slaughterhouse is reached. These batches of pigs then enter the Transport & Lairage model, where the transmission of Salmonella within these batches is modelled on an individual pig basis. Increased shedding due to transport stress and infection via the environment (both at transport and lairage) may occur. The model is described in detail in Chapter 8. Unit The basic unit during transport and lairage is the lymph-node positive and gut contamination status of the individual pigs. The batch lymph-node positive prevalence is also calculated. Note that at lairage the batch may be split up into multiple lairage pens and thus the batch of pigs entering the slaughter line may be a subset of the batch of pigs that leave the farm. After lairage, the prevalence and concentration of Salmonella on the hides of individual pigs is also estimated. Outputs For each iteration of the model the output is the numbers of Salmonella in the gut of individual pigs at the end of lairage and the concentrations of Salmonella on the skin of individual pigs at the end of lairage. Data from batches of pigs that occupy the same lairage pen (at the same time) are grouped together in a vector. From this, a These batches are sorted in the order that the pigs enter the slaughter process to provide an ordered list of Salmonella numbers, in the gut and on the skin. 4.1.3 Slaughterhouse Inputs The large and small slaughterhouses take lists of Salmonella numbers, in the gut and on the skin, as in input from the Transport & Lairage module. Note that negative (i.e. no contamination or infection) pigs are not treated differently from positive pigs. Thus, the input lists contain many zeros for negative pigs. Model In the slaughter models, the pig and later the carcasses go through the slaughter line in the order that they are delivered from the Transport & Lairage module. At each phase one or more microbiological processes may take place, e.g. inactivation, QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Chapter 9 describes the slaughter model in detail. Unit At the start of the slaughter line the unit is 'pig', after slaughter 'carcass', and after the splitting phase 'half carcass'. For pigs and carcasses, Salmonella numbers are considered both on the skin and in the gut. At the point of half-carcasses, only Salmonella on the skin is taken into account, since the intestines are removed at the evisceration phase. Outputs The final output is the number of Salmonella on each half carcass (provided as a list). Necessarily, this list is twice the length of the input list of Salmonella on pigs. 4.1.4 The cutting plant Inputs We do not distinguish between cutting plants that accept half-carcasses from large slaughterhouses and cutting plants that accept half-carcasses from small slaughterhouses. Therefore, the inputs are two lists: the Salmonella numbers on the half-carcasses from the small slaughterhouse and the numbers on the half-carcasses from the large slaughterhouse (a much larger list). Model The cutting plant model has two main functions. Firstly, it combines the half-carcasses from both the large and the small slaughterhouse into three lists of half-carcasses. Each combined list contains the half-carcasses that will be processed into a specific food product: pork cuts, minced meat, or fermented sausage. The number of half-carcasses in each list is 10,000, corresponding to the 10,000 portions that will be produced. Each of the lists is populated by randomly sampling from the large and small slaughterhouse, choosing between them in such a way that the true ratio of productions from large and small slaughterhouses is approximated. The second main function of the cutting plant is producing pork products from the half-carcasses. During this process, cross-contamination is taken into account. Note that the fermentation process is handled later in the model, at this point the portions of fermented sausage are produced in the same way as the minced meat portions (since this is the basic ingredient). The cutting plant is described in detail in Chapter 9 as it is part of the Slaughter & Processing module. Unit The unit changes from 'half-carcass' to 'portion of pork cuts/minced meat/minced meat for sausage production' during the Cutting Plant module. Also, portion sizes are taken into account, according to consumption data of the MS under investigation. Outputs For each of the three food products a list of 10,000 entries of Salmonella numbers is produced.

Model The consumer phase consists of three models that are parallel to each other; pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage are modelled independently. In each of the models there may be growth, inactivation or cross-contamination (not between products, but between product and environment, e.g. knife or salad). The fermented sausage is somewhat different from the other products in the sense that in the consumer phase the fermentation process is modelled (otherwise, the consumer phase would be empty as there is no preparation and the sausage is eaten raw). Chapter 10 describes the models in detail. Unit The units are consumer portions, for 10,000 of each of the products. Outputs The number of Salmonella ingested (i.e. the dose ) for each of the 10,000 portions for each of the three products. 4.1.6 Dose-Response Inputs The input for the dose-response model is the number of Salmonella ingested from each of the products from the consumer phases. Model Using a dose-relationship between the dose and the probability of illness, each of the doses yields a probability. A binomial trial converts these probabilities into lists of ones and zeros, representing the occurrence or absence of illness resulting from each probability. Finally, for each of the three products we calculate the average, and interpret this again as a probability of illness. The dose-response model is further elaborated in Chapter 11. Unit We start with doses (number of Salmonella per portion of pork cuts / minced meat patty and fermented sausage), ending with dimensionless probabilities. Outputs Three numbers are output, the probability of illness given consumption for minced meat, pork cuts and fermented sausage. It is those numbers that must converge over many iterations of the Monte Carlo procedure.

The following figure (Figure 4.1) illustrates the various modules present in the model.

Yet, there is already variability within this one iteration - variability between pigs, carcasses or products exists. One can think of e.g. the mass of the pigs, or the size of the consumer portions. This variability can still be seen in the distribution of doses, but is no longer of relevance in the final probability. In addition to this within-iteration variability, there is also variability over the iterations. This variability is for the largest part variability in parameters describing production characteristics. For example, the temperature of the scalding water is a slaughterhouse characteristic which has variation. The final probability of illness is an average of an average, firstly within each iteration it is the average of a number of probabilities resulting from doses, secondly, this average is averaged over iterations representing variability. But, this variability is not explicitly presented in the results, since it is not of prime importance for answering the main research question: the relative impact of interventions. It is important to stress that the outcome of the model is an average probability of illness (for each product), given consumption. This probability can however easily be used to calculate the expected number of cases of illness. For such an exercise one needs to take into account the consumption patterns and population size of the MS under investigation. See Chapter 12 for further elaboration and results. 4.2 Modelling the EU The model, as described in the previous sections, has a fixed chain of modules, and fixed processing steps within the modules. However, the parameters governing the dynamics can be modified by the user. We have determined, for each MS under investigation, suitable parameters. The estimation of parameters for each MS is described in detail in the chapters on modelling. We have selected four representative MS. This was done according to a clustering scheme, thereby grouping MS having similar production practices. Within each of the four groups we selected one representative MS based on data availability. This clustering process is described in detail in Chapter 6. Ultimately, results for the four MS are meant to represent not only MS specific results, but also indicate the variability of the hazard of Salmonella in pork over the EU. All parameters related to a single MS are grouped together in one single file, this file may then be used as input to the main code. Additional MSs can be implemented in a user friendly way, by using a current implementation of a MS as a template, and modifying the appropriate parameters. 4.3 Intervention and uncertainty analysis Comparison of results of model runs7 is required for intervention and uncertainty analysis. In an uncertainty analysis the impact that certain parameters, and particularly those that are deemed to be uncertain, have on the probability of illness are investigated. This provides insight into the reliability of the results predicted by the model. It also provides an indication of key data gaps, which will be important in the prioritisation of future data collection by EFSA and the MSs should they wish to reduce the (unquantified) uncertainty in the model output. For both the intervention and uncertainty analysis the model has to be run a number of times and the final 7 A model run is synonymous to a simulation in our vocabulary. But please be aware that some software packages use the term simulation where we use iteration.

In some cases it is not explicitly needed to re-run the farm modules, for example when assessing slaughterhouse interventions. In this case the farm matrices can be re-used for multiple runs of the model. The intervention and uncertainty analyses have been made user friendly by allowing easy modification of the requested interventions, or parameter values, in specified user files. Also, results (figures and data structures) are automatically written to an archive, allowing convenient access to previous model runs or analyses. We refer to Chapter 12 for the presentat ion and further discussion of the baseline results and uncertainty analyses. The sensitivity analysis methodology is described in Chapter 5 and the results are provided in the individual module chapters (Chapters 7 - 10).

In our case the basic unit is the number of Salmonella per unit under investigation (pig, carcass, etc.). By adjusting input parameters several real- world scenarios can be simulated, opening the possibility for comparison between those scenarios. In particular, interventions (adjustments in the baseline scenario that reflect possible interventions or controls that hopefully lead to a reduction in the risk of illness) may be modelled. By comparing model results with and without interventions (relative) risks may be assessed. Quantitative risk assessments may be classified as either deterministic or stochastic. Deterministic risk assessment uses point-values as model inputs and therefore the model outputs are also point values. Stochastic risk assessment, however, incorporates uncertainty and/or variability into a model, which are both now defined. Variability represents a true heterogeneity in a population, e.g. the weight of a pig will vary between pigs and the fact that we cannot assign a fixed number to the weight has nothing to do with our incomplete knowledge; it is inherent to the population. On the other hand, uncertainty reflects our lack of knowledge on the exact value of a parameter. For example, the inactivation of Salmonella when subjected to high temperatures may be modelled by an exponential decay, dependent on time and an inactivation parameter. This inactivation parameter is hard to measure and therefore not known exactly. In a stochastic model variability and uncertainty can be modelled using statistical probability distributions, instead of fixed parameter values. Incorporating distributions into the model results in a distribution for the model output; hence providing more information compared to the deterministic approach. Due to time constraints, we do not take uncertainty into account explicitly within this QMRA. We do however perform an uncertainty analysis, in order to ascertain whether uncertainty might play a major role. Variability however, in its various incarnations (between pig, batch, slaughterhouse, etc.) will be explicitly modelled. The specific choices made during the process, on the type of distribution representing the variability and the estimation of parameters will be thoroughly discussed in the model descriptions. Further, more detailed, information on quantitative risk assessment - and in particular stochastic risk assessment - is available in e.g. Vose 2000 or Haas, Rose et al. 1999. Appendices A5.1, A5.2 and A5.3 to this chapter give some common notation and conventions used throughout the report. 5.2 Monte Carlo Simulation Since variability plays an important role, a Monte Carlo modelling framework is used. The basic idea behind a Monte Carlo procedure is that the result of the simulation is iteratively refined during a number of steps, also termed iterations. Each iteration represents a feasible representation of a real-world situation during which numbers are sampled from the probability distributions representing the variability. The number of iterations is preset, or dependent on the convergence behaviour of the simulation. The results of each iteration are stored. At the end, statistical measures QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

For example, means, standard deviations or percentiles may be insightful to the modeller or risk assessor. The description above is somewhat simplified, as it does not incorporate variability that exists also within iterations. This is best illustrated using an example. A slaughterhouse is defined by a number of parameters (e.g. line speed, temperature of scalding water, etc.) and each iteration of a Monte Carlo procedure will result in a realisation of a slaughterhouse. However, within this single slaughterhouse, the processed pigs will have their own variability (e.g. length, mass). This variability is likewise modelled using a Monte Carlo procedure and we end up with a multi-level model containing nested iterations. Such a nested method can lead to a severe computational burden when not implemented efficiently. However, we do not use such a multi-level method. Rather, within each iteration we work with vectors of quantities (e.g. vectors of pig lengths), instead of using an extra loop. Formally these approaches are equivalent. However, we use Matlab R2008b (\u00a9 Mathworks Ltd, USA) for implementation of the model, and Matlab vector operations are extremely efficient. During a Monte Carlo simulation, several parameters are re- sampled from variability distributions during the procedure. We will now discuss our terminology and notation for the use of distributions and probabilities. A sample space is a set of possible outcomes of an experiment. For example the infectious state of a pig is represented by a sample space 8. A random variable maps a member of the sample space to a real number. For example, we may define the random variable as A random variable is always associated to a distribution. The distribution in itself is not a mathematical 'formula', but a convenient way of expressing how a random variable behaves. For example, if is distributed according to the Bernoulli distribution9 with parameter , we write . (5.1) A distribution is always coupled to a pr obability mass function (for discrete random variables) or a probability density function (for continuous random variables), specifying the probability of a certain outcome. A probability is a number between zero and one, where zero stands for 'not occurring', while one means 'always occurring'. Therefore a probability mass function is a function . The probability mass function belonging to the Bernoulli distribution is given by = = = . 0,0 1,1 );( otherwisex for px for p pxf (5.2) The probability mass function represents the probability that equals , given a distribution (for discrete random variables). This is often written shorthand as e.g. or, for the example given above, . 8 Please refer to Appendix A5.1 and A5.2 for a list of distributions and of mathematical notation and conventions used throughout this report. 9 We treat Bernoulli distributions as binomial distributions with one trial, hence the notation B(1,p) below.

For example, if we generate samples from a Bernoulli distribution with and , then our sampling algorithm must produce the number 1 approximately times and the number 0 approximately times. In general, the histogram of the random samples (scaled to an area of one) will approximate the graph of the probability mass function, implying also that the average of the samples will tend to the mean of the distribution. Now, the above is much too convoluted for use in our following discussion and we introduce the following notation for a realisation from a distribution with parameter , for pig , . (5.3) Thus, this realisation takes the values 0 and 1, with relative frequencies tending to and . When realisations vary over iterations, not over pigs or products, we omit the index, (5.4) Now that the rather technical concept of a realisation is handled, we discuss the simpler notion of a fraction. In contrast to a realisation, which is used inside of an iteration, yielding a physically meaningful state (such as, being infected, bacterial numbers, etc.), a fraction is a fixed number representing a fractional part of a quantity. For example, we have fractions in the scalding stage, representing the part of the bacteria moving from a carcass to the scalding water. Note that an extra index is not needed. If we have a fraction of time, we will also use the term rate. 5.3 Modelling Limitations When interpreting model results, one should keep in mind that a model is always a simplification of reality. A typical model usually contains a large number of assumptions, simplifications and abstractions. It would, however, not do the model justice to regard these as modelling 'errors'. Let us briefly discuss some of the most relevant modelling issues. Firstly, the modeller will distinguish a number of determining factors for the specific process that needs to be modelled. For example, pathogen inactivation will often be a function of time, temperature and the roughness of the surface. A number of factors, that are supposed to have a negligible impact, will be discarded. Also, entities will usually be abstracted by defining them in terms of a limited number of parameters. For example, a typical carcass will be defined by a weight and be assumed to be circular. Relations between entities and factors are cast in the form of mathematical equations, which may take the form of differential equations, difference equations, algebraic equations, etc. Obviously, this is also a crucial step and the mathematical expressions should be well founded by the modeller. These two simplifications lead to a description of reality in terms of data and this brings us to two important aspects: data availability and data accuracy. Unfortunately, much of the needed data are unavailable. In this case, the modeller needs to somehow find a substitute for the lacking data. There are several options QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors. The present document is published complying with the transparency principle to which the European Food Safety Authority is subject. It may not be considered as an output adopted by EFSA. EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 53 Use data from a similar case When data are available that refers to a similar situation, one may choose to use these data instead. Of course, it should be clearly stated why inclusion is justified. For example, pathogen inactivation rates on pig carcasses are not reported in the literature. However, such data are available for poultry. Assuming that inactivation rates for Salmonella on poultry and pig skin are similar, we use these data. Use expert opinion Experts may be consulted for their opinion on data. Obviously, this leads to some subjectiveness in the results. Use of a formal expert study overcomes this disadvantage to some degree (see e.g. Meyer & Booker 1991, Fels-Klerx, Cooke et al. 2005). Time constraints unfortunately do not allow us to conduct such a formal elicitation study. Use a black-box model By a black-box model we will understand a simple input-output relation that does not take into account any of the complexities of the situation in reality. Such a model may be used when the process is simply too complex and not well understood, or parameters can not reasonably be determined by any of the above mentioned cases. A black-box model will typically link the output to the input using a simple relation involving a small number of parameters. If input and output data are known from e.g. experimental studies, the parameters can be estimated using standard statistical techniques. Such a model is also known as an 'empirical model'. After abstraction and filling the data gaps, we have a mathematical model which may be used to perform simulations. Mistakes in parameter estimation, incorrect mathematical modelling and plain mistakes are minimised by using, as much as possible, information from peer-reviewed journals, which have been scrutinised by the scientific community. Additionally, we rely on internal and external reviews of the reports and model. Since our method of choice is a Monte Carlo simulation we also have to deal with statistical errors and misinterpretations. Given input distributions and parameters, the simulation yields output distributions. However, if the number of iterations is not sufficient, the results will not have converged to a stable outcome and will not be reliable. We will monitor the convergence at several points in the simulation, thus gaining confidence in the final result. Other mathematical sources of error are rounding errors, introduced by using finite precision arithmetic and errors in numerical solvers. We will not be concerned with rounding errors, an effect which is mostly insignificant. 5.4 Sensitivity Analysis To determine the extent to which the variability of the model parameters affects the model, we conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. This tests the parameters of the model that incorporate variability (i.e. are estimated using a statistical distribution to describe the variability (e.g. duration of transport) against a response variable. Note that the sensitivity analysis only considers the variability of the parameter values which are part of the baseline model. The uncertainty associated with the parameter values is investigated in the uncertainty analysis (Chapter 12). The ANOVA method has previously been used as a method for QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors.

The choice of the response variable is important. If we were to choose the probability of illness, the analysis would tell us the effect that our parameters have in relation to all the parameters in the whole model (i.e. including, farm, slaughter, processing, retail and consumption parameters), because probability of illness is dependent on the whole model. However, there are two concerns with this approach; 1) this would not tell us anything about the effect that the parameters are having at the stage they are implemented and 2) it is not straightforward, within the model, to associate the variability of parameters at earlier stages of the module with the risk of illness from a particular product. For example we would have a duration of transport for a batch of pigs. This batch may get split up in lairage. The individual pigs then go through the slaughterhouse and are split into half carcasses at the splitting stage. Carcasses are then picked at random from which to make the products. These changes in the unit of interest, particularly the random selection of carcasses at the processing stage, make it very difficult to determine which truck during transport a particular product was on in order to link the duration of transport with the risk of illness. This problem of sensitivity analysis across modules where aggregation occurs is mentioned as an issue in Frey & Patil (2002). Therefore, for this model we conduct independent sensitivity analyses for the Farm, Transport, Lairage, Slaughterhouse, Cutting Plant and three analyses at Preparation & Consumption for the different product types (pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage). We do not consider the Dose-Response module in this analysis. Each analysis is conducted on 200,000 units (e.g. batches of pigs during transport, carcasses at the slaughterhouse and products at preparation and consumption). We show the results in the form of bar graphs, where we plot the F value associated with the parameter. The importance of the parameters are assessed in terms of the relative magnitude of the F values, so that the bigger the bar the more significant the variation in the parameter is on the variation in the response variable. When interpreting the graphs it should be noted that a large difference in the F values of the parameters should be observed before it can be safely assumed that one parameter is more significant than another (there is no statistical test to determine the magnitude of this difference). It should also be noted that the sensitivity analysis assesses the importance of the variation in the input parameters on the response variable, it does not give an indication on how important a variable is on the absolute value. To take an extreme example; assume that you have a parameter in your model that reduces the number of Salmonella on the product by 99%, immediately before your response variable value is taken. This is clearly going to have a very big impact on the number of Salmonella on the carcass. However, this reduction is applied to all products, there is no variation about this parameter. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis will report that it is completely insignificant (i.e. it will have a F value of 0). However, if this parameter had been included in the uncertainty analysis (e.g by changing the magnitude of reduction to different values between 0%-100%) then it would have been identified as being significant. Due to the complexity of the model, some modules have a lot of parameters with distributions associated with them and to show them all on a single graph would get confusing. For these modules we only show the most significant parameters on the graph.

Therefore, efforts were made to aggregate MSs into groups (clusters) of countries with similar patterns of factors related to the risk of Salmonella from pork. A detailed risk assessment is then conducted in one MS from each cluster. The MSs were selected according to data availability. 6.1.2 Aim In order to select the MSs as case studies a cluster analysis was carried out. Its aim was to identify meaningful regions (clusters of MS) by using available register data related to the pork production and consumption in each country. Initially, the project group defined a number of criteria in the farm-to-consumption chain important for the risk of Salmonella infection. After evaluating the available MS- specific data, the project group decided which data should be included in the cluster analysis. The data were used for combining countries into clusters such that: Countries in each cluster are similar to each other with regard to the selected information Each cluster is different from the other clusters with regard to the selected information 6.2 Material and Methods 6.2.1 Data Data for the cluster analysis were defined by the four criteria listed in Table 6.1. This list was first put forward, in its original form, by the QMRA project group during a workshop on 21-24 April in Copenhagen, where 40 experts representing 13 MSs and EFSA representatives discussed and commented on its applicability for the QMRA. Data exploration led to identification of only a limited amount of suitable data that both matched the defined criteria and at the same time had data for the majority of the MSs. No direct measures were available, and it was necessary to use 'proxy- data' as information - e.g. size of slaug hter-pig holdings was used to describe the type of production (modern with relatively high biosecurity (large holdings) versus traditional with relatively low biosecurity (small holdings)).

However, such risk factors are numerous and very often hard to measure. Information on these factors is therefore only available from specific research studies from a few countries and not at the MS level. As a proxy for these factors, information on the number of holdings and size of holdings was obtained from EuroStat10, under the assumption that smaller holdings will not have as strictly implemented biosecurity measures as larger holdings. According to expert opinion, production units having less than 400 animals (stock at any given time) are holdings with other biosecurity measures related to purchase of animals and within herd prevention of transmission of infections compared to larger production units. These differences may very well influence the Salmonella risk. The data are provided in Table 6.2. Slaughter - capacity Factors related to the possibility for introduction of Salmonella into a slaughterhouse and cross-contamination between carcasses within the slaughterhouse are considered to be an important influence on the risk of salmonellosis. However, the number of factors (typically slaughtering processes and hygiene factors) are numerous and very often hard to measure. Therefore, no information related to these factors is available at the MS-level. As a proxy for these factors we used information on the capacity of slaughterhouses in the different MSs, which were reported in a baseline survey on Salmonella in pigs (see Table 6.3). 11. The data are 10 The data in the EuroStat database are collected and validated following standardised procedures (Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97, Council Regulation (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1444/2002). The meta data describe the quality of each reporting/survey. This means that the data are \"trustworthy\" in terms of reporting though it says nothing about the quality of the data input. It is believed that the data in this dataset are of high quality based on earlier data sets and on data from other reports. 11 Unpublished raw data from \"Baseline survey on the prevalence of S almonella in slaughter pigs\" (Commission Regulation (EC) No 1444/2002). An outline for data collection and reporting procedure is described in a Commission Decision (Eurostat Metadata). In the baseline studies are Member States asked to report the slaughter capacity of at least 80% of their gross national production. This reporting implies that there may be inconsistency in the reporting: some Member States may have chosen to mainly include output from large slaughterhouses whereas other Member Stases has included more small slaughterhouses.

It was assumed that smaller slaughterhouses will not have as strictly implemented slaughtering processes and hygiene measures as larger slaughterhouses, thereby having higher risk of introducing Salmonella and a higher risk of cross-contamination due to more contact with the environment. Larger slaughterhouses are often newer and more modern, with an infrastructure to avoid cross-contamination e.g. hanging carcasses, decontamination facilities, biosecurity).

Slaughterhouses tend to fall in two categories with an aggregate of small slaughterhouses slaughtering from a few hundred animals per year to some tens of thousands. The other category was slaughterhouses well above 100,000 slaughters per year. The assumption that smaller slaughterhouses are old is partly validated by changes to the infrastructure of slaughterhouses in recent decades, where many small slaughterhouses have disappeared and the number of large slaughterhouses has increased. Consumption - Consumed pork per capita The risk of contracting salmonellosis from pork is directly correlated with Salmonella prevalence. The FAOSTAT database (FAOST AT, Consumption, Livestock and Fish Primary Equivalent) contains data on consumption of pork per capita in 200312. The 12 From the data in the EuroStat database, which contains entries for fewer Member States than the FAO data, but for more years it can be seen that the numbers between 1991 to 2005 do not change very much. This indicates that even though the FAO data are five years old (2003) they should still be valid. One concern though is that the numbers from FAO are generally 1-10% higher (Austria, Netherlands and Belgium with 22, 22 and 48% respectively). It has not been possible to find the reason for this.

Consumption - sausages consumed per capita Fermented sausages13 are included in this risk assessment because they has been known to cause outbreaks of salmonellosis (Emberland et al. 2006; Nygard et al. 2007, Luzzi et al. 2007, Cowden et al. 1989, Gilsdorf et al. 2005, Bremmer et al. 2004, Pontello et al. 1998) and EFSA specifically asked that an example product, that is not prepared at the consumer phase nor heat-treated during production, be included within the model. products (EuroStat does not include products made from e.g. offal in the data set used). While Austria is in top three of most consumed pig meat in both data sets, Netherlands and Belgium are ranked markedly different. This would evidently result in different clusters. 13 Fermented or cured sausages are produced with starter culture (bacteria) or gluconodlacton to control the pH decline. The process is initiated at room temperature and high humidity. The end products contain 10% salt in water and pH is approximately 5.0. No heat treatment is involved (Alban et al. 2002). Fermented sausages are produced in all Member States are made using different recipes.

The consumption data on sausages (all sausages) in the EuroStat database consist of sausages containing pork, beef and poultry meat (Sold production and external trade of foodstuffs, EuroStat Data Shop Handbook). In order to use this dataset as a proxy for consumption of sausages containing pork, the numbers should only be used as relative measure. It is assumed that the proportion of sausages containing pork as well as the fraction of fermented sausages is the same across the EU. It is likely that less sausages containing pork are eaten in some MSs due to cultural and religious differences. This effect is not evaluated in this project and we assume that the proportion of persons not eating pork products out of religious beliefs are relatively low and equal in the MSs.

The k-means clustering method was applied. Briefly, the K-means algorithm starts by partitioning the input data into k initial clusters. It then calculates the mean point, or centroid, of each group and constructs a new partition by associating each observation with the closest centroid. Then the centroids are recalculated for the new clusters, and the algorithm repeated by alternate application of these two steps until convergence, which is obtained when the points no longer switch clusters. The cluster analysis was done using the FASTCLUS procedure in SAS (Cary, 1999). This procedure uses by default Euclidean distances so that the clusters centroids are 14 Cluster analysis is a tool frequently used to handle the heterogeneity of datasets and where the hoped-for result is a small number of groups (clusters). Each cluster should consist of a number of relatively homogeneous objects with a within-group variation considerably smaller than the total variation in the full data set ( Lattin & Carroll, 2003 ).

Each iteration reduces the least-squares criterion until convergence is achieved, which is equivalent to the situation where none of the observations change cluster. The results from a cluster analysis are influenced by variances in the dataset caused, for example, by the different units of the data. To eliminate this effect, all variables utilised in the analysis were standardised (mean=0 and STD=1) prior to the analysis using the STANDARD procedure in SAS (Cary, 1999). Throughout the analysis, the cluster solution was obtained for 3, 4 and 5 clusters. Evaluation of the cluster solution and determining the number of clusters The cluster solution was evaluated using the following 5 relevant statistical parameters: Overall R-square is a ratio calculated as sum of squares between the cluster centroids (\"a measure of the extent to which clusters are different from each other\") / (sum of squares within clusters (\"a measure of the extent to which observations within a cluster are similar\") + sum of squares between the cluster centroids). The value can range between 0 and 1: 1 indicating that the clusters are homogeneous and well separated, 0 indicating that the clusters are heterogeneous and not very well separated (Cary, 1999). Overall within-STD (Standard Deviation) divided by total STD. Low values suggesting that the resulting clusters are quite homogeneous. Pseudo-F-statistic is the ratio of the mean sum of squares between clusters to the mean sum of squares within clusters, and so accounts for the degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom are function of k (number of clusters). Usually, the larger the pseudo-F , the more efficient the partition is, in reducing within- group heterogeneity (Lattin & Carroll, 2003). Cubic clustering criterion (CCC ) is a comparative measure of the deviation of the clusters from the distribution expected if data points were obtained from a uniform distribution. Usually, larger positive values of CCC indicate a better solution as it shows a larger difference from a uniform (no clusters) distribution (Lim et al. , 2006). Values of CCC greater than 2-3 i ndicate good clusters. Values between 0 and 2 indicate potential clusters, but they should be taken with caution (SAS Institute, 1999). Performing a canonical discriminant analysis and plotting the canonical variables. The canonical discriminant analysis was performed using PROC CANDISC in SAS (SAS Institute, 1999). The plots illustrate the spatial separation between clusters and the variation of observations within clusters. Different scenarios for the cluster analysis Using the available data and according to suggestions and advice given by the EFSA Working Group, different scenarios for the cluster analysis were proposed: All the criteria have the same weight in the analysis: Since there are two datasets representing the consumption criterion, the standardised data-values of ' Total pig meat consumed (kg) ' and ' Consumption of sausages (kg) ' have to be multiplied by a numeric factor (0.5) ensuring that all criteria in the pathway have the same influence in the calculation of clusters.

Still, the processing can be critical for the survival and growth of Salmonella due to suboptimal heating and/or preservation. It was therefore deemed relevant to do the analysis both including and not including this dataset. Another option is to run the analysis using both the \"amount of pig meat consumed per capita\" and a \"ratio between the consumption of sausages and the total amount of pig meat consumed.\" Put more weight on the consumption criterion relative to the other criteria in the analysis: In this scenario, extra weight is \"shifted towards\" the consumption criterion, as the amount of consumption is considered to be more important for the description of the EU MSs with regard to Salmonella risk from pork. So, in contrary to the previous scenarios, the criteria of consumption (with and without sausages) will be given twice the weight of each of the other criteria in the calculation of clusters. Include the data on prevalence of infected carcasses from baseline studies: The main reason to include this dataset is to increase the amount of information whereupon we differentiate MS into different clusters. However, it would be redundant to use this dataset in an analysis, since further on, the model is supposed to predict prevalence for the infection of Salmonella in pig meat. The cluster analysis was done with and without using this dataset. 6.2.4 Mapping Results from the cluster analysis were colour coded and georeferenced to present clusters visually, using ArcView program (Lim et al. , 2006). Colours do not represent the risk of salmonellosis in any way. 6.2.5 Interpretation of the cluster solution The cluster solution (the output of the cluster analysis) was used to describe the profile of each cluster. In the cluster solution, each cluster is labelled by the cluster's centre for each criterion. Given the standardisation of data to the overall mean for each criterion before the analysis, the interpretation of the cluster's centres was undertaken relative to the mean of the criteria for the EU countries. 6.3 Results The results from the cluster analysis for the different scenarios were discussed at the meeting between modellers in RIVM, 4-6 November, 2008, and it was agreed that the analysis should focus only on the most relevant scenarios and datasets: Focus the analysis in the scenarios with equal weight to all criteria and twice the weight to the consumption criterion relative to each of the other data criteria; Include data for the production criterion (size of holdings), for the slaughter criterion (slaughter capacity) and for the consumption criterion (the amount of pig meat consumed of pig meat and the ratio between the consumption of sausages and consumption of pig meat); Run the analysis only with 3, 4, and 5 clusters; QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Figure 6.1: Representation of the pseudo-F and CCC values for k=3, 4 and 5. Analysis with equal weight to all criteria and with twice without weight towards consumption Considering the results for these 2 parameters, the optimal number of clusters for the scenario with twice the weight on consumption relatively to each of the other criteria (weight \"towards\" consumption) would be 4 clusters, while for the scenario where all the criteria have the same weight 3 clusters would be optimal. The Overall R-squared values also show a good cluste r distribution for these cluster scenarios: Overall R squared- 0.57 (weight \"towards\" consumption, k = 4); Overall R squared - 0.60 (same weight, k = 3); In terms of within-STD by overall STD parameter , for these cluster solutions, the values are: 0.59 (Analysis with weight \"towards\" consumption criterion and k=4); 0.54 (Analysis with all the criteria having the same weight and k=3); 10152025303540 23456# clusterspseudo F statistics valueAnalysis weight towards consumption Analysis with all steps with thesame weight 22.533.544.5 23456 # clustersCubic clustering criterion valueAnalysis weight towards consumption Analysis with all the steps withsame weight QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

To evaluate whether or not this effect impacts the validity of the analysis, the analysis for a 4-cluster solution was rerun using different initial seeds. By changing the initial cluster seeds randomly (sorting the data according to random generated values), the cluster analysis was rerun 10 times (with 10 random groups of initial seeds) and the results analysed. In the re-run analyses, following discrepancies in the repeated clustering solution were revealed: Denmark and Germany switched cluster twice away from cluster 2 (but kept belonging to the same cluster); Finland switched cluster 3 times; Spain and Portugal both switched cluster 2 times; These results from the re-analysis indicated that the initial seeds did have an influence on the cluster solution. However, for the majority of MSs, the variation in the initial cluster seeds did not influence the cluster to which the MS belonged. The result of the cluster solution obtained when Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria and Germany were used as initial cluster seeds was used for the final evaluation of the cluster solution. 6.3.6 Effect of missing data Nine MSs failed to report values for the consumption of sausages. In addition Luxembourg had not reported consumption of pork meat and Malta had not reported slaughterhouse capacity. This means that these two countries' assignment to groups is only based on two data entries. 6.4 Discussion When comparing the results, by changing the number of clusters, some countries switch groups. For instance, in the 3-cluster solution of weight towards consumption data (Figure 6.2) all the three Baltic States group together with Finland, whereas in the 4-cluster analysis Lithuania groups with Poland instead (Figure 6.3). However according to these results, for most of the groupings the cluster solution is quite robust, and changing the number of clusters does not have a significant influence on which countries usually group together. It is worth mentioning, that although no geographical information was included in the analysis, the clusters to some extent represent geographical regions in EU.

The MS selected for a detailed risk assessment were named MS1, MS2, MS3 and MS4. Throughout the risk assessment, efforts will be made to use data from the other countries within the cluster if data lacks for the selected country. 6.6 References Bremmer, V., Leitmeyer, K., Jensen, E., Metsel, U., Meczulat, H., Weise, E., Werber, D., Tschaepe, H., Kreienbrock, L., Glaser, S. and Ammon, A.

Hence, the inclusion of a farm model of some description is necessary in order to consider these ToRs. Salmonella infection in pigs has been described widely in the literature. Pig morbidity or mortality because of Salmonella infection is rare, and is more commonly associated with Salmonella Choleraesuis, rather than serotypes associated with human illness. Hence pig infection is primarily a food safety issue (meaning we can largely disregard any effects on pig health with the model). Studies (Lo Fo Wong & Hald 2000; VLA 2009) have shown that transmission of Salmonella infection in pigs is a complex process involving many factors, which we cannot identify and include all within a quantitative transmission model. For example, we have been requested to treat all Salmonella serotypes the same, but an interesting factor is that broadly speaking the most common serotype isolated from the western states of the EU is Salmonella Typhimurium, but Salmonella Enteritidis is more commonly isolated in the eastern MSs (EFSA 2008a). Clearly there are reasons for these differences the investigation of which are not within the scope of the project. Therefore, we have modelled those factors that we judge to be, from the published literature and expert opinion, the most important in determining t he prevalence of infection within pigs at slaughter, within and between MSs. Infectious disease transmission models have been developed for a wide variety of animal diseases, including Salmonella in pigs (Hill et al. 2008; Lurette et al. 2008; Soumpasis & Butler 2009). Typically these models have become more detailed over time, abandoning the traditional use of transmission parameters. Transmission parameters represent a simple \"black-box\" approach that describes the force of infection to pigs because of Salmonella in the environment. The final estimation of these transmission parameters represents many different factors, including the resistance of the pig to infection and the level of contamination in the environment. In order to investigate interventions (such as vaccination, organic acids, etc.) a more detailed model is necessary to differentiate between those factors which increase/reduce the contamination of the environment and those factors which increase/reduce the resistance of the pig to infection. Of critical importance to the success of an EU-wide model is the consideration of varying management practices within the EU. As described in Chapter 4 we have approached the modelling of the EU by taking a generic approach and then parameterising for an individual MS. No farm transmission model, at least for Salmonella in pigs, has yet dealt with management practices in sufficient detail to differentiate between farm types. Hence, while we are able to use the previous models listed above to inform the development of the transmission dynamics between pigs, we must apply the novel methodology described in Chapter 4 to include varying management practices.

Specifically, we will model the chosen case study MSs (although the farm model is intended to be flexible enough to be adapted for other MSs). The primary output of the farm model is the prevalence of infection within a batch of pigs, at the point of depopulation for slaughter. This prevalence of infection is naturally variable, as well as being directly affected by the farm management systems in place. This output (prevalence of infection within a batch of pigs) is the input to the transport module of the risk assessment model, and is a natural point to assess the effect of the specified interventions. 7.3 Overview of Farm Management and Salmonella Transmission between Pigs Management, microbiological and transmission literature searches were conducted in parallel, each informing the other. The management of pig production is extremely variable, both within and between MSs. While every effort has been made to understand the differences in pig management, we cannot model every variation that exists, and more importantly the scope of this model only extends to the effect of interventions on slaughter pigs (we differentiate between the sows and the progeny intended solely for meat production; therefore where referenced slaughter pigs means all pigs within a farm primarily intended for meat production. Sows are hence not included in this terminology). Therefore, we only include in this overview management systems and practices that we deem relevant to this risk assessment. This overview is a summary of all the data collected, of which there was a vast amount (some of it relevant, a lot of it not); for transparency only key references are added in this section, but important assumptions are referenced and supported in the description of the model or the parameter estimation section (Section 7.4). Based on discussion from the Data Workshop held in Copenhagen in April 2008, we have chosen to delineate pig production into two categories (large and small farms), with the threshold being 400 pigs slaughtered per year. The rationale for this cut-off point is that farms larger than this size will probably produce pigs along the lines of modern conventional production practices (e.g. splitting different aged-pigs into different rooms/buildings) and hence there should be a difference in Salmonella transmission according to large and small management practices. 7.3.1 Large farm management Modern intensive pig farming has evolved into a sophisticated technology, and much of the pig meat produced in the EU will be produced in this way, especially in those MSs which produce the majority of the EU's pig meat (e.g. Denmark, Germany and France) (http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home/ ). Like all pig management systems, intensive production comes in many different forms. However, here we only consider differences that affect Salmonella introduction and/or transmission . We can therefore initially approach intensive pig QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

First, the main stages of production are defined as: Farrowing : Between 8-15 piglets born to a sow, each sow and litter within its own pen; around 15-50 pens within each compartment. The piglets from all the sows farrowing simultaneously in a compartment can also be grouped together in a large pen. Piglets weaned between 21-42 days of age. Weaning : Pigs moved into specialist accommodation. Litters of piglets grouped together into pens of around 1050 pigs each. Pigs are moved onto either dry or wet feed, and stay within these pens (depending on whether there is a growing stage or not) until 8-12 weeks of age. Growing : Pigs moved into specialist accommodation. Becoming less common in modern systems, this intermediate stage will generally see relatively little mixing of pigs from different pens, and pigs will stay here for approximately 6-8 weeks. Finishing: Pigs moved into specialist accommodation. These farms/buildings tend to be larger, as pigs are fattened to slaughter weight over a period of 8-16 weeks. Contract finishing farms may source their stock from a number of nursery or grower farms. Not all farmers will practice all of these stages of rearing, and differences may be found in mixing patterns and the age of pigs within each system. Information relating to the transmission of Salmonella between different ages of pigs is limited, therefore we conclude that it is sufficient to differentiate between these rearing groups rather than specific age groups. The main management difference between farms relates to how the farmer manages the transfer of pigs through the different stages of rearing. There are many different ways to organise the serving of sows, mixing of pigs etc, but the main difference will be if pigs are raised in an all-in-all-out (AIAO) or a continuous system, with the assumption being that AIAO limits the number of pigs that contact each other, and whether or not there is any movement of pigs between farms. A special form of AIAO production and of crucial importance for the Salmonella status is whether farms apply batch production, and how this is applied through the production chain. Batching can be from letting 20-50 sows farrow simultaneously (i.e. within a few days) in one compartment, and later keeping all the piglets born by those sows in one compartment up to slaughter without introducing or allowing contacts with other pigs. Within that system the piglets from the same litter can also be kept together in same pen up to slaughter. Batching is perceived as beneficial because of the ability for the farmer to plan ahead and reduce peaks and troughs in labour demands, and also has productivity gains. Batching of sows into groups can be done on either a 1, 2 or 3 weekly-cycle, such that groups of sows give birth within a defined weekly period. In addition pigs produced in these systems reach slaughter up to one month earlier than in old traditional systems with a continuous production which is considered to be as a result of improved health status. Of basic importance for the efficacy of this system is that a cleaning and disinfection procedure is applied between batches. In discussion with pig farming experts (industry, vets etc) true AIAO production (i.e. AIAO by building) will be at a compartment level (where cohorts of similarly-aged pigs are moved into and out of a room/section of a building separately from other cohorts). This complicates parameter estimation as it is unclear how farmers perceive AIAO or QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

This survey, and other information collected from individual MSs, suggests that AIAO production is slightly more common than continuous production in the four case study MSs; in the absence of any other information we will assume that the figures from the EFSA breeding survey represent our AIAO-by-room definition. Harder to define, but a crucial difference between farms, is the biosecurity of the farm. We define biosecurity as anything that provides a barrier between the Salmonella -free pig on the farm and the (possibly) Salmonella -positive environment outside (or indeed inside) the pigs' dwelling, including any cleaning and disinfection routines. Biosecurity would include the maintenance of any pig housing, good hygiene during production (in particular good manure management that decreases pig exposure to manure (apart from floor type described below), cleaning and disinfection between batches of pigs, and storage of feed to prevent access of birds and rodents (e.g. open storage/non silos). We can model the batching of pigs and the associated cleaning and disinfection, but currently the only available data relates to rodent control, and thus we have focused only on cleaning/disinfection and rodent control to provide some quantification of \"good\" versus \"bad\" biosecurity. Also important, and related to biosecurity, is whether the pig is kept indoors or outdoors. Outdoor production has become more popular for large-scale production within the last couple of decades (especially in MS2) and has particular differences to inside production that could affect Salmonella introduction and transmission, for example exposure to wildlife including birds and rodents, mixing of sows and type of feed. According to the EFSA breeding survey (not yet published) large-scale outside production is still quite rare for pigs beyond the stage of weaning, and therefore we only include the farrowing stage as a possible outside production stage. The above factors are probably important to consider regardless of the particular infectious organism. However, for Salmonella introduction and transmission we are interested in at least two other factors: feed and flooring. Feed can be both a source of Salmonella infection in pigs and a factor in reducing the level of transmission. Clearly contaminated feed poses a risk to pigs, and has been highlighted as probably the main cause of infection in regions where Salmonella infection in pigs is low (e.g. some Scandinavian countries) (EFSA 2008b), but the relationship between feed and Salmonella infection in pigs is complex. The serotypes commonly associated with feed contamination are not usually those - especially S. Typhimurium - which are commonly associated with pig infection (EFSA 2008b); although we assume here that all salmonellae are capable of infecting pigs and are of zoonotic potential (as prescribed in the EFSA ToRs). As with management systems, feeding systems are variable between farms. There will be variation in the type of food used, the additives used, and how the feed is presented to the pigs (meal/mash/pellets/grinding). All of these factors affect the ecology of the pig gut. The main factor with relevance to Salmonella transmission appears to be the way in which the feed affects the pH and content of organic acids in the pig gut (O'Connor et al. 2008; Wales et al. 2009). The lower the pH the more hostile the environment for any Salmonella , and hence infection is less likely. Of particular importance is whether the feed is presented as a dry or wet form, or whether it is pelleted or non-pelleted (Lo Fo Wong & Hald 2000; O'Connor et al. 2008). Risk factors studies highlight the effect of different feeds on Salmonella infection, but these do not provide enough information to model the relative protective effect of individual types of feed. Therefore we concentrate on describing the dynamics of Salmonella transmission between pigs given consumption of wet or dry feed, where there is some information on the relative effect, and good information on whether a farmer uses wet/dry feed from the EFSA baseline survey.

While the evidence for flooring type affecting Salmonella transmission is varied (some studies point to it as a risk factor, most don't) (Lo Fo Wong et al. 2004; Nollet et al. 2004), logical thinking suggests that slatted flooring may well have some effect as it will remove faeces/ Salmonella from the pig environment. The inclusion of this factor is relatively straightforward, and so we include it to investigate whether this factor is important or not. Again, there are many flooring types (partially slatted, bare concrete, straw-laden), but it is not possible to differentiate between individual types of flooring, and hence we consider only the distinction between slatted and solid flooring (assuming, given the propensity for pigs to earmark a particular area for defecation, that partially slatted flooring is equivalent to fully slatted flooring). Based on the previous discussion, the five main factors considered for large pig farm management are: rearing stages; AIAO vs continuous production; feed; flooring and finally inside vs outside production . There are other factors that may influence Salmonella introduction and transmission, but these have either not yet been proven to be important or are not possible to model with current data, in particular as biosecurity and hygiene factors (e.g. stocking density, age of building, storage of feed). One important example is herd size, which in a number of studies has been shown to be related to prevalence of infection (although we do capture this at a very broad level by considering large and small farms). However, this relationship is far from universally proven, and the underlying drivers of why herd size is related to prevalence of infection (e.g. stocking density, sharing of equipment between farms) are unlikely to be captured within the current model. Therefore, herd size is a factor judged not to warrant further inclusion at this stage - especially as it is unlikely that farmers can change herd size as an intervention measure. The broad overview gained by the above review is the foundation of the generic farm model, which then forms part of the larger generic risk assessment model. Finer resolution can be achieved by considering parameter estimation at a MS level. 7.3.2 Small farm management Information on smaller farms is extremely limited. The only reliable data we were able to find was the EFSA breeding pig survey on the number of farms with less than 20 sows (However, only for three of the four case study MSs, MS1, MS3 and MS4 - MS2 did not sample any small farms as we have defined them). Based on expert opinion and miscellaneous evidence from the literature (although this evidence cannot be relied upon to be representative of all small EU pig farming), we have modified the management system for large farms to describe small farms. The main differences between large and small farm management are that we assume small farms will not have enough stock (maximum of 20 sows) to warrant grouping of pigs, and so we assume that this group of up to 20 sows is serviced, and hence farrowed, at the same time. This produces a large group of piglets (say 200), which is then weaned at the same time and placed within a single block of accommodation. The weaned pigs then stay in this same accommodation until they reach slaughter weight, by which time the next group of piglets should be about ready to be weaned. We consider all of the same factors as for large farms above, i.e. inside/outside production, feed type and flooring type.

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 80By its nature, small farm management is likely to be varied, and the structure described above will only be applicable to a certain percentage of small EU farms. More information on the small farm model can be found in Section 7.4.1. 7.3.3 Source of infection Previous information (Nollet et al. 2005) suggests that infection (from any route) in piglets born to a seropositive sow is relatively lower than piglets born to seronegative sows. The source of infection for most farms is thought to be the introduction of new stock or contaminated feed (EFSA 2006; Lo Fo Wong & Hald 2000), for which one possibility is that a small number of \"seeder\" pigs may initiate widespread transmission in the event of a period of mixing and feed change such as weaning. Therefore, one source of infection within the model is the prevalence of infection in sows from the EFSA breeding survey, which is used to estimate the amount of Salmonella that might be excreted into the farrowing pen. Any piglets infected then pose an increasing threat to other pigs once they have entered the weaning stage. As described above, feed and external contamination (primarily due to rodents) are also included as sources. 7.3.4 Transmission Transmission between pigs has been shown by a number of studies (Jensen et al. 2006; Kranker et al. 2003; Nollet et al. 2005). However, transmission studies relevant to the risk assessment, using \"natural\" modes of infection (i.e. not deliberately inoculating pigs with a large dose to ensure infection) are lower in number and usually smaller. Transmission in these observational studies shows intermittent shedding at low levels (usually less than 100 CFU/g of faeces) and a fairly low incidence of infection, apart from the period immediately post-weaning, when there is typically a distinct increase in incidence/prevalence (Jensen et al. 2006; Nollet et al. 2005). From the studies mentioned above, transmission is highly variable, and different Salmonella serotypes will intermittently contaminate/infect a pen of pigs over the course of time (Davies et al. 1999; VLA 2009). This variability will come not only from the management system used, but is also inherent in the transmission of infectious diseases; therefore the model developed must capture this variability. In order to account for interventions, the environment and the resistance of the pig must be included within the transmission model. Hence, the transmission model focuses on two main factors: the amount of Salmonella in the environment (predominantly through the excretion of Salmonella in the faeces of infected pigs) and the dose- response relationship for the infection of a pig (which can be varied to simulate greater immunity due to vaccination or feed).

The overall farm model is made up of two distinct models, the large and small farm models. Each MS is simulated separately. The model for each MS is identical except for the parameter estimation of each. For each MS model, the following chronology of model events applies: 1. Set number of iterations/farms for both small and large farm models. Each iteration of the model approximates the management of pigs on one farm throughout a 500-day cycle 15. 2. Set up management system of large and small farms. Input management and transmission parameter values for large and small farm models. 3. Allocate farm type to each farm (iteration) of the small or large farm simulation. Farm type is allocated according to proportion of farm types found for MS within the management data collected from the EFSA breeding survey baseline survey. In all there are 56 farm types, each with a different combination of management factors, e.g. large/small farm, feed type, AIAO/continuous production. 4. Run large and small farm simulation models. 5. At iteration level: track movement and birth of pigs over 500-day cycle. 6. At iteration level: determine whether infected breeding pig herd or not. If so, allocate sows that are Salmonella -positive. 7. At iteration level: seed any Salmonella into environment via sows, feed or external contamination. 8. At iteration level: if/when infection in slaughter pigs occurs (via sow, feed or environment), transmission is modelled. As stated there are separate large and small farm models, and the above chronology applies to both. A graphical representation of this management model is shown below in Figure 7.1. We now go through each of the steps in turn and in more detail. Number of iterations The number of iterations represent the number of farms included within a MS model. We have chosen 1,000 iterations as a suitable number for the baseline model, in order to ensure convergence of the national slaughter pig prevalence for each MS (derived from the ~70,000 batches generated from a 1000-iteration simulation). Explicitly, the small farm model is run for 1,000 iterations, and the large farm model is also run for 1,000 iterations. Large and small farm management and transmission setup For the purposes of the model, we assume that all slaughter pigs will go through four main stages of rearing: farrowing, weaning, growing and finishing (fattening); and will be moved into specialist accommodation for each stage of rearing (and can be transported between farms at the end of weaning if on a multi-site farm). At the beginning of the model ( t=1) we populate each pen/room/building with pigs, except for one farrowing building, which is left empty for cleaning and disinfection for one week. Assuming most large systems will raise pigs using some form of 15 500 days was chosen as the best balance between i) running the model for long enough to produce enough batches of pigs that will track through all farm stages (thus making the results more realistic) and ii) reducing the runtime to a manageable level.

Pigs are reared through 4 distinct stages: farrowing (4 weeks - upon which one batch of pigs from farrowing building is mixed into 1 room of 4 pens in weaner building), weaning (4 weeks), growing (6 weeks) and finishing (12 weeks). Examples of flow are given by coloured annotations: red: piglets are weaned and grouped into batch of 4 pens within one weaner room at the start of Week 1, moved to growing accommodation on Week 5, finishing accommodation on Week 11 and slaughtered on Week 23; green: New group of sows moved into vacated farrowing building 5 on Week 16; piglets are weaned at start of Week 20 and pass through rooms in subsequent accommodation as they become empty at the time where movement occurs. This system is relatively flexible: the schematic was described first for an all-in-all-out inside, breeder-finisher production (where 4 pens within the weaning, growing and finishing buildings are assumed to represent one room with adequate screening between other rooms to provide a biosecure area), but can be modified with relative ease for other systems such as continuous or outside production. The number of pens/rooms within a building, the number of buildings, and the number of pigs within a pen can all be modified too (although for simplicity we assume the number of weaners/growers/finishers within a pen must be a multiple of the number of pigs within a pen from the previous stage). As discussed herd size is not included as a variable within a MS-specific model. We have taken a typical large farm herd size and applied it to the framework shown in Figure 7.2. Therefore, the large farm model is for a herd of 460 sows or alternatively 1600 finishers; while the latter is still relatively small for some countries (UK, Denmark), the dynamics of Salmonella transmission are reasonably captured, while reducing the computational effort required to run the model. The overall framework shown in Figure 7.2 remains fundamental for any large farm type, but with the following modifications: QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Model accounts for different flooring types/feed types between farrowing/weaning stages and growing/finishing stages. Breeder-weaner/Grower-finisher(BWGF): as for breeder-finisher, but transport (see Chapter 8) between weaner and grower stages. (Effect on Salmonella transmission because of the grower-finisher farm sourcing pigs from more than one farm is investigated as a scenario analysis). Outside production : applies only to farrowing stage (assume all pigs moved indoors from weaning onwards). Farrowing transmission model parameters are modified to allow for decreased removal of faeces and increased cross-contamination of faecal material between sow crates (less biosecurity). Continuous : Framework and flow as described in Figure 7.2, except no sectioning of weaning, growing or finishing buildings into rooms, i.e. number of rooms set to 1 (hence cross-contamination of faecal material between pens containing different cohorts of varying-aged pigs possible). Flooring/Feed : As for outside production, differences in flooring/feed are achieved by modifying the values of transmission model parameters (i.e. removal of faecal material, dose response parameters). The small farm model is a modification of the large farm model described above. We essentially reduce the large farm model down to one \"cohort\" of the large farm. The model framework is shown in Figure 7.3. Figure 7.3: Model framework for small farm model . Within the small farm model we model the maximum capacity for a small farm, 20 sows.

There are only two accommodation blocks that slaughter pigs reside in, the farrowing and finishing accommodation. We assume all small farms are breeder-finisher farms. As with large farms, each iteration of the small farm model represents one farm; the farm characteristics of each are selected according to the weighting taken from the EFSA breeding survey (similar to the large farm model). Transmission and introduction of Salmonella are treated the same as within the large farm model, where parameter estimation is determined according to the farm type. Allocate farm types to 1,000 farms (iterations) As described above, pig production in each MS is characterised by a heterogeneous mix of production systems. Therefore, as discussed above, five main factors of pig production are ascribed to each farm/iteration of the large and small farm model: 1. Breeder-finisher versus breeder-weaner/grower-finisher production 2. Inside versus outside production (breeding pig herds only) 3. All-in-all-out versus continuous production 4. Solid versus slatted flooring 5. Dry versus wet feed. More detailed definitions of each of the types mentioned above are given in Table 7.1. Table 7.1: Definitions of farm types used within the EU farm model. Farm type Definition Breeder-finisher Farm rearing slaughter pigs from birth to slaughter weight Breeder-weaner Farm rearing pigs from birth to approximately 8 weeks old (large farm only) Grower-finisher Farm rearing pigs from approximately 8 weeks old birth to slaughter weight (large farm only) All-in-all-out (AIAO) Farms producing pigs on strict batch system, where pigs within a batch are of same age, and with a barrier between other batches (e.g. within the model, we assume batches are kept in separate rooms) (large farm only) Continuous Any system that does not meet the criteria of AIAO above Slatted flooring Any flooring that contains slatting of some kind (be it partial or full) Soild flooring Any flooring that does not meet the criteria of slatted flooring Wet feed Any moisture-added feed Iinside production only) Dry feed Any feed that does not fit into wet feed category, including pelleted or compound feed. From the above table definitions we consider a total of 56 farm types (see Table 7.2).

The framework of the model does not change according to farm type, only the parameter estimates assigned to each MS model. Run large and small farm models As stated the small and large farm models are run independently of each other for each MS, each being run for 1000 iterations, where each iteration is run over a 500- day cycle. A selection of these batches is then taken (weighted according to the proportion of pig production from large and small farms) to use an input to the Transport & Lairage model. Anderson and May 1979 state that the timestep of an Susceptible-Infected- Recovered model (of which the farm model is a modified version) should be similar to the latent period of infection, which is the time it takes from ingestion to infection. For pigs, this is estimated to be around 24-48 hours; hence the model is run on a 1-day timescale.

Therefore, over 500 days there are 72 batches sent to slaughter. These 72 batches represent the saved output of each farm/iteration. For the small farm a batch will be sent to slaughter approximately every 26 weeks, and so there are 3 batches sent to slaughter within the 500-day cycle of each farm. At the start of each iteration, the slaughter pigs present on that farm are all susceptible, and hence not shedding any Salmonella into the pig environment. However, sows may be Salmonella -positive, and so may shed Salmonella into the environment (explained in more detail in Section 7.4.3). There is also the potential for Salmonella to be ingested by slaughter pigs through contaminated feed and/or the external environment. This ingestion of Salmonella is highly variable and infection may (or may not) occur at any time point in the 500-day cycle. The random nature of the seeding of infection also means that the time at which the model is started is also completely arbitrary. In reality most farms are old and will have been infected at some point in time, but we cannot run the model from the initial startup of a farm (this would require running the model for years of production, currently not feasible). Management and movement of pigs For all stages of production we use the following notation for the kth pig in the jth pen where is the number of pigs within a pen, npen the number of pens within a farrowing house or a room of a weaning, growing or finishing house, and nroom the number of rooms/buildings within the stage of production (e.g. there are 5 buildings of 16 pens within farrowing, and 6 rooms of 4 pens within growing production). For finishing production there are 6 rooms (of 4 pens each) within two finishing buildings. For ease of notation we consider the two finisher buildings as one building (i.e. there are 12 rooms within the finishing building). For farrowing, there is one sow in each pen. Each sow gives birth to a constant number of n pig piglets (we assume that Salmonella transmission is insensitive to the number of piglets in a litter surviving to weaning). Piglets are weaned wa days after birth. Assuming weekly slaughter batches, one batch (i.e. one building) of piglets are weaned at the beginning of each week (e.g. t = 1 or 8) and the piglets from the j pens in building l are mixed into large groups for placement into weaner accommodation. There is one weaner building; weaners will spend ga days in the weaner accommodation before being moved as intact pen groups into the grower accommodation. For the grower accommodation, growers will spend fa days in this accommodation before being moved as intact pen groups into the final stage of finishing. Finishing is identical to the growing accommodation, except there are two buildings instead of one. Finishing pigs spend sa days in this accommodation before being sent to slaughter. One point to make explicitly clear is the difference between AIAO and continuous production. For AIAO production, within the weaning/growing/finishing building there will be 4/4/6 distinct compartments/rooms where pigs are raised. For continuous production, there is no barrier preventing cross-contamination of pens etc, and the weaning/growing/finishing building is assumed to represent one compartment. At t = 1, four of the five farrowing buildings are occupied (the remaining pen is empty for cleaning and drying). Within all other stages, all pens are occupied (in discussion with experts, it seems unlikely that many farmers would practice downtime beyond QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

The Salmonella status of each slaughter pig k (i.e. not sow) in pen j of room/building l at time t, (k,j,l,t) = 0 k, j, l, where 0 represents susceptible status, 1 represents infected status) (see Section 7.4.3 for further description). Movement of pigs from one production stage to another, and to slaughter, takes place on specific days within the model. This is the set t' = {1,8,15,... 498}. Each individual movement time is denoted t'. We start movement of pigs from one production stage using building or room 1. Therefore, on day 1 the following movements occur: a. Piglets from farrowing building 1 grouped into 4 pens moved into weaner room 1. Sows from farrowing building 1 moved back to service/gestation accommodation. Farrowing building 1 left empty for one week. New batch of sows ready to give birth moved into farrowing building 5. b. Weaners from room 1 moved to growing room 1. c. Growers moved from growing room 1 into finishing room 1 of finishing house 1. d. Finishers within finishing room 1 (building 1) transported to slaughter. These same movements occur, but for different rooms/buildings, on days t'. Production is staggered sequentially; for example, on day 8, piglets are moved out of farrowing building 2 and moved into weaner room 2, and on day 15 piglets are moved out of farrowing building 3 and moved into weaner room 3. In this way we can predefine which rooms/buildings will be depopulated and populated at any time t'. The set of pens/buildings depopulated at time t' is defined as r = {fbw( t'),wr(t'),gr(t'),fr(t')}, and the set of pens/buildings populated at t' is defined as p = {fbp(t'),wr(t'),gr(t'),fr(t')}, where fbw( t') is the farrowing building depopulated, fbp( t') is the farrowing building populated, and wr( t'), gr( t') and fr( t') the weaning, growing and finishing pens depopulated (and populated). For clarity the set of batches being sent to slaughter, b, is {fr(1),fr(8),..,fr(498)}, and we re-denote these individual batches as b. For slaughter pigs that are finished on a grower-finisher farm, it is assumed that they were reared on a breeder-weaner farm and transported to the grower-finisher farm. Within some studies transport has been highlighted as a risk factor for Salmonella transmission between pigs (Berends et al. 1996), and hence transport is included within the BWGF model. Transport between farms is assumed to be almost identical to transport between the finishing house and slaughterhouse, hence the model we use here is largely based on the transport model (Chapter 8). There are important similarities and exceptions, outlined below: 1. As for the main transport model, we assume one batch is transported in one vehicle. 2. Only one batch is transported from the weaner to growing stage at a time. 3. Unless direct data available, assume duration of travel has a similar distribution as transport to slaughterhouse. 7.4.2 Summary of inputs and outputs There is no specific input to the model in terms of Salmonella . The main input is the type of farms which will be included within each MS model, which is derived from the EFSA breeding survey management data and other sources. Salmonella is seeded into the environment over the 500 day cycle of each farm within a MS simulation model from three different potential sources - the sow, feed and external contamination. However, infection of slaughter pigs does not necessarily occur. The output of the farm model is the within-batch lymph-node prevalence of pigs at the point of depopulation (represented by the set b).

It is assumed that this database of batch prevalence represents national production, so that the average prevalence over all batches represents the national slaughter pig prevalence (before transport to the slaughterhouse) for that MS. As stated above, a selection of these batches is then taken (weighted according to the proportion of pig production from large and small farms) to use an input to the Transport & Lairage model. 7.4.3 Transmission model Faecal shedding For the rest of this section we write generally for all stages of production (farrowing, weaning etc) unless explicitly stated. We define the amount of faecal material shed by a pig in any one timestep (one day) as (k,j,l,t), where k represents an individual pig within pen j of room l and ()()()2, ,,,= N tljk (for farrowing pen - sow is defined as k = 1, piglets k={2,3,..11}). Therefore, the amount of faecal material shed into pen j in room l on day t is given by: () ( is equal to 40 for weaning growing and farrowing stages, and 11 (1 sow and 10 piglets) for farrowing. We also define F,day and xc,day as the proportional factors with which faecal material shed on day t is removed from the pen via slatted flooring/cleaning and cross- contamination of adjacent pens respectively. These are samples from beta distributions and consequently we define ()() ( amount of faecal material shed in pen j on day t and available to be ingested by pigs within pen j, = (7.1) The amount of faecal material that was present on day [ t-1] removed by cleaning/slatted flooring etc at the end of day t, calculated as: ) Where F(j,l,t-1) is the amount of faecal material at the end of day [ t-1] and F,old is a removal coefficient estimated in a similar fashion to F,day. Similarly the amount of faecal material cross-contaminated to where xc,old is a removal coefficient estimated in a similar fashion to xc,day. Should Fold(j,l,t)+Fxc(j,l,t) > F(j,l,t-1) then Fold(j,l,t)+Fxc(j,l,t) is truncated such that QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

(However, this is an extremely rare event with the current parameter estimation). Therefore the amount of faecal material within a pen j at the end of time t 4 ) The set of pens depopulated at times t', r, are assumed to be cleaned out before the set of new pigs, p, are moved in at times t' (for weaning, growing and finishing) and time t'+7 for farrowing. We assume cleaning out of faecal material at this depopulation time is efficient, i.e. f(r,t') ~ 0. However, we assume that Salmonella removal will not be 100% efficient. Infection status Based on the literature review in Section 7.3, we assume that a slaughter pig k within pen j located in room/building j will be in any one of two states at time t Susceptible ((k,j,l,t = 0): Pig is not infected. Lymph-node positive ((k,j,l,t)= 1): Pig is infected in ileo-caecal lymph-node and will excrete Salmonella intermittently . If it is shedding it sheds Salmonella at a concentration dependent on whether it was infected at a \"low\" (<106 CFUs) or \"high\" dose (106 CFUs) (based on the observed differences in shedding rates from Jensen et al. (2006) . (More detail on how we model the shedding of Salmonella is given later). Lymph-node positive status is used as it is an ideal characteristic at the point of slaughter for which to validate the model (given this was the primary sample type for the EFSA baseline slaughter pig survey). However, lymph-node positive does not equate to a status of infectious or excreting Salmonella . Rather, it is an indication of the fact the pig still has a Salmonella infection and can potentially shed Salmonella . We then loosely use this characteristic to determine whether the pig is shedding or not, and if so at what level. As no data were available, we assume pigs immediately return to the \"Susceptible\" state following recovery from being lymph-node positive. Recovery from the \"infected\" state takes tLN days. The number of susceptible and lymph-node positive pigs within a pen at time t, S(i,j,t) and I(i,j,t) respectively, are a - b ) Sources of infection Based on the EFSA Scientific Opinion on Salmonella in pigs (EFSA 2006) and the literature review carried out in Section 7.3, the following sources of infection are thought to be important: other infected pigs (including new stock/mixing of pigs/sows, but also the carry-over of Salmonella from previously infected batches), feed and QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

These three sources are modelled to varying degrees, depending on the data available. Sows The herd prevalence for Salmonella infection of breeding sows was estimated for each MS within the EU from the EFSA breeding survey, which was supplied directly via EFSA (http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/efsa_locale- 1178620753812_1178662632875.htm ).). This survey provides the estimates for the herd prevalence of Salmonella infection in each case study MS, pherd. The status of the breeding pig herd within the farm model is therefore given as: binf = ()()herdpB,1 ( 7 . 6 ) where binf = 1 signifies that the breeding pig herd is infected with Salmonella and binf = 0 signifies a Salmonella -negative breeding pig herd. The within-herd prevalence of infection, pw, will vary between farms, as well as MSs. The status of each individual sow entering a farrowing room is determined as follows: ()() = ) 1 denotes that the sow in farrowing pen j in building l is Salmonella positive and 0 denotes a susceptible sow. As each group of piglets reach weaning age a new group of sows are placed into the farrowing house and Equation7.7 is used again to determine the status of each sow within that house (e.g. the first piglets in Farrowing House 2 will reach weaning age at day 8, and hence the sows are removed and replaced on this same day). Each sow will produce f sow faeces per day. The infected sows within a pen j (sow(j,l,t) = 1) may shed Salmonella . Therefore, the number of Salmonella shed into the farrowing environment each day by each sow, s(j,l,t), is estimated by: (7.8) where c s is the concentration of Salmonella shed by a positive sow . Piglets within the same or adjacent pen are then exposed to the Salmonella in the environment. Note that sows are treated as a \"static\" source of infection within the model: they are not infected by either of the other sources considered below, or by the shedding of their neighbours.

We also assume that feed delivery type will be in bulk for large farms and bagged for small farms, where deliveries are made twice a week for bulk deliveries and once a month for bagged deliveries. We assume pigs will consume g grams of feed per day and that a pig is exposed to a single feedlot every 4 days on a large farm and every 28 days on a small farm. We define the prevalence of feedlot contamination as p feed, then the status of a particular feedlot, feed, can be determined using: feed = (B(1, pfeed)) The concentration of Salmonella in feed (per gram) can therefore be given as: == =1 if 0 if 0 feed ffeed fcc Estimation of cf is described later. External contamination (wildlife, boots etc) There are no data to quantify the frequency and magnitude of any external contamination of the farm (and how these two factors will vary between farms). However, there are some data on wildlife incursion into farms, and the amount of Salmonella rodents or birds might contaminate the environment with defecation. We therefore chose to use wildlife (specifically rodents and birds) as a proxy for external contamination. A study into the transmission of Salmonella between wildlife and meat-production animals (Skov et al. 2008) suggests that wildlife within the vicinity of farms are more commonly infected with Salmonella if the pigs themselves are infected. Therefore we assume that the status of the wildlife, w(t), is equivalent to the status of the farm, i.e. w(t) = 1 if or one or more slaughter pigs are in state lymph-node positive, i.e. () > lj ktljk 0 ,,, . Rodents and birds are then assumed to contribute e Salmonella organisms to the dose of each pig for each time step onwards (assuming, in the absence of any other data, each pig will ingest roughly 1g of rodent/bird faeces per day). Studies have shown that prevalence within rodents/birds on an infected pig farm are fairly low, around 1-5% (Davies & Wray 1995; Skov et al. 2008). We therefore set a switch within the model such that pig ingestion of Salmonella through external contamination occurs relative to the prevalence within wildlife. The concentration of Salmonella within wildlife faeces appears to be similar to that within pigs (Davies & Wray 1995), hence, in the absence of rigorous quantitative data, we simply allocate a lognormal distribution for e that on visual inspection gives a biologically plausible estimate. Introduction of infection From the above sources of infection pigs may be exposed at any time t to some dose from either sows, feed or external contamination, s, f and e respectively. These are the daily doses (units of CFUs/day), hence we must scale up from the concentration in faeces, feed and external contamination to the amount of each ingested (for example, amount of faecal material or feed ingested per day). Therefore the total dose each slaughter pig will ingest at time t before introduction of QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

The dose-response model described below is then used to determine whether one or more pigs become infected. Transmission Once infection of one or more pigs occurs, then transmission is driven by the shedding of contaminated faeces by slaughter pigs, as well as the sources of infection (sow, feed and external contamination). In order to model the required interventions, we have taken a more detailed approach than in other Salmonella in pigs transmission models such as that of Hill et al. (2008), which use an all- encompassing transmission parameter. Here we undertake the detailed modelling of faeces and the cross-contamination of this faecal material between pens, the removal of faecal material and its ingestion by pigs. A schematic diagram of the transmission model framework for one pen (relevant to all pens, buildings and stages of production) is given in Figure 7.4. The amount of Salmonella shed into the pen environment each day, (j,l,t) can be given where cp is the amount of Salmonella shed by an infected pig, and is generated from a combination of a discrete general and uniform distribution, i.e. (U(10(DG(a, b)-1, 10(DG(a, b)), where we choose the order of magnitude of shedding (e.g. 2, 3 log CFU per gram of faeces) based on published literature. We can write very similar equations for the total amount of Salmonella in the pen environment as above for faecal material. Therefore, ) where Eold and Exc are amounts of Salmonella removed at t-1 and removed via cross- contamination respectively. As for faecal material, should Eold(j,l,t)+Exc(j,l,t) > E(j,l,t-1) then Eold(j,l,t)+Exc(j,l,t) is truncated such that Eold(j,l,t)+exc(j,l,t) = E(j,l,t-1). The total amount of Salmonella in pen j at the end of day t is given 7 . 1 3 ) where is the decay rate of Salmonella per day.

Only the interactions from pen( j,l) are shown. The total faecal material in the pen, F, is added to each day t by both Susceptibles ( S) and Infecteds ( I) and cross-contamination from other pens, Fxc (from either pen j+1 or j-1), or subtracted via cross-contamination or removal, fold. This faecal material contains E salmonellas, added to each day from the infected group shedding in their faeces, and subtracted from via decay and cross-contamination Exc. Susceptible pigs ingest organisms per day via the amount in the faeces, feed ( f) or environment ( e), which then produces e new infections according to the dose ingested and the dose-response relationship applied. An important sidenote is the treatment of Salmonella within the pen at depopulation of a batch from the farrowing, weaning, growing or finishing compartment. We assume there is imperfect removal of Salmonella during cleaning and/or disinfection. Therefore, (R',t') = [ E(R',t').C]-10.tC, where C is the % of Salmonella removed from pen environment, and is equal to () ( ) c cBeta, (hence C is randomly sampled for each timepoint and pen depopulation), and tC is the time between depopulation and repopulation (7 days for farrowing, zero for other stages). If [ E(R',t').C]-10.tC < 0 then E(R',t') = 0. QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Therefore the average concentration of Salmonella within a gram of contaminated faecal material, c, can be given by ()() ()tljFtljtljc,,,,,,= We assume all ( Salmonella -negative and positive) pigs ingest some faecal material each day. Therefore, each pig will ingest i(k,j,l,t) organisms through faecal ingestion on day t according to the following equation (shown in pig i pen ipig tjik , and ming is the mean mass of faeces ingested by pigs, and ing is the associated standard deviation.

Hence, at time tinf+tLN (time of infection + length of infection) a pig will return to \"Susceptible\" status (if it has not been transported to slaughter first). The number of recovered pigs within a pen at time t, r(j,l,t), is simply the sum of infected pigs that have reached the end of their infection period. Therefore the number of Susceptible ( S(j,l,t)) and LN-positive ( LN(j,l,t))) pigs within a pen at the end of day t is calculated = The prevalence of infection within each pen at time t is then simply () pigntljLN ,,. Output The output of the model is the prevalence of infection (defined as lymph-node positive) within batches of pigs placed on transport to slaughter. This occurs weekly, i.e. one finishing room from one of the finishing buildings is emptied on each of the movement timesteps t' discussed above.

The estimates for each of the parameters specific to large and small farm management are shown in and Table 7.3 and Table 7.4. The only published data we have been able to find from the case study MSs have been from MS2 sources. From the management data collected as part of the EFSA breeding survey it does not appear that there is a significant difference in the numbers associated with length of stage, numbers within in pens etc. As such, the estimates used are kept identical between the case study MSs, although they can be changed at a later date if desired. We are aware that there is variability in the systems described above, such as when pigs will be weaned. However, such variability is difficult to include due to the complexity of describing the population/depopulation of different pens over time. We also realise that variability in weaning age etc might cause changes in the transmission of infection, but because of factors that we cannot capture in the model (e.g. stress, varying growth rate of pigs) investing time in including variability in QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

A major factor in determining variation between MSs is the proportion of different farm types within that MS. Little data were available to assess the number of pigs within a pen etc. Available books on the subject of pig housing and pig management tend to be older, although some information has been gleaned from these (Brent 1986; Sainsbury 1976). A 460-sow unit was chosen as a relatively large size for an EU pig farm. In addition, as an individual-based model the time it takes to run the large farm model is directly related to the number of pigs flowing through the farm, and hence a number was chosen which would represent a large farm but also restrict runtime of the model to a manageable level. Therefore, the framework described in Figure 7.2 and numbers chosen for the length of each stage and the size of buildings, rooms etc have been chosen to reflect expert opinion on the structure of a typical large commercial pig farm, and also to optimise the model.

However, such variability is difficult to include due to the complexity of describing the population/depopulation of different pens over time. We also realise that variability in weaning age etc might cause changes in the transmission of infection, but because of factors that we cannot capture in the model (e.g. stress, varying growth rate of pigs) investing time in including variability in weaning age etc was not considered efficient.

This variability is reflected in the model, as each iteration picks one particular farm type to present that iteration's \"farm\". There are clear differences in the structure of each case study MSs' pig production (see Table 7.5) (from the EFSA breeding survey). This survey is also the most comprehensive and representative data we have, and so more resource has been invested in modelling the differences between MSs that can be quantified using this dataset (i.e. farm type). Transmission parameters Pig/Salmonella parameters for the transmission model are those physical characteristics that determine the transmission of Salmonella between pigs, e.g. the amount of faecal material produced by a weaner per day, or the concentration of Salmonella within that faecal material if the pig is infected. The parameter estimates for Salmonella and pig characteristics are shown in Table 7.6. A full literature review was carried out to determine parameter estimates, however some parameters were not quantifiable. Where this occurred, we used expert opinion and for some rather abstract parameters (such as the amount of faecal material cross-contaminated between pens per day) the estimates were determined by graphing plausible estimates and assessing which looked more correct (via author's opinion). Clearly more data need to be collected for these parameters. Sources of infection Sow The breeding pig herd prevalence of each case study MS was taken from the EFSA breeding pig survey, and assumed to be directly equivalent to pherd. The within-herd prevalence of infection was available from additional work carried out for the EFSA breeding survey for MS2 and the MS4 (EFSA breeding survey data supplied by Michaela Hempen/Frank Boelaert). The mass of faecal material produced by a sow is around 2kg (Brent 1986), which we have assumed a standard deviation of 100g. The concentration of Salmonella within a gram of contaminated faecal material, c s, has been estimated previously by fitting a distribution to empirical enumeration data collected during a study of gilts (VLA 2009).

Feed lots typically consist of 3-5 tonnes in large feed mills, which would typically last the large farm (minus sows) modelled here 2-3 days.

In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors.

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 102The prevalence of Salmonella contamination has been identified to be between 1- 10% for samples from feed types commonly used for pigs (EFSA, 2006). We only have specific data for MS2 from the case study MSs (approximately 2% of pig feed contaminated, (VLA 2008)). However, there are many issues with sampling of feed in determining prevalence, as discussed by EFSA (2006). Of concern to us is the extremely small samples taken (e.g. the UK sampling procedure is to take two 25g aggregate samples from two weeks' worth of production), meaning that it is highly likely that positive batches are missed because of the heterogeneity of contamination. While home-mixing is quite common for pig feed production, industrial production of feed is presumably fairly standardised across the EU. Using this assumption, we therefore set a conservative estimate of p feed at 10% for all case study MSs. This assumption is made purely on the opinion of the author based on discussions with experts on the subject of feed and Salmonella . This necessarily means it is an uncertain parameter and will be investigated within the uncertainty analysis. Pigs consume approximately 4% of their bodyweight, and hence consume more feed as they gain weight. Therefore, assuming midpoints of each stage as 6 weeks old (weaner), 12 weeks old (grower) and 18 weeks old (finisher), then the average daily feed intakes ( g) are 500, 1620 and 3200 g/day respectively (Carr 1998). There have only been limited studies on the concentration of Salmonella within contaminated feed, but it appears to be present in concentrations between 1-1000 CFU/g (Thomas et al. 1981). Sauli et al. 2005 estimate the distribution of Salmonella concentration during finishing heat-treated pig feed production in a large Swiss feed mill. We have fitted a generialised Pareto distribution to the data from Sauli et al. to estimate c f and in the absence of further data assume this is applicable across all EU-produced feed. External contamination As discussed above, we only consider contamination via birds/rodents, and treat this simply by adding an extra \"dose\" to individual pigs if the farm is already infected, e. There are no data to suggest doses that pigs will be exposed to via external contamination. However, studies (Davies & Wray 1995; Skov et al. 2008) suggests that the prevalence of infection in rodents is low if infection is present (1-10%). We have fitted a lognormal distribution to the data provided on enumeration of rodent faeces in Davies & Wray (1995), assuming a pig will consume one whole rodent dropping per \"external contamination\" exposure. The lognormal fit to the data produces a distribution for e as shown in Figure 7.5. Removal/movement of faeces Despite literature searches, no data exists to quantify the rate of removal of faecal material from either solid or slatted flooring, or the rate at which faecal material is cross-contaminated to adjacent pens or Salmonella cleaned out from the pen before repopulation. Hence, we have assumed that the percentage amount of faeces within a pen that is removed or cross-contaminated varies according to a beta distribution. Absolute values for the shape and scale parameters of the beta distributions have been chosen logically: i.e. more faecal material is removed from the pen on slats than on solid flooring, and the vast majority of faecal material will remain within the pen where it originated from, instead of being cross-contaminated.

Fitted to data taken from Davies & Wray (1995). Therefore, current estimates for the two distributions are given in Figure 7.6. Duration of excretion and infection Longitudinal data from two studies (Gray et al. 1996; Jensen et al. 2006) have been used to estimate the duration of excretion and lymph-node positivity. Carrying out survival analysis of the two datasets we produce the following distributions for length of excretion (faecal shedding) and carriage (LN-positive). The two distributions are remarkably similar given they are derived from two different studies and were originally assumed to denote two different characteristics of infection. For this analysis we have assumed that the duration of excretion from Jensen et al. (2006) is equal to the total period from the first to last positive sample from a pig, therefore including sampling points when the pig provided a negative sample. These negative samples may be due to intermittent shedding or because of false negatives (sensitivity of faecal tests is considered to be poor, Rob Davies, VLA, personal communication). The results of Jensen et al. do concur with other similar longitudinal studies (Kranker et al. 2003; Osterberg et al. 2009; Scherer et al. 2008). The similarity of these two distributions tend to suggest that intermittent shedding could occur over almost the whole time period in which an individual pig is infected. Therefore, we assume that there is no carrier phase as defined in previous models (such as Hill et al., 2008), and that excretion can occur over the whole period where a pig is lymph-node positive (albeit intermittently).

Salmonella in pig faeces has not often been enumerated, and then mostly using semi-quantitative techniques. Therefore, we assume there is only one division between stages - the amount shed by sows and then the amount shed by slaughter pigs. However, one recent study by Jensen et al . (2006) did enumerate at an individual pig level for a longitudinal study of outdoor pigs. Two cohorts of pigs (one high and one low dose group) were seeded with experimentally infected pigs on outdoor paddocks, before these cohorts were removed and a new cohort placed on the vacated paddocks. There were significantly greater concentrations shed by the high dose group (0-10 6 CFU/g) than by the low dose group (0-100 CFU/g). Pigs from the second experiment cohorts were then infected quasi-naturally from the contaminated faecal material shed by the first cohorts. A summary of the data collected from the two second cohorts is shown in Figure 7.8 - these cohorts are assumed to be \"naturally\" infected. The raw data from this study was obtained, giving us enumeration of samples taken at weekly intervals for all Salmonella -positive pigs from the second-experiment cohorts. From these data we were able to produce frequency tables for both low and high-dose groups, which were used to estimate the probability of shedding x log CFU/g on week t+1 if pig k was shedding y log CFUs at week w. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 7.7 and Table 7.8. If pig k in pen i and room j, is shedding x log CFU during week w (according to one of the frequency matrices above) then during week w+1: QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Experimental dose-response data (5 pigs each at 101, 103, 105 and 107 CFUs) was taken from a study by Loynachan & Harris (2005). Salmonella infection was reported in a number of different lymph- nodes. To ensure we compare the correct sample for validation at slaughter, we chose to define infection as a positive ileocaecal lymph-node sample, given that this lymph node is also the sample taken within the EFSA slaughter pig survey (EFSA 2008a). A Beta-Poisson model was then fitted to it by P. Teunis at RIVM using his own previously developed program. The alpha and beta parameters from the beta- poisson model are also equivalent to the alpha and beta parameters of the beta- binomial model.

Blue: distribution used for \"low dose\" (infected with < 106 CFU) pigs, red for \"high dose\" (> 106 CFU) pigs. The resulting beta-binomial model is for pigs on dry feed. Pigs on wet feed will have a greater resistance to infection, due to the lowering of pH within the gut making it a more hostile environment for Salmonella (Wales et al. 2009). By a process of trial and error (i.e. changing the estimates until the same relative proportion of pigs on wet feed were infected with Salmonella compared to pigs on dry feed was observed as from a study by Tenhagen et al. 2009), we have developed the modified Beta- Poisson model of pigs on wet feed. The resulting baseline and modified PDFs are shown in Figure 7.9. 7.4.5 Sensitivity analysis Standard risk assessment sensitivity analysis methods are hard to apply for farm transmission models such as this. Within the farm sensitivity analysis we identify the important parameters in determining the variation of the within-batch prevalence of infection for pigs at slaughter (i.e. P LN(b). Using this method, we hope to be able to identify the important parameters for the farm model, whilst avoiding complex and lengthy simulations to link the farm model results to the rest of the model. (As previously described, the farm model produces a standalone database of results for PLN(b), known as the farm matrix (see Chapter 4), which is then sampled to provide the input for the rest of the risk assessment model. Linking the randomly selected results from the farm model to the rest of the risk assessment in order to conduct sensitivity analysis, apart from the direct output PLN(fr(t')), is a difficult procedure).

Based on trials conducted by Frey 2004 we have chosen to conduct an ANOVA method for our farm sensitivity analysis. More detail on this method is provided by Frey et al., but briefly the ANOVA method is a non-parametric method used to determine if values of the output vary in a statistically significant manner associated with variation in values for one or more inputs that have probability distributions assigned to them (see also Chapter 5 for a description of sensitivity analysis). If the output does not have a significant association with variation in the inputs, then the variation in the output is random. The F-test value typically associated with ANOVA can be used to represent the strength of association between input and output: that is, the larger the F-value, the stronger the association. Complexity is added to the analysis as we are dealing with many batches within one iteration of the model, and also because the pigs are kept track of as they migrate through the stages of production (for example, so that we can relate the shedding of Salmonella within a farrowing pen to the prevalence of infection within a finishing batch at slaughter). A major issue is that in order to run this ANOVA method, there must be only one sample from each probability distribution for each iteration, such that its value can be compared against the response variable value for that iteration. As is clear from the methodology described above there may be up to 29,000 individual samples of each distribution taken within a single batch calculation (i.e. 160 pigs over a 182 day lifespan ~ 29,000 samples of a probability distribution). Therefore a summary statistic must be used to describe the variance of these distributions against that of the response variable. We have chosen to use the mean, and hence, for example, the comparison of the shedding of Salmonella by a sow against the prevalence of infection within her progeny at the point of slaughter is carried out by using the average concentration of Salmonella within the sow's faeces over the 28 days the piglets were suckling from their mother. Because of this complexity we include only those parameters which are thought to be of obvious importance: 1. The average concentration of Salmonella shed by an infected sow 2. The average concentration of Salmonella shed by an infected piglet cohort (i.e. 10 piglets) 3. The average concentration of Salmonella shed by an infected weaner cohort (40 pigs) 4. The average concentration of Salmonella shed by an infected grower cohort (40 pigs) 5. The average concentration of Salmonella shed by an infected finisher cohort (40 pigs) 6. The average concentration of Salmonella in feed during weaning 7. The average concentration of Salmonella in feed during growing 8. The average concentration of Salmonella in feed during finishing 9. The average load of external contamination during farrowing. Sensitivity analysis, as described here, allows us to investigate the effect of naturally varying parameters on the farm output, but does not allow us to investigate the effect of uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis of the farm model is discussed further in Chapter 12.

We state the major assumptions (and the reason for their inclusion) below: 1. Breakpoint between small and large farms of 400 pigs slaughter per year This was decided as the breakpoint at the Data Workshop in Copenhagen based on discussion with the experts present, as a suitable point to differentiate between those farms sufficiently large to invest in specific buildings and use more \"biosecure\" methods, and those small farms that probably wouldn't have the resources to invest in such methods. 2. AIAO production by compartment/room. That is, farmers will raise batches of pigs in the same building, but there will be compartments within the building to keep pigs (and faeces of those pigs) from separate batches apart. In discussion with experts few pig farmers practice true AIAO production (i.e. one batch, one building). We therefore assume that if AIAO production is specified in the EFSA breeding survey, it is AIAO by compartment, not building. 3. Model only wet versus dry feed. There is some evidence that pelleted vs non-pelleted feed also has a significant effect in reducing Salmonella prevalence on-farm. However, little quantitative data was available for either moisture content or form of feed. We chose to reduce the complexity of the model by incorporating only wet vs. dry feed. The inclusion of wet vs. dry feed should be seen as an example of how feed can affect Salmonella prevalence. 4. Homogenous mixing of faeces and salmonella within faeces. This assumption was made in order to reduce complexity within the model. Homogenous mixing has the effect of exposing more pigs to infection, but at lower doses. We have not being able to quantify the uncertainty associated with this assumption, but it is likely to be a significant factor. 5. Assume proportional categorisation of breeding pig herd farm types can be applied to contract finishing farms. This is a major assumption that was necessary for MS1, MS3 and MS4 due to a lack of farm management data for contract finishing farms (despite information requests and assistance from experts within each of these MSs no relevant data could be identified). 6. Treat all salmonellas as equally infectious/zoonotic. This was made at the request of the EFSA ToRs. Evidence does suggest infection via multiple strains is likely, but we did not have the data or scope to consider these factors. The infectious dose, and shedding rate in faeces, especially for pig- or feed- adapted serotypes, is likely to be significantly different (Osterberg et al. 2009), and so there remains unquantified uncertainty within the model.

Allocation of contract finishing farm types 2. Dose response relationships for different strains of Salmonella 3. Shedding rates for different strains of Salmonella 4. Quantitative effect in modifying dose-response for different feed types 5. Prevalence and load of contamination within feed 6. Quantitative levels of exposure from external sources of infection (rodents, birds etc) 7. Faecal mass ingested by pigs 8. Cleaning and disinfection efficiency in removing Salmonella 9. Pen cross-contamination co-efficient 10. Rate of removal of faeces from pen 11. Frequency of cleaning 7.5 Results 7.5.1 Baseline results Within-batch prevalence of lymph-node positive pigs at slaughter age The within-batch prevalence at slaughter age is derived from the prevalence of infection within the batches of pigs being sent to slaughter (on a weekly basis in the large farm and every 22 weeks in the small farm). These batches can be Salmonella negative either because the farm was negative at the time of depopulation, or simply there were no infected pigs within that batch, despite there being infection present on the farm. The results are presented for the four case study MSs (MS1, MS2, MS3, MS4) in Figure 7.10. It is clear most batches being sent to slaughter are either Salmonella -negative (each MS sends a similar proportion of completely Salmonella -negative batches - around 30-40%), or infected at a low prevalence. From Figure 7.10 it is clear that those MSs with a higher national pig prevalence (MS2, MS4) have a larger proportion of highly- infected batches from large farms. The within-batch prevalence in small farms appears to be much lower than for large farms. 7.5.2 Model validation/interrogation Official model validation takes place at the point of slaughter (see Chapter 8). However, we can inspect the dynamics of infection for a range of scenarios/time points and compare them against published literature, to get an insight into how well the model compares against observed data. Source of infection We have investigated the relative importance of source of infection by simply turning off each source of infection within each MS model.

The effect is striking - for MSs with a higher breeding pig herd prevalence (MS2, MS4) switching breeding pig herd prevalence to zero removes the vast majority of infections at depopulation. Conversely, removing feed or external contamination from the model does little to change the national pig prevalence in MS2 and MS4. The reverse trend is true in MSs with low breeding pig herd prevalence (MS1, MS3) as feed contamination seems to be the most important factor for the national pig prevalence in these MSs. This strongly indicates that breeding pig herd prevalence is a strong indicator of national pig prevalence - if a relatively low number of breeding pig herds are positive, national pig prevalence will be relatively lower than in other MSs with more infected breeding pig herds.

It is hard to validate this type of result given the lack of quantitative data on the source of infection for pigs. However, contaminated feed and new pigs were identified as two common sources of infection by numerous other studies (EFSA 2006; Lo Fo Wong and Hald 2000), and there seems to be a correlation between breeding pig herd prevalence and slaughter pig prevalence (by lymph-node samples) comparing the two EFSA baseline surveys (Figure 7.12). Indeed, sampling of herds in several EU countries by Lo Fo Wong & Hald (2000) showed a rough correlation between the proportion of seropositive sows and the proportion of seropositive gilts. This would seem to indicate that an increased number of positive sows leads to increased probability of infection in gilts, which can then go onto infect more farms/pigs. However, a similar correlation between seropositivty of the sow and proportion of positive pen faecal samples was weak at best. Certainly there is evidence to suggest that infection passing from sow to offspring does occur, but equally there is evidence to suggest that the real-life situation is far more complex, with different serotypes colonising pigs depending on stage of production and the individual farm. The latter proliferation of serotypes is something not addressed within the farm model. In summary, we think the breeding pig herd can certainly be considered a significant source, but more research is needed before the strong correlation between breeding pig herd prevalence and slaughter pig prevalence can be validated fully.

Correlation coefficient of 0.457. Pen contamination Pen contamination is highly variable, regardless of production stage (farrowing, weaning, growing or finishing), ranging between 0-109 CFUs within a farrowing pen on a single day, to 0 to 108 CFUs in weaning/growing/finishing. Examples of pen contamination for each stage of production are shown in Figure 7.13a-c. The positive breeding pig herd has a large effect in increasing contamination rates within a pen. This is because sows shed proportionally more Salmonella than slaughter pigs if infected (as they shed more faeces). This means that more pigs are likely to be infected with \"high\" doses (> 10 6 CFUs), and hence these infected slaughter pigs are likely to shed more Salmonella than pigs infected at low doses. Not only are slaughter pigs more likely to shed Salmonella , but relatively more pigs will become infected on positive breeding pig herds than those farms which only have feed and external contamination as a source. These two factors combine to give a much reduced contamination of pens for pigs produced from negative breeding pig herds/sows. Small farms, where the occurrence of high-shedding sow is less likely due to smaller numbers of sows on the farm, produce pens relatively low in contamination, even if the sow is positive. This results in most pens being negative for Salmonella , or contaminated at a much reduced level compared to larger farms (essentially because the tails of the distributions for concentrations in sows, feed and external contamination are not sampled due to small numbers). This lack of \"highly- shedding\" positive pigs results in a distinctly smaller prevalence of infection in pigs on small farms compared to large farms. It is difficult to validate such results from the literature, primarily because enumeration of pen contamination is rarely done, and because the studies that are available are QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

However, contamination levels of between 1.8-550 CFUs per 100cm2 have been isolated from pens in lairage (Boughton et al. 2007). This is within the range commonly estimated by the model for given high shedding rates (which might be assumed for pigs during transport and lairage). Doses ingested Pigs will ingest up to 100g of faeces per day; from the section above contamination of these faeces may be significant. On top of the contamination via shedding by pigs, there is also the dose ingested via feed and/or external contamination (Equation 7.15). A sample of the distribution of doses ingested by pigs, for each production stage, is given in Figure 7.14a-b. Combining all non-zero doses together, it is informative to compare the doses received by pigs against the dose-response model used within the model, see Figure 7.15. The vast majority of doses are zero, even on infected farms, so for clarity only non-zero doses are shown below. If a pig does ingest Salmonella (via either faeces, feed or external contamination) then the dose ingested is more likely to be at the lower end of the dose range. Within this range of doses, from 1-10 7 CFUs/day, infection is, on average, only more likely to occur than not occur for a very small proportion of exposure events (those above 106 CFUs). Hence, even with a heavily contaminated pen (>107 CFUs), it still requires continual exposure over a number of days to produce an epidemic-like transmission curve. This supports the results of Figures 7.10a-c, where the vast majority of batches sent to slaughter are infected at a very low prevalence, because infection within the finishing house is relatively rare given typical contamination rates within finishing pens. 7.5.3 Sensitivity analysis The farm model sensitivity analysis has only been carried out on the large farm model. We have made a distinction between sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis within the risk assessment: hence this sensitivity analysis deals only with those parameters that have a variable distribution associated with them (e.g. Normal, Beta). Analysis of the effect of changing uncertain point value parameters is described in Chapter 12. Given the varying parameter estimation for the different MSs we present a sensitivity analysis plot for each MS farm model in Figure 7.16a-d.

The majority of doses ingested by pigs (from faeces, feed and external contamination) are unlikely to result in infection at the average probability of infection. Note different scales of two y axes. The sensitivity analysis clearly shows that if a MS has a relatively high breeding pig herd prevalence (MS2) then the average load of Salmonella shed by the sows is dominant (to the point where the other parameters make little difference). However, if breeding pig herd prevalence is low (MS1, MS3) then feed and external contamination parameters become relatively much more important, although ultimately the variability associated with the within-batch prevalence is driven by the average load shed by piglets and finishers within the batch. The MS4, with a slightly higher breeding pig herd prevalence, appears to be at the cusp of where the sow load becomes less important than feed. These results make intuitive sense - if there are a large number of sows shedding Salmonella then it becomes much more likely that one or more sows will shed at high enough levels to overcome any maternal immunity piglets have to Salmonella infection. If sows are not a common source of Salmonella on the farm, then feed and other sources of infection will become more important. Highlighting the amount piglets and finishers shed as important parameters also seems intuitive - weaning is a time of mixing within the model, thus if a piglet/s sheds high amounts of Salmonella at this time many pigs can be come infected. A high finishing load will incr ease infection near the point of slaughter, leading to a higher prevalence of infection than what would usually happen as pigs are tending to recover by this time.

Each of these objectives have been met to varying degrees, but ultimately we think met sufficiently to provide enough insight for the EFSA scientific opinion which the risk assessment is designed to inform. The model developed was designed to be generic, such that the model framework could be applied to all EU MSs. The parameterisation of the model then leads to a specific MS model, which has been done in this case for the four case study MSs. The model was developed on the basis of a large literature review, information gained by talking to veterinary/microbiological and pig farming experts, plus a review of relevant transmission models. This review process highlighted the crucial fact that in order to a) differentiate between MSs and b) incorporate all interventions it was going to be necessary to include the pig environment within the farm model. The amount of Salmonella in the environment, to which pigs could be exposed to, is determined by a number of management factors. The factors included in this model were flooring, AIAO vs. continuous production, inside vs. outside production and feed. These were included on the basis that the literature provides evidence for these factors affecting Salmonella risk in individual pigs at the point of slaughter, and that we could model them sufficiently with the resources (time/data) available. We have by no means captured all factors that describe variability in Salmonella risk in individual slaughter pigs between MSs and indeed between farms, and those that are captured are captured only to the extent which the data allows quantitative modelling. For example, we have split most management factors into two distinct, dichotomous options: wet/dry feed, solid/slatted flooring, AIAO/continuous production. However, in reality the options available for each factor are multiple and complex. Feed can be wet or dry, but also home-mixed or produced at a feed mill, pelleted or non-pelleted, acidified or non-acidified (and then acidified at different levels). Flooring can be fully or partially slatted, or concrete or straw bedded. Production can be strictly AIAO by building, or AIAO by compartment, or continuous for one stage but AIAO for the next. All of these different options could potentially affect Salmonella risk. Hence, the results produced must be viewed in conjunction with the simplifying assumptions made. However, we believe this is the first real attempt to model the pig environment in such detail that enables differentiation between farm types. Lurette et al. (2008) model the pig environment as part of their transmission model for Salmonella in pigs, but they do not attempt to differentiate between farm types, and indeed it is not clear what farm type they presume from their parameter estimation. The transmission model is complex not only in the range of farm type it can incorporate, but also in mathematically describing transmission dynamics between pigs. The modelling of the pig environment enables us to quantitatively model the individual response of a pig to a variable daily exposure. Differentiating between farm types is fundamental in differentiating between MSs, and the current management factors included do mean that the results produced for each MS are very different according to their particular parameter estimation. The differences between the MSs are discussed in more QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

However, improvements can always be made, and one obvious example is differentiating between feed types in more detail. The data are available, and potentially support the differentiation between not only wet and dry feed, but also pelleted and non-pelleted feed (O'Connor et al. 2008). Exposure to Salmonella , and the response to Salmonella infection in pigs, is incredibly variable, as evidenced by a wi de range of observational and longitudinal studies (Jensen et al. 2006; Kranker et al. 2003; Lo Fo Wong & Hald 2000; Nollet et al. 2005). We estimate that contamination of the pen can vary between 10-10 9 organisms over short time periods; such large variation in contamination unsurprisingly leads to large variation in the amount of Salmonella ingested by a pig, and subsequently the incidence of Salmonella infection. It is difficult to validate the model at an individual farm level given this wide variation, but broadly speaking we see that the model results are highly variable, which at a very qualitative level is in line with observation (Lo Fo Wong & Hald 2000). The validation of the farm model really takes place at the point of slaughter, where we compare the prevalence of lymph-node positive pigs at a MS level against the prevalence observed through the EFSA slaughter pig baseline results (EFSA 2008a). This is discussed in the next chapter, but some qualitative validation of trends has been done throughout the stages of the farm model. Little evidence of infection has been found in piglets still suckling from their mother, although the evidence is mixed for whether (sero-) positive pigs make the progeny more or less likely to be infected at the point of weaning (Lo Fo Wong & Hald 2000; Nollet et al. 2005). Within these studies there is the indication that infection in piglets could be under-estimated because of a high likelihood of false negatives. The studies referenced were relatively small - there is certainly the probability they simply didn't sample any highly-infected piglet groups because these are relatively rare. However, the broad consensus from these studies is that it is not until weaning (when piglets are faced with the double stresses of being weaned and mixed with other unfamiliar pigs) that a significant proportion of pigs may become infected with Salmonella . Comparing against the model the broad trends are certainly the same as observed previously. Infection in piglets is rare and usually at a low incidence rate. However, the model does sometimes show a highly-infected batch of piglets if the sow is shedding relatively large amounts of Salmonella (over 10 6 CFU/g of faeces). While we do not explicitly model stress/feed change during weaning, we do mix pigs together. The larger amount of Salmonella shed by weaners relative to piglets, and the fact there are more pigs directly exposed to this Salmonella , means that within the model the peak prevalence of infection is usually observed during the weaning period (sometimes in the growing period). There is generally a diminishing prevalence of infection at the point of slaughter. This agrees with most current observational data (Kranker et al. 2003; VLA 2009). If we capture the broad trends observed by observational studies, this does not mean further improvement cannot be made. There are many assumptions made within the farm model, some due to simplifying the complexity of the farm system or transmission dynamics, and some made simply due to a lack of data or evidence to be able to model either proven or anecdotal trends. A list of assumptions and data gaps is presented in Section 7.4.6, which we draw upon to highlight some crucial assumptions.

These are all potentially important factors for Salmonella infection in finishing pigs, but were not included because of the complexity of modelling such factors. Further differentiation between feed types would have been difficult to parameterise, but is certainly important. Clustering of Salmonella in faecal material has been modelled before (Arnold & Cook 2009), but would require a more complex model. The effect of clustering in faeces would be to vary (even more so) the daily exposure of pigs to Salmonella , where some pigs would ingest considerably more organisms, and some considerably less. Over the large number of pigs and timesteps (even within the small farm model) we would hope that the effect of this clustering averages out, but cannot be certain that this is the case. Another artefact of this assumption is that we assume if a pig is shedding f faeces per day and y organisms per gram of faeces, then the total amount of Salmonella shed per day is fy. This is probably an over- estimate as organisms are likely to be clustered and not at a constant concentration across the faeces. In reality, varying growth rate of individual pigs means pigs need to be kept back behind their cohort before reaching the correct weight to be moved into a different stage of production or sent to slaughter. We have not included this because of the difficulty in including any variation in pig group size (computationally pig cohorts are represented as matrices, and matrix manipulation is only possible with identical or compatible matrices). In addition, varying growth rates between farms will mean different ages of pigs being sent to slaughter, which has not been captured in the model, and so may well also alter the stage of infection of pigs. We judged the modelling of transmission dynamics in sows (apart from the shedding of the Salmonella in its faeces) to be unnecessary (despite the reference to it in the EFSA ToRs), primarily because we had good data on the proportion of herds with excreting sows from the EFSA breeding survey. Therefore, we simply assigned the distribution of shedding sows according to the survey results for each MS. A lack of data meant the within-herd prevalence was assumed to be the same within each MS (based on MS2 data), although data from the EFSA baseline survey does suggest that within-herd prevalence varies betweens MSs (and probably herds) varies just as much as the breeding pig herd prevalence does. Important data gaps highlighted by the model development were the (variation in) dose-response of pigs to infection, the movement of faecal material and the amount of Salmonella that might be present in the environment due to feed or other external sources of contamination (rodents, birds etc). However, for all information gathered for this model, the trend was that regardless of the type of data needed, it was unlikely that current observational, experimental, longitudinal or survey data would be sufficient to be confident that all the variability had been accurately captured (e.g. the amount of Salmonella shed by a sow is based on one study that shows high variation between pigs - but did they capture the entire range of variation?). This is especially true when it comes to management data - this is as important, if not more important, than being able to describe Salmonella infection in the pig, as it determines the frequency and magnitude of exposure to Salmonella . Specific examples include categorisation of contract finishing farms - not captured in any of the EFSA surveys - and how individual farmers class AIAO production. Having detailed many of the assumptions and uncertainties of the model, caution must be used when interpreting the results. However, some broad conclusions can be drawn from the current model results, and these are now described. Sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the relative importance of parameters varies according to MS parameter estimation. The main example of this is the QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

In two MSs (MS2 and MS4) this is the foremost or second-most important parameter in describing the variability in the within-batch prevalence. It is no coincidence that these two MSs have relatively high breeding pig herd prevalence (44 and 13% respectively). For the other two MSs, with relatively low breeding pig herd prevalence, then the load shed by the sow is a relatively unimportant factor compared to the load being shed by the piglet, or that within the feed. Further analysis of the model shows the reason for this dichotomy: if the sow is infected and shedding at high levels, then commonly (although not always) this will mean one or more piglets will become infected; when this occurs then the shedding of Salmonella by infected pigs, at the farrowing stage or later, dominates the risk. However, in MS1 and MS3 infection of the sow is relatively rare, and so the infections within the herd are generated by an initial infection of a piglet, weaner etc via either feed or external contamination. The sensitivity analysis also identifies another trend: that once a slaughter pig is infected, the subsequent shedding of Salmonella more than outweighs the contribution of contamination within the environment provided by feed and/or the external environment. In summary - breeding pig herd prevalence is a strong predictor of national pig prevalence, and while only simply modelled, scenario and sensitivity analysis suggest that mixing infected pigs with uninfected pigs at any stage of production will be an important source of infection. Finally, feed becomes an important source of infection once contamination of the environment by sows or other slaughter pigs is reduced to low levels. It is difficult to validate the model result that seeding of infection into slaughter pigs is primarily governed by the status of the breeding pig herd. There is evidence in the literature for and against this conclusion (Berends et al. 1996; Lo Fo Wong & Hald 2000; Nollet et al. 2004), but certainly we have not fully captured the complexity of exposure via myriad sources and myriad serotypes. More (field) research into source of infection is needed to prove/disprove the result of the current model. The comparison of dose-response versus dose ingested (shown in Figure 7.15) is enlightening and explains the dynamics described in the paragraphs above. For the vast majority of the time pigs are exposed to Salmonella levels that are extremely unlikely to cause infection. Therefore it takes large doses to trigger sufficient infection to cause large increases in prevalence. These large doses must come from a peak in pen contamination, which can either come from the shedding by sows or slaughter pigs, feed or external contamination. These peaks come from the tails of the distributions for concentrations of Salmonella in pig faeces, feed, rodent faeces etc, and are therefore only rarely sampled from. This explains the characteristic distribution for within-batch prevalence for each MS, where the majority of batches are either non-infected or have a very low prevalence, as it takes a rare, high- contamination event to cause a high prevalence of infection. Finally, the farm model has been designed to provide the input to the Transport & Lairage model - a random sample of P LN(fr(t')) is taken, but also the paired output of the concentration within an infected pig's faeces at the time of transport to the slaughterhouse. The uncertainty and intervention analysis are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13 respectively.

It has been reported that there are significant increases in the prevalence of pigs infected with Salmonella between the farm and the slaughterhouse (Davies et al. 1999, Berends et al . 1996, Hurd et al. 2002). Berends et al. (1996) report trials that showed up to 20% of uninfected pigs within a batch could become infected during transport and lairage. They also report that 2-6 hours of combined transport and lairage could cause the number of animals excreting Salmonella to more than double. While pigs are only in transport and lairage for a short period of time, research has shown that pigs from low risk herds are at risk of becoming infected with Salmonella when held in contaminated pens (Boes et al. 2001) and Salmonella can be isolated from the faeces of pigs exposed to a contaminated environment for as little as 2 hours (Boughton et al. 2007b, Hurd et al. 2001). During transport it is believed that stress may play an important role, causing an increase in faecal shedding (Gronstal et al. 1974a) and also cause carrier animals to revert to excreting Salmonella in their faeces (Williams & Newell, 1970, Gronstal et al. 1974b). The study by Williams & Newell (1970), while small, showed that even though rectal swabs of pigs on the farm and swabs of the truck were all negative, 6 pigs were found to be excreting Salmonella after a 3 \u00be hours journey and all ten swabs of the truck also tested positive for the same strain (perhaps also suggesting that \"carrier\" pigs are initially shedding Salmonella beneath the limit of detection, hence the negative results from the swabs). Environmental contamination is also an important factor to consider. Many studies have shown Salmonella spp. to be present in trucks used to transport pigs (e.g. Rajowski et al. 1998, Rostagno et al. 2003), even after routine cleaning has been carried out (Mannion et al. 2008, Dorr et al. 2009) . There are also numerous studies that have isolated Salmonella spp. in the lairage (Boughton et al. 2007a , al. 2009 , Rostagno et al. 2003, Swanenburg et al. 2001), where multiple batches of pigs can occupy the same living space in a short period (i.e. one day), with little or no cleaning between batches (expert opinion from MS2 suggests, between batches, the area would be hosed down with water, but thorough cleaning would only be done at the end of the day VLA (2009b)). A study by Rostagno et al. (2003) isolated Salmonella serovars from the caecum and ileo- caecal lymph nodes of pigs that were present in transport and lairage. Gebreyes et al. (2004) isolated serovars of Salmonella from the mesenteric lymph nodes and caecum of pigs that were not found on the farm, but were found in transport or lairage. These studies suggest that the transport and lairage environments should be considered important sources of infection. In most previous pig Salmonella models there has been little development of the transport and lairage stages, with most relying on simple equations to model a proportion change in infection levels between farm and slaughterhouse (e.g. VLA, 2003). However, as already stated, it has been established that pigs can become infected with Salmonella very quickly and certainly in less time than the duration of transport or lairage. Also of concern is the fact that the skin of the pig could become contaminated with Salmonella once loaded into transport or lairage pens. It is therefore likely that there are many components of transport and lairage where interventions could take place to reduce the prevalence of infected pigs or QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

A mathematical model can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of these intervention strategies. These factors are the main driving forces behind this paper, where we propose a more in-depth framework to model the transmission of Salmonella during the transport and lairage of pigs. 8.2 Model Framework 8.2.1 Model overview The Transport & Lairage module is designed to be a generic model for the EU, but in order to be adaptable to any EU country, many parameter estimates will differ between member states (e.g. the proportion of large to small farms, number of pigs slaughtered per day in a slaughterhouse). The model simulates the transmission of infection within batches of pigs, going to a specific slaughterhouse over the course of one day (thus each iteration of the model represents one day). For this model we define a batch to be a group of pigs that occupy the same 'living environment'. In transport this is a truck and in lairage a pen. The model is stochastic, with the parameter values including the variability in the observed data. However, a decision was made not to include uncertainty in the model, the effects of this would be investigated in an uncertainty analysis (Chapter 12). The computational steps included in the model, for pigs from a large farm, are shown in Figure 8.1 Note that the steps for pigs from a small farm are the same except that the pigs go to a small slaughterhouse and so the number of pigs going to the large slaughterhouse, n l, is replaced by the number of pigs going to the small slaughterhouse ns. 8.2.2 Pig selection For each iteration of the model, days worth of pigs to be slaughtered in a \"large\" and \"small\" slaughterhouse are selected, where size relates to the number of pigs slaughtered per day (we define a large slaughterhouse to be one that slaughters more than 100,000 pigs per year). We assume (due to lack of data to the contrary) that pigs from large farms will go to large slaughterhouses and pigs from small farms will go to small slaughterhouses. The model accounts for variation between slaughterhouses. For each iteration the model is first run for the small slaughterhouse (the results of which are inputs to the small slaughterhouse model (see Chapter 9) and then independently for the large slaughterhouse (the results of which are inputs to the large slaughterhouse model (see Chapter 9). The selected slaughterhouse (large or small) is assigned a specified number (or 'capacity') of pigs to be slaughtered (denoted as n l for large slaughterhouse capacity and ns for small slaughterhouse capacity. This number is derived from data from member state slaughterhouse capacities). The model then randomly selects batches of pigs (with the appropriate large to small farm ratio) from the output of the farm module, until the capacity of the slaughterhouse is reached. These batches of pigs then enter the Transport & Lairage model, where the transmission of Salmonella within these batches are modelled on an individual pig basis.

Data and expert opinion collected from member states (EFSA, 2008a, Marier, 2009) suggest that it is very rare for a truck to pick up pigs from multiple farms in one journey (for the small farms, expert opinion suggested that many would transport their own pigs to slaughter), the main exception being if two farms are owned by the same producer. Thus, for simplicity, we make the assumption in the model that trucks only pick up pigs from one farm. The effect of trucks picking up pigs from multiple farms is investigated as a scenario analysis (Chapter 13).

There are three main types of truck. The first is that it is just an empty space, with no divisions. In this case the whole batch of pigs would be in the same living space for the whole journey, and thus would be able to have direct contact with each other. In the second type, the truck is segregated into a number of 'pens', each containing a sub-set of the batch. The third type is a 'layered' truck, with multiple 'decks' and each deck housing a certain number of pigs. We assume that transport time is sufficiently short so that there will not be sufficient opportunity for between-pen cross-contamination. The differences between transport types are therefore negligible and each pen with N p(j,i) pigs can be treated as a closed population. General practice is for all pigs that are to be transported from a farm to be mixed together prior to loading, suggesting that any division of pigs on the farm would not necessarily carry through to transport. Therefore, in the model, the pigs in the batch are randomly 'shuffled' to account for mixing and then loaded onto the truck in this random order, (filling up the 'pens' and/or 'decks'). 8.2.4 Lairage framework The Lairage model simulates the transmission of Salmonella over the course of one day. Pigs that arrive late in the day may be held overnight, and slaughtered early the next day. To model this we assume that LO number of lairage pens will house pigs overnight. Therefore, the first batches of pigs (as many as are needed to fill LO pens) to arrive at lairage are considered to be housed overnight. This will affect the conditions of these pens and batches (e.g. a longer duration of stay in lairage, different effect of cleaning). We assume that the trucks arrive at the slaughterhouse over the course of the day during which time pigs that have arrived earlier will vacate the lairage pens to enter the processing stages. Pigs that arrive later in the day will enter the pens vacated by pigs that have gone to be slaughtered. We assume that during this short turnover the empty pen may undergo some cleaning (simple hosing down with water), but more thorough cleaning (such as use of disinfectant) will only be done at the end of the day (but not in the pens which contain pigs to be housed overnight). 8.3 Transmission of Infection during Transport & Lairage 8.3.1 Initial conditions - carryover When pigs enter transport or lairage pens there is the possibility that these pens may be contaminated with Salmonella and/or faeces. We define this contamination as 'carryover' as it is what remains in the environment from pigs that have previously occupied the pen, but before the new batch of pigs enters. For each truck and lairage pen, the model determines whether or not contamination has been carried over from the previous batch of pigs and if it has been carried over, the quantity is determined. We define the amount of faeces (g) left in pen j, after cleaning as )(,j FH carry and the amount of Salmonella (cfu) left in pen j, after cleaning as )(,j EH carry (where H={T,L}, to denote transport and lairage respectively).

How many were there? Were they infected with Salmonella ? Was the environment contaminated?). We estimate )(,j FT carry and )(,j ET carry from studies that record the frequency and degree of contamination of trucks before the pigs are loaded. Assuming independence between trucks ( )( )j F U j p B j FTransMaxFaecCarryT T carry ), ,1( *), 1,1( )(, =, (8.19) where FaecCarryTp is the probability that the truck has been successfully cleaned and all faecal contamination has been removed and TransMaxF is the maximum amount of faeces carried over (note { FaecCarryTp ,1- FaecCarryTp }, so if there is cleaning 0)(,=j FT carry ). Similarly ( )( )j E U j p B j ETransMaxEnvCarryT T carry ), ,1( *), 1,1( )(, =, (8.20) where EnvCarryTp is the probability that the truck has been cleaned and TransMaxE is the maximum amount of Salmonella present in the truck when pigs enter Lairage Lairage is modelled throughout the day and thus the model provides an estimate of the prior history of the pens when new pigs are placed in them.

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 136We must also take account of the fact that the type of cleaning employed at the end of the day is also often more rigorous and so the proportion reduction in cleaning is considered to be more effective (FSA, 2006) 8.3.2 Transmission of infection During transport and lairage, we assume that a pig can be in one of two states at any time: susceptible (0) or infected (1). Thus, during transport, the infection status of pig k, in pen j of truck i is denoted by ()ijkT ,, where(){}1,0 ,, ijkT . During lairage the infection status of pig k, in pen j from truck i is denoted by ()ijkL ,, . We define the variables SH(j) and IH(j) to be the total number of susceptible and infected pigs respectively, from pen j after stage H. As in the farm model (Chapter 7) we define the infected state to mean that a pig is infected in the ileo-caecal lymph-node and will intermittently excrete Salmonella in the faeces, of varying concentrations ranging from 0 to 7 log cfu/g, as suggested by Jensen et al., (2006). During transport and lairage there are events that can cause either a change of state (e.g. susceptible pigs becoming infected) or a change in the concentration of Salmonella excreted by infected pigs. Increased shedding of infected animals due to transport stress During transport it has been observed that the prevalence of shedding will increase (Davies et al. 1999, Berends et al. 1996, Hurd et al. 2002). There are many possible causes for this, but one of the most important is thought to be stress during transport (Berends et al, 1996), this includes stress caused prior to transport when pigs may be held in lairage overnight or mixed with unfamiliar pigs. To account for the effect of stress we assume that there is a fixed probability, p rex, that lymph-node positive pigs will become stressed during transport (note, there is little evidence to suggest that stress is such an important factor during lairage and in fact longer lairage times are beneficial in reducing the previous stress of transport (Warris et al. 1998)). A US study (Callaway et al., 2006) looked at the effect of mixing (social) stress on populations of Salmonella Typhimurium in segregated early weaning pigs. After 5 days they found that the incidence of faecal Salmonella shedding was higher in mixed contact pigs. They concluded that social stress of weaned pigs may increase susceptibility to and/or faecal shedding of Salmonella . This study is not directly related to transport stress, but it does suggest the effect that stress will have on pigs infected with Salmonella. Therefore, in the absence of other relevant data, we assume that the concentration of Salmonella excreted in their faeces in stressed pigs will be increased. To model this, we change the distribution for concentration of Salmonella excreted in the faeces, so that higher concentrations are more likely and consequently, under stress, more infected pigs will be excreting Salmonella . There is little data to determine exactly how we should change this distribution. As discussed in the Chapter 7, there is an observable difference in excretion levels between pigs infected with a low dose of Salmonella and those infected with a high dose (Jensen et al., 2006). Given the lack of data, we assume that the effect of stress is equivalent to the difference between excretion levels of low dose and high dose pigs. Thus if a pig becomes stressed during transport, the amount of Salmonella they shed is increased by between 1-3 log cfu/g (determined by a random sample from a U(1,3) distribution), but with a maximum of 6 log cfu/g (so a pig that was already shedding 5 log cfu/g would not increase to any more than 6 log cfu/g)).

Riches et al. , 1996 reported a mean stocking density of 239 kg/m2 for full truck loads in winter (standard deviation of 38). This high stocking density means that there is a high risk of exposure to Salmonella contaminated faeces. This risk is further heightened by the likelihood of carry over from previous batches of pigs, as while trucks may be cleaned between journeys it is reported that this cleaning will not remove all of the Salmonella from a contaminated vehicle (e.g. Mannion et al. 2008, Rajkowski et al. 1998). However, different methods of cleaning have different effects (Small et al. 2007). The way in which we model environmental infection is shown in Figure 8.2. This framework is applicable to both transport and lairage, but the parameter estimates will differ. We determine how much Salmonella each pig will ingest and use the dose- response relationship derived for the farm model (Chapter 7) to determine whether or not it becomes infected. We estimate the amount of Salmonella ingested by calculating the amount of faeces ingested and the concentration of Salmonella in the faeces. To do this we use the methodology adopted in the farm model (Chapter 7). As for the farm model, we assume that Salmonella and faeces will be homogenously spread throughout the pen (cleaning and movement of pigs in a confined space is likely to spread Salmonella over the whole pen (VLA, 2009b).

(8.29) Having determined the ingested dose we then use the beta-binomial dose-response model, used for finishing pigs in the farm model (Chapter 7), to determine if any susceptible pigs become infected during their stay in the pen. 8.3.3 Skin contamination When pigs enter the slaughter process, the characteristic of interest changes from the infection status to the proportion and load of contaminated hides and guts. Slaughter pigs that carry Salmonella in their gut are known to be a considerable risk for contamination of the carcass, and consequently the meat product (Berends et al. 1997; Botteldoorn et al. 2003). There is a lack of data concerning the prevalence of contaminated hides immediately after lairage. There are many studies that report the prevalence of carcass contamination during the slaughterhouse process (e.g. EFSA 2008b), but very few actually record the prevalence at the start of processing (i.e. immediately post-lairage). Within groups of slaughter pigs, there is a correlation between the proportion of animals carrying Salmonella in the faeces and the proportion of contaminated carcasses. Data from a study by Davies et al. 1999 shows the results of samples taken from pigs during eight visits to one slaughterhouse (with a total of 2,205 samples). Isolations from the large intestine and the carcass are recorded. We assume that the large intestine results represent the number of infected animals and the carcass swabs the number of contaminated carcasses. We then calculate the ratio of these values, R CONTAM . The proportion change between infected pigs and contaminated carcasses, CARCASSF , is derived by fitting an empirical distribution to the values of RCONTAM (see Figure 8.3), where if CARCASSF <1 there are more infected pigs than contaminated carcass and if CARCASSF >1 there are more contaminated carcasses than infected pigs. The number of pigs from each visit with positive caecal contents is assumed to be the sum of pigs from the infected class from the end of the lairage, IL(j). The mean proportion change from these data is 0.62 with a standard deviation of 0.31 and a 95% confidence interval of [0.41-0.84].

(8.30) 8.3.4 Number of Salmonella on the skin There is very little information on Salmonella counts on hides at the slaughterhouse as most studies look at total aerobic count (TAC) or enterobacteriacae counts. However, data from Davies, 1999 show that post-bleed (which we assume to be equivalent to the end of lairage as the bleeding stage is not modelled in this risk assessment) the mean log Salmonella score per 0.1m2 carcass is 1.9, with a maximum of 3. On this scale a score of 0 relates to 0 organisms, 1 relates to 1-10 organisms, 2 to 10-102 organisms and 3 to 102 - 103 organisms. This mean score is obtained from 10 contaminated carcasses. To achieve a mean score of 1.9 from 10 observations, we estimate that 30% of contaminated carcasses had score 1, 50% had score 2 and 20% had score 3. Therefore, the likely score of a contaminated carcass is ascertained as shown in Table 8.1.

(8.32) 8.3.5 Differences between small/large farms and small/large slaughterhouses Little data exist to describe small farm transport within any of the case study MSs. Expert opinion resulted in contradictory approaches (e.g. whether a haulier would stop at multiple farms or not), suggesting that knowledge of this area is limited. Given that small farmers are unlikely to be able to change their transport methods as a viable Salmonella intervention we do not consider that there will be any differences in the modelling of transport between small/large farms and slaughterhouses other than the number of pigs being transported. Similarly, we consider there to be little difference in the modelling of the lairage setup. The capacity and number of pens will differ for a small slaughterhouse, but these are parameter inputs rather than modelling assumptions. 8.3.6 Output to Slaughter & Processing module The outputs of the Transport & Lairage module relevant to the Slaughter & Processing module are Total number of pigs to go through the slaughter line of the large slaughterhouse, n l and small slaughterhouse, n s.

Where applicable, the different MS estimates are given. The Transport & Lairage module parameters can be divided into two distinct categories: parameters governing the management and logistics of transport and lairage, and those governing the transmission of Salmonella between pigs during these stages.

We assume that each batch of pigs uses a different truck. Data from the Animal Movements Licensing scheme (AMLS, 2008) shows the number of pigs per animal movement, from an agricultural holding to a slaughterhouse, in MS2. These data show that there is rarely, if ever, more than one movement record per day for a given farm. Thus we assume that multiple trucks are not used to transport one batch of pigs. There was no data available to confirm if this would be different for other member states. A MS2 study (Guise et al. 1996) found that the number of pigs per pen in trucks varied between 12 and 16 for single deck trucks and on one sampled double-deck truck there were 19 pigs per pen. There was no data available to confirm if this would be different for other member states. Probability of transport stress , prex No data are available to estimate this parameter from published data. Expert opinion (Cook, 2008, Davies, 2008) suggests that pigs would revert to shedding from a carrier status (defined as infected but not excreting Salmonella ) around 10% of the time. We assume the carrier status is analogous to the infected animals in the current model that are either not shedding Salmonella or shedding at a low-level (<2 log cfu/g) and that the increase in shedding observed during transport is simply these low-level shedders excreting enough to test positive again (appearing as carriers reverting to excretion). As stress during transport is assumed to increase this rate, and in the absence of any other data, we double this estimate to p rex= 20%. Probability of environmental carry over in truck, pT EnvCarry To estimate this parameter we combine data from two studies (Mannion et al. 2008, VLA, 2009a) that sampled trucks before pigs were loaded. Mannion et al. 2008 took samples from 9 trucks pre-loading and found Salmonella in 3 of them. VLA, 2009a sampled 9 trucks and found Salmonella in 2 of them. Combining these gives us sTE=5 out of nTE=18 trucks testing positive for Salmonella . Thus, the probability of a truck being contaminated with Salmonella prior to the loading of the pigs, pT EnvCarry is estimated by TETEEnvCarryT nsp= Probability of faecal carry over in truck, pT FaecCarry The study by Mannion et al. 2008 reported that sTF= 1 truck out of nTF= 9 was visually contaminated on arrival at the farm.

At the lairage 54 out of 97 samples tested positive. From this we can estimate that the probability of contamination before loading is pF =0.1111 and the probability after is pA= 0.5556. Thus we estimate that the effectiveness of cleaning is (p A-pF)/ p A=(0.5556-0.1111)/0.5556 = 0.8 and so there is an 80% reduction in contamination due to cleaning. The way this study was set up, the trucks were sampled at the farm first and at the lairage last. If the study recorded data from a truck at lairage first and then from the same truck on arrival at the farm, we could use this matched individual truck data to get an estimate of effectiveness of cleaning. However, these type of data were not available. Maximum amount of faeces, FTransMax , and Salmonella , ETransMax , in truck before pigs enter If faeces carry over is determined to occur ( pT EnvCarry ) then the amount of faeces carried over is determined from a uniform distribution with a maximum of FTransMax = 990g (based on data from Serrano-garcia, 2008). If Salmonella carry over is determined to occur ( pT EnvCarry ) then the amount carried over is determined from a uniform distribution with a maximum of ETransMax =0.11 cfu/g (based on data from Mannion et al. , 2008). 8.4.3 Parameters relating to Salmonella infection Amount of faeces excreted, ),(jkf To calculate the amount of faeces shed we estimate the number of defecations while in the pen and the amount of faeces excreted in each defecation. Data from Aarnik et al. 2005 records the number of times pigs excrete per day by weight class. As we are modelling finishing pigs we use the 105kg weight class (the largest weight), which were found to excrete an average 3.1 times per day. Data collected for the farm module (Chapter 7) suggests that the amount of faeces shed by a finisher pig per day has a mean of 2580g and a standard deviation of 50g. We fit a gamma distribution to these values (as the amount of faeces shed per day can not be negative). To determine the amount shed by a particular pig, k, in pen j, per excretion, ),(jkf , we sample from this distribution for each individual pig and then divide the answer by 3.1 (the average number of times finisher pigs excrete per day). 1.3),(,502580,502580 ),(22 2 =jk jkf To estimate the probability of an excretion per hour we divide 3.1 by the number of hours a day a pig is active (and thus able to excrete). We assume this to be 12 hours and so estimate the probability of an excretion per hour to be DP= 3.1/12=0.2583. Probability of environmental carry over in lairage , pL EnvCarry To estimate this parameter we combine data from 2 studies (Boughton et al. 2008, VLA, 2009a). Boughton et al. 2007 took 120 samples over 2 days from lairage and 33 tested positive for Salmonella. VLA, 2009a took 90 samples and isolated Salmonella from 49. Combining these, and therefore assuming that the studies are equivalent, gives us sLE=82 out of nLE=210 pens testing positive for Salmonella .

Thus we assume that PL clean=0.25. As before, we assume that this applies to both large and small slaughterhouses. Effectiveness of cleaning in lairage, E L There are many different types of cleaning that could be implemented to clean out lairage pens (e.g. pressure washing, steam washing, use of sanitiser). Qualitative data from the UK (FSA, 2006 suggests that most premises use pressure washing or steam-cleaning. A paper by Small et al. 2007 shows results of a laboratory study on the log reduction of Escherichia coli (E.coli ) counts using different cleaning methods on either a visually clean or visually dirty concrete slab. Log10 reductions were recorded immediately after cleaning and again one hour after. We assume that the immediate reduction is applicable to cleaning out between batches of pigs during the day and the reduction after an hour is applicable to overnight cleaning. The study found that pressure washing gave an immediate 2.5 log10 reduction (standard deviation 0.7) on a visually dirty slab. One hour after cleaning the overall reduction was 4.1 (standard deviation 1.7). For steam cleaning there was an immediate 0.9 log10 reduction (standard deviation 0.7). After one hour there was a 1.7 log10 reduction (standard deviation of 1.6). Reductions are also given for mains pressure water, sanitizer, steam, mains pressure followed by steam and pressure wash followed by steam. The sanitizer showed the largest reduction (4.5 standard deviation of 0.9). We assume that all premises will use either pressure washing or steam cleaning with equal probability and estimate the log reduction in contamination due to cleaning during the day: ( ) () > < =y j j NjLE (8.34) where y is a random number generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. With appropriate data on frequency of use of other cleaning practices we can incorporate all types of cleaning. Note that this estimation assumes that reduction in E.coli counts is equivalent to reduction in Salmonella counts. It may be useful to conduct experiments to determine the relationship between reduction in counts of E.coli and Salmonella so that an appropriate conversion factor could be used if appropriate (e.g. derive a relationship to say that a 1 log reduction in E.coli is equivalent to a x log reduction in Salmonella ).

A study by Boughton et al. (2007a) found an average of between 1.8-11.5 MPN/cm2 Salmonella in lairage pens. 8.4.4 Parameter estimation - MS2 Duration of transport, T(i) The duration of transport is estimated by fitting an empirical distribution to data from AMLS, 2005 (see Figure 8.20). These data contained the duration, in minutes, of transport times for 14,088 movement records from agricultural holdings to slaughterhouses during 2005. The mean duration time was 60.71 minutes with 5th and 95th percentiles of 6 and 204 minutes. Figure 8.4: Plot of MS2 transport duration times and empirical cumulative distribution function for duration of transport time (minutes). Lairage throughput , nl, ns The lairage capacities for large, n l, and small, n s, slaughterhouses are discussed in the Slaughter & Processing module (Chapter 9). Number of pigs in pen in lairage, Lpencap Data from Defra, 2004 reported that group sizes were generally between 21-60 pigs in 12 MS2 slaughterhouses. For simplicity and ease of calculation purposes we assume a group size of 50 pigs (as lairage capacity is variable we wish to avoid the cases where we would get a large number of pigs in lairage coupled with a small number of pigs in a group).

Data from FSA, 2006 records the number of pens that house pigs overnight on specific days. They found that the number of pens housing pigs were [0, 1, 2], with probabilities p overnight =[0.2, 0.7, 0.1]. Thus each iteration of the model we determine the number of overnight pens from these probabilities using the multinomial distribution, Novernight =(Mn(L pens, povernight )), where number of lairage pens in the slaughterhouse, which is derived by dividing the slaughterhouse capacity by the pen size (n l/Lpencap). The FSA, 2006 study also provided data for the mean time that pigs are kept in lairage when held overnight, was 15.3 hours, with a range of 10-20 hours. From this we assume a standard deviation of 2 and thus we estimate the parameters of a gamma ( (,)) distribution as =15.3/2 2 and =15.32/22. Therefore, we estimate that ()() 52.58,83.3=TimeNightL . If pigs are not kept overnight then the study found that the mean time was 2.8 hours with a range of 0-6 hours. From this we can assume a standard deviation of 1, and thus we estimate the parameters of a (,) distribution as =2.8/1 and =2.8^2/1. Therefore, LTimeDay =()( )84.7,8.2 . (N.B. we use a gamma distribution to avoid negative duration times). Using this distribution 99.47% of duration times are less than 6 hours. Lairage capacity, Lcap As part of a larger study Defra, 2004 conducted 12 visits to pig slaughterhouses. This study confirms that the lairage capacity is often smaller than the throughput of animals per day. Among the larger slaughterhouses (>2000 pigs per day) lairage capacity could be as small as 22% of throughput. We estimate the capacity of lairage as a proportion of the throughput of pigs for the day. Data from Defra, 2004, recorded the throughput of pigs on the sampling day and the lairage capacity of 12 pig slaughterhouses. From these data we estimate that the lairage capacity of the larger slaughterhouses (throughput >1000 pigs per day) is generally between 20 and 70% of the throughput of pigs. Therefore, we assume the lairage capacity to be uniformly distributed between 0.2 and 0.7. A general study on cattle, sheep and pig lairages found that up to 25 groups of animals could pass through each holding pen in one day (FSA, 2006, pg65). However, they report that the mode was 2 groups. The throughput of the smaller slaughterhouses (<1000 pigs per day) generally seemed not to exceed the lairage capacity. Thus, we assume that the lairage of a small slaughterhouse is sufficient to hold all pigs for the day. Stocking density, Lstock Data from a lairage study (Defra, 2004) found that the stocking rates of pigs (m2 per animal) ranged from 0.42-0.83. Thus, we assume that the stocking rates follow a U(0.42,0.83) distribution.

Using this information we can fit beta pert (BP) distributions to these data (see Appendix 8.1 for fitting method). The estimates are shown in Table 8.5.

Using this information we can fit beta pert distributions to these data (see Appendix 8.1, for fitting method). The estimates are shown in Table 8.6. Data was not available for every parameter. In the absence of such data we use the UK data. If further data for MS3 becomes available in the future the appropriate parameter estimates can be added to the model. 8.4.7 Parameter estimation - MS4 There was no transport or lairage data available for MS4. Therefore we use the UK data as a proxy, because the data available for the parameter estimation is deemed to be of the best quality and thus the parameter estimation could be considered to be more accurate. If data for MS4 becomes available in the future the appropriate parameter estimates can be added to the model.

It was not possible to explicitly model the change in skin contamination during the Transport & Lairage phases as there was simply not enough data that would have allowed us to accurately estimate this. In order to model this quantitative data would be needed at transport and lairage on contact rates of pigs with surfaces, faeces and other pigs as well as transfer rates of faeces from surfaces to skin (how much is transferred and how often). Prevalence of skin contamination at the start of the slaughter line. This estimate is based on only a small study as most studies that report the prevalence of carcass contamination do so at a stage further down the slaughter line (e.g. evisceration). These studies are not a reliable estimate for the prevalence at the beginning of the slaughter line as most processes during slaughter will increase or decrease the prevalence. Indeed this is one of the main effects modelled in the slaughter model. Therefore a reliable estimate of the prevalence at the start of the slaughter line is very important. Concentration of Salmonella on hides at the start of the slaughter line . Similar to the prevalence, this parameter is also based on a small study and therefore further studies to quantify this parameter would be useful. This parameter is equally as important as the prevalence as higher concentrations on contaminated hides will likely lead to high concentrations in products and thus higher risks of illness. Amount of Salmonella carried over. While there is reasonable data on whether Salmonella was isolated from a pen/truck before pigs enter it, the data on how much is present is limited.

Similar to the Salmonella carry over, there is little data on exactly how much faeces is likely to be present in a pen before pigs enter. Probability of pigs being stressed and the effect of stress on the pigs. While it is well established that pigs get stressed during transport, there is little or no quantitative data on how likely it is that a pig will become stressed. There is also little quantitative data available on what effect stress will have on the pig, in relation to transmission of Salmonella . 8.6 Major assumptions The following assumptions were included in the Transport & Lairage model. Pigs from small farms go to small slaughterhouses and pigs from large farms go to large slaughterhouses (due to lack of data) Trucks do not pick up pigs from multiple farms (expert opinion suggests this is generally the case and further modelling assumptions would be needed to implement multiple farm pickups) Pigs in the batch are allowed to mix during loading. When data for a model parameter for a particular member could not be obtained data from another member state was used. The author used his best guess as to which data would be most appropriate (based on quality of data and similarity of member states). Cross-contamination of faeces and Salmonella between pens will not occur due to the relatively short time pigs spend in transport and lairage pens. The amount of Salmonella shed in faeces will be increased by 1-3 log10 cfu/g if the infected pig becomes stressed during transport. Farm model dose response relationship assumed applicable to both transport and lairage Homogenous mixing of Salmonella within faeces, within a pen. E.coli is an adequate surrogate organism for Salmonella, for modelling reduction in microbial load due to cleaning in lairage. 8.7 Results To show results from the Transport & Lairage model we define the total number of pigs in a batch N SL(j) and the number of excreting pigs in a batch, ISL(j) and the prevalence of excretion (i.e. lymph node positive) , )()()( j NjIj ISLSL prev= Figure 8.5 to Figure 8.8 show the results of the batch prevalence of lymph node positive pigs at different stages of transport and lairage for the four case study member states. It can be seen that there is an increase in the number of lymph node positive pigs after both transport and lairage for all member states.

It can be seen that MS2 has the highest prevalence at each stage, with an average prevalence of 20% at the end of lairage. MS3 has the lowest prevalence of 0.67%, with MS1 1% and MS4 3.5%. It can be seen that for every member state the average prevalence increases between transport and lairage. The 5 th and 95th percentiles show that there is a large degree of variation between days, with the average prevalence for some days reaching almost 20% for MS4 and 50% for MS2. It can be seen that the distributions are skewed for all MSs with the mean much closer to the 5th percentile than the 95th. This shows that it is a rare occurrence that you get the batches with particularly high prevalence (i.e. close to the 95th percentile). Table 8.7: Mean, 5th and 95th percentiles of lymph node positive batch prevalence before transport, after transport and after lairage for each member state. Mean, (5th, 95thpercentiles) of prevalence (%) Member state Before transport After transport After lairage MS1 0.43 (0.35, 1.46) 0.62 (0.5, 2) 1 (0.8, 3.7) MS2 16.5 (13.4, 45.5) 17.6 (13.5, 47.8) 20 (15.1, 0.33 (0.32, 1.4) 0.67 (0.64, 2.82) MS4 2.35 (2.35, 13) 2.69 (2.69, 14.1) 3.53 (3.53, 17.5) 8.8 Validation We can validate the results of the model at this stage by comparing the average lymph-node positive prevalence at the end of lairage for each member state with the lymph-node positive prevalences given in the EFSA slaughter pig baseline survey (EFSA, 2008b). This is done in Table 8.16, where it can be seen that the results match the EFSA survey quite well, particularly for MS1, MS2 and MS4. The model seems to underestimate the lymph-node positive prevalence for MS3 as it predicts a lower average prevalence than MS1 (while the EFSA baseline results are higher) and the predicted prevalence is also quite a bit lower than the 5 th percentile of the baseline prevalence for MS3 (3.7%), although still only one order of magnitude out. Investigation of the model suggests that this discrepancy likely comes from the model not capturing a specific aspect of PO at the farm, as the prevalence at the end of the farm stage is lower than that of MS1. This could be due to MS3 having a much larger proportion of small farms than other member states. We should note that the EFSA baseline results are from tests done part way through the slaughter line, rather than immediately after lairage. However, given that the pigs are killed almost immediately after leaving lairage, it is reasonable to assume that the change in lymph-node positive prevalence will be negligible. 8.9 Sensitivity Analysis The sensitivity analysis methodology is described in Chapter 5. For the Transport & Lairage module we conduct two sensitivity analyses, one for transport and one for lairage. For the transport sensitivity analysis we use the lymph-node positive prevalence at the end of transport as the response variable and for the lairage sensitivity analysis we use the lymph-node positive prevalence at the end of lairage as the response variable (note that due to this choice it does not make sense to include parameters that relate to skin contamination in this analysis, as this is effectively just an input to the slaughterhouse model).

Note that we plot the F value, so that the bigger the bar the more significant the variation in the parameter is on the lymph-node positive prevalence at the end of transport (although factors with bars of similar height should be considered equally significant). From these graphs it is clear that stress is the most important factor in our model. Stocking density is also relatively important for MS1, MS3 and MS4. Note that the initial batch prevalence is not included as a factor as it is not a parameter input of the model, rather an output of the Farm module. However if it is included it is by far the most important factor. This suggests that the within batch prevalence is more influential on the lymph-node positive batch prevalence at the end of slaughter that the distributions used in the transport module. Figure 8.13 to Figure 8.16 show the results for the lairage sensitivity analysis. Interestingly the significance of the parameters differ between member states. For MS1 and MS4 it is the number of pigs kept overnight that is most important while for MS3 and MS2 it is the load of Salmonella carried over in the pens between batches. It is clear that many of the parameters have similar significance on the prevalence at the end of lairage and that it is not just one parameter that overwhelms everything else (as stress seems to during transport). Again we do not include the batch prevalence at the beginning of lairage as a parameter. When it is included it is much more significant than the other parameter, as the farm prevalence is in transport, thus again suggesting that the within batch prevalence is highly influential. 8.10 Discussion The Transport & Lairage module has been developed to incorporate factors that are thought to influence the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter-age pigs, including stress during transport, contamination of the environment and cleaning of the environment. These factors were included with the aim of assessing the effect of various interventions implemented at the transport and lairage stages.

The average batch prevalence for each of the four member states compares favourably with the findings of the EFSA slaughter pig baseline survey (EFSA, 2008b), albeit with a few deviations (particularly the lower prevalence for MS3 predicted by the model) suggesting, as would be expected, that the model does not capture all the factors associated with Salmonella transmission and prevalence. Part of the reason for this may be data gaps associated with some of the parameters. Sometimes this is a lack of adequate quantitative data across all MSs (such as estimating the skin contamination at the start of the slaughter line and the effect stress). In other cases we have good data for some MSs and not others (e.g. the effect of cleaning of lairage, proportion of pigs kept overnight in lairage) so it was necessary to estimate the value based on data from another MS. However, it could well be due to issues at the farm level, it has been shown that the within batch prevalence before transport is more influential than any of the parameter distributions within the Transport & Lairage module. Perhaps the most important data gap in the Transport & Lairage module is the effect of stress during transport, as well being a significant data gap, the sensitivity analysis suggests that it the most important factor in relation to lymph-node prevalence at the end of transport. There is little quantitative data on stress so expert opinion had to be used to estimate the proportion pigs that become stressed. On top of this, the effect that stress has in relation to Salmonella is not clear. We have assumed that it will results in a 1-3 log10 cfu/g increase in the amount of Salmonella shed in the faeces of lymph-node positive pigs, but this is not a published result. These parameters are included in the uncertainty analysis to ascertain their influence on the risk of illness. It should be noted that while the effects described above are significant within the Transport & Lairage module, they actually have little effect on the risk of illness. This is highlighted by the logistic slaughter and cleaning of lairage interventions (see Chapter 13) which demonstrated a very low to negligible effect on the risk of illness. While it is clear that the conditions in lairage can have a significant effect on the prevalence of skin contamination at the start of the slaughter line, the intervention analysis suggests that this is of lesser importance to the effect that the various slaughter processes have (e.g. the increase in contamination at de-hairing and the decrease at singeing). This analysis suggests that intervention measures should focus on reducing on farm prevalence or carcass contamination in the slaughterhouse.

In some case we have to rely on expert opinion. In these cases the aim is to obtain a minimum ( a), maximum ( b) and most likely ( m) value for the parameter. With this information we can fit a beta pert distribution on the interval [a, b]. To do this we first need to estimate the mean and variance and then the corresponding shape and scale parameters ( and ). The formulas required are shown in Table A8.9.

We cover the route from slaughter pigs departing from lairage to half-carcasses which are the input to the next module: \"Preparation & Consumption\". Our model is built using the MPRM (Modular Process Risk Model) paradigm (Nauta 2008). The defining feature of an MPRM is splitting the model into several modules. These modules are sub-models in themselves and represent a well defined part of the real-world problem. In each module one or more of the basic microbiological processes of inactivation, growth, partitioning, mixing, removal and cross- contamination are modelled. The final model is obtained by chaining the modules, passing information from one module to the next. Section 9.2 starts off with an overview of the type of models used to model the Slaughterhouse. We then continue by discussing each phase within the slaughterhouse in detail. For each phase, first a model is established, paying special attention to the justification of simplifications and modelling choices. This leads to a detailed mathematical definition of the processes. Next, technical implementation or mathematical solving steps will be discussed in a separate section, which may be skipped by the reader. Finally, the sources for the parameter values will be given. Results for the large slaughterhouse are presented in Section 9.4 The small slaughterhouse is discussed in Section 9.6, in the same vein as the description in Section 9.2, results are presented in Section 9.7. The next step is development of a model for the cutting plant, where half-carcasses are cut into smaller parts and processed into meat products. This is presented in Section 9.8. Section 9.3 deals with 'house flora', the persistent strains of Salmonella present throughout the slaughterhouse. We discuss the main sources and the modelling thereof. We conclude with a discussion of the model and the results obtained. Also, we point to data gaps, which are the main obstacle in the accurate representation of the slaughter process.

In contrast to the small slaughterhouse, the process is automated to a large extent. Conceptually, the slaughterhouse consists of a line of carcasses which are subjected to several processing stages. We assume a single slaughterline per slaughterhouse. At each stage several relevant processes may increase or decrease the Salmonella concentration on the carcass. At the start of the slaughterhouse procedure, live pigs enter the facility. The exterior of those pigs may be polluted with faeces or dirt containing Salmonella . If Salmonella is present on the exterior, we say that the pig is contaminated. The number of colony forming units (cfu) of Salmonella per contaminated pig is an input parameter for the Slaughterhouse model, coming from the Transport & Lairage model. Apart from being contaminated, the pig may be infected, meaning that Salmonella is present in the intestines of the animal. The number of Salmonella in the intestines is also an input parameter to our model. Pigs are delivered to the slaughterhouse in batches originating from a single farm, where they may be split up into smaller sub-batches during lairage, depending on the size of the batch and the capacity of the pens in lairage (there is no mixing of pigs from different batches). The slaughterhouse processes a number of batches per day and we consider entire batches only. An important term in this context is prevalence. In this model we can speak of the prevalence of infected or contaminated pigs in a batch, but also of the prevalence of infected batches. Note that pigs with zero Salmonella are treated in the same way as positive pigs. It is not possible to single out only positive pigs for simulation, due to cross-contamination between pigs. The final output of the slaughterhouse model is the level of contamination per half- carcass, for a large number of half-carcasses, presented in the form of distributions. Also the percentage of contaminated half-carcasses (prevalence) is calculated from this and separately presented. 9.2.2 General slaughterhouse parameters This section lists some general parameters that are not specific to any stage in the process. We start with the percentage of slaughterhouses that are large and the capacities of small and large slaughterhouses. Using the same criterion as adopted in the cluster analysis, we define a slaughterhouse to be 'large' if it slaughters over 100,000 pigs per year. The data used is the same data as used for the cluster analysis (Chapter 6). We assumed 250 working days per year, for conversion from years to days, thus a large slaughterhouse slaughters over 400 pigs per day. As an upper limit we set 5000 pigs per day. For the small slaughterhouse we set a minimum of one pig per day. Table 9.1 summarises the percentages and capacities. Compare those numbers to some other data collected (Appendix 9.1) and note the numbers seem to be in the same order of magnitude.

See the main text for sources. MS Fraction Large Number of pigs Slaughtered per day Capacity Large (per slaughterhouse, per day) Capacity Small (Per slaughterhouse, 22500 As an alternative, we also calculate the number of pigs slaughtered per day, from the annual slaughter volume (Table A9.34) and the carcass weight (Table 9.15). Unfortunately, these data are not compatible. For example, MS3 has 401 slaughterhouses, of which 56 are large. The minimum number of pigs per day would be 400 times 56 equals 22,400, which is already more than the total number of pigs slaughtered per day. Therefore we choose to use the numbers as given in the cluster analysis (Chapter 6). For the capacity of the small slaughterhouse for MS2, denoted , we have a detailed description, obtained from the questionnaire (EFSA 2008b). We describe the variation in capacity by means of a general distribution: (9.5) This should be read as, e.g.: the probability that the capacity is between 1 and 4 is 0.26/0.91. For the capacities of the large slaughterhouses we have detailed information for Denmark, .(9.6) See also the histograms of the distributions in Figure 9.1. Any probability distribution mentioned in this Chapter is listed in Table A5.1 in Appendix 5.1 (Chapter 5).

Growth of bacteria is not relevant in the slaughterhouse environment, due to the short total time of processing as compared to the generation time of Salmonella . Also, at several stages lag- phases are probably induced due to stress (e.g. heat stress at singeing). We refer the reader to Titus, 2007 (Section 3.3), or Nauta et al. 2005 (Section 3) for more information on cross-contamination, inactivation and slaughterhouse models in general. Cross-contamination is not a well-defined concept. We will define cross- contamination as the contamination of a carcass (or other unit under investigation) by means of a second agent (e.g. a cutting knife, or the scalding tank), which has previously been contaminated by another carcass. We assume that contamination takes place in discrete time, thus the exchange of micro-organisms from pig to an environment is an instantaneous action. See Chapter 5 (including Appendix 5.1 and 5.2) for a list of all variables and quantities used throughout this report, including a description of the notation used. We have two entities that must be taken into account, these are given in Table 9.2. Table 9.2 : Typical quantities in a cross-contamination model.

Note the reversed roles of and for the environment and the pig. For the pig, time can be measured by the phase it is in, while in the environment, time is represented by the number of the pig it is interacting with. We continue by defining rates of transfer, defining fractions of pathogen per time unit that move from to and vice versa. We define the rates of transfer in Table 9.3. We are now in the position of formulating a simple model. Note that a carcass at stage has a contamination level equal to its contamination from the previous stage, multiplied by the fraction of Salmonella not moving to the environment, plus the contribution from the environment to the carcass. This conception may be expressed as . (9.7) Note the notation , which means we round down to the nearest integer. Similarly, the environment retains a fraction of Salmonella that was present at time and increases with a fraction of Salmonella from the carcass, . (9.8) We should supplement these equations with suitable initial conditions, i.e. we prescribe for and for all stages. Note that, due to cross-contamination negative carcasses may become positive. Therefore, it is not possible to model only positive carcasses, adjusting for negative carcasses only. In our case, the splitting phase (Section 9.2.10) is the final point where cross contamination may occur, and from that point onward negative half- carcasses could be removed from the model. However, for practical implementation reasons, negative carcasses were not singled out. Next, we discuss the inclusion of inactivation in the model. Inactivation is the reduction of the number of Salmonella on the carcass, or in the environment. Two inactivation models are relevant for our purposes, a linear model and an exponential inactivation model. Let denote the number of Salmonella at time and arbitrarily set for given values . Then, the linear model, where the number of bacteria decreases with a constant value each minute may be written as . (9.9) 16 We will also write and generally start numbering from one onward, instead of zero.

Quantity Domain Unit Description - Fraction of Salmonella in the environment, moving from the environment to the carcass - Fraction of Salmonella on the carcass, moving from the carcass to the environment Secondly, the exponential inactivation model is widely used. In the exponential model, the number of bacteria decreases with the same factor every time unit. Mathematically, the exponential model is given by . (9.10) The exponential model is often more realistic than the linear model when modelling natural inactivation of micro-organisms. However, adding an exponential decay to the cross-contamination equations yields a mathematically intractable system. On the other hand this does not pose a problem numerically. Due to the exponential nature of the natural growth and decay of micro-organisms, the number of cfu's is often measured in 'log cfu'17. An amount of log cfu is equal to cfu. Converting to log units we find that the exponential model becomes linear, . (9.11) Here we have not rounded down to integers for simplicity. The models appearing in Section 9.2.4 are variations on the basic models established in this section and will be somewhat more complicated. However, the main reasoning is similar to the description in this section. 9.2.4 Large slaughterhouse stages The slaughterhouse environment varies throughout the EU and within slaughter stages the specific equipment and settings of the machinery are also not constant. Since it is not feasible to model variations in slaughterhouse stages, we have opted to identify the most relevant stages (in terms of risk of contamination) and restricted the model to those stages. The variability between machinery parameters however, is modelled using data from scientific literature. Within a slaughterhouse several stages may be distinguished and are summarised in Figure 9.2. Some of these stages have little or no impact on Salmonella contaminat ion and will not be modelled. Others, however, are recognised as highly relevant. Those stages will be part of the model in the form of modules. Below we present a list of stages, accompanied by a brief description and a justification for inclusion or exclusion from the model. As such, this section acts as a qualitative risk assessment - a first step where we identify potential hazards and relevant processes 17 All logarithms are in base 10, the natural logarithm (base 'e') is written 'ln'.

No microbiol ogical risks are present at this point. Apart from the electrical stunning method, a gas stunning method is in widespread use. In this second method a number of pigs (one at a time, or from 5 to 10) are stunned using gas (carbon dioxide). This treatment relaxes the muscles (as opposed to electrical stunning) and may lead to increased shedding. Furthermore, pigs have contact with each other and the slaughter floor, leading to cross-contamination. Unfortunately, no data are available to quantify this hazard. Data on increased shedding, Salmonella concentrations, cross-contamination and frequency of employment of the gas stunning method would be needed. Further research on this phase is needed, for it is potentially a highly relevant phase. After stunning, the pigs are subsequently killed by severing the main artery in the neck ('sticking'). Also, methods are used where longer knives penetrate all the way through the heart. The main hazard at this point is contamination of the pig from the conveyor belt, which will be covered with blood and dirt. Again, due to lack of data, this cross-contamination will not be modelled. The knives themselves only touch a small part of the contaminated skin and are sterilized routinely. We therefore consider them as relatively safe. Finally, the pig bleeds for some time before entering the scalding bath. Apart from contact with the conveyor belt there is no risk, and this phase is also not modelled. Scalding (Section 9.2.5 ) During the scalding phase, the pigs are submerged into the scalding bath, containing hot water. The primary objective is the loosening of hairs, but the hairs will still be attached and are removed in the following stage. From a microbiological quality point of view, the high temperature potentially reduces the pathogen levels on the exterior of the pig. Also, Salmonella may be washed off. Relevant parameters are the temperature of the scalding water, the number of pigs sharing the scalding bath and the time spent in the scalding bath. A potential risk is contamination of the scalding water, which could contaminate the skin of subsequent pigs that enter the scalding bath. An alternative to vat scalding is spray scalding, where the pig is not immersed in hot water, but rather a hot spray is applied. There is little data on the frequency of this scalding method and the effect of spray scalding on contamination levels. For these reasons spray scalding was not considered. Readers interested in scalding methods are referred to Troeger, 1993. Dehairing (Section 9.2.6) Dehairing takes place in the dehairing machine. This machine consists of a rotating drum with extensions (e.g. brushes or flaps) at the inside. This procedure removes the bulk of the hair. Due to the vigorous action of this machine, some faecal material will be extruded, from the interior of the pig, contaminating both the pig and the machine. It is evident that due to the many brushes or flaps, cleaning of the machine is difficult. For this reason, the dehairing machine has been identified as a significant source of contamination. See also Section 9.3 on the presence of unavoidable Salmonella cultures in the slaughterhouse: the house flora. Note that scalding and dehairing may be combined in a single machine, as also considered in Section 9.6.2.

The pigs are subjected to very high temperatures (approximately 800-1000 \u00baC) in a singeing machine, where remaining hairs are burnt. As a side effect, it also burns or dries dirt and faecal material. Typically, a singeing machine consists of two heated half shells closing on the pig, or a heated tunnel. Singeing is considered to be the most effective stage for microbial inactivation. Its efficiency is dependent on the time spent in the machine and the temperature to which the pig is subjected. Note that it is possible to have dehairing and singeing combined in one single machine. Polishing (Section 9.2.8) The polishing machine, also known as the 'wet scraper', is a tunnel with a car-wash like series of brushes with flaps. Almost all dried dirt and other contamination (e.g. debris of hairs after singeing) is removed or loosened during this phase. Similar to the dehairing phase, there is a risk of cross-contamination at this step and some faecal extrusion may take place. Note that the polishing stage is not implemented in all countries. Sometimes the polishing phase is replaced by a manual washing step (Bolton et al. 2002). Belly opening (Section 9.2.9) During this step, the belly is opened by machine, using a small hook. Here the infection of the gut becomes relevant, since there is a risk of puncturing the colon, or rupturing the stomach, thereby re-contaminating the carcass or the hook. In between the processing of consecutive pigs the hook is \"sterilised\" inside the machine, i.e. washed with water at 82 \u00b0C. Evisceration After belly opening, the gut (colon, small intestine, stomach, spleen) is loosened manually and put in a container. The main hazard is the spilling of faecal material and/or additional puncturing during manual loosening. We consider these risks as part of the belly opening phase, i.e. the risk of puncturing during belly opening includes the evisceration risks. Cutting the breast bone The chest cavity is opened from the front, exposing the interior of the pig. Little data on this step is available, but no further cross-contamination seems to occur. Pluck removal The 'pluck' is a term encompassing the tongue, pharynx (including tonsils), oesophagus, trachea, heart, lung and liver. During this phase, the pluck is removed manually, after which the pluck is put in a container. This phase probably has some risk as the pharynx, tonsil and tongue are very often heavily infected, as pigs during lairage tend to investigate their surroundings orally (including excretions from other pigs) QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Workers are not supposed to touch the carcass, they mainly contaminate the plucks. This could pose some risk to consumers, the liver is a part of the pluck that may be consumed, possibly unheated (e.g. liver sausage). However, since liver sausage is not a part of this risk-assessment (see Chapter 10) we do not model this step. Splitting (Section 9.2.10) During this phase, the carcass is split in two, top down by machine-saw, stopping at the neck. Between carcasses the saw is cleansed inside the machine. However, the inside of the machine is unreachable and therefore hard to clean and the saw might therefore be contaminated. This step is also risky because of Salmonella present in the oral cavity. Dressing During this phase, the kidney plus surrounding fat is removed. This is mostly done manually. Like the pluck-removal phase, we assume a negligible risk of cross- contamination during this step. Trimming (Section 9.2.11) We define trimming as the inspection, by slaughterhouse personnel, of the carcass. If any visible contamination is found, it is removed. The trimming is done manually, with a knife which is sterilised in-between actions. Care is taken to remove a large portion around the contamination, not touching any of the contamination. Inspection Meat inspectors examine carcass, intestines and pluck, to see if the carcass contains any risk for human health, when consumed. This includes looking for indicators for disease or infection. See for example Table 1 in Mousing et al. 1997 for an extensive overview of what is inspected. Inspectors will handle the carcass manually, make incisions and perform palpations. The inspector uses his hands and also knives for making incisions in lymph nodes. It is estimated in Pointon et al. 2000 that approximately one out of 360 carcasses have lymph nodes cut. These lymph nodes have a Salmonella prevalence of 2%. Note that lymph nodes might be heavily contaminated with Salmonella and therefore the knife and hands should be cleaned between carcasses. If the inspector found visible contamination, abscesses, swellings, etc. then the carcass is put on a separate line. The offending deviation is removed by knife. A risk during meat inspection is cross-contamination, although the meat is in principle not cut. We assume that hygiene is such that in total the meat inspection step has little risk. Classification During classification, the fat and muscle contents are measured by inserting a probe. We assume there to be a negligible risk of cross-contamination at this step.

Counter-intuitively, post-evisceration washing increased bacterial counts by 1 log cfu ml-1. This was also observed for the pre-evisceration wash (2.5 log cfu cm-2) which is sometimes performed instead of polishing. Possibly, the washing step does not remove the bacteria, but rather redistributes them, spreading them over the carcass and thereby increasing recovery. The reported numbers refer to total bacterial counts, not specifically Salmonella . Specific data were not found in the literature and the redistribution effect is as yet speculative. For this reason this step was not modelled. However, the increase may of course be added to the simulation by means of a hypothetical intervention. Blast chilling (Section 9.2.12) Blast chilling is the fast cooling of carcasses by means of blowing cold air. This phase takes place in a room with low ambient temperature. Some Salmonella inactivation will take place due to the low temperature and drying of the pig skin. The amount of inactivation is dependent on the temperature and time duration. Cooling (chilling) This phase is actually a storing phase, keeping the half-carcasses cooled at 4\u00b0C for an extended period of time, until the carcasses are transported to the cutting plant. Salmonella , theoretically, does not grow, nor inactivate, at 4\u00b0C. Therefore, we do not model this phase. In Bolton et al. 2002 it was confirmed experimentally that Salmonella do not grow during cooled storage. In the following, each phase is discussed in three subsections: 'Problem definition', describes the process and establishes the equations that model the process. 'Solution and implementation', contains the solution procedure for the equations and the efficient implementation in the model. These sections may be skipped by the casual reader who is not primarily interested in the technical details. 'Parameter estimation', describes the sources of the parameters used and any assumptions and simplifications made in the process of transforming the data to a form that fits our model. Parts of the models described in the following sections were adapted from Titus, 2007 and Nauta et al. 2005. 9.2.5 Scalding Problem definition In addition to the quantities defined in Section 9.2.3, we define the following variables, where the subscript '1' refers to scalding being the first stage and a subscript ' ' means that the value of the variable differs between pigs due to variability, QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

This reflects our decision of rounding only in between stages. Also note that all fractions are -dependent, although this has been suppressed in the notation. We set to be the time at which pig is introduced into the scalding bath. This is assumed to be an instantaneous action. For convenience, we define . (9.12) Suppose that enters the scalding bath at time . It will then have just left the bath at time The equation for the change of the number of pathogens on pig needs to take into account the rate of inactivation, the fraction migrating to the water and the fraction migrating from the water. We have chosen not to model transfer rates from the pig to the scalding bath per minute, since direct data on this parameter was not available. Instead we just assume that a particular fraction of the Salmonella on the carcass will be transferred instantaneously to the bath when the pig is entering it. Therefore, the fraction moving from the pig to the tank is modelled as a first step, occurring at . The number of Salmonella remaining is then . (9.13) Here , with an output from the Transport & Lairage model, being the initial number of Salmonella on the pig. For the dynamics after the initial transfer of Salmonella , we need to take into account the time slot during which occupies the tank. In terms of an ordinary differential equation the inactivation during scalding may be modelled as , for , (9.14) , for , (9.15) which is valid for . Note that, in order not to overwhelm the reader with subscripts, we have dropped the '1' subscript in , we will continue to do so when no danger of confusion exists. We now turn to a description of the number of pathogens in the scalding tank. This is dependent on the number of pigs that have entered the tank up to time , since each pig deposits a fraction of its pathogens in the water, while at a rate the pathogens in the scalding water move to the pig.

This yields the equations , for , (9.16) . (9.17) The expression stands for the number of Salmonella in the water just before pig enters. The initial condition for the scalding water is , stating no initial contamination of the scalding water at the beginning of the day.

However, , the initial contamination, comes from lairage, the output of the Transport & Lairage model. The quantity , the number of pigs processed comes from the slaughterhouse capacity (see Section 9.2.2). , the temperature of the scalding water, and , the fraction of bacteria moving from the water to the pig and vice versa. The temperature of the scalding water according to Wilkin et al. 2007, ranges from 58 to 64\u00b0C with an average of 60\u00b0C. These values were measured in a slaughterhouse in MS2. The distribution of the temperatures is not explicitly stated. For lack of a better alternative we use the 'beta pert' distribution for the MS2, a distribution based on the beta distribution, but scaled to a prescribed minimum, maximum and mode (Vose, 2000). We use the mean 60 for the mode (or, most likely value). For the other MSs we use the former European Guidelines. Although these guidelines are no longer in effect, they are still widely adhered to. Below we present a table of estimates for each MS (Table 9.5). Other temperatures found from the literature review are given in Appendix 9.1. The fraction of bacteria moving from the pig to the water is determined from the attachment strength of bacteria to the skin. From Namvar & Warriner 2005 we find that 2% of E. Coli on pork skin samples is loosely bound to the skin and removed by very modest washing. We therefore set . The value of is determined from data presented in Notermans & Kampelmacher, 1974 Figure 9.3 presents attachment rates dependent on temperature, for an initial concentration of E. coli per ml. We assume that Salmonella and E. coli behave similarly, both being flagellated micro-organisms. Table 9.5 Temperature of the scalding water for each member state.

The curves represent the 2.5, 50 and 97.5 percentiles. We interpret the spread in measured values as variability (in skin characteristics), rather than uncertainty. From 20\u00b0C onward, the curves seem to approximate straight lines. We used a least squares estimate to fit a straight line through the last four data points. The coefficients for these lines are tabulated in the Table 9.6. Also the variance is listed. Now, there is also a dependence on the initial concentration , determined by Notermans & Kampelmacher 1974 to be almost linear: .

(9.30) Instead of using the description for the mean, we incorporate the variability by drawing from a normal distribution. Furthermore, we approximate for simplicity. Then, the attachment parameter (a parameter such that ) can be drawn from a normal distribution, provided the value is not below zero, (9.31) The numbers presented should be interpreted with care, since several factors influence the attachment rate. Some factors unaccounted for are: the change of skin composition during scalding, the change of organic material in the scalding water or any chemical added to the scalding water. and pathogen inactivation on the pig and in the water Pathogen inactivation in the water is calculated using the D-values and Z-Values for Salmonella in water.

The relation is as follows . (9.33) For the concentration now the following relation holds 19 For S.

(9.34) From this relation we find that we can define the rate of pathogen inactivation as a function of time by . (9.35) We interpret the variation in the results for the D-values and Z-values as a matter of variability between strains and draw values from a general distribution. We keep the D-values and Z-values together and to this end we draw pairs from the distribution, . (9.36) Rates of pathogen inactivation on pig skin are not reported in the literature. However, (Yang et al. 2001) report D-values at several temperatures for chicken skin. We recognize the difference between pig skin and poultry skin, but for lack of better data we use the reported value of . Furthermore, from interpolation of the reported D-values at 50 and 55\u00b0C, we find . From these values, the inactivation parameter for Salmonella on pig skin becomes . (9.37) , the time spent in the scalding bath. For the time spent in the scalding bath only data were available for MS2, which had a minimum time of 2.77 mins and maximum time of 7.5 mins. Information on time in the scalding bath from five other studies was averaged to provide an estimate for the other 3 MSs (see Appendix 9.1). The resulting parameter estimates for T 1 for each MS are provided in Table 9.8.

We suppose that interacts with the dehairing machine in timeslot . The dehairing machine exerts some pressure on the pig, which may lead to faecal extrusion, contaminating both the pig and the dehairing machine. The total resulting bacterial load is the product of the amount of faeces extruded per pig, the infection status and the concentration of Salmonella in the faeces. Also taking into account transfer from the pig to the machine (at rate ), transfer from machine to pig (a fraction ) and the bacterial load on the machine we arrive at the following list of parameters given in Table 9.9. As was the case in the scalding stage, there is initial transfer from the pig to the machine. In this case a fraction at time . We assume that initially only the pig is contaminated by the extruded faeces, by an amount , then transfer to the machine occurs. Therefore, the initial concentration on the carcass is given by , where stands for the number of Salmonella at the end of stage 1. Thus, the equation for the concentration on the carcass at time is (9.38) QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

This value was reported as 18%, thus we arrive at a value of . Estimation of is not easy, since it is thought of as stemming from a distribution. Appendix 9.2 presents a number of simple approaches for estimation of , that unfortunately do not result in useful estimates. We are therefore forced to perform a complex calculation, which we present below. We start with the recursion (9.48) for , which can be solved in closed form as .

Some of the numbers are clearly too high, and would yield an unrealistically high Salmonella load. Therefore, we set an upper bound of .

This causes an exponential reduction in the number of Salmonella . Table 9.11 provides a description of the parameters needed.

In contrast to the dehairing machine, no water is used and the machine does not exert a large amount of pressure. Therefore, only a small amount of faecal matter is assumed to extrude from the pig during polishing. The parameters given in Table 9.13 are used. Table 9.13: Quantities used in the polishing phase.

Previously, in Section 9.2.6, we had classified the Salmonella into three groups: loosely bound, firmly bound, irremovable and used these groups to estimate . An amount would be transferred to the dehairing machine. At this point however, we have only irreversibly bound Salmonella e left. Now no fraction of will move to the machine, but a fraction of will do so. The resulting equations are a minor modification of the dehairing equations, , (9.77) .

Next, during evisceration, the gut is loosened and removed manually. After processing of a pig, the cutting hook is retracted into the machine and auto- sterilized using hot water treatment. The temperature of the water should be 82 \u00b0C by EU regulation (Eustache et al. 2007). However, Delhalle et al. 2008 arrive at a distribution, BP(47,77,81). Taking the most conservative estimate of 47\u00b0C, already yields a 2 log decrease per second (see equation (9.35). In Maribo et al. 1998 a sterilizing time of 8 seconds is reported. Clearly, the resulting reductions are sufficient for elimination of all Salmonella e on the knife. This however, does not take into account the possible formation of biofilm, or recontamination of the knife after sterilizing, by dripping of condensed water. See also Peel & Simmons 1978, who experimentally establish that at least 10 seconds are needed at 82\u00b0C. However, since Peel & Simmons 1978 do not mention any counts, we assume a sterile cutting hook (which we also call 'knife' in the following). See Section 9.3.2 for the treatment of house flora (biofilm) in this phase. This brings us to the relevant quantities, being the transfer coefficients and inactivation coefficients. Additionally, we also need to take into account the area of the pig's exterior touched by the knife, since only from this area can Salmonella be transferred. Finally, there exists the possibility of puncturing the gut, thereby spilling faecal matter on the knife and pig.

(9.86) Implementation The recursion derived in the previous section can be directly implemented in Matlab. Parameter estimation , transfer rate from the pig to the knife Unfortunately, very little data has been published on the Belly Opening or Evisceration phases in pig slaughter. Therefore, estimation of transfer parameters on the basis of measured Salmonella counts can not be done. As an alternative, we use transfer parameters reported in Kusumaningrum et al. 2003 on transfer from stainless steel surfaces to roasted chicken and sponges to stainless steel. The transmission from sponges to stainless steel was measured by contaminating a wetted sponge and wiping a steel surface. Certainly a sponge has a different structure than pig skin, but the effect of wiping is somewhat comparable to the cutting action of the knife. The authors found a transfer rate of 21\u00b18 percent. Modelling the variability using a normal distribution may result in negative values, or values over 100%. For this reason we use a beta pert distribution with most likely value 0.21 and minimum and maximum equal to 0.13 and 0.29, .

It is unclear in what way this variation was modelled. Since no further information is available we choose each outcome to be equally likely and set . (9.88) A typical width of cm was found. The surface area of a pig was measured in Kelley et al. 1973, where the following relation between body mass and surface area was obtained . (9.89) From the EFSA baseline study (EFSA 2008a; annexes Table VI.5), we have data for each MS on weights of pig carcasses, in the form of means and minimum and maximum values (see Table 9.16). The weight of an individual pig is obtained by sampling from a beta pert distribution with the parameters taken from the above table. , , and , puncturing of the gut, resulting faecal extrusion, infection status of the pig, Salmonella concentration in faeces and proportion moving to the knife. The frequency with which the gut is punctured is not reported in the literature. However, expert opinion from a Dutch slaughterhouse suggest that the probability of faecal leaking lies somewhere in the range . Therefore we set . (9.90) Table 9.16: Carcass weight per MS in kg.

(9.91) In order to estimate the proportion of Salmonella moving to the knife and to the pig we use data from Titus, 2007 who reports If the knife becomes contaminated, the mass of the contamination lies between 0.0125 and 0.5 g. On carcasses, faecal contamination was found ranging from 6.6 to 19.8g. Thus, let us take the total contamination (carcass and knife) uniformly distributed, rounded to one digit: (9.92) QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

We derive this factor by a least squares fit through the points (0,0), (0.0125,6.6) and (0.5, 19.8), yielding20 . (9.93) The infection status and concentration in the faeces were determined before, in Section 9.2.6. 9.2.10 Splitting Problem definition The splitting phase constitutes the halving of the carcass, top-down, by an automated saw. The saw stops at the head, which is removed later. The relevant parameters are largely the same ones as used in the Belly Opening phase, with the difference that faecal leakage no longer plays a role; the gut has been removed at this point. Thus, the following parameters are needed (Table 9.17), Table 9.17: Parameters used in the splitting phase. Quantity Domain Unit Description cfu Number of Salmonella on the th pair of half carcasses obtained from , in phase 6 cfu Number of Salmonella on the th half carcass in phase 6 - Transfer fraction from pig to the saw cm2 Surface area of the pig cm Length of the incision cm Width of the incision Note there are twice as many half carcasses as there are carcasses. We assume that the distribution of resulting contamination over the half carcasses is proportional. Note that the factor relating the incision length to the total area is not , but , since the saw cuts the exterior on the front and back side of the pig. The governing equation is similar to the Belly Opening equation: , (9.94) with . (9.95) Next, we distribute the Salmonella load over the half-carcasses, using a binomial distribution. Let be realized from the binomial distribution with parameters and . Then the Salmonella load on each half-carcass is , for , (9.96) , for . (9.97) 20 Actually, we fit (0.0125, 6.6) and (0.5, 19.8) to a line of the form y=ax, making sure the line goes through the origin: no contamination should imply no contamination on the knife.

Parameter estimation , transfer rate from the pig to the saw In Section 9.2.6 this parameter was estimated from published literature on cross contamination from steel surfaces to sponges and roasted chicken (Kusumaningrum et al. 2003). The saw used in the splitting phase is comparable to the knife used in the Belly Opening phase and thus we set . (9.98) , and , incision length and width and the surface area of the pig The surface area of the pig was already determined in Section 9.2.6. The incision length and width is however different. The incision length is equal to the length of a carcass, which was determined in Titus, 2007 to range from 137.7 to 164.5cm, with an average of 152 cm. We fit these values to a beta pert distribution (using 152cm for the most likely value) and obtain . (9.99) Also from Titus, 2007 a value of cm was found for the width of the saw. 9.2.11 Trimming Problem definition Trimming is an inspection, by slaughterhouse personnel, for abnormalities on the half carcasses. For our purposes the most important element of the trimming procedure is the detection of faecal contamination and its removal. Potentially, there is the risk of cross-contamination, either by the knife, or by the hands of the handler. Table 9.18 lists the quantities that will be of interest. Any visible faecal material on the carcass must have originated from either the farm, lairage, dehairing, polishing, or belly opening. The material originating from the farm, transport, lairage or dehairing phases is very likely to have been removed or spread during subsequent stages and no longer visually detectible. We assume only material due to the polishing and belly opening phase is detectable. After polishing, an amount is deposited on the pigs' exterior. The contribution from belly opening is . Thus .

The contamination will be distributed over both half-carcasses, with no preference for either, , (9.101) . (9.102) Experiments with the model indicate that low levels (originating from polishing) of approximately 1 gram occur rather frequently. High levels, of around 5 to 10 grams (originating from belly opening) occur infrequently. The faecal contamination is partially removed, depending on a number of factors. We assume that faecal contamination is divided over the half carcass in a number of 'chunks'. Also, we assume that larger chunks are easier to spot by the trimmer. Furthermore, we know a typical number of trimming actions (a random variable ). Finally, we assume some threshold value at wh ich the faecal material is just visible (a random variable ). Figure 9.4 schematically depicts the situation. 2 3 4 5 6 1Detection Lim itWeight Figure 9.4: Schematic distribution of faecal material at the trimming stage. The x- axis labels the chunks of faecal material. What we would like is to determine the weights of the first few pieces, those that are above the detection limit, which are those that are detected. We treat the number of detected pieces as a given (observed). To this end we need to assume some distribution of feacal material over the half- carcass. We choose an exponential distribution of the weights.

Also, for distributions the total area is one, while we would like grams. But this is easily solved by interpreting as one 'weight unit', with the threshold. In this continuous setting we have a situation like Figure 9.5. Detection Lim itNumber of observed trimmings Weight Figure 9.5: The trimming phase as a continuous process. Compare with Figure 9.4. Now, given the detection limit and number of observed trimmings, we can calculate the parameter of the exponential distribution. Then, we integrate this distribution from zero to , which is the amount of material removed (in accordance to both the detection limit and the number of observed trimmings). This amount is simply subtracted, . (9.103) Solution and implementation In order to find the parameter of the exponential distribution, we assume that at a detection limit of grams, exactly pieces are removed at a total weight of grams of faecal material on the -th half carcass, (9.104) Unfortunately, finding from this equation cannot be done analytically. However, introduce , then . (9.105) , yielding equation is easily solved, giving .

This gives for , also depending on , .(9.108) Finally, the amount to be removed is found by integrating the distribution from zero to , . (9.109) Parameter estimation We need to estimate the parameter , the detection limit of faecal material on pig skin. Such a number was not found in the available literature. However, in Evers et al. 2008 a similar situation is described. This paper deals with children visiting petting-zoos. After a visit, the parent will inspect the hands of the children for faecal contamination. From laboratory experiments it was derived that 3mg of material would be visible upon inspection. However, this number is rather uncertain. Also, it is not directly applicable to the trimming procedure. Therefore we consider that this number indicates terms of magnitude only and set the detection limit between 1 and 10 mg randomly for each pig, . (9.110) The number of trimming actions was estimated to be two or three by the QA department of a large Dutch slaughterhouse, . (9.111) The remaining parameters (concentration, infection status) were already discussed in previous sections. 9.2.12 Blast chilling During blast chilling the temperature of the exterior of the pig is lowered rapidly to very low freezing temperatures. The temperature decrease is effected by blowing cold air at the half-carcass. At temperatures below the freezing point, ice crystals have the potential of killing Salmonella cells. The application of cold air also dries the exterior of the pig, lowering the . Also, chemical reactions in the cell may destroy the lipid bilayer, causing permanent damage to the cell (Chang et al. 2003). Not all slaughterhouses have implemented the blast chilling phase and the time- temperature combinations vary between slaughterhouses. A few examples of reported parameters are given in Table 9.19. Since the variation in times and temperatures is large, the range of processes is large (drying, cooling, ice crystal formation), data is scarce and blast chilling is not implemented in every slaughterhouse, it was decided to implement blast chilling simply as a one log reduction. This number may be changed in the model when more accurate reductions factors are available. Also, the above table can act as a guide for those who wish to enter approximate reductions into the model.

Thus, house flora acts as a permanent source of potential contamination of carcasses. House flora is reduced by cleaning, usually performed at the end of a work-day. The efficiency of cleaning is hard to assess. Easily reachable surfaces, such as floors, can be effectively cleaned and disinfected. On the other hand, there are many sites that are hard to reach, e.g. the inside of machines, or any rails, beams, etc. that are located high up. During the night, any micro flora which was not removed by cleaning may grow to larger numbers. The temperature is certainly favourable and the humidity is high. We will model the combined effect of cleaning and subsequent growth using one factor for bacterial numbers, for those machines that are known to become heavily contaminated (dehairing machine, polishing machine). The resulting contamination will then be a model input for the start of the next day. 9.3.2 Belly opening and splitting Previous studies indicate that the evisceration knife and halving saw are important sites of persistent micro flora (Swanenburg, 2000). This is not compatible with estimated decimal reduction times, which imply that the knife will be sterile in a matter of microseconds (see Section 9.2.9). On the other hand, Warriner et al. 2002 find only small numbers of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae on the evisceration knife and halving saw. Possibly, contamination in terms of prevalence is high (many carcasses are contaminated), while contamination in terms of concentration is low (they are contaminated only moderately). This would reconcile the differing conclusions drawn by authors, whether the belly opening and splitting phases are important cross-contamination events or not. Possible circumstances not accounted for in our model, that would contaminate carcasses even if the knives are sterilised efficiently, could be: Dripping of condensed water, inside of the machine, recontaminates the knife.

All of these hypotheses lead to a persistent moderate contamination of carcasses. We will model both effects as an addition to the bacterial load on the skin. To be completely explicit, the sequence of events is modelled as follows, 1. The carcass is cut 2. The knife is retracted and sterilized 3. The knife is recontaminated / unsuccessfully sterilized 4. The next carcass is cut This effect may be implemented by addition of an extra term . The distribution of this extra Salmonella load is unknown, so we take very modest values, (9.112) 9.3.3 Dehairing and polishing According to Warriner et al. 2002, the dehairing machine is heavily contaminated at the start of a working day. It is a key factor in cross-contamination of carcasses (as confirmed in this model). The authors report Enterobacteriaceae counts at the beginning of the day (5.6 log / 100cm 2) and at the end of the day (7.2 log / 100 cm2). Assuming that days at the slaughterhouse are similar, we have a rough estimate of the cleaning and growth effect, a decrease of 1.6 log. The unpublished report by Richards & Dodd 2009 presents Enterobacteriaceae counts, sampled during the day on several sites on the polishing machine. Averaged, the polishing machine contains 2.0 log cfu/cm2 at the start of the day and 0.96 log cfu/cm2 at the end of the day. This results in a one log effect of combined cleaning and growth during the night. These numbers were put into the model. When house flora is enabled, the initial load on a machine (i.e. at the start of a new iteration) will not be zero but the end of the previous iteration plus 1.6 log (dehairing) or plus 1.0 log (polishing). 9.3.4 Other house-flora Another source of endemic Salmonella in the slaughterhouse could be airborne bacteria, as suggested by Bolton et al. 2002. These authors mention numbers up to 3000 cfu/m3. The problem in modelling this phenomenon is that the mechanism of attachment to carcasses or slaughter equipment is unknown. 9.4 Results for the Large Slaughterhouse In this section we discuss the results of the large slaughterhouse model. The results for the 4 case study MSs are given in Figure 9.6. The input to each model is the output of the previous phase, i.e. from the Transport & Lairage module.

The phase and unit under investigation is listed at the ticks of the x-axis. The vertical axis is in units of average 'log cfu'. Here the geometric average is taken over all products within one iteration (typically 10,000), and an arithmetic average over the iterations. The iterations induce variability in the results. This variability is represented by 'variability bars', having ticks at the 5th percentile, 50th percentile (median) and 95th percentile. It should be kept in mind at all times that the prevalence graphs and bar chart should be considered as a whole. If a slight drop is observed in average log cfu contamination per positive product/carcass, it can very well be that there is also a tremendous drop in prevalence, and the decrease of Salmonella numbers might be higher than it seems when superficially considering the bar charts Mean Percentiles Figure 9.6: Salmonella numbers (top panel) and prevalence (bottom panel), during stages of the large slaughterhouse for the 4 case study MSs. (top right); MS3 (bottom left); MS4 (bottom right) At the start of the slaughter process, which is just after lairage, we have a low prevalence for MS1, MS3 and MS4, though the contamination on the skin can be substantial. As seen from Table 8.7, the prevalence of infection at this stage is higher QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

The first process is the scalding step. Scalding has little effect on the prevalence (except for MS2), but numbers decrease considerably. We must conclude that the scalding water is sufficiently hot to properly kill off any Salmonella transferred from pigs to the scalding water, thereby prohibiting cross-contamination. At dehairing prevalence increases and numbers increase, especially for MS2. Here we see the effect of cross-contamination, plus added faecal contamination. It turns out that the dehairing stage introduces a large amount of variability, probably due to a rare event (faecal extrusion) having a large impact (heavily contaminated). Next is the singeing stage, which has the effect of about a 1.7 log reduction (on average), as seen from the formula and parameter values. However, the result from the graph seems to be much lower. This effect may be explained by means of an example. Suppose we have the following distribution of Salmonella over 100 carcasses Nr. of carasses 40 10 10 10 10 10 10 Bacterial load 0 100 101 102 103 104 105 The prevalence is 60%, and the average log cfu per contaminated carcass is 2.5. Now, after singeing, suppose a two log reduction, any number below one is rounded to zero and we obtain Nr. of carcasses 60 10 10 10 10 Bacterial load 0 100 101 102 103 Now, the prevalence is 40% while the average log cfu per carcass is 1.5. Observe how a two log reduction manifests itself as a one log reduction of contaminated carcasses! Singeing is followed by polishing, a phase which is comparable to the dehairing phase. The main difference is the lower amount of extruded faecal contamination. We see from the bar chart that this lower load yields a small decrease in numbers for MS1 and MS3 and a small increase in numbers of MS2 and MS4. For all MSs the prevalence does increase slightly. The following phase is evisceration. A striking feature is the increase of the prevalence to 100%. This is because of the implementation of house flora, contaminating every carcass with a small amount of Salmonella . Also, numbers of Salmonella increase and particularly for MS1, MS3 and MS4. This is the result of the faecal contamination resulting from puncturing of the gut. Although this is a rare event, the resulting contamination is very high. During splitting, the contamination is divided randomly over two half-carcasses. This will cause average contamination to go down, but also lowers the prevalence slightly, since some half carcasses originating from a slightly contaminated carcass will end up with zero Salmonella . The process of trimming doesn't seem to have much effect. Since trimming basically consists of remo val of detected faecal contamination (from polishing or evisceration), it must be the case that either the contamination is not detected, or there is not much contamination on average.

The results from the large slaughterhouse can be compared to results from other QMRAs. Consider Figure 9.7, taken from Bolton et al. 2002. The figure shows total aerobic counts, but noting that we only compare relative amounts we can state that the results in the figure are consistent with ours, with regards to: a decrease due to combined scalding and dehairing, a decrease due to singeing and little effect from evisceration. We do not capture the remarkable increase during power hosing, it is not a part of our model, and not comparable to the polishing stage.

The workers swabbed an area of 0.05 m2 on each of the ham, belly and neck, combining all three swabs in a 100 ml volume of BPW. Total aerobic counts and Salmonella prevalence (RV broth, BG and MLCB agar) were used for sample analysis. Furthermore, we present in Figure 9.8 results of (Pearce, Bolton et al. 2004).

Taken from Richards and Dodd (2009), who adapted from Pearce, Bolton et al. (2004) The correspondence with our model is even more striking here. We observe a marked decrease during scalding, increase from dehairing, decrease from singeing, increase from polishing and little effect from the remaining stages. A numerical comparison should not be attempted due to uncertainties and sampling methods. As a final remark on the slaughterhouse model we mention that the modelling of house flora was based on little data, and mostly on expert opinion. As a result we are not confident that we have captured all house flora dynamics in sufficient detail. Yet, experts believe that it is an important factor within the slaughterhouse environment. Therefore we strongly advise further research into slaughterhouse house flora and biofilm formation on slaughter equipment. 9.5 Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis methodology is described in Chapter 5. For the slaughterhouse module we use the number of Salmonella on the half carcass at the point of chilling as the response variable. The results for the four MSs are shown in Figure 9.9 to Figure 9.12. There are many variables to consider in the Slaughterhouse module, so we label the variables using the parameter notation from the previous sections and also identify the stage at which the variable is used. It can be seen that the variation in the length of incision at belly opening is the most significant factor for MS1 and MS4, while for MS3 it is the body mass of the pig (used to determine the surface area of the carcass during belly opening) and for MS2 it is the time spent in the dehairing machine. Parameters associated with the scalding water are also relatively significant for many MSs, as are a number of and parameters (it may be useful to remind the reader here that the parameters are the fraction of Salmonella moving from the environment to the carcass at a particular stage and the parameters are the fraction of Salmonella moving from the carcass to the environment). For MS2 it is the time the pigs spend in different stages that QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Most MSs also have smaller slaughterhouses in operation. These small slaughterhouses handle a much smaller number of pigs on a daily basis, use less dedicated machinery and do not have a continuous slaughter line. This category in itself is ill-defined, encompassing the range from floor slaughter of only a few pigs per day to semi-automated slaughterhouses. Accounting for this range is not feasible within the setting of this project and we have chosen to model one specific QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

To this end we have observed the slaughter process in a small Dutch slaughterhouse. We will describe the process and the modelling thereof using the same template as used for the large slaughterhouse: description, solution and parameter estimation. 9.6.1 Small slaughterhouse phases Before describing each phase in detail, we will first present a short overview. The process is based on the slaughter procedures as implemented at 'Slagerij Kenkhuis'21. The floor plan of the facility is as sketched in Figure 9.13. Figure 9.13: Example floor plan of a small slaughterhouse. The process starts outside of the building, at the entrance, where pigs are stunned. Pigs are kept in a little stable before slaughter. Next, the pigs are dragged inside, where they are bled, hauled up and inserted into the scalding bath. There is only a small amount of time for bleeding: the time that the previous pig spends in the scalding bath. 23..1.1 21 We are grateful to the people at 'Slagerij Kenkhuis', Vriezenveen, the Netherlands for generously allowing us to visit the abattoir and for answering our questions regarding the details of the slaughter process.

Inside the scalding bath, there are rotating rubber flaps. In a sense, it is a scalding bath and a dehairing machine in one. After four minutes, the scalding tank is opened, the pig is automatically lifted to the level of the table next to the scalding bath and two workers drag the pig onto the table. When the pig is on the table, the claws and the ear pits are removed. Also, visible remaining hair and dirt is scraped off using knives. Next, one side of the pig is singed using a hand held torch. The pig is then turned to its other side and the other side is singed. This is followed by loosening the rectum, to facilitate the removal of the gut later. The hind legs of the pig are now incised. Using hooks through the incisions the pig is hauled up to a rail suspended from the ceiling, until it hangs head down. The pig is pushed towards the third worker, who proceeds with belly opening, evisceration and splitting. Firstly the belly is opened. Then the gut is removed and kept apart (for later inspection). Then the pluck is removed and kept at a special storage area, some parts are also used for consumption (e.g. liver). The next step is the halving of the carcass. This is done manually using a large knife-shaped axe. Also the head is halved. Finally, some final scraping and cutting is performed and the carcasses are moved to temporary storage. This storage is at ambient temperature and takes from a couple of minutes up to a few hours, until meat inspection. Thereafter the meat is stored in a cooled room (4 \u00b0C). 9.6.2 Scalding Problem definition The scalding procedure is similar to the scalding process at the large slaughterhouse. The main differences are in the higher temperature of the scalding water, the number of pigs in the tank and a longer time spent in the scalding bath. The integrated rubber flaps, acting as a dehairing mechanism, do not have the same potential of getting contaminated as the dehairing machine in the large slaughter line. This is because of the high temperature of the water in which the flaps are submerged. The dehairing flaps do have an effect on the contamination on the pig skin, which will be explored in Section 9.6.3. Table 9.20 provides quantities in the small slaughterhouse. Note that we have mostly used the same symbols as used in the large slaughterhouse. Some parameters are described by the same formula and are not repeated here.

The tank also has a heating system for keeping the water at the right temperature. However, the tank only contains 150 litres of water and a pig entering the tank can easily lower the temperature temporarily. Therefore we choose the minimum temperature somewhat lower. We consider 90\u00b0C the most likely, 95\u00b0C the maximum and 85\u00b0C the minimum and fit a beta pert distribution, .

(9.126) 9.6.3 Flaming/trimming Problem definition As described before the acts of flaming and trimming are performed alternately. First the pig is flamed, after which visible contamination is removed (trimming). Next, the pig is turned and the other side is singed and trimmed. Part of the model consists of the singeing and trimming phases developed before (Sections 9.2.7 and 9.2.11). Additionally, we model the contamination of the table and cross-contamination to the pig after turning. Thus, we model the following, 1. Assume even distribution of Salmonella between two sides of the pig 2. Singeing of side A 3. Dressing of side A 4. Cross-contamination between table and side B 5. Singeing of side B 6. Dressing of side B 7. Cross-contamination between table and side A If needed, superscripts are added to the quantities to indicate to which step and side they refer. The quantities for the flaming/dressing phase of the small slaughterhouse are described in Table 9.21 Table 9.21: Quantities used in the flaming/dressing phase of the small slaughterhouse.

The time is the time at which pig leaves the phase. We will also need to refer to some times halfway during this phase, e.g. is the time just after pig had side A singed. 22 These are the same quantities as those listed previously and are considered as an input from the Farm and Transport & Lairage model.

In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors.

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 213We begin with step one, which is modelled as, , (9.127) . (9.128) This is followed by dressing, removal of visible faecal contamination. Previously, this was modelled by collecting the faecal material extruded during polishing and spilled during belly opening and assuming the contamination was present in one spot. Then, a threshold for detection was used to determine whether the contamination was removed. Since in the small slaughterhouse these phases are not present we have to model this in a different way. Since the scalding bath also acts as a dehairing machine, we assume an amount of faecal material to have leaked from the pig during this phase. During dehairing in the large slaughterhouse, this material would be directly deposited onto the pig. This is not realistic in the present case, the faecal material will be deposited on the pig via the water and the dehairing flaps. Estimating the amount of material remaining in the water, attaching via the water, or attaching via the flaps is unfeasible. However, we have observed the number of cleaning actions performed by the personnel. Also, we have an estimate of the amount of faecal material detected by visual inspection. We propose an algorithm to model the routes 'water to The algorithm aims to construct a number of patches of faecal contamination in such a way that the predicted number of visible spots and a number of undetectable spots result. This is obtained by starting with a large number (100) of small patches of 10mg (summing to 1g), randomly combining them until the desired number of detectable patches is obtained. The random recombination is meant to reflect the mixing and transfer occurring in the scalding bath. The result of simulating the above algorithm for a large number of times is graphically depicted in Figure 9.14. The algorithm was run until 2,3, or 4 patches were present with more than 0.1 gram of faecal material. Then, the percentage of remaining faecal contamination, which is not removed, is plotted in a histogram. For example, when 2 patches of contamination were found and removed, it is most likely that approximately 75% of 1g remains on the carcass. Surprisingly, the histograms are fitted very well by an extreme value distribution. We do not think this is a coincidence and suspect some deeper mathematics behind this observation. For now, we will work with the fitted parameters. Firstly, let be the number of 'faecal contamination patches' found on pig . From our observations we found that usually 2, 3, or 4 dressing actions took place: .

The cross-contamination equations eliminate , giving, . (9.149) Since the contamination from step 3 is known, we can use this formula to find all , as a first step. Then we use the first equation and combine the second and third to obtain , (9.150) . (9.151) We've removed the indices , to stress the fact that both equations can be solved in vector-form. Finally, equations (9.138 - 9.141) are again implemented in the model. Parameter estimation The time, in minutes, spent under the handheld flamer was observed to be, . (9.152) The inactivation parameter , is hard to estimate. In the large slaughterhouse the entire pig carcass is singed for some time. In the small slaughterhouse a small handheld torch is used, that may be less hot. Furthermore we have to take into account that only visible remaining hairs are flamed manually, and not all parts of the carcass are heated. We estimate the inactivation parameter to be 10 times lower as compared to the singeing inactivation parameter in the large slaughterhouse. . (9.153) This estimate is however highly uncertain. Next, we turn to the amount of visible faecal material . As in Section 9.2.11 we use Evers et al. 2008. In this paper it was reported that an amount greater than 0.003g=3mg would be detected.

The number of dressing actions was observed at the small slaughterhouse, usually between 2 and 4, we take it to be discretely uniformly distributed (see equation (9.129). For lack of better data we use for the amount of Salmonella extruded the value was used for the polishing phase in the large slaughterhouse, g. Finally, we turn to the transfer parameters and . Again, these are unknown for our specific situation. As a substitute, we use the transfer rate 0.032 for pork cut to a cutting board from the consumer phase model (Chapter 10). The rate for cutting board to pork cut is unknown, and we set . (9.154) 9.6.4 Belly opening Problem Definition The manual belly opening process is, from a modelling point of view, very similar to the belly opening process by machine, the difference being the absence of a sterilising step. Therefore, cross-contamination plays an important role. The quantities used in the belly opening process in the small slaughterhouse are provided in Table 9.23. As in Section 9.2.9 we define and .

Then, quantities in (9.155) are known for all , and (the vector containing all ) can be calculated in one step: . (9.158) Parameter estimation Puncturing of the gut The concentration of Salmonella is obtained from the farm phase. The amount of faecal material spilled from the gut is taken to be the same amount as obtained for the large slaughterhouse (equation (9.92), . (9.159) The status of the gut (i.e. punctured or not) is Bernoulli distributed with parameter . We have an expert opinion from the slaughterhouse personnel, who indicated a failure rate of about 1 in 2000. This is an expert opinion from just one small slaughterhouse, in reality this parameter will likely vary between slaughterhouses, due to e.g. the skill level of the personnel. We have no information on how this parameter might vary. However, this probability was assumed to be uniformly distributed between 0.012 and 0.02 with a mean of 0.015 for the large slaughterhouse (equation (9.90). We will copy the information that there is a factor of 1/3 between the upper/lower bounds and the mean. Combined with a mean of 1/2000 this yields .

The latter two parameters were already determined in Section 9.2.9, , (9.161) . (9.162) The parameter will, like , be based on Kusumaningrum et al. 2003). We use the reported transmission rates from stainless steel to roasted chicken. The experiments were performed with, and without, exerted pressure. Since the cutting action of the knife is rather vigorous, we use the number for the 'exerted pressure' case. The standard deviation was subtracted from the mean to act as a lower bound. The upper bound would be greater than one and was truncated at one, . (9.163) Incision dimensions The incision dimensions, , and the surface area of the pig , needed for scaling the transfer parameter from pig to machine, were previously determined in Section 9.2.9.

The difference is that there is no sterilization, and thus the transfer from knife to pig plays a role. The rest of the model is analogous to the large slaughterhouse model.

Using the vector of binomial realisations, determination of the Salmonella load on the half carcasses is simply , where the square brackets signify concatenation.

This is because of the lower prevalence and contamination for the small farm (and subsequent transport and lairage), see Chapter 7 & 8. The first step is combined scalding and dehairing. The effect of dehairing manifests itself in the following stage (it yields the faecal contamination which is removed in trimming). Thus, we see the effect of scalding, which is similar to the large slaughterhouse: very little cross-contamination combined with a significant reduction. Next is the combined flaming/trimming phase. This was a rather complicated model (see Section 9.6.3), and it is hard to anticipate the result of the combined flaming and trimming in the presence of cross-contamination. It turns out that cross-contamination does increase the prevalence. However, singeing and trimming do achieve quite QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Within the belly opening phase, both cross- contamination and faecal contamination is accounted for by the model. However, we see little effect. Apparently, the probability of puncturing the gut is low enough to have little overall effect. Also there doesn't seem to be much effect of cross- contamination, which is probably due to the very low prevalence and Salmonella concentration at this point. Finally, splitting reduces the prevalence and numbers slightly, which is to be expected from a partitioning step.

Firstly, we combine output from small and large slaughterhouses into a single input to the cutting plant in 9.8.1. Then, a sample of half carcasses is cut into retail cuts (Section 9.8.2). Finally, each retail cut is split into meat used for pork cuts, QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

This is arranged in such a way that we get a certain preset number of retail portions for each pork product. Those portions are the input for the next module, Preparation & Cons umption, described in Chapter 10. Note that the cutting plant model will be a model describing variation in Salmonella densities over the portions. No cross-contamination between pork cuts is considered. Transport from the slaughterhouse to the cutting plant, and from the cutting plant to retail, are not modelled. By regulation transport takes place at 4\u00baC, a temperature at which Salmonella numbers remain stable. 9.8.1 Combining production from small and large slaughterhouses In each iteration of the model we run a large and a small slaughterhouse, according to their typical capacities. In reality, a percentage of production originates from small slaughterhouses and a percentage from large slaughterhouses. We will sample carcasses from the large and small slaughterhouses, in such a way as to obtain the proper fraction of pork from large and small slaughterhouses. We are interested in generating a number of portions. The default in the current implementation of the model is N=10,000 . Each portion is obtained from a half-carcass. The fraction of portions to be taken from half-carcasses from the large slaughterhouse and of portions to be taken from the small slaughterhouse) can be found in Table 9.1. With probability we sample from the large slaughterhouse (or the small slaughterhouse otherwise). We assume the fraction to be the same for each pork product. This half-carcass is then used for further processing as described in the following section. 9.8.2 Retail cuts Each meat product requires a number of 'cuts', these are important in the model, since cross-contamination might occur from the outside surface to the interior of the meat. We assume that initially only the exterior is potentially contaminated while the interior is sterile. Table 9.25 indicates how the carcass is divided and gives the main product obtained from it. For our purposes it is important to know the number of cuts required to obtain the final product. Cuts are not completely standardised but are generally done in the order described in Table 9.26. Table 9.25: Naming of pig parts and associated main products Part Name Main Products 1,2 Head Soup, Stew 3 Loin/Rib Pork Cuts 4,6 Loin Pork cuts (rib roast, back ribs, cutlets) 7 Sirloin Pork cut (Sirloin cut) 8 Tenderloin Pork cut (Tenderloin cut) 5,9,10 Belly (or Side) Spareribs, bacon, stir-fry meat Shoulder/Blade Ham 12 Leg Ham, Schnitzel 13,14 Leg/Trotter Soup/Stew The top panel of Figure 9.16 shows an abstraction of the half carcass. The carcass is represented by a square and the cuts are perpendicular through the square, in the order as indicated in the rightmost column of Table 9.26. Cut number five, indicated schematically by a series of vertical lines, represents the cutting of the final cuts. This process takes place for each secondary cut.

In particular, note the positions of the legs (part 11) in both panels of Figure 9.. However, the abstractions capture the cutting of the carcass, dividing it in several parts and allowing us to estimate the areas where cross-contamination may take place.

Light gray indicates meat used for pork. Dark gray indicates meat used for ham. The bottom panel shows the numbering of the pork cuts. Minced meat is produced from virtually every part of the pig and leftovers from the cutting process. When sold, minced meat typically has a fat to meat ratio of 20 to 80. The head and legs may also produce minced meat, although this is only used as the basis for sausages. In order to obtain a manageable cross-contamination model, we abstract the model a bit more, as in Figure 9.17. We re-number the cuts and label the resulting pieces of pork. The contamination is referred to by the label of the piece, subscripted by a direction. For example is the number of Salmonella on the top of piece , corresponding to a part of the loin. Width, height and depth (not shown) of the pieces are also subscripted. Later, we will also perform the final cuts, yielding the pork cuts as sold to the consumer. In this section we will work with relative Salmonella contamination, i.e. assuming a total of one Salmonella . Later this number can be scaled to the true value, but for the calculati ons it is only the relative distribution that counts. For now we will work with the symbols, using their numerical values later. Also, we will use the reversed implication sign ' ', which will mean 'becomes'. Thus, , will mean that is halved.

(9.180) This amount is divided over the cutting line, according to the relative contribution of the sides of the pieces tot the total length of the cutting line. This leads to , (9.181) , (9.182) , (9.183) . (9.184) Note that adding together the corrections yields zero, no Salmonella was lost or created. The remaining cuts are handled in a similar manner: remove Salmonella from the exterior and assign it to the cutting planes. These calculations are not shown, but are similar to the above equations. Parameter estimation From Hetzer et al. 1950 we find the approximate height ( ), length ( ) and width ( ) of a half carcass as . We obtained the relative heights and widths of the boxes (from Figure 9.17) from a poster showing pork cuts, ordered from KNS23. This yielded the values given in Table 9.28. Results The equations for Salmonella cross-contamination during the various cuts were solved using Mathematica24. The resulting relative contamination per piece is given in Table 9.29. 9.8.3 Consumer Cuts Whenever a consumer buys a portion of pork, it originates from one of the parts shown in Figure 9.16. However, since these parts are of unequal size, some parts have a larger probability of being the source of the consumer portion than others. This probability is also the fraction of the total weight of the part and is determined from Figure 9.16 and Figure 9.28. Suppose we have picked a piece according to the probabilities above. From this piece consumer portions are produced. The following Sections will discuss the three pork types that are produced (in our model) from this piece: pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage. 23 Koninklijke Nederlandse Slagersorganisatie, Royal Dutch Butcher Association, http://www.knsnet.nl/ 24 Mathematica 7.0, Wolfram Research, Inc., Champaign, Illinois, 2008 QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

However, we realize that the main risk is having a consumer portion which is not taken from the interior. If we take the weight of the chosen piece, divide by the consumer portion size and round to the nearest integer, then we have an approximation of the number of consumer portions taken from the current piece. The weight of a piece is the proportional fraction of the total weight of the half-carcass. The portion sizes are discussed in Section 9.8.7. The equation for becomes, . (9.185) Two of those portions have the highest number of Salmonella , they contain the sides. The relative Salmonella density in 1/m2 of piece X is .

To the left: consumer cut taken from outside of primal cut (C 2). To the right: taken from interior (C 1). Note the difference in scaling for the y-axes. In order to determine the number of Salmonella , we follow this procedure, and do this for each cut needed in the remainder of the model: 1. Choose a cut X according to Table 9.30 2. Determine a carcass weight according to a beta pert distribution with parameters taken from Table 9.16. 3. Determine the number of cuts 4.

Since minced meat is produced from virtually every part of a pig, we assume the entire half carcass is used for minced meat. If is a portion size in grams and is the weight of the half carcass, then the number of Salmonella in the portion equals . (9.187) We have not considered the fact that one minced meat consumer portion will have originated from several half carcassess.

There are only 3 parameters with variability in the cutting plant module; 'pieces' (i.e. the pig part that the portion came from, see Table 9.25), 'dangerous cut' (i.e. the cut taken from the outside of the primal cut as opposed to the interior, see Figure 9.16) and carcass weight. The results are shown in Figure 9.19 to Figure 9.22 and are similar across all member states with the probability of a dangerous cut being the most significant factor and the carcass weight being the least significant.

A second option is considering the extreme case of one pig, giving after a simple calculation an expression which does not contain . This was to be expected, since the machine is clean at the start of the day and transfer from the machine to the pig does not play a role. A thorough examination of average quantities for the limit of an infinite number of pigs also does not give any useful information. This is demonstrated below. We start with the recursion for , which can be solved in closed form as , (A9.2.3) where we set . Inserting this expression into (9.49) yields . (A9.2.4) Our goal is to estimate using reported average increases in micro-organisms.

The consumer phase is important in the sense that (in contrast to the farm, slaughter, or retail phases) it cannot be controlled by government (Nauta et al. 2002). Food preparation habits are highly variable and accurate data on daily life food handling practices are hard to obtain. In Section 10.2 the food chain is described from retail to ingestion by the consumer. The input to the food chain, the number of Salmonella e per portion, for each case study MS and each product is obtained from the Slaughter and Processing module (Chapter 9). The output of the retail and consumer model is the number of Salmonella ingested per person per day, for each pig meat product and each case study MS. This output will, in turn, feed into the final model, where the risk of illness is modelled using a dose-response relation. The model is directly coupled to the Slaughter & Processing model, the output of each iteration being matched to an iteration of the Preparation & Consumption model. The interpretation of one slaughter module iteration is 'pork produced in a realisation of typical production environment', the interpretation of variation over iterations being variation between production environments. The output of the slaughter model is a number of portions (10,000 at default) per iteration, randomly sampled from the total pork production. In the Preparation & Consumption module each of those portions is prepared and consumed. Any variation described in this report is within-iteration variation, and thus expresses variability over consumers, portions, etc. Section 10.2.5 discusses the two major basic processes present in the consumer phase: growth and inactivation. We continue with considering three types of pork: minced meat (Section 10.3), pork cuts (Section 10.5), and dry cured sausages (Section 10.6). This particular choice of products was made because each product represents a clear distinct hazard. Pork cuts are usually cooked well, but there is a chance of cross contamination during cutting and handling of the meat. Minced meat is thoroughly mixed, and Salmonella e may be present in the interior of hamburger patties (or meatballs, etc.). Since the core of a meat patty is less efficiently heated than the outside, undercooking may occur, and Salmonellae may survive. Dry cured sausages, including all variations therein like chorizo, salami, etc., are eaten uncooked. Any Salmonella e present after the fermentation process can potentially survive or grow, although salt concentration (lowering the a W) and a low pH are limiting factors. Several outbreaks attributed to the consumption of fermented sausage have been reported (e.g. Pontello et al. 1998, Bremer et al. 2004, Gilsdorf et al. 2005, Emberland et al. 2006, Nyg\u00e5rd et al. 2007, Luzzi et al. 2007).

Each module represents a distinct step, and is assigned a specific microbiological process: grow th, inactivation, cross-contamination, partitioning, mixing or removal (Nauta 2001; Nauta 2008). Figure 10.1 shows the pathways for each of the products. The relevant process in indicated by (G)rowth, (I)nactivation and (C)ross-contamination. Note that we only model products sold chilled, not frozen; therefore we do not model defrosting. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, it is a minor assumption, since Salmonella does not grow, nor is it inactivated, in a chilled or frozen environment. Secondly, there is little data on the percentages of products sold frozen. The few sources available indicate that the percentage sold frozen is negligible. Thirdly, there is no data on the type of defrosting practiced by consumers. There are three defrosting procedures that are usually considered: defrosting in the microwave, in the fridge, or at room temperature. Of those, only defrosting at room temperature could pose modest risk. Figure 10.1: The food pathway for pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage.

This maximum is adhered to by virtually every MS. In the UK, 94% of the supermarkets, butchers, market stalls and other outlets adhere to the maximum temperature requirement (Peck et al. 2006). The time spent in transport and retail was obtained from Derens et al. 2006. Due to poor data availability it is necessary to use the same data for all of the MSs. The temperatures are not known separately for transport, wholesale or display, we only have some data on temperatures in lorries. Therefore, we choose to work with the total time, and assign it to the Transport category, hrs. (10.189) We have introduced a new notation here. The star (*) indicates all MSs, while the second index indicates the first phase in the model. Temperatures in the lorries values were recorded in a French study (Peck et al. 2006). We describe those using a general dist ribution (see Chapter 5, Appendix 5.1). . (10.190) This notation should be read as follows: the temperatures for all MS have a certain probability of being in a range of values, e.g. the probability that the temperature is between -2 \u00b0C and -1 \u00b0C is 0.009. Within this interval the temperature is sampled uniformly. 10.2.2 Consumer transport and storage In the following tables we summarise data on times and temperatures for the transport of meat products from the store to the domestic home. Also refrigerator temperatures and storage times are tabulated. See Appendix A10.1 for the sources of the data. The travel time from store to domestic home is known for MS2. Due to lack of data it is assumed that MS1 & MS3 have similar travel times between the store and home. However, in the absence of any other data it is assumed that MS4 has the same travel time as Finland, which is also in Cluster 4 (see Chapter 6, Table 6.5). . (10.191) . (10.192) Table 10.1: Duration of transport to, and storage in, retail MS Transport Wholesale Display Cabinet All 5h 9h 96h QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

However, refrigerators often have varying temperatures (due to e.g. opening of the refrigerator door), and growth is an important process. For temperature during transport and storage in the fridge, data are available in Appendix 10.1. For consumer transport temperature we used French data Derens et al. 2006 for MS1, MS2 and MS3 Finnish data for MS4 (10.194) ), . (10.195) For fridge temperatures, the best data available was for the UK. This data is used for all case study MSs, due to no data available for any other MS, (10.196) . During transport from the supermarket to the domestic home, Evans et al. 1991 found that temperatures of meat products can easily assume an ambient temperature. Therefore, the temperature of pork during transport is highly dependent on the average temperature of the MS. In ambient temperature conditions, Evans 1998, estimates 0.6 cfu log increase (time and temperature not reported). 10.2.3 Preparation: cross-contamination By cross-contamination we mean the contamination of a product, via an object that was contaminated by the Salmonella on the meat product. More specifically, during the cutting of the pork cuts the knife will be contaminated with Salmonella e from the meat. Later, these Salmonella e in turn may be transferred to another product (e.g. a salad). Other examples are cross-contamination via hands due to improper washing, or via a cutting board. Also there is the possibility of a direct dose of Salmonella , by touching of the lips, or licking of the finger. This dose is not expressed as 'per gram' but directly in cfu ingested. The data relevant to cross-contamination, and the description of the model will be discussed later in the Chapter.

Nonetheless, we list it since this is the phase in which we calculate the dose ingested due to the consumption of the food product and cross-contaminated RTE-product (if applicable). 10.2.5 Growth and Inactivation During transport and storage there is an opportunity for bacterial growth. Depending on the duration of transport, temperature, pH, and water activity (amongst other factors), the number of Salmonella e in the product may increase. We use a growth model that takes into account these factors. To give the reader an idea of the growth ranges for Salmonella spp. environmental factors, we list them in Table 10.2, taken from ICMSF 1996. However, conditions in food products are different from growth media used in the laboratory. In order to construct a full model, we would need the minimum, optimal and maximum temperature, pH and a W enabling growth for Salmonella in each of the food products under consideration. Furthermore we would need the temperature, pH and a W of each of the food products under consideration. After a thorough literature search we concluded that these data are not all available. A literature survey of published growth models was conducted. The results are presented in Appendix 10.2. Oscar 2002 deduced that the hyperbola model yielded the best fit for the lag time parameter. For the specific growth parameter, the Ratkowsky model gave the best fit, while the CTM enjoyed the tightest confidence interval. According to the author, other studies have revealed mostly identical conclusions. In addition to the data listed in the Appendix, the online database ComBase has a large amount of raw data on Salmonella inactivation on fermented sausage and pork cuts. This database is also actively maintained, and contains most of the data referenced in the literature. Appendix 10.3 contains an overview of the most common growth models used in literature. Both primary models (growth using a growth and lag-time parameter) and secondary models (T, pH and a W dependent growth parameters) are reviewed. Considering the available models and data, we chose the Baranyi model for the following reasons: Using the DMFit Excel add-on Baranyi and Roberts 1994, Baranyi 2006, we can calculate growth curves from raw data. This add-on uses the Baranyi model, and calculates all necessary parameters for the model. This is better practice than using parameters from the literature, that are fitted to specific models, for specific products. DMFit works very well with the ComBase database, opening up a large amount of data.

Salmonella growth (Laboratory) Minimum Optimum Maximum T 5.2 35-43 46.2 pH 3.8 7.0-7.5 9.5 aW 0.94 0.99 >0.99 The Baranyi model is also suitable for curves without a lag phase. This is automatically detected by the DMFit software. The Baranyi model is also suitable for curves without an asymptote. This is automatically detected by the DMFit software. The model is also suitable for inactivation. The Baranyi model has a well-founded mathematical basis, in contrast to other models which are mostly ad-hoc fits to specific functions. Table 10.3 lists the parameter values calculated with DMFit, using raw data from ComBase, that we use in our growth model. Note that if no lag phase or asymptote is listed, they were not present in experimental data. Also note that we have no data on fermented sausages. However, those data are not needed. Before fermentation, the constituent is minced meat, during fermentation we have a specialized model which does not depend on the Baranyi growth model. The temperatures in the above table match very well with the temperatures needed for our models (transport temperatures and refrigerator temperatures). For improved accuracy, we linearly interpolate the growth rate for temperatures not listed. The lag phases are nearest-neighbour interpolated 25 (with all temperatures >23OC interpolated to 23 OC and all temperatures below 4.4 OC interpolated to 4.4 OC). Due to lack of pH and a W data at several temperatures, we do not use any secondary model. Inactivation is the opposite of growth: a decrease in microbial numbers due to unfavourable environmental factors. This process is relevant during the cooking of pork cuts and minced meat, and is for those products the most important risk limiting factor. See Appendix 10.4 for an overview of D-values and z-values, the most common tools for inactivation calculation. For pork cuts we assume complete inactivation due to cooking, which is justified since Salmonella is only present on the outside of the product (Section 10.5.2). Minced meat, however, is contaminated throughout the product and we use an exponential inactivation (Section 10.3.4). For fermented sausages we use a model depending also on pH and a W, which are important factors during fermentation and drying of the sausage (Section 10.6.1). 25 With nearest neighbour (also known as 'piecewise constant') interpolation, a value is interpolated to the points by choosing the nearest to .

Travel times were reported in Section 10.2.2. From Table 10.3 we have growth rates and lag phases for minced meat at several temperatures. These parameters are suitable for the description of growth in minced meat, including the lag phase. 10.3.2 Storage of minced meat Duration of storage in the refrigerator and temperatures can be found in Section 10.2.2. Growth parameters for minced meat, at 4.4, 7.2 and 10 \u00b0C are given in Table 10.3. As discussed before, we will interpolate the growth rate between temperatures when needed. 10.3.3 Preparation of minced meat The cross-contamination model for minced meat contains two phases. Firstly the meat is handled, preparing hamburger patties, or meat balls, from the mince. Secondly, a ready to eat (RTE) food product is prepared, possibly on the same board, possibly without washing hands. We model the cross-contamination process between two objects using transfer coefficients. Such a coefficient represents the fraction of Salmonella migrating from one object to another. We consider lettuce as the accompanying RTE food, since transfer data is available for this product. The transfer coefficients given in Table 10.1 are relevant during these processes. Next, we also need probabilities of improper handling, and frequency of preparation of a side dish which are adapted from Table A10.. Values for the UK were used for each MS. When a range of values is listed in this table, the average is taken. When multiple sources were available, the geometric mean was taken rather than the arithmetic mean, because of large differences in orders of magnitude.

We add subscripts to distinguish the phases.

Then the first step, contaminating the hands and the board, and can be written 0 0 1101 1 01 = = BLHM tt tt (10.197) This represents first a transfer from meat to board, followed by a transfer of what is left from meat to hand.

Finally, one could argue that transfer happens simultaneously, 0 0 111 = BLHM T BLHM ttt t BLHMMBH MBMHMH MB 00010 0001000 .(10.199) This is not equal to the first nor the second approach. While the third approach seems intuitively right, there is the danger of being greater than one, resulting in a negative amount of Salmonella . This is ultimately the consequence of transfer rates collected from different experiments. In the work of Mylius et al. 2007 an extra correction is added to the transfer rates (a term ) in matrix entry (1,1). However, given that transfer rates are typically in the order of hundredths or thousandths, this risk is negligible. In the second step, the board and hands can contaminate the RTE food, if eaten, and if the hands and board are not properly sanitized. Now, a consumer handles the board or hands unsafely according to a Bernoulli (binomial with one trial) distribution, and , respectively. Furthermore, preparation of a salad is described by . Thus, to be explicit, the X's are random variables taking the values: =handling board safe if 0handling board unsafe if1 BX , (10.201) 1 SX .

Thus, the meat is still potentially highly contaminated, while a moderate dose is directly ingested via the RTE product (e.g. lettuce). 10.3.4 Cooking of hamburger patties With regard to the heating of minced meat, two data sources were found. Firstly, the mathematical model and measurements of, describing temperatures at various depths in a piece of meatloaf, cooked in a convection oven Holtz & Skjoeldebrand 1986. Secondly, measurements describing the internal and external temperature of minced beef in a conventional oven Hollywood, Varabioff et al. 1991. However, we are concerned with cooking of hamburger patties in a frying pan, having a completely different temperature profile. The temperature difference between the outside and inside of hamburger patties (100g, thickness 1cm) has been described Juneja et al. 1997. The temperature difference in Fahrenheit as a function of time in minutes during cooking was determined to be: . (10.206) This formula implies that inside temperature equals the outside temperature after approximately 12 minutes, after which the relation is no longer valid (the internal temperature would exceed the external temperature!). Also, the initial temperature difference is about 100 degrees. This model is rather simple, distinguishing only between an inner and outer part of the pattie. We would like to model spatial temperature distribution in more detail, so previous attempts are not suitable for our purposes. We develop a new model, aiming to describe the temperature distribution, evolving over time, in more detail. Let us start with the basic physical processes acting when frying a minced meat product: 1. Conductive heat transfer from the frying pan to the oil, and to the product 2. Internal heat redistribution by diffusion We will assume that the heat transfer from pan to oil to product is perfect, i.e. the bottom of the product is kept at the frying temperature at all times. There are other processes at work, such as the formation of a crust, inhibiting heat flow from the inside to the outside, and transport of water and oil components inside of the product. We will neglect the second process, but account for crust formation in a simplified manner. We mainly focus on internal diffusion. 10.3.5 Physical Cooking Model Diffusion as a function of time and spatial coordinates is governed by the heat equation (see e.g. Hallstr\u00f6m et al. 1988 or De Jong et al. 2005), ).,,(),,,(ztyxTttzyxT= (10.207) QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

(10.208) The parameter [m2/s] is known as the thermal diffusivity and represents the material properties of the product. It is defined as pc= , (10.209) with , the density of the product [kg/m3], c p, the specific heat capacity [J/(kg K)], , the thermal conductivity [W/(mK)]. At the boundaries we need boundary conditions. The simplest boundary condition is at the bottom ( ), where the temperature is kept at the heating temperature , . (10.210) At the other boundaries, heat flow depends on the ambient temperature . The description of the boundary condition is based on Newton's law of cooling27. This law states that the heat flux is proportional to the temperature difference, and is given by ] ),,,([),,,( ATtzyxTntzyxT = .

(10.213) We now consider a hamburger which has rotation symmetry, such that viewed from the side we have a rectangle of width W and height H, measured in meters. Figure10.2 schematically represents the situation as outlined above. 10.3.6 Description of Cooking process The model developed in the previous section allows us to model the cooking of the minced meat patty in some detail. We will model the following stages, after the recipe described by Bergsma, Fischer et al. 2007, Looking of one side of the patty for one minute at high temperature. Cooking temperature and ambient temperature are fixed. Heat flows through the sides of the patty depending on the difference in temperature with the environment (ambient temperature). 27 Also known as Fourier's Law , or The Law of Heat Conduction.

It is assumed that a crust has formed at this point, at the cooked side. We set the conductivity of all sides to zero (i.e. a perfectly insulating patty). Setting all sides instead of only the top has only a small effect. The sides have a small area compared to the top and bottom, and the bottom is now directly heated and is subject to a boundary condition of the type (A10.245). Experiments have shown us that the difference between zero conductivity and low conductivity is very small in terms of the final result. The product is cooked for a few more minutes, at a lower temperature. Figure 10.2: The geometry of the minced meat patty. Boundary conditions are boxed. 10.3.7 Finite difference approximation The equations as stated are not accessible to the usual exact solution methods, such as separations of variables or Fourier techniques. Therefore, we construct a numerical solution. The simple description of the boundary (aligned with the coordinate axes), makes the problem suitable for approximation using finite differences. The mathematical description of the finite difference approximation is given in Appendix 10.5. dT/dn ( T(x=0,y) - T A)/ QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

The surface convective heat transfer coefficient could not be obtained from the literature. However, a rough approximation can be obtained by dividing the thermal conductivity by a typical length scale. Such a length scale would be the cubic root of the volume, which in turn is determined from the portion weight divided by the density. Portion sizes vary greatly per MS and per consumer, but using a typical value of 100g we arrive at a typical volume of 83cm 3. Taking the cubic root, a typical length scale would be 0.04m. Table 10.6: Parameters used in the cooking process. For comparative purposes, the parameters for water have also been included.

Below we list a few sources, The USDA recommends cooking at 71 \u00b0C (internal temperature!) for 8 to 10 minutes. The Dutch 'Voedingscentrum' recommends cooking for 12 to 15 minutes per 100g, with no temperature indication. 'Voorlichtingsbureau Vlees' recommends 8 to 12 minutes per 125g. Information from hamburger labels, obtained at a local supermarket, give 9 minutes. Sunflower oil has its smoke point at 232 degrees In the end, we have chosen to fry initially at 180 \u00b0C, turning the temperature down to 100 \u00b0C after crust formation. This setting reproduces an internal temperature of 70 \u00b0C after about eight minutes (Figure 10.3). Official cooking times lie between 8 and 15 minutes. However, we would like to take into account possible disregard of the recommendations. We assume that 8-15 minutes is the 2.5% to 97.5% percentile of a normal distribution, with mean. minutes (10.214) Then the standard deviation is given (see e.g. Rice 1995 pg. 205) by (10.215) and the cooking time distributed according to (10.216) QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Unfortunately, D-, and z-values for ground pork could not be located in the literature. But, according to Murphy et al. 2002, the D- values and z-values in beef patties are (10.217) (10.218) 10.4 Results Figure 10.3 shows the temperature distribution during cooking of the minced meat patty. The temperature starts at ambient temperature (panel 1), slowly penetrates into the interior (panel 2), heats the other side of the patty after turning (panel 3) and slowly cooks the rest of the patty after the heat is turned down (panel 4 to 12). Perhaps easier interpreted is Figure 10.4, the mean temperature and core temperature during cooking. The mean temperature increases steadily, almost two-phase linearly (note the change in slope after 2 minutes). In contrast, the core temperature is far from linear, resembling a sigmoidal curve. Such curves were obtained before, one may compare our results with e.g. Hollywood et al. 1991 (Fig. 1), or Holtz & Skjoeldebrand 1986 (Fig 5).

Colours indicate the average temperature in a 1mm square, but contour lines have been smoothed. Note this is not in log-scale Using the decimal reduction time and the z-value, the temperature fields could be used to obtain a contour plot depicting the survival of Salmonella . Firstly, 106 cfu were evenly distributed over the patty. Then, for 10 minutes, in each cell, the Salmonella was reduced according to the decimal reduction value at the temperature at that point. Figure shows the result of this procedure. The rapid elimination of Salmonella at the top and bottom is easily observed, but it is also striking that the greatest number of Salmonella persists just above the centre of the patty. The total number of surviving Salmonella was also plotted, as a function of time. The result is shown in Figure . It turns out that the data from the simulation is very well approximated using a cubic interpolant.

The rationale for this claim is that the Salmonella are located at the pork cut surface, and thus all of them are directly heated. 10.6 Dry Cured Sausage Following Lund et al. 2000, Chapter 19, we define a dry cured sausage as a sausage having its reduced to at least 0.9 (corresponding to between 25% and 50% moisture loss (Anonymous 1997)) and having its pH reduced to at least 5.3, by means of a fermentation and drying process. See also Bacus 1986, (Chapter 4), for a overview from a microbiological perspective of the production of fermented sausages. Sausages with an between 0.9 and 0.95 are called semi-dry, and will not be considered here. We assume that the basis of the sausage consists of 80% of minced pork meat. The preparation of a dry cured sausage can be divided into several stages, as described by Lund et al. 2000, (Fig. 19-2). Firstly, the raw ingredients are salted, the sausage is filled, and if applicable a starter culture is added (e.g. P. acidilactici, P. pentosaceus or Micrococcus strains (Bacus 1986)). Then, the actual fermentation takes place, lowering the pH. This may be done at temperatures between 25\u00b0C and 43\u00b0C (North-American Style), or <25\u00b0C (European Style) (ICMSF 2005). However, not all time-temperature combinations are safe. In Anonymous 1997 a degree-hour control is suggested, i.e. the product of the temperature in excess of 60 (in Fahrenheit) and time (in hours) should not exceed a certain predefined value. The model we propose for modelling log-reductions does not depend on the specific temperature during fermentation, but rather on the final pH obtained. Finally, during an extended drying period the is lowered. This phase is also called 'ripening' or 'ageing' and gives the product its typical flavour. If the resulting sausage is stored, the temperature may not exceed 25 degrees. Table 10.10: Summary of the preparation of dry cured sausage. In the following table we summarise the relevant conditions of the preparation process.

See for example Goepfert & Chung 1969, Smith et al. 1975, Baran & Stevenson 1975 or Masters et al. 1981. Comparing this table to Table 10.2 one sees that the environmental factors during the preparation are close to the extremes of the theoretical growth limits. Another complication is that the growth limits are interdependent. For example, at low pH the minimum and maximum growth temperatures could be larger than those listed. Usually, this interdependence is modelled by a minimal convex polyhedron, the 'true' region in which growth is possible (see e.g. Koutsoumanis et al. 2006). Somewhere in this polyhedron will be the optimal point , , etc, where the growth rate is at its maximum value. Moving towards the boundary, the growth rate will diminish, reaching zero at the boundary. This leads to the following schematic figure given in Figure 10.7. The same type of figure may be drawn for the lag phase parameter. Figure 10.7: Growth, dependent on environmental factors. In reality, other factors also play a role, most notably (or NaCl) and availability of substrate. Also, previous environmental factors play an important role, a well known example being an extended lag phase in the case of temperature shocks (McKellar & Lu 2004). In a dry fermented sausage, the environmental parameters are typically rather close to the borders of the growth/no growth region, which makes application of a growth model dubious. Furthermore, pH and water activity are not constant during the process. Considering these complicating factors, we conclude that application of a primary and secondary growth model can not be justified in this case. Rather, we choose to base our model on measured data. We will use a previously developed model, as described in the next section.

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 265This model was based on many data sets obtained from several fermentations. A complicating factor is that fermentations may also fail. Failure may be attributed to several events, e.g. failure to reach a low pH during fermentation, or failure to reach a high a W during drying (Bacus 1986). These events may have several causes, e.g. improper sanitation, inadequate temperature or humidity control, low salt concentration (ICMSF 2005). Also, so-called DFD-meat has a higher pH value than normal pig meat, opening the possibility of insufficiently lowered pH (see e.g. Gu\u00e0rdia et al. 2005 or Feiner 2006 (Chapters 4 and 16) Modelling these events is not feasible, and data on percentages of failed fermentations are not available. Therefore, we propose an alternative route to estimate the occurrence and result of fermentation failure. The approach is based on the assumption that failed fermentation is associated to Salmonella outbreaks, while successful fermentation is associated to sporadic salmonellosis ca ses (incidental illness due to high Salmonella load, even though the fermentation was successful). Even subject to successful fermentation, a dry cured sausage may still cause illness, due to e.g. high initial contamination levels of the minced meat used. The following table (Table 10.11) summarises the Salmonella outbreaks due to fermented sausage over the past ten years. From Eurostat we have approximately 4.7x10 9 kg of sausage consumed per year (not necessarily fermented). A batch is approximately 250 kg Alban, Olsen et al. 2002, which means that approximately 18.8 million batches per year are consumed. From the above table we find a number of outbreaks of about 1 per year in the EU, the probability of a batch causing an outbreak is 1/18.8x106. A typical dry fermented sausage is 250g (Alban, Olsen et al. 2002), leading to 1.000 sausages per batch. From the above table we see that per batch, on average, approximately 1000 persons get ill. Thus the probability of getting ill from a sausage of a failed batch is about 1. Thus, when eating a sausage, there is a 1/18.8x106 probability of becoming ill. The model runs 10,000 fermented sausages per iteration. Before encountering one illness, we expect around 1800 iterations (this takes about one hour). Not only the running time of the model is pr ohibitive, also the numbers of illness are very low (1000/year) compared to the number of illnesses stemming for successful batches (approximately 18000/year, calculated from our model).

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 266 For these reasons (lack of data on failed fermentation, prohibitive model running time and comparatively small number of cases), we choose not to model failed fermentations, but only successful fermentations instead. Appendix 10.6 gives some directions for modelling failed fermentation. 10.6.1 Salmonella Reduction Model A model for successful fermentation, based on a polynomial fit of log reductions of Salmonella , dependent on pH, a W and temperature, was proposed in Hwang et al. 2008. The authors also provide an extensive overview of previous measurements, and show good correspondence with those data. We reproduce their results in terms of log reductions during fermentation ( , pH at beginning of drying ( ), a W at end of drying ( . (10.239) We use the data listed in the paper to obtain distributions for the parameters. The temperature had a very flat histogram and is best described by a uniform distribution. The water activity and pH were assumed to be normally distributed (Figure 10.8), but the number of data points is low. The usage of a normal distribution does open the possibility for rare occurrences of extreme values. The fitted distributions are given by, , aW 4.4 4.6 4.8 5 5.2 5.4 5.600.511.52 pHDensitypH fit Ph data pH Figure 10.8: Water activity and pH, fit according to the experiments in Hwang et al. 2008.

We do have a few numbers from other sources, summarised in Table 10.12. Note that Table 10.12 contains a variety of dry fermented sausage products, hence the large variation in storage time. From this table we can conclude that there is a large range to the number of storage days, but we cannot deduce anything on the distribution of storage time. Thus, we describe storage time using a uniform distribution (10.243) Table 10.12: Reported drying periods of dry fermented sausage. Source Number of days Ihnot et al. 1998 56 Kr\u00e4mer 2002, page 300 3-10 Feiner 2006, Chapter 17 80-90 4-5 10.7 Model Assumptions Throughout the preceding Sections several assumptions were explicitly or implicitly made. In this Section we summarize the most important ones. Minced meat, pork cut and fermented sausage cover the pork spectrum in terms of microbial hazard. During transport and storage growth models are adequate for modelling Salmonella behaviour. For minced meat, temperature abuse during cooking is the most important factor. This is well modelled using a physical model taking only diffusion into account. For pork cuts, cross-contamination to utensils and a side dish is the most important factor. (But note that cross-contamination is also modelled for minced meat). This is well modelled using fixed transfer rates. For fermented sausage, the model of Hwang et al. 2008 for successful fermentation is adequate. Failed fermentation has a negligible effect in terms of cases of illness. We assume our parameter estimates are reasonable (to be verified using uncertainty analysis) and capture the variability. 10.8 Parameter Estimation & Identification of Key Data Gaps In this Section we summarise the parameter estimations made throughout this report for easy reference (Table 10.13). The most serious data gaps are the time temperature combinations for the transport and storage phases. We frequently had to resort to data from other MS. Also, transfer coefficients and probabilities of hazardous actions are parameterised with a little amount of data only. 10.9 Results The results obtained during the Preparation & Consumption modules of the QMRA are dependent on the output of the previous modules (Farm, Transport & Lairage, Slaughter QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Therefore, our discussion will be based on relative effects of phases within this module. Figure 10.9 shows the results for each MS obtained from the Pork Cut module. The figures show the average contamination of positive products (top panel), and the prevalences (lower panel), over the phases. The phase and unit under investigation is listed at the ticks of the x-axis. The vertical axis is in units of average 'log cfu'. Here the geometric average is taken over all products within one iteration (typically 10,000), and an arithmetic average over the iterations. The iterations induce variability in the results. This variability is represented by 'variability bars', having ticks at the 5th percentile, 50th percentile (median) and 95th percentile. It should be kept in mind at all times that the prevalence graphs and bar chart should be considered as a whole. If a slight drop is observed in average log cfu contamination per positive product, it can very well be that there is also a tremendous drop in prevalence (in the case that the reduction was such that many products dropped to zero Salmonella , while the remaining products were not much affected). Thus, the decrease of Salmonella numbers might be higher than it seems when superficially considering the bar charts only. The phases from transport to refrigeration show little increases in Salmonella numbers for MS1, MS2 and MS3. Although the possibility of growth exists, the effect is minimal. There is a larger increase for MS4, due to the different parameter estimates used (see Section 10.1.3). Since no inactivation or cro ss-contamination is possible, the prevalence within each MS remain constant, typically around 1 x 10 -3 (MS1, MS3); 0.04 (MS2) or 5 x 10-3 (MS4).

MS1 (top left); MS2 (top right); (bottom right). Note that with prevalence's this low, the log cfu numbers are based on a few products only, out of the 10,000 products per iteration. The next phase is preparation, where cross-contamination and inactivation play important roles. We observe a decrease in both prevalence and numbers, which is due to Salmonella ending up on the salad (which is not included in the total number at this point) and due to Salmonella transferred to hands, knife or board being inactivated. After preparation follows cooking, which we assume kills all pathogens on the product. However, Salmonella still reside on the salad, which is finally consumed. We now consider the Minced Meat Module, which contains the same phases as the pork cut module, shown in Figure 10.10.

MS1 (top left); MS2 (top right); MS3 (bottom left); MS4 (bottom right) As compared to pork cuts, more growth is observed during transport to the store and in the fridge. This must be attributed to growth factors of minced meat, since travel times and temperatures are the same as used in the pork cuts module. Next, the preparation phase seems to have little effect on the bacterial numbers. Of course, the preparation phase is very different from that of pork cuts (minced meat is not cut). The cooking phase is not fully efficient. Although the prevalence drops dramatically, there are still some Salmonella remaining on contaminated products. Finally, during the consumption stage, the numbers on the salad are added to those on the patty. This increases the numbers, but also the prevalence (since salads may be contaminated while the associated patty is not). The MS4 model predicts higher bacterial numbers compared to the other MSs at the point of consumption. As mentioned above, this may be attributable to the different parameterisation for the time and temperature between retail and home (Section 10.1.3). Finally, we present the results for fermented sausages in Figure 10.11.

The bacterial numbers go down during curing and drying, but seem to go up slightly at storage. The model does allow for growth, which is most pronounced in the storage phase, because it is the phase where previous pH or a W deficiencies have most opportunity to result in favourable growth conditions. When pH or a W allow for growth, additionally time and temperature combinations during storage do in principle allow for growth. For each of these three products, the averages presented in Figure 10.12-10.14 are averages of distributions of Salmonella numbers of the products. It is interesting to consider those distributions at consumption, since they drive the risk by means of the Figure 10.11: Salmonella numbers (top panel) and prevalence (bottom panel) for fermented sausage during stages of the Preparation & Consumption module for the 4 case study MSs.

The bins are categories, bin 1 represents 100 to 101 Salmonella , bin 2 represents 101 to 102 Salmonella , etc. On the vertical axis is the probability of a product having such a Salmonella load. The products show similar behaviour of the contaminated products (uncontaminated products are not shown), the probability decreases approximately exponentially. Although the probability of an extreme dose, like 106 Salmonella , is low, it is not zero. Such behaviour is also found in other risk assessments, for example Nauta et al. 2007, (Fig. 3). For pork cuts (Figure 10.12) it can be seen that the dose is often very small at less than 10 Salmonella . However, as remarked above, this dose does vary and pork cuts in MS2 and MS4, in particular, were predicted to be highly contaminated. For minced meat (Figure 10.13) the doses are higher than for pork cuts. Similar to above, MS2 and MS4 are predicted to have a wider variation of doses ingested. However most of the ingested doses are less than 10 Salmonella for all MSs.

This is because many of the parameters in the module specifically affect one product type only, or have different parameter estimates depending on the product type.

The results for the pork cuts sensitivity analysis are shown in Figure 10.15 to Figure 10.18. Here we can see a difference between member states. For MS2 and MS4 (the MSs with the highest prevalence at the point of consumption and higher variation of doses) the consumption of salad is the most significant factor, while for MS1 it is the knife cleaning and for MS3 it is the fridge temperature. 10.10.2 Minced meat For the Preparation & Consumption minced meat module we use the number of Salmonella on the minced meat portions at the point of consumption as the response variable. The results are shown in Figure 10.19 to Figure 10.22. There seems to be variation between MSs as to the most significant parameters for minced meat, but board cleaning, salad consumption, fridge temperature and fridge time seem significant for all MSs. The magnitude of the difference in values between these parameters is generally small, suggesting that there may not be a large amount of difference in their importance.

From this analysis we concluded that there is little difference in the significance of the factors for any of the MSs (and therefore no graphs are presented here). The F values were all quite low suggesting that none of the variability in any of the parameters has a particularly significant effect on the response variable.

In the following we will add a superscript 'min' or 'max' to indicate minima and maxima ( e.g. is the maximal temperature). A superscript indicates optimal values. In the following we will assume that each of the parameters lies within the interval between its minimum and maximum, i.e. , for . (A10.244) A10.3.1 Primary Models Primary models relate the number of bacteria at a certain time to the specific growth rate , the lag phase parameter and the initial or final numbers or . Any environment specific factors (pH, temperature, water activity, etc.) are not considered in a primary model. The simplest model is the exponential model, , (A10.245) possibly truncated at a maximum 1999b calls (A10.245) a 'two-phase linear model'. Two more advanced models, featuring an inflection point, are the modified logistic model, , for .(A10.247) and the modified Gompertz model, , for ,(A10.248) with . Gibson, Bratchell et al. 1987 compared these two models. Note that, since the graph of the logarithm of the concentration is no longer linear, the specific growth rate is no longer constant. This is the motivation for the introduction of , the maximum specific growth rate, attained at the inflection point. Both models have the undesirable feature that . Finally, we discuss the Baranyi-Roberts model (or Baranyi model). This model is not an empirical model but rather a mechanistic model, developed in a series of papers, Baranyi, Roberts et al. 1993, Baranyi and Roberts 1994 and Baranyi and Roberts 1995. In fact, the model is given by a system of differential equations, allowing also for varying temperatures. For a fixed temperature an analytic solution can be written, , (A10.249) .

However, it can be related to a lag phase-like parameter: . (A10.251) The above formulas are valid only for a constant environment (e.g. temperature). In all other cases, differential equations need to be solved. Growth experiments with varying temperature were performed by Ingham, Wadhera et al. 2005 for the surface of chicken and ground beef. Those authors also note a good correspondence between the predictions from PMP 7.033, which uses the Baranyi model, and their experimental findings. A10.3.2 Choosing a primary model In choosing the model there are a number of factors to consider. Is the model accurate? Are growth parameters for Salmonella available? Is the model flexible? The Gompertz and Baranyi models are known to provide the highest quality fits over large times. The exponential model is too simple to capture the bacterial dynamics. Growth parameters for Salmonella , in several environments have been published. However, care must be taken in using parameters estimated for a certain primary model in another primary model. They do not represent exactly the same quantity! The Baranyi model is certainly the most flexible model, it can handle varying temperature profiles. This is a useful feature in modelling cooking or defrosting. The most important drawbacks of the models are the following. The logistic and Gompertz models do not reproduce at time zero. The Baranyi model needs either an unknown , or a parameter which only resembles the lag parameter. Below we present two figures, based on estimates from Oscar 1999c, using the estimated lag time and specific growth rates estimated in this paper, at two temperatures. 33 Pathogen Modeling Program 7.0, http://pmp.arserrc.gov/PMPOnline.aspx QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Also, the Baranyi curve is closest to the 'true' growth curve (not provided). This suggests using the Baranyi model. Estimation of specific growth rates and lag rates is done using secondary models, which are discussed in the next section. A10.3.3 Secondary Models Secondary models consider the growth rate and/or the lag parameter as a function of environmental factors. Square root models A popular second order model is the square root model , (A10.252) where is a parameter of the model. Square root models are also termed Ratkowsky or B\u00e9lehr\u00e1dek models and were firstly introduced in Ratkowsky et al. 1982. Sometimes extensions, incorporating , and , of the following form are used: , (A10.253) see Ratkowsky et al. 1983. Wijtzes et al. 1995 suggested a model like (A10.252) with an extra factor and in Wijtzes, McClure et al. 1993 a model like (A10.253) but without the exponential factor for the maximum pH. The gamma concept The gamma concept was firstly introduced by Zwietering et al. 1992. An often used particular type is the square root gamma model, , (A10.254) (A10.257) QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Note how the gamma has deviating parameters for temperature in the equation ( no ). For the optimum and maximum water activity the value one is usually taken. Other types have been proposed, e.g. with a Ratkowsky-type exponential . (A10.258) Cardinal models In the previous models, the parameters are considered to be not directly correlated to biological phenomena. For example is not the 'real' minimum growth temperature for the micro-organism. Rather, it is a model extrapolation, and thus determined from data, mostly measured far away from . In cardinal models however, the parameters are considered to be directly biologically interpretable. A cardinal temperature model (CTM) with inflection was introduced by Rosso et al. 1993 and later used in Rosso et al. 1995, it reads . (A10.259) Spices and salt The salt content may be directly related to the water activity. Spices and herbs may also have a large impact on the growth factor Koutsoumanis, Lambropoulou et al. 1999 but are hard to quantify. Secondary lag time model If needed, secondary models for the lag time can be used in the same way as above, in which case becomes a parameter. The difficulty is that the occurrence (and length) of a lag time is dependent on previous environmental factors. One needs to take into account e.g. temperature shock. A popular choice is Baranyi & Roberts 1994 , (A10.260) which relates the lag-time to the growth-rate, using an 'initial state parameter' . For there is no lag, while for the lag phase is infinitely long. Another possibility Oscar 2002, called a hyperbola model, takes temperature explicitly into account, . (A10.261) Here are parameters with biological meaning and is an exponent to be estimated. Furthermore, a Ratkowsky model is often used, Ratkowsky et al. 1983, . (A10.262) Finally, we mention Arrhenius model of Davey 1989, , (A10.263) QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Tertiary models Tertiary models combine first order and second order models, and often incorporate variability. A user-friendly computer implementation of combined first and second order models is also thought of as being a tertiary model.

At a temperature (measured in degrees centigrade), exponential inactivation may be modelled using the decimal reduction value , , (A10.264) . (A10.265) The unit of is log-reductions per minute, and therefore time is also measured in minutes. Usually, only a reference value at a certain temperature is known, e.g. . The decimal reduction time at other temperatures can be found from the Z-value (measured in degrees centigrade), which is the temperature needed to lower the decimal reduction time by one log. Thus, is assumed to be linear in , , (A10.266) . (A10.267) For example, for a reference value at , having the value and , the equation becomes , (A10.268) and .

Then the resolutions (grid-spacings) are . (A10.271) . (A10.272) In order to greatly simplify the process, we assume that , i.e. equal grid spacing. This does set a constraint on the allowed dimensions of the domain. Also, set and for and . Furthermore, we abbreviate . Often, we will suppress time dependence, , when there is no risk of confusion.

(A10.277) Plugging in the usual second order accurate difference approximation to the first derivate, , (10.278) presents us with a difficulty, since we have to evaluate the temperature outside of the grid. Luckily, this grid point drops out of the equation when we consider that the differential equation also has to hold at the boundary, , (A10.279) QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Here, the normal derivative is in the positive x-direction, and given by . (A10.281) This yields the following Laplacian, . (A10.282) The top boundary, at has the normal in the negative direction.

This is accomplished by numbering the grid points in a row-by-row basis, such that entry in belongs to grid point . We introduce the mapping to perform this mapping. Our aim is now to write the heat equation in the form , (A10.293) with a suitable matrix A containing the discretization of . As we have seen above, this is accomplished using simple difference equations. For a certain we have an entry and an equation consisting of the vector product between row of A with , plus or minus .

In the end, the model will prove to be inadequate. However, it is educational and highlights the results of improper assumptions. We suppose that an outbreak occurs only if fermentation fails. In this case we assume that every contaminated sausage causes illness. The number of illnesses is therefore dependent on the sausage prevalence within a batch. This we can estimate using our model. Suppose the baseline prevalence of sausages is p B, if we also interpret this number as the probability that a sausage is contaminated, we can model the number of contaminated sausages in a batch using a Poisson distribution, P( k out of n sausages contaminated | p B ) = Poisson( the number of sausages in a batch. We note that the number of illnesses per outbreak is roughly between 1000 and 10,000. The probability of an outbreak of this type is P( outbreak ) = P( between 1000 and 10,000 sausages contaminated ) \u00d7 P( fermentation fails and failure is unnoticed ). The first probability (call it P B) is easily calculated, ==000.10 1000 !) ( ii B np Binpe PB . (A10.305) If we apply an intervention, in the form of a log-reduction of Salmonella , just before the fermentation phase, we can now assess the impact. After application of a m-log increase, call the resulting probability P m. Note that a -m log increase is a m log decrease and that P B=P0. When the probability of failed fermentation remains constant, the relative increase in the probability of an outbreak rm is given by r m=PB/Pm. Now, there is a problem with equation (A10.305). For every reasonable value of p B, the result P B is astronomically small and can never be used for outbreak estimation. For example, from the model we find p B is approximately 2/1000, yielding P B approximately 10-1250. The crucial unrealistic modelling assumption is \"interpret p B as the probability that a sausage is contaminated\". In reality, the basic material (minced meat) will be obtained from one (or a few) sources. If one portion is contaminated, it is very likely that other portions are also contaminated. There is no single p B that can act as a probability of contamination, there is significant clustering. In the next section however, we will see that for a given batch size and contamination of the basic material, we can make some statements on the outbreak size.

However, on a theoretical basis we can still obtain some results on the expected reduction in outbreak sizes dependent on the concentration of Salmonella . Suppose we have a batch of sausages, and the basic material contained Salmonella . When dividing Salmonella over sausages, we are interested in the event that sausages are contaminated (a prevalence of ). Denote this probability by . Note that when the following analysis does not hold, but an alternative approach is possible, which will not be explored here since this situation is unlikely to result in an outbreak. Finding an expression for the probability is not as easy as it appears on first sight. From Torabi 2009 we find a closed form expression for , . (A10.306) Here is the Stirling number of the second kind, which has the interpretation of \"the number of ways to partition a set of m elements into k nonempty subsets\". The other factors have obvious interpretations. The Stirling number of the second kind can be defined in many ways (Abramowitz & Stegun 1972). An explicit expression is . (A10.307) However, this fact was not recognized by Torabi 2009 who used the right-hand side of (AA10.307). Using a symbolic computing language, we can now calculate probabilities and expectations, or draw graphs of the distribution for selected values of and . An example is shown in Figure A10.25. Note that for large and we have a pronounced peak: the average value is close to the most probable value. Also, one suspects that a Poisson distribution will be a good approximation for such large values, a conjecture which we will not explore further here. The expected value of the number of contaminated sausages, which depends on both and is given by .

We use the same range of values for as in the above table and obtain Table A10.23 Reduction in prevalence upon reduction of the contamination by one log a batch of 1000 sausages, bringing down the initial concentration from 4000 to 400 decreases the prevalence by a factor 0.336. For higher values of the calculation becomes unfeasible. But, the percentages seem to stabilize, and depend only on .

Finally, we present the results of the log-reductions in a figure, drawn with . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 70.00.10.20.30.40.5 m 1000reduction Figure A10.26 . Reduction factors for the prevalence as a function of m. Drawn for n=1000. Blue line: one log decrease. Purple line: two log decrease. Figure A10.29 should be read as follows. When e.g. m/1000 = 4, or m=4000, we have four times as many Salmonella as sausages. The result of a one log reduction (top curve) is that the new prevalence is approximately 38% of the old prevalence. The result of a two log reduction (bottom curve) is that the new prevalence is approximately 4% of the old prevalence. We would like to remind the reader that we associate prevalence directly to outbreak size, thus a 38% percent reduction in prevalence directly translates to a 38% reduction in outbreak size. We make no claims on the total number of outbreaks. Note that the top curve (one log reduction) is not a straight line, nor is the bottom curve (two log reduction). But, the dependence of the prevalence reduction on the initial contamination is almost linear. Also, the dependence of the prevalence reduction on the log reductions is not exactly linear, dividing the points of the top curve by the points of the bottom curve would not exactly give a horizontal line, but it would be close. As a conclusion, the result of a one log reduction can greatly influence the prevalence of contaminated sausages in a batch. Therefore, if the probability of fermentation failure remains a constant, such a reduction can have a significant beneficial effect on the outbreak sizes. The result of a two log reduction is, of course, an even lower prevalence, although not exactly a factor two. Relatively speaking the gain gets slightly lower for higher log-reductions.

In earlier work the concept of \"a minimal infective dose\" was common, i.e. it was supposed that a certain number of pathogenic organisms are necessary to produce infection/illness (Untermann 1998) and at doses below this threshold infection will not take place. A more realistic scenario, which is now the accepted concept in the field of MRA, is that there is no threshold dose and that even the consumption of a single organism poses a (albeit small) definitive risk of infection. A necessary condition for disease is the uptake of at least one infective organism (a \"single hit\"). If the host is able to kill or inactivate the organism, infection, multiplication and the formation of a clone to infect the host is prevented. There is, however, a (small) probability r that the organism will succeed in infecting the host (Teunis & Havelaar 2000). If the inoculum contains n organisms the probability of at least one organism succeeds is the complement of the probability of absence of infection P inf (n;r) = 1-(1-r)n. (11.1) In reality the number n is not known, but the expected number of organisms in a random sample (D) can be characterized by a Poisson uncertainty. The probability of a least one infectious organism being taken up is a function of the expected number (Teunis & Havelaar 2000). Pinf (D;r) = 1-e-r*D (11.2) This is the exponential dose-response relation for a single-hit model with a fixed probability of infection r. This distribution has only one parameter r which is assumed to be the same for all of the organisms in the inoculum. The exponential dose- response model seems to work well with some intestinal parasitic pathogens e.g. Giardia and Cryptosporidium (Teunis et al. 1996). However, it can be assumed that in reality there will in most cases be variability in the interaction between the individual pathogenic organisms and hosts. Th is variability can be expressed as a beta distribution with two parameters , (Haas etal. 1998). Including this variability in equation (11.2) leads to Pinf (D;,) = 1- 1F1(,+, -D) (11.3) In which the Kummer confluent hypergeometric function (Abramowitz & Stegun 1984). This formula is mathematically cumbersome and can be replaced by the approximation developed by Furumoto and Mickey (Furumoto & Mickey 1967) on the condition that >>1 and <<.

As the ID 50 (the dose needed to achieve a 50% probability of infection) is dependant on , it follows(Chen et al. 2006 ). ID50(,) = (21/ - 1) (11.5) Equation (11.4) can be rewritten in a form without the parameter (Haas et al. 1993): Pinf = 1 - [1+D/ID 50(21/ - 1)] - (11.6) Another widely used dose-response model is the beta-binomial model. Fazil (1999) states that the beta-binomial is a modified form of the beta-poisson that incorporates the variability in the pathogen-host probability of infection given a certain, variable dose, rather than the average dose considered in the standard Beta Poisson model. P inf (n;r) = 1-(1-Beta( ,))n (11.7) The beta-binomial model can be used in a MCMC environment, where sampling from the Beta-distribution with parameters , can be performed (Nauta et al. 2007). Mean values for this probability can be calculated as P inf (n;r) = 1-( ( + )( + n))/(()( + + n)) (11.8) where is the gamma function (Haas 2002). Therefore, as expected, the, mean values obtained by MCMC simulation for the P inf (n;r) for the beta-binomial model are almost identical to P inf (D;,) for the beta- Poisson model. A reservation has been stated regarding the (simplified) Beta-Poisson model, as the confidence interval can be very wide in the case of very low doses (Teunis & Havelaar 1996). In these cases the model can predict a risk of infection that is higher than the risk of exposure, which obviously is not plausible (FAO/WHO 2003). When there is reason to expect problems of this kind the version using the confluent hypergeometric function can be used (Teunis & Havelaar 1996). As described above, the probability of human illness is dependent on two probabilities - the probability of infection given exposure and the probability of illness given infection (i.e. P (Illness|Infection) .). Data on P (Illness|Infection) is very scarce as in most outbreaks only the number of ill patients is known and no information of infected persons who do not become ill is available. However, feeding trial data can often provide information on this probability e.g. (McCullough & Eisele 1952 and Bemrah et al. 2003). When describing P (Illness|Infection) , probabilities from feeding trials are often used as the proportion of ill persons out of infected persons ignoring a dose-effect. For Salmonella a probability of 0.10 has been suggested (Bemrah et al. 2003) and for Campylobacter 0.33 (Nauta et al. 2007). Another possibility is applying a hazard function for the probability of illness given infection (Teunis et al. 1999). In some cases (e.g. Campylobacter ) this leads to a decreasing probability of illness with increasing dose, which is not biologically convincing QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 30411.1.1 Determination of model parame ters and uncertainty analysis The model parameters (r for the exponential model or , for the hypergeometric/beta-poisson/beta-binomal models) can be estimated from feeding experiments in volunteers (Black et al. 1988 and McCullough & Eisele 1952) experimental animals or from outbreak data (Teunis et al. 2004), if it is possible to obtain quantitative data for the inoculum ingested. In both outbreak data and data from feeding experiments with volunteers the representativity of the cases can be questioned, as there may be overrepresentation of e.g. young healthy males in volunteer studies and young children or elderly persons in outbreak data. In some occasions surrogate pathogens are used instead of the pathogen of interest (USDA- FSIS 1998). Fitting the model to experimental or outbreak data can be performed by optimizing the log-likehood function by maximum-likelihood techniques (Teunis et al. 1996) or by Bayesian methods using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Metropolis-Hastings algorithm) implemented e.g. in Mathematica (Teunis et al. 2008) or WinBUGS (Chen et al. 2006). Confidence limits (e.g. 95%) for the dose-response curve can be obtained by bootstrapping (Medema et al. 1996) or by MCMC methods (Chen et al. 2006). 11.1.2 Bacterial dose-response models When different dose-response models are compared in connection with bacterial enteric infections, the Beta-Poisson model is usually preferred. For Salmonella enterica v. meleagridis and Campylobacter jejuni the fit of the Beta-Poisson model was significantly better than the fit of the exponential model (Teunis et al. 1999). Also for other Salmonella enterica serovars e.g. anatum and enteritidis, , the Beta-Poisson model provides the best fit (Teunis et al. 1996 and USDA-FSIS 1998). Also Shigellosis is usually modelled by the Beta-Poisson model (USDA-FSIS 1998 and Crockett et al. 1996). 11.2 Salmonella dose-response models The FAO/WHO Salmonella risk assessment (FAO/WHO 2002) refers to three previously published Salmonella dose-response models: The first (Fazil 1996) is the beta-Poisson model (Haas 1983) fitted to the human feeding trial data for Salmonella infection (McCullough & Eisele 1951). The second model was proposed in the US Salmonella Enteritidis Risk Assessment (USDA-FSIS 1998) and was based on the use of a surrogate pathogen ( Shigella ) to describe the dose-response relationship. The third model was introduced in a Salmonella Enteritidis risk assessment done by Health Canada (Health Canada, 2000, unpublished), which was based on a Weibull dose-response relationship that was updated to reflect selected outbreak information using Bayesian techniques. The model chosen by the FAO/WHO Salmonella risk assessment (FAO/WHO 2002) was a beta-poisson model based on data from 23 Salmonella outbreaks shown in Table 11.1. It was concluded that the outbreak model (beta-Poisson model) should QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

The following drawbacks of the previous models were mentioned: Naive human feeding trial data (beta-Poisson model) The model suffers from the nature of the feeding trial data (i.e. the subjects used were healthy male volunteers) and may not reflect the population at large. The model also tends to greatly underestimate the probability of illness as observed in the outbreak data. US SE RA (beta-Poisson model) The model uses human feeding trial data for Shigella dysenteriae as a surrogate pathogen, with illness as the measured endpoint in the data. The appropriateness of using Shigella as a surrogate for Salmonella is questionable given the nature of the organisms in relation to infectivity and disease. Health Canada Salmonella Enteritidis (Weibull-Gamma model) To date, this model has not been fully documented and lacks transparency. The model uses data from many different bacterial-pathogen-feeding trials and combines this information with key Salmonella outbreak data using Bayesian techniques. Using data from many bacterial-feeding trials and the current lack of transparency regarding their influence is a point of caution.

Bemrah (Bemrah et al. 2003) has adopted the Beta-Poisson model for modelling probability of Salmonella infection from a turkey product. The parameters and were set to 0.33 and 139.9 (Rose & Gerba 1991) and the probability of illness given infection was estimated to be 10% based on data from the Salmonella feeding trial of McCullough & Eisele 1951. Oscar (2004) has published a dose-response model based on human feeding trials (McCullough & Eisele 1951) with 13 different Salmonella strains using a three-phase linear model (minimal illness dose, median illness dose and maximum illness dose) with subsequent use in Pert distributions in a computer simulation model. Due to the scarcity of data for some strains and the feeding trial background of the data the model probably is not valid for universal use. Recently a new methodology (Bollaerts et al. 2008) has been applied to the outbreak data used for the FAO/WHO Salmonella risk assessment. A generalized mixed model approach with serovar and food-matrix-specific random effects has been used. The usual conventional polynomials for continuous variables have been replaced by modified fractional polynomials and a two-stage bootstrapping procedure accounts for both stochastic variability and for data uncertainty. The method lacks the biological explanation of the parameters afforded by the beta-Poisson model, but may be appropriate when the effect and interaction of serovars and food-matrix is the topic of interest. 11.3 Choice of dose-response model for the EFSA Salmonella in Pigs QMRA As the model will be applied to individual doses a Beta-Binomial version of the Beta- Poisson model will be used with the same - and - parameters (0.1324 and 51.45) as the FAO/WHO Salmonella risk assessment dose-response model.

The baseline model is run with the (baseline) values described in the previous chapters. These values represent the best estimates for the model parameters at the current time. For each parameter, efforts were made to use MS- specific values. However, if these were not available surrogate estimates were applied from a MS that had data for that parameter; first choice was from a MS that were grouped to the same cluster, and second choice from any MS within or outside the same cluster. The model was separately run for the four case-studies: MS1, MS2, MS3 and MS4. More detail can be found on the running of the model in the technical chapters (Chapters 4-11), but briefly we give an overview. The Farm module was run for 500 days over 1,000 iterations (each iteration represents a different farm) for both small and large farms. The number of iterations and days was set to ensure convergence and to allow the variation between the different farm management set-ups to be represented for each MS. The output matrix from the Farm module serves as the input for the second phase of the exposure assessment (Transport - Consumption). This phase of the model is run for 10,000 iterations (where each iteration represents a different day in the slaughterhouse), to ensure model convergence. Within each iteration, 10,000 independent servings were simulated, and the numbers of CFUs per serving were input into a dose-response relationship estimating the probability of illness for each individual serving. This probability was used in a binomial trial predicting whether the serving resulted in a consumer's illness or not. This is done 10,000 times per product type, per iteration (i.e. there are 100,000,000 servings each of pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage considered within a MS model). The proportion of illness in the 10,000 servings was interpreted as the probability of infection ( P illness) in each specific iteration. Ten thousands iterations were run, estimating a new probability of infection within each iteration. The overall mean of the iteration specific probability of illness is the output of the model. Figure 4.1 in Chapter 4 summarises the model framework. Based on the estimated probability of illness, obtained at the end of the dose response module, we estimate the annual number of cases for each member state, N(G,H), where G={MS1, MS2, MS3, MS4}, and H={PC, MM, FS}, to represent minced meat and fermented sausage respectively. ()() ()() sizen consumptio= (12.1) where frequency consumption (G, H) is the amount of product H consumed in G (grams per day per person), portion size(G,H) is the size of one portion of product H in G (grams) and Population size(G) is the population of G. Therefore, data on population size, frequency of consumption and portion size of each product was collected for each QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

The estimates for the parameters frequency consumption , portion size and Population size are given in Table 12.1. As described above, Pillness is the output of the QMRA. In case of data unavailability, information from another MS country was utilised. Appendix 12.1 provides a summary of EU consumption data that was collected as part of this project. 12.1.2 Baseline results The running means of Pillness for each product, after each iteration, are displayed in Appendix 12.2. For all products, convergence of the model was obtained after around 4,000 iterations (the average Pillness stabilised). The final estimate of Pillness is the mean after 10,000 iterations, for the three different types of products (Table 12.2).

Mean probability of illness (one serving) MS1 MS2 MS4 MS3 Pork Cuts x 10-5 x x 10-54.26 x 10-6 5.78 x 10-7 For all product types, the estimated value of P illness varies with a factor of about 100 between the countries. The average rate of illness is between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 10 million servings of a particular product type. For three MSs (MS1, MS2 and MS4), the product with the highest probability of illness, per serving is fermented sausage; for MS4 it is minced meat. The lowest risk, per serving, is associated with pork cuts (MS1, MS2); minced meat (MS3) and fermented sausage (MS4). Across all products, MS2 and MS4 are predicted to have a higher probability of illness. Table 12.3 provides the model predicted number of cases per year per MS, attributed to each product type. The predicted number of cases per MS, from the consumption of the 3 products, is estimated to be 949 (12 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) (MS1), 25,248 (42 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) (MS2), 1,509 (4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) (PO) and 29,901 (293 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) (MS4). In addition to the effect of the estimated risk of illness, the consumption patterns also influenced the estimated number of cases. For example, although, per serving, the highest risk of illness for MS2 was fermented sausage, the number of predicted cases is the lowest as this product type isn't consumed as often as minced meat products or pork cuts. 12.2 Validation of the Model 12.2.1 Methods used for validation of the model The validity of the model was assessed by comparing predicted results from the model with observed (epidemiological) results in the populations of interest. The comparison was done by relating the magnitude of the predicted and observed value, and qualitatively assessing the degree of agreement/disagreement.

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 315In this project we compared the output at three different points in the model: 1) prevalence of lymph-node positive pigs post-lairage (comparable to the lymph-node positive prevalence from the EFSA baseline survey (EFSA 2008b)); 2) prevalence and concentration of contaminated portions at retail and 3) number of human cases. For each validation, the baseline model was used. The validation of the prevalence post-lairage (i.e. before entering the slaughterhouse) allows an evaluation of the Farm and Transpo rt & Lairage module. The validation at retail level permits an assessment of Slaughter & Processing module, which includes the cutting plant. The validation of the number of human cases assesses the Preparation & Consumption module. The validation of human cases is also a useful measure for the validity of the model as a whole. Note that the observed (epidemiological) data to which the estimated parameters are being compared includes uncertainty due to sampling error (statistical uncertainty) and imperfect test sensitivity and/or specificity. In addition, the samples whereupon the epidemiological data are based do not match the units in which we work within the model. For example, tests used to detect Salmonella at slaughterhouse or retail will not be 100% sensitive and human epidemiological data will be subject to under- reporting. Therefore, the comparison of predicted and observed values was done on a qualitative basis with focus on whether the model was predicting the same trends that were indicated by the observed data. 12.2.2 Results of the validation Validation at post-lairage level Table 8.7 shows the changes in prevalence of infection during the stages of Transport & Lairage for large and small farms combined. The output at the end-point of the Transport & Lairage module (i.e. post-lairage) is the prevalence of lymph node positive pigs at slaughter, which is comparable to the observed prevalence in the EFSA baseline study (EFSA 2008b). The predicted and observed values are presented in Table 12.4. This table also includes the 2.5-97.5 percentiles of the 10,000 simulated prevalences of pigs with Salmonella (variability), and the 95% confidence interval for the observed prevalence (which indicates the precision of the observed prevalence - uncertainty). Table 12.4: Prevalence at post-lairage predicted by the model, and the correspondent results reported to EFSA, in a baseline study (EFSA 2008b). Both estimates of prevalence refer to the lymph node. MS Model: prevalence of pigs with Salmonella (%) (mean), [2.5th - 97.5th] percentiles (%))* EFSA Baseline results: [95% CI]** 1, percentiles describing the variability; ** [95% CI] describes the uncertainty Concerning post-lairage, the results from the model match quite well to the results obtained in the EFSA survey, particularly for MS1, MS2 and MS4. For MS3, there is a discrepancy between the prevalence observed in the survey and the predicted QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors.

In particular, the model gives a lower average prevalence compared to what was observed in the survey. The predicted prevalence is also lower than the 5th percentile of the baseline prevalence for MS3 (3.7%). Investigation of the model suggests that this discrepancy likely comes from the generic model structure not capturing a specific aspect of production in MS3 at the farm, and particularly within the small farm model, given there is a relatively high percentage of small farms in MS3. Validation at retail level Table 12.5 shows the predicted and observed (whenever data were available) prevalence at retail level for the 4 MSs and for both pork cuts and minced meat. Also, the predicted prevalence for fermented sausages at storage is presented. The predicted mean value for the microbial load at the same stage is also presented in the table. For MS1, comparing with data reported to EFSA, the model underestimates the prevalence for both pork cuts and minced meat. However, for both the predicted and reported data, minced meat has a higher prevalence than the pork cuts. Looking at the results for MS2, following the trend already seen in the post-lairage results, MS2 has a higher prevalence of Salmonella at retail than MS1 for each product type. For pork cuts in MS2, the model predicts a higher prevalence in pork cuts when compared to the prevalence observed by Little et al. (2008). There are many possible reasons for this divergence includi ng that the QMRA will define a product as positive if it has 1 or more Table 12.5: Predicted and observed (whenever data was available) prevalence at retail level for pork cuts (PC) and minced meat (MM) and fermented sausage (FS); Predicted microbial load at retail level also for the three product types (in Salmonella log cfu).

It was not possible to get reported data on Salmonella prevalence or microbial load for MS4 and MS3. However, data from the EFSA trends and sources report (EFSA., 2009a) give ranges for the prevalence in pork cuts of 0%-6.1%, for minced meat 1.3% - 5.9% and for ready-to-eat minced meat/minced meat products (which includes fermented sausages) of 0%-3.3%. The results obtained in the model are in the same order of magnitude, with the results from all case studies falling within or slightly below these observed intervals. Concerning the concentration of Salmonella in contaminated cuts at retail; across a number of EU MSs, studies show that contamination on retail cuts is comparatively low (scaling up to the unit of a serving commonly less than 10 CFU/portion) (Prendergast et al., 2009, Delhalle et al., 2009). The average number of Salmonella contaminating the three product types was predicted in the simulations to range from 1-11CFU/portion for all MS/product-type combinations. Overall it can be concluded that the model is producing realistic enough results at the point of retail to differentiate between MSs and provide a baseline from which to conduct intervention analysis. Validation of the final output: number of cases To validate the final output of the model, the total number of predicted cases per year (see Table 12.3) attributed to pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausages was compared with the total number of cases of salmonellosis (from all sources) reported by EFSA, 2009a (Table 12.6). In addition, information is provided on the predicted and observed number of cases per 100,000 habitants. The model predicts that MS4 will have the highest incidence of salmonellosis, and the most cases of salmonellosis, due to consumption of the 3 pig meat products considered here, followed by MS2, MS3 and MS1. Whereas, the rank for the total number of reported cases to EFSA, is topped by MS2 followed by MS4, MS3 and MS1 (although MS2 and MS4 have similar numbers of reported cases). Table 12.6: Total number of cases and cases per 100,000 habitants predicted (for pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage); total number of cases and cases per 100,000 habitants of salmonellosis (all sources); reported to EFSA, 2010 Total no. cases predicted per year (PC+MM+FS) Total no. reported cases of salmonellosis (EFSA 2010) MS1 949 (12 cases per 100,000 habitants) 2310 (28 cases per 100,000 habitants) MS2 25248 (42 cases per 100,000 habitants) 11511 (19 cases per 100,000 habitants)* MS3 1509 (4 cases per 100,000 habitants) MS4 29901 (293 100,000 100,000 habitants) *Adjusting the MS2 number of reported cases fo r under-reporting of 3.2 [1.4-12.0] cases per reported case and 3.4-3.7% the estimated total number of Salmonella is between 548-5,110. This calculation was not possible to perform for the other MSs due to data gaps. In summary, if we consider likely under-reporting ratios and the attributable fraction of cases to pig meat consumption, it is likely that (although the estimates of Salmonella prevalence look reasonable at the point of slaughter and retail) the QMRA is over-estimating the number of cases attributable to the 3 product types. However, a direct QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors. The present document is published complying with the transparency principle to which the European Food Safety Authority is subject. It may not be considered as an output adopted by EFSA. EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 318comparison between the numbers predicted and reported number of human cases is not straight-forward. The following possible issues have been identified: The number of cases of salmonellosis reported refer to cases from all sources, and not only pork. In Chapter 14, it is estimated that 10-20% of all Salmonella infections in EU are attributable to pork. Indeed, although not carried out for all 4 MSs, a source attribution study using MS2 Salmonella data estimated that between 3.4-3.7% of Salmonella were attributable to pigs/pork (Pires et al., 2008, Pires, 2009). The reporting of cases itself is biased due to under reporting, caused by differences in health systems, by the fact that not all patients seek medical care, or that not all patients get tested. Several studies suggest multipliers of different values to get the real number of cases of salmonellosis. In England in the mid 1990s, investigators determined that for every laboratory-confirmed case of Salmonella reported to national surveillance, 3.8 cases occurred in the community (Wheeler et al., 1999). In a study in US, this so called multiplier was estimated to be 38.6 (Voetsch et al., 2004). The observed data of human cases or prevalences and concentration in the farm-to-consumption chain can originate from risk-based surveys, where data originated from the populations expected to have a relatively high prevalence of Salmonella /salmonellosis, not reflecting the overall prevalence of Salmonella /salmonellosis. The QMRA was carried out for all types of Salmonella. Within the mandate, EFSA were asked \"to consider all serovars in pigs that are of human health significance\". EFSA, 2006 concluded that \"all Salmonella serovars in pork are to be regarded as a hazard for public health\" and recognised that there will be variability between strains in their behaviours across the food chain. It was therefore deemed acceptable by EFSA (as stated in the call for proposals) for the QMRA to consider all types similarly and hence that a QMRA for Salmonella spp. would be appropriate. However it is recognised that this assumption is not valid as, for example, many serovars are commonly seen in pigs but rarely observed in human infections (e.g. S. Derb y), others are commonly detected in both pig populations and in human cases of salmonellosis (e.g. S. Typhimurium). This could be attributable to differences in the dose-response relationship (see bullet point below) or the possibility that S. Derby does not survive very well within the slaughter and processing environment. The validity of the predicted number of cases is dependent on the validity of the exposure assessment and the dose-response relationship. The exposure assessment has, to some extent, been validated at the point of retail. The Preparation & Consumption module is a necessary, but notoriously uncertain, module within the QMRA. In addition, the dose-response relationship is based on data from outbreaks, and as described above, we necessarily assume the same dose-response relationship for all strains of Salmonella , all meal types, and all ages/health status of consumers. This assumption could over-estimate the dose-response. For example, in many cases, an outbreak is caused by a high virulent strain. Therefore, the dose-response relationship used in this project is most valid for relatively high virulent strains, hence the use of a \"high-virulent\" dose-response curve will result in an overestimation of the predicted number of cases.

The uncertainty analysis (section 12.3) reveals whether incorporating the uncertainty around these values in the model will influence the risk of illness significantly. If the analysis suggests that the uncertainty about a parameter estimate is significant, then if the estimate used in the baseline model was far from the true value, this will result in an over- or underestimation of the \"true risk\". Using the predicted risk in calculating the number of cases will then be different from the true number of cases. As stated above, the purpose of looking to observed data to validate the results of the model is not to compare the absolute values, but instead analyse and evaluate the relative values and trends. A total concord in values of predicted and observed prevalence or number of cases is not expected due to different biases in both predicted and observed values. Indeed, many QMRAs overestimate the number of cases, for example Nauta et al., 2001 and Nauta et al., 2007. The validation of the model suggests that a large majority of the important factors that determine the Salmonella contamination within the pig meat food chain are captured within the model, certainly at the point of slaughter and in the slaughterhouse. Clearly, factors important in determining human infection have not been captured, as the number of cases per year is over-predicted. However, we must assess the impact these missed factors have on interpreting the effectiveness of interventions at a MS level. In our opinion, with due attention paid to the uncertainties identified (below and in the other chapters), the model can be used to assess the relative effect of interventions (e.g. percentage of reduction in the number of cases) 34. 12.3 Uncertainty Analysis As highlighted above, many of the model parameter estimates are highly uncertain due to significant data gaps / deficiencies (see Chapters 7-11). The objective of the uncertainty analysis is to assess the effect that these parameters have on the model output and, in particular, the probability of illness therefore providing insight into the reliability of the results predicted by the model. The uncertainty analysis also indicates the degree to which key data gaps are contributing to the uncertainty about the probability of illness. Identification of important data gaps will be important in the prioritisation of future data collections in EFSA and the MSs with the aim to reduce the uncertainty in the model output. All MS-specific parameters are inputs into the model and can be updated, if more recent or more appropriate data become available. Similarly, the MS-specific values of the parameters can be changed in accordance to other MS data, thereby allowing the prediction of risk of illness in other EU MSs. 34 The absolute value of risk is important in determining the relative effect of interventions, as the effect of changing a mechanism will be dependent on the initial value of the concentration/prevalence. However, given we are probably within an order of magnitude difference from the number of cases, and are within right order of magnitude at slaughter and retail prevalence, then we assume the relative effects can be reliably estimated with the current model.

In the case of missing or incomplete knowledge, proxy-data is used, for example data reported in other countries, or data referring to products other than pork. To assess the influence of these parameters, alternative scenarios of the model were run, where the uncertain parameters were changed to a minimum and a maximum value, respectively. These alternative values were subjectively identified, based on our opinion concerning what was the realistic minimum and maximum value of the parameter (therefore, the result from the uncertainty analysis is influenced by our subjective opinion of realistic values). The resulting probability of illness (for the three products) is compared with the baseline results. In cases where a parameter has a distribution associated with it, the alternative scenario is run with differently parameterised probability distribution. The effect on the output from the different scenarios was assessed by the relative effect of each parameter on P illness for each product. The relative effect was quantified using Equation 12.2 (12.2) Due to the long running time of each simulation, the uncertainty analysis was performed for MS1 and MS2 only. To reduce the duration of the simulations, the number of iterations used in the uncertainty analysis was reduced compared to the baseline simulation. For the Farm module, the alternative scenarios were run for 300 iterations and 500 days to obtain the revised Farm Matrix for each scenario investigated. This was then, followed by 10,000 simulations for the remainder of the model to obtain the alternative probability of illness. For the non-farm parameters (i.e. those in the Transport & Lairage; Slaughter & Processing; Preparation & Consumption modules), the matrices from the baseline Farm module were used and then 10,000 simulations were run. The parameters investigated in the uncertainty analysis are provided in Table 12.7, 12.8, 12.9, 12.10 representing the different parts of the model respectively. The uncertainty analysis results are shown through clustered-bar plots that allow an easy visualisation of the relative effect of each parameter in the final output.

MS Farm Transport & Lairage Slaughter & Processing Preparation & Consumption MS1 - Prevalence of feed contamination; - Prevalence of infection within breeding pig herd - Probability of pigs being stressed during transport; - parameter for the dose response; - Amount of faeces spilled while dehairing; - Storage time in the fridge (MM); - Portion sizes (all products); - sausage pH MS2 - Max. mass of faeces ingested per day (finishers); - Prevalence of feed contamination; - Probability of pigs being stressed during transport; - Amount of faeces spilled while dehairing; - Storage time in the fridge (MM); - Portion sizes (all products); - sausage pH For the Farm module, the influences of changing values of different parameters differ between MS1 and MS2. In MS1 the uncertainty attached to the prevalence on feed contamination has a strong influence on the risk of illness, whereas in MS2 the uncertainty attached to the mass of faeces ingested have a strong influence. In both MS1 and MS2 the uncertainty of prevalence of infection within herd has a strong influence on the result. In the Transport & Lairage module, for both MS1 and MS2, the uncertainty attached to the probability of pigs being stressed during transport has the strongest influence on the probability of illness. Also in the slaughterhouse and cutting plant module, the influence of uncertainty on the probability of illness was similar in MS1 and MS2. In this module, the uncertainties attached to amount of faeces spilled at dehairing and frequency of gut puncturing has the strongest influence on the probability of illness. Due to the complex food chain system being modelled it is not unexpected that the ranking of MSs in terms of Salmonella prevalence/risk will change across the food chain, and indeed this is the case, especially for MS4. Hence, the effect of uncertainty was also assessed specifically for MS4, which has the highest incidence of cases, despite having an average baseline prevalence of 3.5% in slaughter pigs (compared to 21.2% in MS2). The relatively large incidence in MS4 predicted by the model was due to the parameter estimation of the travel time between store and home ( T 4,2). It was assumed that MS4 would have a different distribution to MS1, MS2 and MS3 (see Equations 10.3 & 10.4). Due to a lack of MS-specific data it was assumed that MS4 would have a similar dist ribution times to Finland, due to Finland being in the same EU cluster as MS4. However, this is a very strong and uncertain assumption and has a very significant effect on MS4 results. To assess the impact of this assumption, the QMRA was re-run assuming that the same probability distribution for the travel time between store and home as MS1, MS2 and MS3. From this analysis, it can be seen that if the alternative probability distribution had been used the number of cases would be significantly reduced from 293 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year to 26 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year. However there is uncertainty associated about which distribution is the most appropriate and, indeed, whether the assumption that MS1 and MS3 should have same distribution as MS2, given that the data used to define the distribution given in Equation 10.3 was from MS2.

In particular, it has highlighted the need for MS- specific data for the time between the retail store and home. 12.3.3 Discussion The results from the uncertainty analysis show that some parameters have a bigger influence in the final output than others. This is a result of a combination of the magnitude of the parameter values and how the actual parameter is manipulated in the model. Strictly speaking the reason why some parameters have a bigger influence then others depends on how the parameter is built into the model and to which value the parameter are changed to. Discussion of the most important uncertainties The results of the Farm uncertainty analysis agrees with the work carried out in Section 7 (specifically Figure 7.11), in that feed is relatively important in MS1, but not MS2. Hence, this result also explains the relative importance of the faeces ingested in MS1 and MS2, because pigs in MS1 are probably more likely to pick up infection from feed and the external environment. The probability of feed contamination is a large data gap and this analysis suggests, in concurrence with the recommendation from EFSA, 2008a, that there should be a baseline survey for feed. It was not possible to incorporate the farm management types into the uncertainty analysis (as the way the parameters were estimated did not fit well with the methodology of the uncertainty analysis). However, better data on these parameters is necessary for contract finishing farms (these did not fall under the EFSA baseline survey for breeding pig herds), as they are crucial in determining the risk of transmission. For the Transport & Lairage part of the analysis, the probability of pigs being stressed during transport has a relevant impact for both MS1 and MS2. If the probability of stress increases, then more pigs will start excreting higher amounts of Salmonella in their faeces (increasing the likelihood of environmental contamination) (Chapter 8). Taking MS1 and fermented sausages as an example, an increase of 2.5 fold on the probability of stress results in an increase of 0.39% on the final probability of illness, and results in an increase of 112 cases of salmonellosis per year, due to consumption of fermented sausages. From the parameters analysed in the Slaughter & Processing module, for both MS1 and MS2, the uncertainty related to the parameters \"amount of faeces spilled at dehairing\" and the \"frequency of gut puncturing\" has a large impact on the probability of illness estimated in the model. This reveals that in this module, the uncertainty in the amount of faeces that contaminated the cutting and dehairing instruments will contribute to the uncertainty in the estimated probability of illness. For instance, for MS1, increasing the amount of faeces by a factor of 5 while dehairing contributed to an increase in the final probability of illness of 75% for minced meat, but since the absolute values for the final P illness are very low, this is translated into a relatively small increase of 35 cases per year. For the parameters analysed in the Preparation & Consumption module, the effect of uncertainties in the values of the parameters was similar for MS1 and MS2. The parameter where the uncertainties have a high influence on the probability of illness is the storage time for minced meat, followed by the variation in the sausages' pH and portion sizes. The storage time at the consumer's home is an uncertain parameter, and in the model the same general distribution was utilised for MS1 and MS2 (Chapter 10). The high impact of the uncertainties in storage time and portions size on the probability of illness might be the explanation of the high predicted QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

By doubling the values in this distribution, an increase of 273% in the final P illness for minced meat was estimated. Doubling the values of the time distribution is not necessarily a real case-scenario, but an educated guess to evaluate the impact of the parameter in the model. On the other hand, specific data on portion sizes should be easier to arrange and verify and this parameters also play an important role on the final output from the model. 12.4 Sensitivity analysis The results of the sensitivity analysis for each module are shown and discussed in their respective Chapters (Chapters 7-10). As discussed in the methodology section (Chapter 5), it was not realistic to conduct one analysis for the whole model, due to the problems associated with conducting sensitivity analysis across modules where aggregation (e.g. outputs of Farm module used as inputs to Transport & Lairage module) occurs, as mentioned in Frey & Patil (2002). However, the independent analyses highlight the parameters within each module whose variability has a significant effect on the output of that module. It should be remembered that it does not follow that the parameters will have a similar influence of the risk estimate. Table 12.12 below highlights the most sensitive parameters for each module and details the quality of the data used for the parameterisation. This is split up into whether the parameter was a significant data gap ( i.e. very little or no data at all) and whether there was good, relevant data for every MS. From the table we can see that the parameters such as average amount of Salmonella in feed, stress during transport and salad consumption are of the most concern because as well as being sensitive they are also significant data gaps.

The data categories chosen were dependent on the data availability. To represent the consumption step, datasets on the amount of pig meat consumed per capita (source Eurostat [1]) and on the relative consumption of sausages per capita (source Eurostat [1]) were used. The results from the cluster analysis35 group the countries in 4 major clusters that are represented in Table 1: Table 1: Results from the Cluster Analysis. Distribution of the Member States in the four clusters Cluster Member States included 1 Austria 2 Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and UK 3 Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovenia 4 Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Luxembourg, Latvia, Malta, Slovakia For the case studies, one Member State (MS) per cluster was selected. An important consideration in this selection was the need for more detailed data for the chosen MS in order to proceed with the development of the model. Cluster 1 is represented by MS1, cluster 2 is represented by MS2, cluster 3 is represented by MS3, and cluster 4 is represented by MS4. A12.1.2 Data requests for the model To develop the model, the modellers identified the data requirements for all the steps in the farm-to-consumption pathway. Ideally, this data should be specific from each of the representative MS, but in case of unavailability, data from other MS in the same cluster will be used. To illustrate the diversity in the consumption patterns among the different member states, the data needs for the consumption step include data on portion sizes and frequency of consumption for pork cuts, minced meat and dry-cured sausages. All the parameters required for the consumption step are listed: - Portion size of pork cuts; - Portion size of minced meat; - Portion size of dry cured sausage - Frequency of consuming minced meat; - Frequency of consuming pork cuts; - Frequency of consuming dry-cured sausage; 35 The cluster analysis is described in more detail in the Cluster Analysis - Final Report previously uploaded; QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

This email provided information about the QMRA project including the purpose of this project, collaborative partners, etc. The cluster analysis procedure and results were also explained. Attached to the email, a spreadsheet was sent. In this spreadsheet, the data parameters needed were explained and could be easily entered. Table 2 represents the list of institutes contacted per MS. The email was sent directly to representatives of these institutes that also belonged to DTU-FOOD network of contacts.

In addition, there were a number of projects and initiatives dedicated to consumption and these are listed below - ILSI Europe study- The micronutrient Landscape of Europe; [7] - HELENA study - Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence [8]; - EPIC studies - European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition [9]; - HECTOR project - Healthy Eating Out [10]; - EFCOSUM project- European Food Consumption Survey Method [11]; - WHO MONICA project - Multinational Monitoring of trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease [12]; - EFSA Concise Food Consumption Database [13]; - INFID project- International Food Intake Directory [14]; - DAFNE initiative -Data Food Networking [15] From these projects, the DAFNE is the one that contains information most relevant to our data needs. The DAFNE initiative shows the results from many European household budget surveys (HSB) in a joint effort of European countries to compare the food habits of their populations and monitor overtime, trends in food availability. The HSB are periodically conducted by the National Statistics Offices of most European countries in country-representative samples of households [15]. The methodology followed is uniform enough to allow comparisons between countries. HSB are not primarily designed to collect nutritional information, but by recording data on the values and quantities of the household food purchases it is possible to depict the dietary patterns prevailing in the representative population samples [15]. The DAFNE databank currently comprises data on 24 European countries (including. MS1, MS2 and MS3) and using a software available at the website, it is possible to extract data on different food categories (eg: pork meat, poultry, seafood) [15].

In this call, the crucial data gaps along the farm-to-consumption pathway were identified. The Member States were encouraged to participate via data submission (industry or academic data) or expert opinion [23]. Regarding the consumption data, the countries were requested to fill in forms with data on pork meat products bought and consumed in the country and also data on the most consumed pork-meat dishes. The data requested for the pork meat products is listed below: - Description of product type (e.g. pork cuts, ham, roast, minced meat, offal); - Percentage of persons consuming each product type; - Amount of product type consumed (gram) per serving; - Frequency of consumption of the product; Concerning the data on pork meat dishes: - Description of the dishes (e.g. meat balls, stew, pork cuts); - What is the dish usually served with (e.g. potatoes, green salad, raw or heated- treated vegetables, etc); - How is the pork typically prepared for the dish (boiled, fried, roasted, grilled, smoked, salted, marinated, no preparation); - How is the pork meat usually consumed (well done, medium, rare or raw); - How often is the dish prepared and consumed (one a week, twice a month); - Amount of pork meat consumed (gram) per meal of the dish; - Percentage of persons ever consuming each dish; These data requests have the purpose to illustrate the diversity of consumption patterns on the different Member States and to fill in for the data needs in the final model.

Values used as input for the model Table 4 and Table 5 compile the data, from the previous mentioned sources for each MS that is going to be used in the model36. The following guidelines were used: - Data refers to general population (meaning consumers and non consumers); - In case of the data being split in men and women , an average was calculated; - When age information was available, the adult group (approximately 18-40 years old) was chosen; - When there was no available data from the cluster-representative MS, data from another MS in the same cluster was used. When the latter was also non- available, data from a different cluster was used; Table 4 describes the values for the frequency of consumption of pork cuts, minced meat and sausages used as input in the model for each cluster. This data comes from the results of the literature search and it is the best available data for the product characteristics: pork cuts, pork minced meat and fermented sausages.

[and] during transport at lairage or during the slaughter process\". In addition, we were also contracted to assess the: 1. Expected reduction of Salmonella cases in humans (or pig meat at retail) by a reduction of Salmonella prevalence in slaughter pigs 2. Expected reduction of Salmonella cases in humans (or pig meat at retail) by a reduction of Salmonella prevalence in piglets from breeder farms 3. Expected reduction of Salmonella cases in humans (or pig meat at retail) by the most important potential treatments or control measures at farm level 4. Expected reduction of Salmonella cases in humans (or pig meat at retail) by the most important control measures during transport, at lairage or during the slaughter process. These objectives can be split into two types of intervention: hypothetical and specific. Regardless of the specific interventions used, it is instructive to assess the effect of points 1 and 2 above. These two objectives hence form the 2 farm hypothetical interventions investigated. Of further interest is a hypothetical reduction of carcass contamination at the slaughterhouse. While not specifically part of the EFSA ToRs, hypothetical reductions in carcass contamination of x logs pre-chill are assessed. In order to assist model development, more information was needed on what specific interventions were desired for the EFSA Working Group to consider as part of their Scientific Opinion. Discussion on the priority of particular interventions, and the feasibility of modelling them, with the Working Group and the EU led to the following specific interventions being included within the scope of the QMRA: Farm: 1. Reduction of feed contamination 2. Supplier status 3. Improved hygiene/biosecurity A. Within farm: increased cleaning, longer downtime B. Outside farm: Prevention of external contamination 4. Increased resistance of pigs to Salmonella infection by using e.g. wet feed, vaccination or organic acids Transport: 1. Increased cleaning 2. Logistic transport (i.e. one batch, one vehicle) Slaughter: 1. Reducing/preventing faecal leakage 2.

Reducing the effect of house flora (i.e. persistent contamination) by extra cleaning efforts The QMRA model has been developed with these interventions in mind - much of the complexity found within the QMRA model (outlined throughout Chapters 4 - 11) has been included because of these interventions. Utilising the ability to look at interventions at various point in the farm-to-consumption chain, QMRA focuses on the relative effects on the number of human cases. We therefore present, for each intervention, the % reduction in the baseline number of cases for each MS attributable to each product type: pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage. This does mean, for example, that a significant 50% reduction in fermented sausage cases might actually represent a smaller absolute number of human cases reduced than a much smaller 5% reduction in the number of pork cuts cases. However, using the relative burden makes it easier to assess the effect of different interventions across MSs. The effects of many of the specific interventions included in the model have been reviewed comprehensively elsewhere in the literature. We refer to and draw our conclusions from these reviews wherever possible. However, these reviews point towards a very broad trend when investigating specific interventions: that the effects of particular interventions vary markedly between farms and between studies (presumably because the pig environment requiring intervention is in itself complex and variable). It is therefore not possible for any of the interventions to estimate the effect of interventions on the number of human cases to high accuracy. Further research is necessary before we can confidently assess the effect of specific interventions (e.g. vaccination, organic acids) at a MS level. Nonetheless, a lot of time and research has been put into developing a QMRA that can investigate specific interventions. Therefore, in order to produce usable results for the Working Group, we have investigated how the mechanisms of interventions might reduce human cases, considering biologically plausible ranges of parameter estimates. These intervention results provide insight into the magnitude of reductions that might be achieved by applying control at specified points in the food chain, given particular characteristics of the system (MS-specific or otherwise). We now describe how the effect of each of these interventions was estimated. 13.2 Methodology 13.2.1 Farm Hypothetical reductions We were mandated to look at the effect of reducing slaughter and breeder prevalence (assessed using either bacteriological or serological tests) on the number of human cases. Breeding pig herd prevalence From Figures 7.11 and 7.16 (i.e. the Farm model analysis) it is clear that, at least within the model, breeding pig herd prevalence is the dominant factor in determining national slaughter pig prevalence (i.e. low breeding pig herd prevalence ~ low slaughter pig prevalence, and vice versa). There are two major differences between the MS farm models: parameterisation of the breeding pig herd prevalence QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors.

Further analysis (not shown in this report) has been conducted, where the breeding pig herd prevalence of MS2 has been input to the MS1 MS farm model. The result for slaughter pig prevalence for this MS2/MS1 model was very similar to the original result for the MS2 farm model. This shows that the difference between MS slaughter pig prevalence is largely described (but not completely) by breeding pig herd prevalence. Hence, because of the onerous runtime of the farm model, we have chosen to conduct this analysis of breeding pig herd prevalence for MS4 only. MS4 was chosen as a \"middling\" MS of the four MSs chosen in terms of farm types and breeding pig herd prevalence. The trend shown by this analysis of MS4 will apply equally to each of the four case study MSs. We therefore adjust the value of p herd to {0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45}, and run the model separately for each value. The range of values was chosen to reflect the range of prevalences recorded in the four case study MSs from the slaughter pig baseline survey. National slaughter pig prevalence We chose to investigate a 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 90 and 99% reduction in slaughter pig prevalence, using lymph-node positivity as the sampling test. For prevalence at slaughter the method of achieving a reduction is important in its effect further down the food chain in reducing human cases of Salmonella . For example, reducing the burden of Salmonella infection across all batches (i.e. reducing within-batch prevalence) may well produce a very different intervention effect than reducing the proportion of infected batches. We have chosen to represent the reduction of within-batch prevalence, as this would appear a more likely occurrence given the current crop of interventions being suggested at the farm level (e.g. acidified feed, vaccination). Within-batch slaughter prevalence is reduced in the following way: 1. The farm output matrices (see Section 7.5) are sampled within the transport module. 2. We isolate each batch being sampled from the farm matrices and binomially determine which infected pigs would, because of some intervention, be negative. Hence we revert s pigs from positive to negative status, sampling from the following distribution, ()()ptljIBs ,,,= where I(j,l,t) is the number of lymph-node positive pigs within the slaughter batch and p the fraction with which to reduce infection by, i.e. the set, respectively. Zero indicates a negative pig, one a positive pig. 3. Having reverted specific pigs to susceptible status, we must also revert shedding status to 0 (negative) as well. Reduction of feed contamination There are no national data to suggest how prevalence of feedlot contamination (i.e. the percentage of feed batches that are contaminated with Salmonella ) might be reduced. We have chosen to reflect hypothetical changes in the prevalence of feedlot contamination, rather than hypothetical changes in the numbers of Salmonella present in contaminated feed. The parameter associated with prevalence of feed contamination is p feed. This is changed to absolute values of {0.01,0.03,0.07,0.1,0.15,0.2} to assess the change in farm prevalence (and human cases) over this range of feed contamination for each QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

This range of values is chosen to take into account data that suggests prevalence commonly varies between 1-10% (EFSA 2008b) and expert opinion that suggests prevalence is probably under-estimated using current sampling schemes. We have already investigated the elimination of feed as a source of infection within Section 7.5.3. Supplier status The complexity of the farm model, and a paucity of information on the subject, eventually precluded the explicit inclusion of the supplier status of weaners to a grower-finisher farm. Investigation of this type of intervention is complex, due to the type of surveillance scheme a MS would use (e.g. serology, bacteriology). For example, the Danish surveillance system classifies all farms to one of three levels; however, while this information on breeding/weaning herds is available, farmers may not utilise this information in deciding where to source their new stock. In addition, MSs may choose their own thresholds for discrimination between low, medium and high prevalence herds. The Farm model developed and described in this report has been designed, so far as possible, to investigate multiple interventions at the farm level. However, its strength lies more in the consideration of interventions that prevent/reduce within-batch transmission of infection (e.g. cleaning, vaccination). The inclusion of different management structures is a novel development in transmission modelling, which is important when considering the variability between MSs; the management systems considered are, of course, simplified within the model, and at present do not really allow for us to investigate supplier status with confidence. Improved hygiene/biosecurity Within the model there are two ways to improve biosecurity or hygiene. First, include downtime between batches of weaning, growing and finishing pigs (in the same way as for farrowing groups). Second, the efficiency of cleaning (between batches) in removing Salmonella can be increased. There are qualitative data that do suggest downtime and cleaning can have an effect on Salmonella levels (VLA 2009). However, there are little data to quantitatively estimate the differences in Salmonella infection between batches of slaughter pigs produced from farms that have downtime compared to farms that don't, or farms that have good cleaning practices and farms that don't. Therefore, we again go back to hypothetical changes in the mechanism of that intervention. If we can take a hypothetical but plausible range for a perceived intervention (e.g. if we can assume extra cleaning will have a 1 or 2 log greater reduction in the levels of Salmonella present in the pen), then we can suggest a rough estimate for its effectiveness in reducing slaughter pig prevalence and/or number of human cases. It is assumed that the main mechanism by which downtime achieves a reduction in Salmonella prevalence is by the drying out of the pen, which reduces the number of Salmonella in the pen environment that are available for carry-over of infection. Assuming this mechanism then we don't explicitly model the emptying of a pen for 1, QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Given that the flow of pigs is rather regimented within the model, then modelling the inactivation of the Salmonella , rather than the emptiness of the pen, is an efficient way to capture this intervention. From published studies we have assumed that Salmonella will be inactivated at a rate of 0.4 logs per day, and assume, conservatively, that this rate will also be applicable during downtime. We run the model assuming a 1, 4 and 7 day downtime, or a 0.4, 1.6 and 2.8 log reduction in Salmonella numbers per pen between each batch of pigs across weaning, growing and finishing houses. We currently assume that cleaning of pens after each batch is ineffective in removing all Salmonella (most commonly between 20-90% of Salmonella being removed during cleaning, assuming that cleaning separates a proportion of the Salmonella from the faecal material). Therefore if a pen is highly contaminated a potentially significant level of Salmonella may be left behind, where a new batch of pigs entering the pen can be exposed to this residual contamination. There are no sufficiently comprehensive studies to directly estimate the effect of improved cleaning in removing Salmonella . However, a study by Small et al. 2007 suggests that between 1-2 logs improvement in reducing enterobactiacae numbers is possible through more robust cleaning methods such as pressure washing with sanitiser washing. We therefore assume that an improvement of cleaning will decrease the load within the pen by an additional 1 or 2 logs. These changes (average 1-log improvement and 2 log improvement) are represented in the model by replacing the baseline estimate for p clean by (Beta(3,50)) and (Beta(3,500)) respectively (where the modified beta parameterisation was achieved by simply adjusting the distributions until the averages were 1 and 2 orders of magnitude lower than the baseline average). The average reductions achieved by the baseline, 1 log and 2 log reduction models are 0.4, 0.04 and 0.004. Increased resistance (wet feed, vaccination, organic acids) As mentioned above, there are no sufficiently extensive intervention studies that provided enough information to confidently quantitatively model these interventions. A systematic review of vaccination was carried out by Denagamage et al. 2007. Their conclusions were that there were few studies that were relevant for assessing the effect of vaccination in reducing Salmonella levels in market age pigs. Five clinical trials were reported, none of which achieved a high score for methodology, and (for us) more importantly, the trials were not undertaken to the point of depopulation, therefore reducing the relevance to the QMRA. From these five studies there does appear to be a positive effect of vaccination in reducing Salmonella prevalence in pigs; however only one reports the actual prevalence in vaccinated and control groups (Maes et al. 2001). Of critical importance for assessing the effects of Salmonella vaccination in pigs is the concentration of Salmonella in faeces in infected but vaccinated pigs; no study so far has reported this effect. Introduction of organic acids and wet feed can be considered as manipulating the characteristics of the feed given to pigs in order to alter the gut ecology/microbiology such that Salmonella do not survive and multiply as easily within the digestive system (hence reducing the potential for infection). A recent systematic review of the published literature (O'Connor et al. 2008) assessed the evidence for both pH and moisture content of feed as methods that might control Salmonella (moisture content obviously relating to wet feed, and pH to both factors). They found little evidence for QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Recent studies on organic acids, not included in the systematic review, are also inconclusive on the effect of organic acids in reducing Salmonella in pigs at slaughter (VLA, 2009). Similar conclusions can also be made on non-pelleted feed (Lo Fo Wong & Hald 2000), where evidence does exist for a positive effect, but little data are available to conclusively prove and enumerate such an effect. Again, an important point missing from these studies is the effect on enumeration, rather than prevalence. The above information for feed does not allow us to assign quantitative values to our intervention analysis. However, as above, we can model the mechanism of intervention over plausible biological ranges. From the evidence available it appears that changing the pH of the feed/gut is fundamental in determining the dose response of the pig: reduce the pH and probability of infection given a particular dose is also reduced, leading to lower numbers of pigs that are Salmonella -positive. The underlying biological mechanisms for pH reducing Salmonella can be considered well-proven, at least experimentally: therefore, we assume Salmonella is inactivated at low pH levels (Hwang et al. 2009; Tiganitas et al. 2009). The variation in the results of the studies above, in our opinion, is more likely to represent variation in the methodology and the application of the intervention measure than the physical response to pH/moisture content of the Salmonella in the pig gut (although of course there will be a varying response from different Salmonella spp.). If this assumption is correct, then we can model the 100% correct application of these intervention measures to see their effect (whilst remembering that 100% correct application of acid concentrations etc is extremely unlikel y in practical farming conditions). This 100% assumption allows the best-case scenario to be assessed - the true effect will lie between the baseline and the best-case scenarios. We assess \"resistance\" interventions - vaccination, feed type or organic acids, via modification of the dose response model for slaughter pigs 37. The dose response model parameters were adjusted until there was roughly a 1 or 2 log increase in dose needed to cause the same probability of infection (essentially shifting the dose- response curve in Figure 7.9 along the axis by 1 or 2 logs). This can be approximated by re-parameterising DR to 200,235 and 2,000,235 respectively (using this method the difference in dose needed will vary across the dose range, but the modified dose-response curves, as can be seen from Figure 13.1, are relatively parallel to the baseline). See Figure 13.1 for the effect on the dose-response model. 37 The mechanisms for increased resistance are obviously different between vaccination and feed: vaccination stimulating the immune response of the pig, feed/organic acids changing the pH/organic acid make-up of the pig's digestive system, making a less favourable environment for Salmonella survival/colonisation. However, given we do not know the quantitative effect of each mechanism, we assume the qualitative effect is the same - it takes more Salmonella s to cause the same probability of pig infection.

The beta parameter of the beta-binomial model is adjusted until it takes around, on average, 1 or 2 more logs to cause the same average probability of infection as the baseline model. For clarity, only the average probability of infection is displayed. The dose-response model has already been modified for wet feed (see Section 7.4). 13.2.2 Transport Increased cleaning As per farm pen cleaning, little evidence is available to suggest what the effects of improved cleaning measures are. Small et al. (2007) tested the effectiveness of different cleaning measures. The results of these tests for commonly-used cleaning techniques (pressure washing and steam washing) are used in the baseline model. However, the most effective cleaning was pressure washing with sanitiser washing, which had an average 4.5 (+/-0.9) log10 initial reduction and 5.2 (+/-0.5) log10 reduction after one hour. This is a further 2 log reduction on the effect of pressure washing (used as the standard cleaning measure within the baseline model). Following these results we assume a 0.5, 1 and 2 log further reductions in Salmonella during cleaning of transport and lairage pens. This is implemented in the model by increasing the estimated reduction in Salmonella due to cleaning, E L, by a further 0.5, 1 or 2 logs respectively.

We modified the baseline code so that trucks were filled up to capacity with whatever pigs were next in line (as opposed to restricting to one batch of pigs per truck), thus allowing for the possibility that a truck will contain pigs from multiple farms and thus cross-contamination between clean and infected batches of pigs. Logistic slaughter (slaughtering highly-infected batches at the end of the day) Although this is a slaughterhouse intervention it is modelled within the Transport & Lairage module. Logistic slaughter is easy to implement in the current model if we use the actual bacteriological status of the pigs to assess whether a batch is \"high- risk\" or \"low-risk\". Instead of a completely random sampling from the farm matrices, we can randomly sample a day's allocation of batches to a slaughterhouse, and then sort the batches by the within-batch prevalence of lymph-node positive pigs, P LN(b), such that for each batch slaughtered that day, x1 to xn, then PLN(xn) > PLN(xn-1) > PLN(xn-2)... > PLN(x1). In reality logistic slaughter is carried out via a bacteriological or serological test at the herd level, such that high-risk herds, rather than high-risk batches, are slaughtered at the end of the day. Our representation represents a \"perfect\" test scenario, and indicates whether the practice of logistic slaughter, as a physical mechanism for preventing significant cross-contamination of carcasses, works or not. The application of a less than 100% sensitive or 100% specific herd test can be modelled if logistic slaughter is assessed to be a significant intervention. 13.2.3 Slaughter Hypothetical interventions Decontamination can be performed in several ways, using water or steam, optionally at high temperatures, or using added chemicals. Also, a new technique using ultrasound has been occasionally used. Irradiati on is very effective, but prohibited in the EU, as is adding chemicals. Decontam ination usually takes place after polishing or before (blast) chilling. We investigated the effect of a 1, 2 and 3 log decrease in exterior contamination, at an individual carcass level, at the point of pre-chill. Pre-chill was chosen as the final practical point along the slaughter line where intervention can occur. DG Sanco requested that only hypothetical reductions in carcass contamination were to be investigated, rather than specific interventions that would physically inactivate/remove Salmonella from the carcass. Hence the only specific intervention investigated was preventing faecal leakage. Reducing/preventing faecal leakage During dehairing and polishing, faecal material may exit via the rectum of the pig. This can also happen after the rectum is loosened, before belly opening. This introduces an extra amount of contamination on the machine and the exterior of the pig. According to Richards & Dodd (2009) it is common practice in Denmark, Norway and Sweden to seal off the rectum of the pig with a plastic bag after loosening. According to Borch et al. (1996), after polishing, the rectum is circumcised, loosened and bagged. This prevents any further leakage. Another option mentioned was the use of a stainless steel plug.

This intervention is modelled by simply setting amount of Salmonella within an infected pig's gut, c, to zero. 13.2.4 Multiple interventions In reality, the application of just one intervention is unlikely to achieve the elimination, or at least significant reduction, of Salmonella from the pig meat food chain, and a more practical approach will be the application of controls at different stages of the food chain. Indeed a comprehensive review of Salmonella in pigs (EFSA, 2006), which explored possible interventions across the farm-to-fork pathway, concluded that it was not possible to control Salmonella with the adoption of just one measure. In other words, the control of the Salmonella can only be achieved by the introduction of multiple interventions across the farm-to-consumption pathway. We therefore investigated the application of double interventions. The combinations chosen were based on the results of the individual intervention analyses for specific intervention measures. 13.3 Results 13.3.1 Hypothetical interventions As discussed above, hypothetical interventions describe the effect of reducing some important factor/parameter within the food chain/model, but without defining what intervention might achieve a reduction. The effect of reducing slaughter pig prevalence, as described above, is shown inFigure 13.2. Reducing slaughter pig prevalence is deemed to be effective in reducing the number of human cases per year for each case study MS. Indeed for MS2, which has a high baseline slaughter pig prevalence, there is a strong linear relationship between reduction in slaughter pig prevalence and reduction in the number of cases. This linear relationship also exists for MS4, but less so for MS3 and MS1. Further discussion on these results are included in Section 3.4. Breeding pig herd prevalence has already been established as a significant factor within the model via sensitivity analysis - broadly speaking, low breeding pig herd prevalence (low number of positive piglets) equals low slaughter pig prevalence and vice versa . The reason for this is that breeding pig herd prevalence has already been shown to dominate the risk of positive pigs at slaughter to a degree that the trend in the change of breeding pig herd prevalence will outweigh all other factors. The result of the breeding pig herd analysis is shown in Figure 13.3. This analysis looks at a broad range of plausible breeding pig herd prevalences (as taken from the EFSA breeding survey), but uses the farm management systems of MS4. The trend observed with this MS4 management model will be much the same as it will for the other three MSs. It is clear from Figure 13.3 that for MS4 breeding pig herd prevalence is predicted to be strongly correlated with slaughter pig prevalence, and hence is also strongly correlated with the risk of illness in humans.

Figure 13.2: Effect of reducing slaughter pig prevalence from 5 to 99% of the baseline national pig prevalence estimated within the baseline model, for each product type and for each case study MS (pork cuts - blue, minced meat - green and fermented sausage - red). y axes are inverted for clarity. Reductions in national pig prevalence are achieved by reducing the number of infected pigs within each batch according to a binomial trial, where the probability of \"success\" (i.e. subtracting a positive pig), p = {0.05,..0.99}. Hence, the number of infected pigs subtracted from an individual batch varies, but across all batches sent to slaughter the average reduction will converge to p. Small variations in the downward trend can be seen, for MS1 and MS3 in particular; these are due to sampling error within the Monte- Carlo simulations. We also investigated the effect of a 1,2 or 3 log reduction in contamination of the carcass pre-chill. The results are presented in Figure 13.4. A clear trend is observed, in that a reduction between 1-2 logs is enough to achieve maximum reductions that could be achieved with decontamination interventions at these stages.

However, we have investigated the effect of manipulating the mechanisms that we believe influence the interventions.

For each MS, a log reduction of 2 logs appears to be sufficient to reduce cases due to pork cuts and sausages by approximately 60-80%. Farm At the farm level we were asked to investigate reducing number of suppliers, increased downtime, increased cleaning efficiency, reduction of feed contamination, acidification of feed/water and vaccination. Increased downtime and increased cleaning have been investigated separately according to the different mechanisms involved. We assume the mechanism for acidification and vaccination has approximately the same effect - i.e. that more Salmonella s are required to cause infection (which we can model by modifying the dose response model). Increased cleaning/downtime While the mechanisms for removing Salmonella are different for downtime and cleaning, the effect is similar - a reduction in the Salmonella levels present in a pen at the point where a new batch of pigs enters the pen. The effect of reducing the contamination level at the point of pen population is given in Figure 13.5. There is a marked effect of reducing contamination levels before pen re-population, especially if levels up to 2 logs can be achi eved. However, at present it is unlikely that average cleaning efficiency can be improved to achieve this 2-log reduction. The effect of downtime is very similar (if achieved by different means), because the number of days chosen 3 and 6, correspond to a 1.2 and 2.4 log reduction in contamination levels. Therefore downtime could also have a positive effect if pens are left empty for 3+ days (we have used a conservative value for the D-value; the drying effect of downtime means the D-value is probably higher.

Increasing resistance of the pig (vaccination, organic acids) Within the model, the resistance of the pig to infection is governed by the probability of infection given ingestion of a particular dose. Modifying the dose-response relationship for ALL pigs at ALL stages of production across a MS will produce a similar trend in results for each MS, therefore we show only MS4 (see Figure 13.6). 0 1 20 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100% reduction in human cases 0 1 200.020.04 Slaughter pig prevalencePork cuts Minced meat Feremented sausage Slaughter pig prevalence Figure 13.5: Effect on national pig prevalence at slaughter by reducing contamination in pen by 0.5, 1 or 2 logs before re-population of pen. 1 log and 2 log levels are broadly equivalent to 3 and 6 days downtime respectively (MS4 only).

MS4 shown. It is clear that a modest 1-log increase in the dose needed to cause the average probability of infection will have a significant effect (~ 90% for all product types) in reducing slaughter pig prevalence and subsequently the human risk of illness. It must be remembered that this is the effect of consistently modifying the dose- response relationship for all pigs at all stages of production - something which has yet to be shown to be practical for such interventions as vaccination or organic acids. There is stronger evidence that feed type might have an effect, but still whether a significant (e.g. 1-log) increase in the dose needed to cause infection can be achieved is debatable. A further log increase in dose needed to produce the same baseline probability of illness doesn't have the same magnitude of effect, and the published literature suggests this may well be unobtainable with current interventions. Varying probability of feed contamination The effects of reducing feed contamination are shown for MS4 and MS1 in Figure. MS1 was also investigated for this analysis due to the identified importance of feed (see Figure 7.11).

Shown on log scale to clearly show the greater effect increasing feed contamination has on MS1 compared to MS4. There is a relatively linear relationship between slaughter prevalence of feed contamination and slaughter pig prevalence (and the human risk of illness) for both MS1 and MS4, although there is a steeper gradient for MS1 (meaning, as suspected, that feed is relatively more important in MS1 than MS4). Transport Logistic transport Transporting more than one batch of pigs in one transport vehicle had minimal effect on slaughter pig prevalence, and hence risk of human illness, for any MS. Logistic slaughter The effect of slaughtering high-risk batches at the end of the slaughter day was negligible on slaughter pig prevalence, and hence risk of human illness, for any MS. This is because the vast majority of cross-contamination during transport occurs within the same batch, rather than between batches of pigs. Increased cleaning at transport Increased cleaning techniques (producing a 0.5, 1 or 2 log reduction in transport contamination before loading of pigs) had minimal effect on slaughter pig prevalence, and hence risk of human illness, for any MS.

Change to wet feed and 1 log decontamination pre-chill 5. 1 log modification of dose-response with 1 log decontamination pre-chill 6. 6 day downtime with 1 log decontamination pre-chill The same methodologies for the singular interventions were used, but simply applied in tandem as relevant. The results are shown in Figure 13.8. The combination of interventions can, if applied judiciously, produce reductions greater than the sum of the individual interventions alone. The major reason for this is that both interventions (e.g. changing farms to wet feed and applying a 1-log decontamination step pre-chill) will affect the contamination level of carcasses. Using MS4 wet feed example, it just so happens that the combination of these two interventions decrease the average concentration on the carcass into the range where significant changes in doses ingested and/or dose-response will occur, leading to a greater increase in the reductions of cases (see Figure 13.4). The application of a decontamination step, regardless of farm intervention, appears a worthwhile intervention, especially if able to decrease contamination levels by 2 logs or more.

The effects of multiple interventions for minced meat and fermented sausage were similar. The application of intervention combinations can be much greater than the effect of each intervention applied individually, for example wet feed and decontamination pre-chill. 13.4 Discussion We have implemented a number of hypothetical interventions in order to investigate the effect of reducing slaughter pig prevalence, breeding pig herd prevalence and finally carcass contamination in reducing the number of human cases per year within the case study MSs attributable to each of the three product types respectively. These hypothetical interventions correspond to the EFSA ToRs for interventions. In addition, we have also investigated the ability of differing specific interventions in achieving the percentage reductions assumed within the hypothetical interventions. We were not able to model the absolute effect of specific interventions, such as vaccination or the feeding of organic acids, due to extreme quantitative data paucity in the area of farm interventions for Salmonella in pigs. In order to implement any of the interventions we have assumed two critical factors: (1) that uptake of each intervention is 100% across all farms/slaughterhouses across MS, and (2) that each intervention would be implemented in such a way to produce the effect desired (e.g. reducing carcass contamination by 1 log, or raising the dose needed to cause a particular probability of infection). Qualitative evidence (VLA, 2009) and expert opinion suggest that uptake and efficient application would be nowhere near 100% in reality. We would strongly advise field studies to assess these two factors. The hypothetical interventions investigated are illuminating.

This is a positive result as it does suggest that control will be effective across the whole of the food chain. Breeding pig herd prevalence is a strong indicator for slaughter pig prevalence (validated in some part by the results of the EU-wide baseline surveys in breeding and slaughter pig surveys), which in turn is a strong indicator of human risk. Hence, by reducing breeding pig herd prevalence major reductions in the number of human cases can be achieved. Greater reductions can be achieved when breeding pig herd prevalence is high, e.g. for MS2. As the sensitivity analysis for the farm suggested (Figure 7.16), the most important factor within the model was the amount of Salmonella the pigs (either sows or slaughter pigs) were shedding. Therefore to reduce slaughter pig prevalence the number of infected piglets entering the weaning stage must be reduced. Once the number of infected pigs entering the weaning stage is reduced, then feed and external sources of contamination (e.g. rodents) become more important. This does therefore suggest that as a first step, if breeding pig herd prevalence is high it should be controlled as a first measure - feed and external contamination of finishing pigs can then have a positive effect once breeding pig herd infection is reduced to low levels (perhaps below 5-10%). Reducing slaughter pig prevalence is also effective in reducing the number of human cases per year for each case study MS. Indeed for MS2, which has a high baseline slaughter pig prevalence, there is a strong linear relationship between reduction in slaughter pig prevalence and reduction in the number of cases. This linear relationship also exists for MS4, but less so for MS3 and MS1. This result is perhaps counter-intuitive, if cross-contamination and growth have a significant role to play at the slaughterhouse and cutting plant/retail. However, the relationship between lymph-node prevalence at slaughter and the prevalence of carcass contamination during the slaughterhouse is yet to be fully proven. A Danish study (Dahl, 2009) suggests that there appears to be a strongly non-linear relationship between the number of sero-positive pigs and the % of positive pooled swabs at pre-chill, but a more representative sample to compare against this model is the % of lymph-node positive pigs and % of contaminated carcasses at evisceration. EFSA (2008a) investigated this as part of their analysis of the slaughter pig baseline survey data, and found what appears to be a modest linear relationship between the two at the slaughterhouse level. Further investigation of the model results shows that there is also a linear relationship between the percentage reduction at slaughter and the percentage reduction in the average prevalence and load of contamination on retail products. Of course, there are factors that may well invalidate this linear relationship past the slaughterhouse (growth at retail, cross-contamination at cutting plant/retail), but there is no information to support/disagree with this at a MS (or large-scale study) level. From a modelling perspective, the results are logical and intuitive. The main factor determining risk of illness does appear to be the gross contamination (i.e. large numbers of CFUs per carcass) of a carcass at some stage during the slaughterhouse phase, where such gross contamination (usually via faecal leakage from a heavily- infected pig) then cross-contaminates a substantial number of carcasses further down the line (from 10-50). These gross contamination events are infrequent and highly localised (invariably within a batch). At an individual farm/slaughterhouse level, there will be wide variation in the response of the model to the differing percentage reductions investigated. However, averaging over MSs and time (as for the intervention analysis) then the effect of reducing the number of lymph-node positive pigs entering the slaughterhouse by x% simply reduces the number of gross- QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Translating these reductions through the rest of the model, a linear relationship will exist in the percentage reduction in cases, as the gradient of the human dose-response model used within the QMRA over the range of average doses produced from the hypothetical interventions (0.05-0.5 logs) is relatively linear. Therefore, in summary, we believe the current results from the intervention analysis for slaughter pig prevalence are sufficiently representative to at least draw the broad conclusion that intervention at the farm s hould produce reductions in human illness, and that interestingly reductions in human cases appear to be linear to reductions in slaughter pig prevalence. However, how these large reductions (10-90%) can be achieved is less certain (see later). Marked reductions can be achieved by applying some decontamination measure, or reducing faecal leakage, at the slaugh terhouse. An intervention that could consistently achieve a 1 log decontamination of carcasses pre-chill could reduce the number of cases up to 20-40% in low-prevalence MSs (MS1, MS3, MS4), but further reductions (up to 2 logs) would be needed in other MSs with higher prevalence (i.e. MS2), as the initial contamination levels are predicted to be higher in these MSs. Further reductions can be achieved by further reducing concentrations on carcasses at pre-chill (e.g. a reduction of 3 logs) with all MSs resulting with a very high reduction (95-100%) in their number of cases. Non-chemical interventions have already been shown to produce reductions in the order of 1-2 logs (Christiansen et al. 2009; James 2009), and hence could be a viable short-term measure for reducing illness in humans if they are shown to be as effective if scaled up to be applied across a MS's slaughterhouses (given interventions at the farm level (e.g. vaccines) are likely to take years before real reductions are achieved). In contrast, evidence that specific farm and transport interventions work consistently is sparse, if non-existent, presumably due to the more complex environment in which these interventions will have to be applied, and the difficulty in standardising experiments to trial interventions. Hence, while the evidence for consistent effects is lacking, some farm interventions may well be effective. This was the conclusion of Denagamage et al. 2007 for vaccination, but no quantitative effect was able to be shown. This lack of evidence for a consistent and/or quantitative effect meant that specific farm interventions could not be modelled. Therefore, in order to provide some assessment of farm interventions, we have only modelled the effect of the varying mechanisms applied to farm interventions (e.g. modifying the dose-response for vaccination, lowering the contamination of pens for cleaning). The results of these farm interventions suggest that farm interventions could work, although the significant reductions that would be required to achieve the same effect as slaughterhouse interventions would be unlikely for any single farm intervention. Large reduction of slaughter pig prevalence were not seen in the literature for any of the current farm interventions. In addition, transport interventions, even assuming 100% uptake and 100% compliance/effectiveness, would not seem to make a significant difference in the rates of human illness. On the farm, increased cleaning or downtime would have an effect in reducing slaughter pig prevalence, and hence human illness, if contamination levels in pens immediately before re-population were brought down by around 1-2 logs. Whether this reduction in contamination could be achieved consistently over all farms (especially in older buildings) is open to debate. Downtime would seem to be a more reliable way to achieve this reduction (as it relies on simply allowing the drying out of QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Modifying the dose-response model by 1-2 logs, as described above, produces a significant effect in reducing slaughter pig prevalence and human illness. The effect modelled is by a constant modification of the dose-response relationship, and hence current intervention trials where the application of organic acids or vaccination is applied only over limited timeframes are unlikely to achieve similar reductions in slaughter pig prevalence. Therefore, more promising interventions may be changing feed type, as this can be applied over weaning-finishing, and applying organic acids over the whole course of production. Vaccination may be effective in reducing infection in pigs over the entire production timeframe, but only if applied properly. Reducing feed contamination can have a measurable effect in reducing slaughter pig prevalence, and hence human illness, even where breeding pig herd prevalence is high, as in MS2. A greater relative effect can be seen for MS3 and MS1 where breeding pig herd prevalence is lower. As for all interventions, the magnitude of effect that can be achieved in reality is very uncertain, given we do not really know what the prevalence or contamination levels of feed contamination are across the EU. One option would be to change the method of feed production, as some methods are significantly more associated with Salmonella infection (EFSA 2008b). In summary, the farm and transport interventions are likely to vary in their ability to change slaughter pig prevalence by a sufficient amount to change illness numbers in humans. However, a combination of interventions applied across a large proportion of farms is likely to have a cumulative effect in reducing slaughter pig prevalence. Probably of extreme importance, but not investigated here, is the rate of uptake and correct application of interventions by farmers - if this is not universal across a MS the effect in reducing human illness will be proportionally reduced. The model results lead us to suggest that those MSs with a high breeding pig herd prevalence should focus on these herds in order to reduce the burden of infected new stock entering the weaning/growing/finishing stages, although of course that doesn't mean taking efforts to control Salmonella post-weaning won't also be beneficial. However, it may be more efficient in MSs with a low breeding pig herd prevalence to focus their attentions on feed and other sources of infection. In all likelihood Salmonella control in pig production will be implemented at various stages. We have investigated three combinations of interventions, using either wet feed, increasing resistance or downtime along with a decontamination measure at pre-chill. A decontamination step achieves a 20% or greater reduction for MS4; while not explicitly investigated, the effect of decontamination is probably even greater in MS3 where a 1 log decontamination step achieves around a 40% reduction (see Figure 13.4). Certain combinations of interventions are likely to produce even greater reductions than the effects of individually-applied interventions. However, the specific combination of interventions that achieve greater reductions together are dependent on the situation within a particular MS, in particular the contamination levels of carcasses. Investigation of such beneficial combinations can be done with the current QMRA model; the myriad combinations possible prevented us from investigating all of these, but MSs will be able to interrogate potential combinations of interventions if/when the baseline model has been parameterised for their country. From the current evidence, it would appear that specific slaughterhouse interventions are, at present, more likely to produce greater and more reliable reductions in human illness, at least in a shorter timeframe than can be achieved at the farm.

The economic, social and public-health importance of these diseases has motivated many countries to implement surveillance and intervention strategies to control foodborne illnesses, particularly foodborne zoonoses (Wegener et al ., 2003; EFSA, 2009). However, a precise evaluation of the effect of such interventions is difficult, partly due to the lack of information of the public-health impact of specific sources on the incidence of foodborne infections. The ability to attribute cases of human disease to specific reservoirs, food vehicles or other responsible sources is, therefore, recognised as critical for the identification and prioritisation of food safety interventions (Batz et al., 2005; Havelaar et al., 2007; Pires et al., 2009). Efforts to quantify the importance of specific sources for human illness are gathered under the term \"source attribution\" or \"human illness source attribution\" and can be defined as the process of determining the proportion of a particular disease that is acquired from a given source (e.g. chicken) and potentially through a given pathway (e.g. food or direct animal contact). Several methods for source attribution have been described, including microbiological approaches, epidemiological approaches, intervention studies and expert elicitations. For a full review of approaches for sources attribution readers are referred to Pires et al. (2009) and EFSA (2008a). Salmonellosis is one of the most common and widely distributed foodborne diseases in Europe. All serovars of Salmonella are potentially pathogenic for humans, but the degree of host adaptation varies, which affects the pathogenicity. Non-typhoid and ubiquitous serovars, such as S. Typhimurium and S. Infantis, affect both humans and a wide range of animals, and are those with principal zoonotic significance. Although these serovars in principle are non-host -adapted, strong associations between certain serovars or phage types within a serovar and a given animal reservoir may occur e.g. S. Enteridis in laying hens. In contrast, there exist a group of serovars that a highly adapted to an animal host e.g. S. Cholerasuis in pigs, S. Dublin in cattle, S. Abortus-ovis in sheep, and S. Gallinarum in poultry. These serovars only occasionally infect humans, where they may produce no, mild or serious disease (Acha and Szyfres, 1987). In this chapter, Salmonella serovar and phage typing data collected as part of the EU-wide Baseline Surveys (BS) conducted in the period from 2005-2008 as well as data reported by the EU Member States in 2005-2008 published in the Community Summary Reports (CSRs), were analysed to make inferences about the most important sources of human salmonellosis in EU, as well as to highlight regional differences. No Member State specific data on the distribution of serovars in humans was available, meaning that it was not possible to develop a source attribution model estimating the quantitative contribution from each animal-food source based on the subtyping data. As an alternative the relative contribution of different sources to human disease was quantified using an analysis of data from outbreaks reported in the EU in 2005 and 2006.

For slaughter pigs, lymph node samples and carcass swabs were considered as herd and carcass level, respectively. The 2008 BS on the prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter in broiler carcasses provided data for the carcass level in broilers. The study design, sampling schemes and data collection methods can be found in the respective BS survey has been conducted in cattle and beef, consequently, we obtained data on this reservoir from the Community Summary Report in 2007 (CSR) (EFSA, 2009a). Information on phage types was provided for a limited number of isolates of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium, and not by all countries. The relative frequencies were calculated for all available data in each reservoir and in humans, but in the Netherlands a different phage typing scheme for S. Typhimurium was used, consequently showing a different set of phage types when compared with other countries. The serovar distribution of reported human cases and S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium phage types was collected from the (EFSA, 2006; EFSA, 2007d, EFSA, 2009a; EFSA, 2010). Published data corresponds to the top 10 serovars causing human disease each year and the most frequent S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium phage types in all reporting countries. Data were aggregated at the EU level, meaning that no country-specific data were available. All data were analysed and compared by simple frequency distributions and, when possible, utilised for making inferences about the most important sources of human salmonellosis. To estimate relative frequencies, the numerator was the number of units (herds, flocks or samples) positive for a specific serovar and the denominator was the number of positive units. In the relative frequency graphs, \"Not typeable\" and \"Salmonella spp, unspecified\" were excluded in order to show the distribution among known serovars. Thus, values shown on top of the bars are the total number of units given an unambiguously named serovar. Data were stored and analyzed in SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Institute., SAS/STAT\u00ae User's Guide, Version 8, Cary, NC: SAS Institute Inc., 1999. 14.2.2 Spatial analysis Prevalence data from the BS in laying hens, broilers, slaughter pigs and turkeys in the EU were utilised for the of the serovar distributions was limited to the country level, as the location (coordinates) of the individual holdings participating in the studies was not available. Also, the lymph node samples representing slaughter pigs were collected at the slaughterhouse. ArcGIS 9.3 was used to create maps showing the distribution of the most frequently identified Salmonella serovars among MS and non-MS participating in the baseline studies. In order to standardize animal sources at herd/flock level, we used data from laying hen flocks, broiler flocks, fattening turkey flocks, and slaughter pigs (lymph node samples).

The Moran's I test measures the spatial global correlation, indicating whether the evaluated Salmonella prevalences were globally clustered or dispersed. In order to explore the specific location of potential spatial clusters, the local cluster detection test was used. The presence and location of local clusters were investigated for all evaluated serovars, since even in the absence of significant global spatial autocorrelation, clusters at the local level may still occur. The local cluster test estimated the probability that the frequency of events per trial at each vertex surpasses the expected frequency by chance. SaTScan uses ellipses and a non-parametric test statistic. It takes into account the observed number of cases inside and outside the ellipse when calculating the highest likelihood for each ellipse. SaTScan tests the null hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis that there is an elevated rate of cases within the windows as compared to the outside. The method uses the likelihood ratio as the test statistic. The significance of the test statistic is determined by a large number of replications of the data set generated under the null hypothesis in a Monte Carlo simulation. The likelihood ratio for each replica is computed, and the result is significant at the 0.05 level if the value of the real data set is among the top 5% of all the values, including the replicas. The Poisson model was chosen, which requires information about the estimated number of Salmonella positive holdings or samples in each country and animal population data. The estimated number of positive cases of each evaluated Salmonella serovar was calculated from the estimated prevalence. All estimated Salmonella positive holdings or samples were geocoded to the centroid of its respective country. The maximum window size was defined here as 50% of the cases and 999 replications were performed. The cluster analyses were performed separately for the results obtained by each baseline survey (laying hens, broilers, fattening turkeys and slaughter pigs). Only the most likely cluster is displayed in this analysis. The SaTScan output was imported into Arc GIS 9.3 to create maps of the identified clusters. 14.2.3 Source attribution using outbreak data Human foodborne illnesses may be attributed to the responsible sources by analysing of data collected through outbreak investigations (Grieg et al., 2009). Foodborne outbreak data are usually freely available to the public and may provide detailed information over several years (EFSA, 2006; EFSA, 2007d; EFSA 2009b). In addition, these data are observed at the public health point which gives important information to the authorities for immediate control of individual events (EFSA 2008a). A simple analysis of foods implicated in outbreaks could be sufficient to estimate the proportion of cases that can be attributable to different food types (Adak et al, 2005; EFSA 2008f). However, often the food implicated in the outbreak is a complex food containing several food items, which leads to the necessity of using methods that analyse the relative contribution of each food category to the burden of human disease (Painter et al. , 2006; Pires, 2009). A source attribution analysis using data from outbreak investigations was conducted to estimate the relative contribution of food sources to human salmonellosis in EU. Data on Salmonella outbreaks from 2005 and 2006 were supplied by EFSA, which in collaboration with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Salmonella was the most common zoonotic agent in foodborne outbreaks reported in the EU, being responsible for 64% and 54% of all reported outbreaks in 2005 and 2006. These outbreaks affected more than 22,700 people in each year, of which 14% were admitted to hospital (Table 14.1) (EFSA, 2006; EFSA, 2007d). For cases for which specific information of the location of exposure was available, restaurant outbreaks affected around 80% more people than outbreaks in family homes in 2005, whereas in 2006 household outbreaks represented 47% of the total Salmonella outbreaks. All Salmonella outbreaks reported by MS and non-MS were used as input data in the analysis, including confirmed and suspected outbreaks as well as outbreaks where evidence for an implicated source was not provided (source unknown). Implicated foods were reported based on epidemiological and/or laboratory evidence. Analytical epidemiological evidence corresponds to evidence of a statistically significant association between a food item (foodstuff) and the human cases in the food-borne outbreak, demonstrated by either a cohort study or a case-control study. Descriptive epidemiological evidence corresponds to information linking two or more persons with clinical symptoms consistent with the same disease, with a possible food vehicle in common. Laboratory evidence implies that the causative agent was detected by laboratory methods in the food source (e.g. in leftovers or ingredients) or in the food production and preparation environment (EFSA, 2007e). Serotype and phage type information was provided for a part of the Salmonella related outbreaks reported by the MS. In the study period, 54% of the causative agents were serotyped and 17% were phage typed. When no specific serotype was reported, the pathogen was classified as Salmonella spp. S. Enteritidis was the predominant Salmonella serovar associated with outbreaks and accounted for 56% of all reported outbreaks where serotyping was performed.

The main category general outbreaks included all outbreaks that took place outside a private home ( household outbreaks ). Reported outbreaks associated with travelling abroad were analyzed separately and were not attributed to any of the specific sources. Travelling abroad is not considered to constitute a source/route of exposure by itself, as the main sources described will also apply for travellers. However, because information on the implicated foods was lacking, attribution of these cases to a specific source was not possible. In addition, information on the destination was not repo rted making it impossible to assign illnesses to be acquired within and outside the EU. Outbreak cases with travel history were thus attributed to a separate category travel . Figure 14.1 Hierarchical scheme for categorising the location of the outbreak. 14.3.2 Food categorisation Food items were categorized using the hierarchical scheme presented in Figure 14.2. Foods that contained only one category (e.g. steak contains beef; fruit salad contains fruit, even though it contains multiple fruits) were considered \"simple foods\", while foods containing ingredients belonging to different categories (e.g. meatloaf contains beef, egg, bread, and spices) were considered \"complex foods\". Each implicated food was assigned to one or more mutually exclusive food categories, according to its ingredients. For outbreaks caused by complex foods for which ingredients were unavailable, an ingredient list was obtained by a review of recipes on the World Wide Web, as described by Painter et al. (2006): the top three recipes from a Google search were selected; when recipes were conflicting, the ingredients listed in at least two of the three recipes were included. Non-reported sources of infection were classified as unknown . Categories belonging to the main group \"land animals\" were in some cases grouped together in meat and poultry , depending on the level of detail of information available.

Hierarchical scheme for categorising food items into commodities within the main animal reservoirs. 14.3.3 Attribution of outbreak-related cases to specific sources For the majority of the dataset, the data were organized so that one observation corresponded to one outbreak. For each observation, information on the year of occurrence, country, number of ill people, hospitalisations and fatalities associated with the outbreak, travel information, location of the outbreak, and implicated source was included. When any of the fields was incomplete, the parameter was included as missing or unknown . Analyses of the data were complicated by the fact that some countries report aggregated outbreak data. In the analyzed period, 5.2% of the Salmonella outbreaks were reported in an aggregated form. To include these aggregated data in the dataset, an additional variable was introduced: \"number of outbreaks\". For simple-food outbreaks, all illnesses were attributed to a single food category. For complex-food outbreaks, illnesses were partitioned to each implicated category relative to the proportion of illnesses attributed to each of the categories in outbreaks caused by simple foods. As a result, illnesses in an outbreak due to a complex food were only attributed to categories that had been implicated in at least one outbreak due to a simple food. As an example, outbreak-associated illnesses caused by lasagne would be attributed to the categories dairy, beef, vegetables, grains and beans, and oils and sugar. If any of these categories was not implicated in any outbreak caused by simple foods, the category would be excluded from the analysis of the attribution of illnesses to the separate ingredients composing the complex food. For categories implicated also in simple food outbreaks, the proportion of illnesses in complex food outbreaks was estimated based on the number of illnesses caused by the categories involved in simple foods-outbreaks and the sum of illnesses caused by all the commodities that composed the food (see example in Table 14.2). The total number of illnesses caused by each category in simple and complex food outbreaks was then summed, and the proportion of illnesses attributed to each source was estimated on the basis of the total number of illnesses analysed. The proportion of reported human illnesses attributable to specific sources was estimated both on the basis of the number of reported outbreaks of salmonellosis QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

The first analysis was performed in an attempt to explore for potential overestimations of the proportion of disease attributed to sources that caused large outbreaks, e.g. egg-associated outbreaks. The proportion of hospitalisations and fatalities linked to Salmonella outbreaks attributed to specific sources was also estimated. The attribution estimates (in %) based on the number of outbreaks was multiplied with the total number of sporadic cases reported in EU to estimate the number of sporadic cases by source. The number of reported outbreak-related cases was then added to the output of this analysis, either to the specific sources implicated in the outbreaks or to \"outbreaks with unknown source\". The underlying assumption of this final step was that each outbreak contributes with one case to the total number of sporadic cases. To illustrate potential regional differences within Europe, separate analyses for the 4 United Nations regions were performed (as available in http://www.un.org/depts/dhl/maplib/worldregions.htm ). Table 14.3 shows the regions and countries belonging to each.

Using this approach we assumed that the data were a random sample of outbreaks within the population of interest. For each source attribution analysis, we used a set of 10,000 replications obtained from the original data. The source attribution estimations were performed using each replication separately (totally 10,000 analyses), and the 10,000 estimates of each parameter were used to obtain the bootstrap distribution of the parameter of interest. The 95% confidence intervals for the parameters were then given by the two QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Data were stored and analyzed in SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Insitute., SAS/STAT\u00ae User's Guide, Version 8, Cary, NC: SAS Institute Inc., 1999 14.3.5 Source attribution modeling using microbial subtyping data The principle of the subtyping method is to compare the subtypes of isolates from different sources (e.g., animals, food) with the same subtypes isolated from humans. The microbial subtyping approach is enabled by the identification of strong associations between some of the dominant subtypes and a specific reservoir or source, providing a heterogeneous distribution of subtypes among the sources. The approach utilizes a collection of temporally and spatially related isolates from various sources, and thus it is facilitated by an integrated foodborne disease surveillance programme that is focused on the collection of isolates from the major food animal reservoirs of foodborne diseases (Pires et al. , 2009). This method typically focuses on sporadic cases and attributes infections to the reservoir level, meaning that the original infectious source is identified, whereas the route from reservoir (primary production) to consumer is not described. The results have provided information for the implementation and evaluation of control strategies in the major reservoirs (Wegener et al. , 2003; EFSA 2008b). Several developed countries including EU MS have implemented laboratory-based surveillance and monitoring programmes for Salmonella infections in humans and in the main food-reservoir animals (Wegener et al., 2003; Hopp, 1999; Korsgaard et al. 2009; EFSA, 2009a). However, the extracted data is often not comparable between countries due to differences in sampling schemes and analytical methods. This highlights the importance of initiatives like the EU-wide Baseline Surveys for Salmonella organised by the EU Commission in collaboration with the Member States and EFSA. For this report, we originally intended to develop a hierarchical source attribution model based on the principles described by Pires & Hald (2009) using MS-specific animal and food data from the EU baseline surveys and human data as reported by the MS to The European Surveillance System (TESSy). However, this idea was abandoned, since MS-specific data on the distribution of serovar and phage types in humans was not available. As an alternative, we made some descriptive comparisons of animal, food and human data as described above. The results were supplemented with results from the spatial and outbreak data analyses, and all results were discussed in an attempt to make inferences and rank the most important sources of human salmonellosis in EU.

As mentioned before, it was assumed that lymph node samples represent the occurrence of Salmonella at herd level (although estimation of herd prevalences were not possible), and carcass swabs represent the slaughterhouse level. Twenty- five MS and Norway participated in this study. The overall EU lymph node-prevalence was estimated to 10.3% (95% CI: 9.2-11.5%) varying from 0% to 29% among MSs. Data on carcass swabs were submitted by 13 MS, resulting in an overall EU prevalence of 8.3% (95% CI: 6.3-11%) varying from 0% to 20% among MSs. The most frequent serovar isolated from lymph nodes and carcass swabs was S. Typhimurium (40% and 49% of positive samples, respectively) followed by S. Derby (14% and 24% of positive samples, respectively). These serovars were widely distributed in EU occurring in most MSs, where Salmonella was isolated from pigs or pork. S. Enteritidis was on the top-ten serovar list among both lymph node samples and carcass swabs, and although the absolute prevalence in most MSs was low, S. Enteritidis appeared to be more prevalent in Eastern European countries corresponding to the MS clusters represented by MS3 and the MS4 in the QMRA (see Chapter 6). The frequencies of the most important serovars in humans and each of the investigated animal sources are presented in Figures 14.3-14.4, where the latter presents serovars other than S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium to facilitate visualization of the distribution of less frequent serovars. . 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.0100.0 Pig Lymph Pig Carcass Laying Hens Broiler flocks Broiler carcassesFat Turkeys HumansSalmonella serovar distribution in humans and animal sources (%)Others S.

Laying-hen flocks (holdings) Twenty-three MS and Norway took part of the BS in laying hens conducted between 2004 and 2005. The overall EU holding prevalence was estimated to 30.8% (95% CI: 29.8-31.8%) varying between 0% and 79.5% between MSs. A particularity for this study was that several types of samples were used, including pooled-faeces from dropping belts, followed by boot swabs, and dust or faeces from different locations in the production system. A holding was assumed positive if one or more samples were found positive (EFSA, 2007a). The most prevalent and most widely distributed serovar in laying hens was S. Enteritidis, which occurred in 18.3% of holdings (59.9% of positive holdings) and was found in 18 MSs. S. Typhimurium had an overall EU holding prevalence of 2.6% (8.3% of positive holding) and was found in 15 MSs. S. Infantis was the second most frequently occurring serovar. It was isolated from 11.5% of the positive holdings from 13 MSs. The frequencies of the most important serovars in humans and each of the investigated animal sources are presented in Figure 14.3-14.4. Broiler flocks and carcasses The BS in broiler flocks was conducted between 2005 and 2006, with 23 Members States and Norway participating. The overall EU flock prevalence was estimated to 23.7% (95% CI: 23-24.5%) varying from 0% to 68% among MSs. The BS on the prevalence of Salmonella in broiler carcasses was conducted in 2008 with 26 participating Member States. The overall EU prevalence of contaminated broiler carcasses was 15.7% (95% CI: 13.7-18%) ranging from S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis were clearly the most frequently reported serovars in broiler flocks in the EU, being reported in 37% and 20% of positive flocks and from 17 and 14 MSs, respectively. The next most frequently observed serovars were S. Mbandaka (in 7.9% of flocks in 12 MSs), S. Typhimurium (in 4.6% of flocks in 15 MSs), and S. Hadar (4.1% and 8 MSs). Although S. Virchow was found in only 2.1% QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

In broiler carcasses, S. Enteritidis, S. Infantis, S. Typhimurium, S. Mbandaka and S. Agona were the most widely spread serovars occurring in 10-15 MSs. Overall, the serovar distribution mirrored the distribution in broiler flocks, although some serovars tended to be more clustered - or not as wide spread as compared to the broiler flocks. The latter means that the overall serovar distribution in some instances was hugely driven by the dominant occurrence of a specific serovar in one or a few countries. For example, S. Infantis was isolated from 358 positive broiler carcasses, but 269 of these isolates was from a single MS. Likewise, S. Kentucky was isolated from 76 carcasses, where 68 isolates were from three MSs and 39 of these were from only one MS. The frequencies of the most important serovars in humans and each of the investigated animal sources are presented in Figure 14.3-14.4. Turkey flocks The BS in fattening turkeys was conducted between 2006 and 2007. Twenty-two MS and Norway participated in the survey and Salmonella was reported from turkey fattening flocks in 19 countries. The overall EU flock prevalence was estimated to 30.7% (95% CI: 28.2-33.2%) varying from 0% to 78.5% S. Bredeney was the most frequently reported serovar from the fattening turkey flocks in EU, representing 17.2% of the Salmonella positive flocks. The three next most frequent serovars were S. Hadar, S. Derby and S. Saintpaul (14%, 11.3% and 10.4% of the positive flocks, respectively). S. Saintpaul and S. Typhimurium were the serovars most widely distributed found in 12 MSs. Generally, the serovar distribution in turkey flocks was characterised by the predominace of serovars that are infrequently found as the cause of human infections. The frequencies of the most important serovars in humans and each of the investigated animal sources are presented in Figure 14.3- 14.4. Cattle and beef As no EU-wide baseline survey has been conducted for cattle, all data presented was retrieved from Community Summary Report 2007. Data from herd level was very sparse and not representative, and was therefore excluded. Most data were reported from the slaughterhouse level, where a total of 30,134 samples of fresh beef from 9 MSs was reported. The prevalence varied from 0% to 0.7% between MSs, with the exception of one MS having 6.7% positive samples. Results from sampling fresh beef during processing plants and at retail were also reported, but only by a few MSs. The results are, therefore, not described in detail here. Data on the serovar distribution was very scarce and not very informative for the purpose of this report. In brief, the most frequent serovar reported in fresh beef sampled at the slaughterhouse was S. Typhimurium (19% of positive samples from 5 MSs), followed by S. Dublin (13% from 1 MS) and S. Enteritidis (4% from 2 MSs). Serovar information on milk and dairy products was also scarce, since only three out of 47,596 tested units were positive for Salmonella . Humans Human cases caused by the most frequent serovars in all reporting countries were collected from the CSR from 2005 to 2008 (EFSA, 2006; EFSA, 2007d; EFSA, 2009a; EFSA, 2010). Data were The European Surveillance System (TESSy) and represents uploaded case-based and aggregated data that has been approved by each MS.

The aggregation also mean that serovars reported individually in one year may be reported in the group of \"other\" in other years (for example S. Bovismorbificans, which was reported individually in 2005 and 2008, was most likely included in the group of other in 2006 and 2007). Overall, the incidence of human salmonellosis decreased from 2005 to 2008. S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium are by far the most frequent serovars reported in humans. Together these serovars constituted between 63% and 85.7% during the four year period. However, while the reported incidence as well as the relative frequency of S. Enteritidis has been decreasing from 2006 to 2008, the opposite trend has been observed for S. Typhimurium. Other important serovars reported on the top-ten in humans during all four years included S. Infantis, S. Virchow and S. Derby.

Phage typing data available from the baseline surveys was in general also sparse. Since phage typing was not mandatory, only a proportion of the countries in each study reported these data and the results should, therefore, be interpreted with care. The most frequent S. Enteritidis phage type in humans reported from 2005 to 2006 was PT4, causing between 23% and 30% of all S. Enteritidis infections, followed by PT1, PT8 and PT 21. S.

In laying hens, these two types corresponded to around 60% of all typed samples. The exception was turkeys, where the most frequent phage types were PT13 and PT14b. Depending on the animal host, other types also showed some expression, such as PT2 and PT21 in broilers. S. Typhimurium infections in humans were mainly caused by phage types DT104, DT120 and DT193, which constitutes more than 50% of all typed isolates reported from 2005 to 2008, but with the relative importance of each fluctuating over the years. Although S. Typhimurium phage types varied widely among the different animal sources, DT104 was present in all animal species and it was the main observed phage type among broilers and turkeys. Source-specific DT104b, DT135 and U302 for turkeys. 14.4.2 Spatial analysis To investigate the spatial distribution of the most prevalent Salmonella serovars from the baseline studies, both a global and a local spatial cluster tests were performed. No spatial analysis was performed for cattle or beef because of insufficient data availability. The Moran's I test for global cluster detected global spatial autocorrelation for the distribution of S. Typhimurium in pigs and in turkeys. S. Derby in pigs and in turkeys was also globally clustered. The Moran I tests indicated less than 5% likelihood that these clustered patterns could be the result of random chance. However, for the remaining prevalent serovars reported by the baseline studies, no spatial autocorrelation was statistically significant, meaning that the presented patterns were neither globally clustered nor dispersed. Still, since even in the absence of significant global spatial autocorrelation, clusters at the local level may occur, subsequent local spatial cluster analyses were performed for the overall most prevalent Salmonella serovars. Table 14.5 shows the most likely spatial local clusters of the most prevalent Salmonella serovars, with their respective relative risk (RR) and level of significance (p-value), for laying hens, broilers, pigs and turkeys. Figures 14.5-14.8 show the location of the significant spatial cluster of Salmonella serovars for laying hens, broilers, pigs and turkeys in EU.

Presented results are from an overall analysis performed by the total number of ill people and by the number of outbreaks, which included all countries in the study, cases caused by all Salmonella serotypes, and outbreaks that took place both outside and in the household. Table 14.6 Attribution estimates showing the proportion of outbreak-associated salmonellosis cases attributed to specific sources in Europe, 2005 and 2006 (median, %) Proportion of number of ill 95% CI Proportion of number analysis by of ill, it was estimated that 32.4% (95% CI: 20.9 - 47.0%) of the outbreak-associated salmonellosis cases were attributable to the consumption of eggs, making it the most important source of illness. For many outbreaks the source reported was meat i.e. it was not specified from which animal species the meat originated. This of course limited the ability of the results to point at specific sources. The general category meat and poultry , which include pork, was estimated to be responsible for 11% (95% CI: 4.1 - 22.1%) of the cases, and dairy products (2.21%, 95% CI: 0.9 - 4.5%) and chicken (1.8%, 95% CI 1.1 - 3.1%) followed in the contribution for human salmonellosis. When summarizing the proportion of cases caused by all meat and poultry-meat categories (see categorization scheme in Figure 14.2), it was estimated that 14.5% of the outbreak- associated cases of salmonellosis could be attributed to this main food category. 4% of the cases were attributed to international travel, and 42% could not be attributed to any source. No outbreaks and therefore no cases were attributed to game meat. The analysis by the number of outbreaks attributed, in general, a lower proportion of salmonellosis to each of the sources and a higher proportion to an unknown source, but the results were not substantially different. QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors. The present document is published complying with the transparency principle to which the European Food Safety Authority is subject. It may not be considered as an output adopted by EFSA. EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 381 A comparison between the proportion of outbreak-associated salmonellosis attributed to specific sources in general outbreaks and household outbreaks suggested that eggs were the major contributor to human illness in both types of outbreaks (data not shown); chicken (4.0% versus 1.6%), dairy products (4.0% versus 2.5%) and vegetables (2.9% versus 0.5%) were estimated to cause a higher proportion of salmonellosis in general outbreaks, whereas the general category meat and poultry (3.4% versus 5.7%) was a more important source of illness in private homes. When all the subcategories within meat and poultry-meat were summed up, no significant difference between the two types of outbreaks was apparent. In contrast, meat products within the poultry category appeared to cause a higher proportion of cases in outbreaks outside the household. A comparison between the proportions of illnesses attributed to the various sources in the different categories of general outbreaks showed no significant differences in the order of importance of the sources to human illness. Our results suggest that eggs caused a higher proportion of the cases associated with outbreaks in institutions when compared to restaurants/caf\u00e9s and catering establishments, whereas the proportion attributed to chicken was higher in catering establishments' outbreaks than in the other locations (data not shown). The analysis of human cases caused by different serotypes showed that eggs was the most important source of outbreak-associated cases caused by S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium, and that foods within the category meat, particularly pork (7.5%, 95% CI 2.2 - 16.4) and beef (3.3%, 95% CI 0 - 11.4), were important sources of S. Typhimurium infections. Overall, around 18% of the S. Typhimurium cases were attributed to the category meat and poultry. For S. Typhimurium, 13.5% (95% CI 0 - 31.8%) of the cases caused by this serotype were attributed to vegetables, whereas only 1.5% (95% CI 0.3 - 4.8%) of the S. Enteritidis outbreak infections could be associated with this source. Source attribution estimates differed when the analysis was performed stratifying by European regions. Figure 45 shows the differences in the proportion of cases attributed to specific sources in each region. Results suggest that eggs were the most important source of outbreak-associated salmonellosis in Eastern (61%, 95% CI 50 - 71%) and Western Europe (27%, 95% CI 14 - 47%), that in Northern Europe chicken was the most important source (24%, 95% CI 6 - 52%) and eggs contributed for a high proportion of cases, and that the majority of the salmonellosis cases were attributable to meat in the south of Europe (39%, 95% CI 0 - 76%). No outbreak- related illnesses were associated with international travel in Southern and Eastern Europe. The proportion of cases that could not be attributed to any source in Western Europe was substantially higher than in other countries.

The vast majority of the salmonellosis outbreak cases that resulted in death were attributed to eggs (67.2%, 95% CI 47.3 - 82.1%). All the remaining sources were estimated to have a minor contribution to reported fatalities, and attribution estimates varied between 0 and 3.8%. Around 16% of the outbreak-associated deaths were attributed to an unknown source. Of the Salmonella infections that required hospitalization, 32.5% were attributed to eggs (95% CI 21.5 - 42.8%), and around 40% of these cases could not be attributed to any source. A total of 173,379 human laboratory-confirmed cases of salmonellosis were reported in 2005, and 165,023 in 2006. On the basis of the proportion of disease attributable to each source estimated in the analysis by the number of outbreaks, a total of 82,539 cases of salmonellosis were attributed to the consumption of eggs in the overall population and study period. The general category meat and poultry-meat was estimated to be responsible for 38,772 cases, and 8,124 cases were associated with international travel. 177,135 cases could not be attributed to any source.

The subtyping method of pathogen isolates by phenotypic and/or genotypic subtyping methods. Currently, serotyping and phage typing appear as the more relevant subtyping methods for Salmonella , as these are more generally applied for surveillance than genotypic methods (EFSA 2008a). However, the latter are expected to take over in the future, and approaches for attributing human campylobacterioses using MLST typing have recently been described (Mullner et al., 2009). The contribution of each animal-food source for human cases depends on the prevalence of the Salmonella subtypes causing disease in that specific source, on the consumption of the food source in the population, on the ability of the subtype to cause infection (which depends on the survivability of the subtype in the food chain and on the pathogenicity), and on particularities of processing and preparation of the food source. Both consumption patterns and processing and preparation practices may vary between countries, reflecting, among others, cultural differences. The Salmonella serovar and phage type distribution in animals, foods and humans in European countries was analysed on the basis of data from two different data sources, the CSRs, which publish data reported from individual countries, and the EU-wide baseline surveys (BS) conducted at the major animal reservoirs. The BS data were assessed to be more appropriate for source attribution, since they are uniform, representative and provide information on several animal sources at the reservoir level. They have, however, the downside of being cross-sectional studies providing only a snapshot of the situation. Furthermore, they were conducted in different years, which limited the comparison of the serovar and phage type distribution between sources and humans as these may change over time. Data from the CSR was the only source of data available for the cattle reservoir and for human Salmonella infections. Human Salmonella data were aggregated for all European countries, and the unavailability of MS-specific information limited the comparison of Salmonella subtypes distributions from animal-food sources and humans. Consequently, quantitative estimates for the relative importance of each source for human disease could not be provided. Additionally, only a minor proportion of isolates from both animal-food sources (including from the BS) and humans was phage typed, and only from a limited number of countries. The phage typing distribution observed does, therefore, not represent all European regions. The main observed serovars varied between animal reservoirs, but the frequent occurrence and wide distribution of S. Enteritidis followed by S. Typhimurium and S. Infantis was clear throughout the analyses. Other serovars, however, also appeared as important for specific animal sources, such as S. Derby in pigs, S. Dublin in cattle, S. Hadar in broilers and S. Saintpaul, S. Kottbus and S. Bredeney in turkeys. The most important serovars in humans were S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium and S. Infantis. Together these three serovars accounted for up to 81% of the human Salmonella cases in the period 2005 to 2008, with S. Enteritidis alone being responsible for between 54% and 64% of cases.

In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors.

Enteritidis, which is in line with the results of the source attribution analyses based on outbreak data, where it was estimated that eggs were the most important source of human salmonellosis in EU countries, and that the majority of S. Enteritidis cases was attributed to egg consumption. S. Enteritidis in pigs appeared to be more prevalent in Eastern Europe including MSs of both MS cluster 3 and 4 used in the QMRA (Chapter 6). The overlapping of S. Enteritidis clusters in laying hens and pigs (Figure 14.6) further suggest the possibility of a common source and/or transmission of infection between these two species due for instance to a more extensive pig production for instance characterized by a relatively large proportion of smaller holdings. The predominance of PT4 and PT8 among most animal reservoirs was not surprising, given that those, along with PT1, were the main phage types involved in human cases. In laying hens, these two types corresponded to around 60% of all typed samples, emphasizing the role of eggs in human infections. Still, S. Enteritis was also the most frequently isolated serovar in the BS in broilers, where also PT8 and PT4 dominated. Broiler meat is, therefore, likely to be an important source in countries with a high S. Enteritidis prevalence in broiler flocks. Along with those results, S. Typhimurium showed different clusters for turkeys, pigs, broilers and laying hens, where the cluster for pigs was located to Western Europe corresponding to MS cluster 2 represented by MS2 in the QMRA (Chapter 6). This concurs with the current knowledge about the widespread distribution of S. Typhimurium both in area and in types of sources. Very broadly speaking, these clustering patterns of S. Typhimurium suggest that pigs and pork are a main source of human S. Typhimurium infections infections in Western Europe, whereas the disease burden is more evenly shared between broilers and pigs in Eastern Eur ope (MS cluster 3 and 4 in the QMRA). Although S. Typhimurium phage types varied widely among the different animal sources, DT104 was present in all animal species, which was also expected, given its wide distribution and its multi-resistant characteristics. The phage type distribution observed in humans with DT104, DT120 and DT193 as the main types, concurs well with the animal data and to some extent supports, that pigs and to a lesser extent poultry are important sources of human S. Typhimurium infections. Interpretation of the sources of human S. Infantis infections tended to be more complex, given its widespread occurrence including in animal feed. However, it is notable that it clustered in countries with intensive pig production (North-east of cluster 2 in the QMRA), and also in broilers in Eastern Europe (particularly MS cluster 3 in the QMRA) indicating that pork and broiler meat may be important sources of these infections. However, S. Infantis was also commonly observed in laying hens and turkeys, so a proportion of infections originating from these sources cannot be ruled out. S. Derby was, as expected, mostly found to be pig-associated, and the cluster analysis provided a cluster for pigs that was very similar to that found for S. Typhimurium in pigs i.e. MSs belonging to MS cluster 2. S. Derby was, however, also present in poultry, mainly turkeys. Compared to the other animal species, turkeys were in general not assessed to be a major source of human infections, even though many of the important serovars seen in humans were also found in turkeys. This is supported by the finding that S. Saintpaul and S. Kottbus, which play an important part in turkeys, cause only a few human cases, suggesting that turkey meat does not QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

This may be explained by the lower consumption and maybe more varied consumption patterns across countries. S. Hadar was associated with poultry with high prevalences observed in turkeys in a few MSs. Still, broilers are considered, quantitatively, to be a more important source due to a higher consumption of broiler meat as compared to turkey meat. The same pattern was observed for S. Virchow, which was very widespread in broilers and was also found in turkeys, but less spread and in lower prevalences. The importance of S. Virchow among human cases has increased in the last years, which may be explained by an increase in broiler consumption in European countries (Magdelaine et al., 2008). As human data were not available at the country-specific level, it was not possible to compare the spatial serovar distribution between humans and animal sources, However, it is clear that S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium and S. Infantis are also the most frequently observed and widely distributed serovars in the animal source population. In contrast, S. Saintpaul and S. Kottbus, which play an important role in fattening turkey flocks, are not appearing on the human top-ten for any of the years included (2005-2008). However, given that these serovars show some very area- specific clustering, we would expect them to represent a higher proportion of human cases in these areas. For some animal sources, the serovar proportions were driven by the findings in only one or a few countries. Such observations reinforces the importance of the spatial analysis as a strong tool to help drawing conclusions based on data provenient from a large area with different realities, such as the EU. In general, the clustering of specific Salmonella serovars in specific geographic areas may mirror common sources or reservoirs of infection such as specific raw feed ingredients, infected breeding pig herds, or endemic wildlife species. Spatial clustering is also consistent with the potential for the clonal spreading of a particular Salmonella serovar among farms following the introduction into a region, e.g. through the movement of infected animals, or through feed or animal transport vehicles, as suggested by Emborg et al. (2007). Finally, clustering may reflect a selection pressure for a specific serovar or phage types in a region for example due to the use of specific antimicrobials, which is consistent with the observations of Emborg et al. (2008). Overall, the results of analysing the serovar and phage type distributions tended to confirm the current knowledge on sources (Hald et al., 2007; Pires et al, 2008; EFSA. 2008f; Pires, 2009). The observed data also concurred with the results of the source attribution study based on outbreak data, which renders credibility to both approaches. We acknowledge, however, that we could have done a more robust analysis if more detailed information on the human data as well as data over time had been available. Still, all included BS were conducted within a five-year period, and we would not expect this to be a major issue. Results from an analysis of data from outbreak investigations suggested that eggs were the most important source of human illness, followed by meat (including pork) and poultry-meat and dairy products. The analysis of human cases caused by different serovars showed that eggs were the most important source of human disease caused by S. Enteritidis, and that meat products, particularly pork and beef, were important sources of S. Typhimurium infections. Source attribution estimates revealed regional differences in the relative importance of sources of salmonellosis. These differences are in line with differences in the epidemiology of Salmonella in different countries, such as the identified clusters of S. Enteritidis in MS3 and Slovakia and high prevalence of Salmonella in broilers and pigs in Southern QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Additionally, regional differences in the source attribution estimates can reflect differences in the effectiveness of the surveillance systems and completeness of the available data. Other source attribution studies have shown differences between countries in the relative importance of sources for human salmonellosis (Pires et al., 2008). Specifically, table-eggs were estimated to be the most important source of Salmonella infections in the Netherlands and Denmark followed by pork. The results of the analysis of outbreak data were found useful to investigate the relative importance of food sources for human salmonellosis and to a wide extent support other results. It is, however, acknowledged that extrapolation from outbreak data to the population level involves making certain assumptions that may bias the results and that the unharmonised outbreak reporting in EU in 2005 and 2006 added to the uncertainty of the results. A more elaborate discussion on the limitations of the method can be found in Pires (2009). It should be emphasised that the Consortium originally intended to develop a hierarchical source attribution model bas ed on microbial subtyping (Hald et al., 2004; Pires & Hald, 2009) using MS-specific animal and food data from the EU baseline surveys and human data as reported by the MS to The European Surveillance System (TESSy). It was, however, necessary to abandon this approach, since MS-specific data on the distribution of serovar and phage types in humans was not available. As an alternative, the Consortium made some descriptive comparisons of animal, food and human data, which were supplemented with results from a spatial analysis and an outbreak data analyses. The conclusion below should, therefore, be considered as a guesstimate and is based on very simple deductions: Human S. Typhimurium infections represented between ca. 10-20% of all cases, and this proportion seems in fact to be increasing (relatively and absolutely). Based on the comparison of phage types occurring in humans and animals sources, it is assessed that the majority of human S. Typhimurium cases are caused by pig- related phage types leading to the conclusion that the majority of human S. Typhimurium infections overall is coming from the pig reservoir. Certainly broilers and beef also contribute to these infections, but the contribution is in general assessed to be low due to low prevalences and/or lower impact through the food production chain. The latter is derived from the fact that some of the dominant S. Typhimurium phage types in broilers only occur in low frequencies in humans. Still, as illustrated by the spatial analysis there are geographical variations, where S. Typhimurium appears to be more prevalent in pigs in Western Europe and in broilers in Eastern Europe suggesting that broilers contribute relatively more in the latter region. S. Enteritidis is recognised to be associated primarily with the poultry reservoir and particular laying hens and table eggs. Still, in Eastern Europe a small proportion of these infections may also come from the pig reservoir, as the prevalence of S. Enteritidis in pigs in this region generally is higher. This is also supported by the spatial analysis indicating a common cluster for S. Enteritidis in pigs and laying hens in the eastern part of Europe, This may add a few percentages to the overall pig-associated burden. S. Derby is another very important serovar in pigs and most human infections of this type is assessed to originate from the pig reservoir. Although, it is also occurring in turkeys, the much lower consumption and production of turkey meat point at pork. In addition, it can be seen that some of the turkey-specific serovars (e.g. Saintpaul, Bredeney and Kottbus) have hardly any impact in humans. Of course this may be due to for instance lower infectivity of these serovars as compared to S. Tm., but without the detailed human data, it was not possible to estimate these differences.

Infantis infections tended to be more complex, given its widespread occurrence including in animal feed. However, a certain proportion of S. Infantis infections and minor proportions of other serovars will most likely also be associated with pigs. In conclusion, it is \"guessed\" that 10-20% of human infections in EU is attributed to the pig reservoir.This is to some extend supported by the outbreak data analysis that indicated that meat products, particularly pork and beef, were important sources of S. Typhimurium infections. This is furthermore in concordance with a recent attribution study done by Pires et al. (2008) and Pires (2009), where the proportion of pork-associated cases acquired domestically was estimated for four EU countries: Denmark (3.6-9.7), The Netherlands (7.6-15.2%), Sweden (0.1-0.3%) and UK (3.4- 3.7%). 14.6 Conclusions The relative importance of different sources varies between EU regions according to differences in prevalences, consumption patterns and preferences, and animal and food production systems. The overall EU incidence of human salmonellosis has been decreasing from 2005 to 2008, which is mainly explained by a decrease in the number of S. Enteritidis infections presumably as a result of an improved surveillance and control of S. Enteritidis in laying hens in many MSs (EFSA 2010; Korsgaard et al. 2009). In contrast, the incidence of S. Typhimurium infections has increased from 2006 to 2008 indicating that one or more sources of these infections are increasing in importance. Besides the decreasing trend of S. Enteritidis cases, eggs from laying hens are still considered the most important source of S. Enteritidis infections and consequently the most important single source of human salmonellosis in EU. This is supported by the source attribution analysis based on outbreak data, where table eggs were found as the most important source. A certain proportion of human S. Enteritidis infections are also assessed to be attributable to broilers, particularly in countries with a high S. Enteritidis prevalence in broiler flocks. S. Typhimurium showed different clusters for pigs and broilers suggesting that pigs is a main source of these infections in Western Europe (MS cluster 2), whereas in Eastern Europe (MS cluster 3 and 4), the disease burden may be more evenly shared between broilers and pigs. S. Infantis tended to cluster in countries with intensive pig production in the North- east corner of MS cluster 2, whereas in Eastern Europe (MS cluster 3 and 4) the focus was on broilers, but the sources' relative contribution to human infections was difficult to assess. Although S. Derby was mainly associated with pigs in Western Europe (MS cluster 2), it was also present in poultry, particularly turkeys. However, compared to the other animal species, turkeys are in general not assessed to be a major source of human infections, presumably due to its lower consumption and maybe more varied consumption patterns across Europe.

Hadar was associated to poultry meat consumption, with particularly high prevalences among turkeys in a few countries. Also S. Virchow had a very widespread distribution in broilers in Europe, and its increasing importance among human cases since 2005 is likely to be due to increasing broiler meat consumption. Based on the above discussion of the relative importance of different animal sources, a cautious assessment would be that around 10-20% of human infections in EU may be attributable to pigs and pork. However, this \"guesstimate\" is believed to vary considerably between MSs depending on for instance Salmonella prevalence in pigs and pork, consumption patterns and preferences, and the relative importance of other sources. In order to obtain more reliable and quantitative estimates for the importance of different source to human salmonellosis in EU, it is recommended to develop a model for the attribution of human salmonellosis based on the microbial subtyping approach. This will require MS-specific data on the distribution of Salmonella subtypes in the most important sources and in humans. Particular, the latter data has been very difficult to obtain, which is considered most unfortunate as these data are essential for understanding the trends and sources of human salmonellosis. 14.7 References Acha, P.N., Szyfres, B., (Eds.)

The variability between MSs in all areas of pig production, slaughter, processing, preparation and consumer preferences is vast and hence a single model for the EU was deemed not to be feasible at an early stage of the QMRA. We have tried to overcome this by producing a generic EU model, where the processes are fixed but the parameterisation is MS specific. In terms of processes the QMRA includes models for large farms; small farms; large slaughterhouses; small slaughterhouses and 3 product types (pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage). Indeed within the Farm modules further variability is accounted for by the consideration of key management factors, e.g. all-in-all-out vs. continuous production; wet feed vs. dry feed etc. These sub-models are linked together with MS information on ratios of large-to-small farms and large-to-small slaughterhouses. Unfortunately, due to lack of data, it was necessary to assume that all pigs from large farms go to large slaughterhouses and all pigs from small farms go to small slaughterhouses. However, if such data become available the model can be easily the amended to take this into account. Of course, compared to reality, the categorisation of the pig production into small and large farms/slaughterhouses is coarse and within these there will be significant variation, both within and between MSs. However, within the resources available, we believe that a large proportion of the variability between production types has been captured; risk assessment is an iterative process and can always be further improved upon - when better or new data becomes available. The advantage of producing a generic model that can be parameterised for any MS is that, it is hoped, each MS will have the opportunity to use the model to assist with the development of its own national control plan. The generic EU QMRA is a fully stochastic farm-to-consumption Monte-Carlo simulation model, and includes several novel developments for Salmonella in pigs QMRAs and EU QMRA methodology. Specifically, this includes detailed modelling of the pig and pig slaughterhouse environments (farm management, faecal shedding and cross-contamination at the slaughterhouse). In order to demonstrate the QMRA and, in particular, to identify key differences between MSs which might be important for intervention at a national level, four case study MSs were selected. Rather than simply choose a MS from each geographical region within the EU or MSs with the best data, a cluster analysis was undertaken. The aim of the cluster analysis was to objectively identify case study MSs that would be likely to have differing impacts for different interventions. Although, many attributes were originally suggested for the clustering criteria, due to data gaps/deficiencies the EU MSs were clustered according to production practices (ratio of large-to-small farms; ratio of large-to-small slaughterhouses) and consumption practices (amount of pork consumed; relative amount of fermented sausage consumed). Salmonella prevalence was not included as a factor within the analysis as this would be an outcome of the QMRA. Therefore the clusters do not reflect similarities in Salmonella prevalence but similarities in production and consumption practices. The MSs within each cluster were then selected based on data availability. The aim of the QMRA is for it to be applicable to any MS and therefore discussions are currently underway between EFSA and the QMRA team on how best to provide other MSs access to the model.

In particular, the probability of illness (per serving) is highest for fermented sausage for MS1, MS2 and MS3 and minced meat for MS4. However, when taking into account consumption practices, the products with the highest number of attributable cases are predicted to be pork cuts (MS1, MS3) and minced meat (MS2, MS4). Overall, it is predicted that, from the 3 product types modelled there will be 949 cases of Salmonella in MS1; 25248 cases in MS2; 1509 in MS3 and 29901 in MS4. The QMRA model has been validated at three important stages of the food chain: prevalence of infection in slaughter pigs; prevalence and concentration of contamination at retail, and the number of human cases per year attributable to pig meat consumption. Validation of any QMRA is always challenging particularly since there are so many uncertainties present within the model; consequently QMRAs will often over-estimate the overall risk (e.g. Hartnett, 2001; Nauta et al., 2001, 2005; Havelaar et al., 2008). In addition, the observed data to which the outputs of the model are compared are not accurate. For example, as discussed in Chapter 12, sampling at the slaughterhouse or at retail may not be totally randomised (or may even be risk-based), the microbiological test may not be 100% sensitive and the reported number of human cases may be sign ificantly under-reported (which will vary between MSs). However, we have concluded that the results of the QMRA look fairly reasonable at the points of post-lairage (compared to the EFSA Baseline Survey (EFSA, 2008a)) and at retail (compared to data from EFSA 2009, Little et al., 2008). At the point of post-lairage, the model appears to give relatively accurate predictions for the prevalence of lymph-node infection in three of the four case study MSs, which suggests that a large proportion of the variation between MSs in farm practices/ Salmonella prevalence is captured. However, the model underestimates the prevalence of infection for MS3 as the model predicts that 0.7% of pigs will be lymph-node positive and the EFSA baseline study states that an average of 5.1% [3.7 - 6.9]. As suggested in Chapter 8, it is likely that this discrepancy is due to the model not capturing a specific farm management aspect of MS3; this is likely within the small farm as this is highly uncertain and MS3 has a much larger proportion of small farms than the other three MSs. Although, at the point of retail, it is only possible to compare the MS1 and MS2 results against MS-specific data, the results for MS3 and MS4 are not unreasonable when compared to the other MSs that reported the results of retail sampling to EFSA. Certainly, the model appears to predict va lues for prevalence and concentrations that are similar to those observed in studies from across the EU. Validating the number of cases estimated by the model is complex and must take into account a number of uncertainties associated with both the model predictions and also the reported number of cases, especially due to under-reporting of human cases which is discussed in detail within Chapter 3 (Section 3.3.2). For all four MSs the model does seem to be over-estimating the number of cases, particularly as the number of reported cases for each MS will be attributable to all sources of Salmonella , not just those related to pig/pork-meat or, indeed, not just the 3 product types considered here. The reasons for this are hard to determine given the complexity of the system being modelled, and the lack of data that would enable us to determine the effect of immunity and age- and food- related dose-response. As mentioned above, the number of reported cases for each MS will be attributable to all sources of Salmonella , not just those related to pig/pork-meat. Therefore, as QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors.

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 394part of this project (Chapter 14), we investigated the main animal-food sources of human salmonellosis in EU and assessed these to be table eggs, pork and broiler meat. However the relative importance of different sources varies between EU regions according to differences in prevalences, consumption patterns and preferences, and animal and food production systems. Overall the results tended to confirm the current knowledge on sources (Hald et al., 2007; Pires et al, 2008; EFSA, 2008b; Pires, 2009), and it also concurred with the results of the source attribution study based on outbreak data, which renders credibility to both approaches. We could have done a more robust analysis if more detailed information on the human data as well as data over time had been available. In relation to pork, the source attribution work suggested that overall 10-20% of all Salmonella infections within the EU may be attributable to pork; however this estimate is highly uncertain and will vary between countries depending e.g. on prevalences and consumption patterns. Unfortunately, quantitative estimates for the relative importance of each source for human disease could not be provided, because human data was only available at an aggregated level and only for the top-ten serovars found each year. However, for MS2, it was recently estimated that 3.4-3.7% of cases were attributable to pork (Pires et al., 2008) and in Denmark between 5-11% of cases have been estimated to be related to the consumption of pork during the past years (Pires & Hald, 2009). Therefore, no matter how well controls for Salmonella in pig meat work in reducing pig-meat attributable Salmonella cases, there is only likely to be a small effect in reducing the total burden of Salmonella illness in the EU. Within the mandate, EFSA were asked \"to consider all serovars in pigs that are of human health significance\". EFSA, 2006 concluded that \"all Salmonella serovars in pork are to be regarded as a hazard for public health\" and recognised that there will be variability between strains in their behaviours across the food chain. It was therefore deemed acceptable by EFSA (as stated in the call for proposals) for the QMRA to consider all types similarly and hence that a QMRA for Salmonella Spp. would be appropriate. However, this assumption will lead to an over-estimation of the risk, which is now discussed. The Salmonella serovar and phage type distribution in animals, foods and humans in European countries was analysed within Chapter 14 on the basis of data from two different data sources, the Community Summary Reports, which publish data reported from individual countries, and the EU-wide baseline surveys conducted for the major animal reservoirs. Within the EU, the most important serovars in humans were S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium and S. Infantis representing up to 81% of all infections. The main observed serovars varied between the animal reservoirs, but the frequent occurrence and wide geographic distribution of S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium and S. Infantis was clear throughout the analyses. The most frequent serovar isolated from slaughter pigs (lymph-nodes and carcass swabs) was S. Typhimurium and S. Derby. These serovars were widely distributed in EU occurring in most MSs. The prevalence of S. Enteritidis in most MSs was low, although S. Enteritidis appeared to be more prevalent in Eastern European countries, whereas S. Infantis more prevalent in Northern Europe. Other serovars, however, also appeared as important for specific animal sources, such as S. Dublin in cattle, S. Hadar in broilers and S. Saintpaul, S. Kottbus and S. Bredeney in turkeys. This therefore highlights the difficulties of producing Salmonella -specific QMRAs. To develop serovar specific QMRAs would be highly challenging due to the number of anticipated data gaps (there are still data gaps when considering all Salmonella ) and time available. It is therefore assumed within the QMRA that all Salmonella are equal in terms of, for example, their survival in the environment and infectiousness to pigs and humans. However it is known that this assumption is not really valid as, f or example, many serovars are commonly seen in pigs but rarely observed in human infections (e.g. S. Derb y) whilst others are commonly detected in QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Typhimurium). This could be attributable to many factors, including differences in their survival during the slaughter and processing environment or the dose-response relationship. 15.3 Uncertainty Analysis: Iden tification of Data Gaps and Assumptions The model parameters, for which there is a high degree of uncertainty, were investigated in the uncertainty analysis (Section 12.3). Many were assessed to have an important impact on the model results; hence it is recommended that future research in the area of Salmonella in pigs focuses on these parameters if the aim is to reduce the amount of uncertainty associated with the output of the QMRA. In addition to uncertainty, the probability of illness will also be highly influenced by the variability described within the model. The variability is incorporated into the model using probability distributions and includes variability both at the individual animal/product level and variability between farms/slaughterhouses. The consideration of variability is important because human cases of illness will most likely occur when in the tails of the distribution, i.e. the relatively rare occasions when the number of Salmonella in a pork product is high and so the probability of illness is also high (from the dose-response model). Although not possible to perform a full sensitivity analysis (i.e. assessing the impact of the distribution of each variable parameter on the final probability of illness), it was carried out at the end-point of each module. In turn, each of the exposure assessment modules (Farm, Transport & Lairage, Slaughter & Processing, Preparation & Consumption) and the hazard characterisation are now discussed with particular focus on the uncertainties present within each module. 15.3.1 Farm The farm model is a stochastic SIR model, modified to specifically incorporate faecal-oral, feed and external routes of Salmonella transmission. These modifications allow us to differentiate between sources of infection, but also allow the description of varying farm types between EU MSs. The results from the baseline model appear to capture the variability in the dynamics of infection, and much of the variability between MSs has been captured, given that three of the four MSs were well- validated at the point of national prevalence of lymph-node positive pigs at slaughter. We estimate that MS breeding pig herd prevalence is a strong predictor of national slaughter pig prevalence, which is validated to some degree by the comparison of the two baseline survey results. The farm model is necessarily complex in order to capture the wide variation in transmission and management practices across the EU. However, despite this complexity a number of simplifying assumptions have been made. Of importance is the homogenous mixing of faeces and Salmonella , but also the generic dose- response model used. Perhaps of greatest importance is the simplification of farm categorisation used within the model. Despite incorporating 56 different farm types into the model, this categorisation is still an ov er-simplification of reality, especially for the small farm. The above assumptions were primarily made to reduce model complexity, but also because of data gaps in transmission dynamics and management practices. A crucial data gap identified from the farm analyses is the probability of feed QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

In addition, while not explicitly included within the uncertainty analyses, more detail is required on management practices and dose-response. Given these inherent model and data uncertainties, care must be taken when interpreting the farm model results, especially when assessing the effect of interventions (see below), but we consider the current model as a large first step towards capturing previously unaddressed differences in farm type, and a useful tool for assessing the effectiveness of hypothetical and specific interventions at a national level (although the validity of such a model to make recommendations to an individual farmer has not been tested). 15.3.2 Transport & Lairage The Transport & Lairage module was developed to incorporate factors that are thought to influence the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter-age pigs, including stress during transport, contamination of the environment and cleaning of the environment. These factors were included with the aim of assessing the effect of various interventions implemented at the transport and lairage stage. The results from this stage show that the prevalence does increase, both during transport and lairage. The average batch prevalence for each of the four member states compares favourably with the findings of the EFSA slaughter pig baseline survey (EFSA, 2008a), albeit with a few deviations (particularly the lower prevalence for MS3 predicted by the model) suggesting, as would be expected, that the (Farm and Transport & Lairage) models do not capture all the factors associated with Salmonella transmission and prevalence. Part of the reason for this may be data gaps associated with some of the parameters. Sometimes this is a lack of adequate quantitative data across all member states (such as estimating the skin contamination at the start of the slaughter line and the effect of stress). In other cases we have good data for some member states and not others (e.g. the effect of cleaning of lairage, proportion of pigs kept overnight in lairage) so it was necessary to estimate the value based on data from another member state. However, it has been shown that the within batch prevalence before transport (i.e. the farm model output) is more influential than any of the parameter distributions within the Transport & Lairage module. There is little quantitative data on stress so expert opinion had to be used to estimate the proportion of pigs during transport that become stressed. The uncertainty analysis showed that the probability of pigs being stressed during transport has a significant impact on the probability of illness for pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausages. It was concluded that this is the most important data gap in the Transport & Lairage module. This parameter was also identified in the sensitivity analysis as the variation associated with this parameter having an important impact on the variation associated with the lymph-node prevalence at the end of transport. 15.3.3 Slaughter & Processing The slaughterhouse module is described in Chapter 9. It is clear that significant data gaps remain. Firstly, there are quite some uncertain parameter values, for which additional measurements or laboratory experiments would be needed in order to obtain more accurate numerical values. Some parameter estimates would actually be very simple to measure, for example time and temperature data from large slaughterhouses, often recorded by automated systems. However, unfortunately, QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors.

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 397such data is not usually available to researchers. Secondly, there is a lack of validation data. By this we mean, data to which we can compare the outputs of the model, e.g. Salmonella counts on carcasses before and after a process step, or Salmonella numbers on machinery throughout the day. Thirdly, the production process itself is sometimes not known explicitly. A case in point is the small slaughterhouse, where the model was based on the slaughter process as observed in a single Dutch slaughterhouse. Slaughter practices in other MSs (and other slaughterhouses) remain unknown to us; this is called model uncertainty and although not possible to be included within the uncertainty analysis per se needs to be highlighted as a data gap. Another form of model uncertainty is the inclusion of certain stages in the slaughterhouse, which is often based on arguments presented in previous QMRAs. This is potentially dangerous, since it may lead to certain stages being overlooked. Consider for example the possibility of contamination of the lungs of the pigs with scalding water, which may be hazardous at the pluck removal stage leading to carcass contamination (Hald et al., 2004). Or, another example could be cross- contamination when using gas stunning of batches of pigs, which is not usually modelled. This may be the result of a lack of data, or perhaps it is simply ignored because it is hardly ever considered at all in previous studies (perhaps due to lack of data!). With respect to the baseline slaughterhouse results, we find that the results do not look unreasonable and, in particular, when comparing the profile of microbial loads over the different slaughter stages (see Section 9.4). Currently, our model suggests that house flora has very little effect on the final risks of illness. However, it does impact the prevalences to a large degree, due to the additional contamination (in low amounts) on many carcasses. After the slaughterhouse module follows the cutting plant module. Here, the half- carcass is processed and partitioned into consumer cuts. The process of cutting a half carcass into consumer portions at the cutting plant is not standardised at all. Furthermore there is considerable confusion of terminology, to the point that encyclopedia and dictionary lookup of meat products would yield incompatible results. Our model describes a possible implementation of the cutting plant process, but by no means exhaustive with regards to variation over MS. Although the model takes into account cross-contamination via the cutting equipment, it does not take into account any contamination between carcasses (via e.g. the table surface or improperly cleaned knives). This is an opportunity for further research. Unfortunately, no suitable data were found for validation of the cutting plant model. The uncertainty analysis identified that the amount of faeces released during dehairing in the large slaughterhouse ( A k) to be an important parameter. This suggests that the prevention of faecal leakage, for example by means of bunging, would be an effective intervention. This was further considered in section 13.2.3. 15.3.4 Preparation & Consumption The consumer model consists of three parallel pathways: pork cuts, minced meat and fermented sausage. These products are chosen as a proxy for a wide range of products. e.g. the category 'pork cuts' represents all meat that is cut by the consumer, and the fermented sausage would cover every conceivable dry cured sausage in production. The three pork products were selected (in a sense) to cover the spectrum of risks. Specifically: pork cuts represent all cut pork associated with QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors.

EFSA reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the authors. 398the risk of cross-contamination, minced meat represents hamburgers, meatballs and other pork patties, with the associated risk of undercooking (and cross- contamination), while the fermented sausages collectively represent the risk of a ready-to-eat product. Also in the consumer model we face data gaps. Specifically, data on transfer coefficients are severely lacking, for example between pork product and chopping board. Further laboratory experiments on bacterial transfer would be extremely beneficial for further QMRAs, perhaps even allowing for the use of distributions instead of point values. Consumer behaviour in the domestic kitchen is reasonably well known from surveys. The most useful data on time / temperature combinations during various transport and storage phases was taken from one French study (Derens et al. 2006). In this study a small time / temperature recorder was embedded in packs of retail pork, yielding large quantities of realistic data. Replication of such an experiment in additional MS would be of great value for future QMRA work, especially because the storage time of minced meat is influential on the probability of illness in both MSs considered in the uncertainty analysis and also for pork cuts in MS2. The sensitivity of the MS4 results to the transport time between retail and storage further highlights the need for this type of data. Due to lack of MS4 data, the travel time distribution was based on data from another MS within the MS4 cluster, and the resulting distribution was quite different from the one used for the other three MSs. If similar data was applied, the number of predicted cases for MS4 was reduced almost 10 fold. So although we do not know which distribution is the most appropriate, the uncertainty analysis clearly emphasised the need for MS-specific data for the time between the retail store and home. An unanticipated result of the fermented sausage model is that outbreaks do not seem that relevant as compared to sporadic cases. Our model, based on the model of Hwang et al. 2008, predicts more sporadic cases from successful 38 fermentation than reported cases from known outbreaks, which we assume to be the result of failed fermentation. The uncertainty analysis identified that portion sizes (of all products) had an important impact on the probability of illness. EFSA are currently carrying out further research in this area of consumption data. Should these data, when published, be more relevant then they can be used to better parameterise a MS's QMRA model. Finally, we would like to point out that it is hard to intervene at the consumer stage (although one can think of government information campaigns, but the efficiency is debatable). Nonetheless, a detailed model is certainly useful for gaining insight into the hazards at the consumer phase. 38 Here, successful means that there was no obvious shortcoming in the process. A high load of Salmonella is purely by chance. In contrast, when we speak of 'failed' fermentation, there was a clear defect during the fermentation process.

For any dose-response model there is always a high degree of uncertainty due to the availability of data. In general, two types of data are available for the construction of a dose-response model: feeding trial data and outbreak data. Feeding trial datasets (e.g. McCullough & Eisele 1952; Bemrah et al. 2003) have the benefit of recording accurately the dose each participant in the trial would have received; however on the downside they often use high doses to initiate infection, consider only one combination of food matrix and organism and, lastly, typically enrol healthy, young male volunteers and are therefore not representative of the overall population. Dose-response models have also been developed using data from outbreaks. These datasets have the advantage of being a more realistic reflection of reality, for example the exposed population will differ in their susceptibility; however in outbreak situations it is difficult to assess who has actually been exposed and, if so, what dose they received. The QMRA applies the FAO/WHO Salmonella dose-response model (FAO/WHO, 2002). This is based on a total of 21 Salmonella outbreaks of which 13 were S. Enteritidis; 3 were S. Typhimurium and there was 1 outbreak each for S. Heidelberg , S. Cubana , S. Infantis , S. Newport and S. Oranienburg (Table 11.1). It also covers a large range of food stuffs, some meat (e.g. chicken, hamburger) and some non-meat (e.g. water, peanut sauce). None of the outbreaks were related to pork/pork products. Bollaerts et al. (2008) comment that the FAO/WHO model, which is modelled using a Beta- Poisson, does not take into account heterogeneity due to the fact that the Beta- Poisson reflects the biological process of infection; not illness. The authors therefore developed a dose-illness model using generalised linear mixed models and fractional polynomials of dose which allows for heterogeniety due to differences in host susceptibility and the serovar and food matrix (in combination). In this QMRA, the heterogenoety between host, pathogen and food is not considered and we therefore apply the Beta-Binomial to the outbreak data summarised in Table 11.1. The Beta-Binomial incorporates the variability in the pathogen-host given a certain, variable dose, rather than the average dose considered in the standard Beta-Poisson model (FAO/WHO, 2002). Considering the above discussion, it can be summarised that there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with the data underlying the dose- response model which cannot be quantified. In addition there is also model uncertainty, i.e. which model is the most appropriate for describing the dose-illness relationship. Considering this, for any QMRA it is important to place more emphasis on the relative risks (e.g. the intervention analysis) than the absolute risk (Havelaar et al., 2007). 15.4 Intervention Analysis We have implemented a number of hypothetical and specific interventions in order to investigate the effect of reducing slaughter pig prevalence, breeding pig herd prevalence and finally carcass contamination on the number of human cases per year within the case study MSs attributable to each of the three product types. In order to implement any of the interventions we have assumed two critical factors: that uptake of each intervention is 100% across all farms/slaughterhouses across the MS, and that each intervention would be implemented in such a way to produce the effect desired (e.g. reducing carcass contamination by 1 log, or raising the dose QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors. In accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, this task has been carried out exclusively by the authors in the context of a grant agreement between the European Food Safety Authority and the authors.

Qualitative evidence (VLA, 2009) and expert opinion suggest that uptake and efficient application would be nowhere near 100% in reality. We would therefore strongly advise that field studies are carried out to assess these two factors. The hypothetical interventions investigated are illuminating. Interventions that reduce prevalence and/or contamination at each major point in the food chain investigated (breeding pig herds, slaughter pigs and pre-chill) will have a large impact in reducing the number of human illnesses attributable to pig meat consumption - if the reductions are also large. This is a positive result as it does suggest that control will be effective across the whole of the food chain. We were not able to confidently model specific farm or transport interventions because of a lack of evidence showing consistent quantitatively-estimated reductions. We have therefore investigated hypothetical changes in the mechanisms of these interventions (e.g. vaccination, cleaning). The results show that large changes in these mechanisms are necessary before significant reductions can be made (e.g. between-batch cleaning efficiency needs to be increased by up to 2 logs or downtime would be needed for 3+ days). Whether these large changes can be achieved consistently across a whole MS is debatable, but certainly there is little current evidence to suggest that these farm interventions can achieve marked reductions on their own. The broad conclusion must be that a sustained program of farm interventions would be needed to be effective on the wide range of farm types in the EU. Results from the intervention analysis highlighted that interventions modelled during the Transport & Lairage phase had little effect on the risk of illness, e.g. logistic slaughter and cleaning of lairage. While it is clear that the conditions in lairage can have a significant effect on the prevalence of skin contamination at the start of the slaughter line, the intervention analysis suggests that this is of lesser importance than the effect that the various farm or slaughter processes have. Marked reductions can be achieved by applying some decontamination measure, or reducing faecal leakage, at the slaugh terhouse. An intervention that could consistently achieve a 1 log decontamination of carcasses pre-chill could reduce human illness by up to 20-40% in low-prevalence MSs (MS1, MS3, MS4), but further reductions (up to 2 logs) would be needed in other MSs with higher prevalence (i.e. MS2), as the initial contamination levels tend to be higher in these MSs (according to the models - there is a distinct lack of enumeration data within the slaughterhouse to validate this result confidently). Non-chemical interventions have already been shown to produce reductions in the order of 1-2 logs, and hence could be a viable short-term measure for reducing illness in humans if they are shown to be as effective if scaled up to be applied across a MS's slaughterhouses (given intervention at farm level are likely to take years before real reductions are achieved). In summary, the farm and transport interventions are likely to vary in their ability to reduce slaughter pig prevalence by a sufficient amount to reduce the number of salmonellosis cases in humans. However, a combination of interventions applied across a large proportion of farms, probably combining changing feed type, is likely to have a cumulative effect in reducing slaughter pig prevalence. Probably of extreme importance, but not investigated here, is the rate of uptake and correct application of interventions by farmers - if this is not universal across a MS the effect in reducing human illness will be proportionally reduced. The model results lead us to suggest those MSs with a high breeding pig herd prevalence should focus on these herds in order to reduce the burden of infected new stock entering the QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

However, it may be more efficient in MSs with a low breeding pig herd prevalence to focus their attentions on feed and other sources of infection. In all likelihood Salmonella control in pig production will be implemented at various stages. We have investigated three combinations of interventions, using either wet feed, increasing resistance or downtime along with a decontamination measure at pre-chill. Certain combinations of interventions are likely to produce even greater reductions than the effects of individually-applied interventions. However, the specific combination of interventions that achieve greater reductions together are dependent on the situation within a particular MS, in particular the contamination levels of carcasses. Investigation of such beneficial combinations can be done with the current QMRA model; the myriad combinations possible prevented us from investigating all of these, but MSs will be able to interrogate potential combinations of interventions if/when the baseline model has been parameterised for their country. From the current evidence, it would appear that specific slaughterhouse interventions are currently best placed to produce consistently large reductions in the number of human cases. For high breeding prevalence MSs, reducing infection in breeders would seem to be an important control measure as has been successfully implemented by the poultry industry. However, multiple intervention investigations suggest that MSs can achieve more effective reductions in human cases by targeting both farm and slaughterhouse. Such information will be valuable to the EU Cost- Benefit Analysis project currently underway, where with the results of the intervention analyses they will be able to assess the cost-effectiveness of different intervention options. 15.5 Comparisons to other Member State QMRAs It is worthwhile comparing the QMRA described here to other work in the area of Salmonella in pig QMRA. In particular, we compare the results of this model to a qualitative risk assessment (De Sadeleer et al., 2009) and QMRAs developed by Delhalle et al. 2009 (Belgium); Titus 2007 (New Zealand); VLA 2009 (MS2) and Barron et al. 2009 (Ireland). A qualitative Belgian risk assessment (De Sadeleer et al., 2009) concluded that the risk of Salmonella infection in humans in Belgium was low, but that it could be reduced further by implementing additional measures in the slaughterhouse and the domestic kitchen. The current model also highlights the effectiveness of slaughterhouse control measures. Interventions in the domestic kitchen were out of the remit of the current project, so were not considered. In addition to the above, a modular risk model to assess the risk of salmonellosis through the consumption of mixed pork meat has been developed in Belgium (Delhalle et al. 2009). Within this model the exposure assessment starts at the end of the lairage and finishes at the point of human consumption. Similar to the current model (post-lairage) this model comprised modules for the slaughterhouse, Post-Harvest, Distribution & Storage and Preparation & Consumption, with each module generating an output that was the input to the next module. Some results from the Belgian risk assessment are shown in Figure 15.1 and Figure 15.2. At the end of the slaughterhouse (i.e. at chilling) the Belgian model estimated the prevalence of QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Similar to the results of the intervention analysis provided in Chapter 13, the Belgian QMRA also found that the risk of illness could be significantly reduced all along the QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

They also found the risk could be reduced by consumers however, as also mentioned above, consumer interventions were not in the remit of the current project. We can also discuss the similarities and differences of our QMRA compared to a model described by Titus 2007. The Titus QMRA is also based on the MPRM paradigm, taking into account numbers of Salmonella on individual pigs. The main focus of the QMRA is the pig slaughterhouse where it was concluded that many carcasses are contaminated with low numbers of Salmonella and only a small number are heavily contaminated; this is consistent with our findings. Looking more precisely at the various stages (Figure 3.4 in Titus 2007) we find a significant decrease at scalding (about 3 logs) and a modest increase at dehairing. This is also observed in our model. In all other phases, the contamination slowly decreases (but note that polishing and blast chilling were not modelled). Again this is compatible with our findings, except at evisceration where we predict an increase and Titus shows a reduction. The intervention 'prevention of faecal leakage' was studied and was found to result in a 10% - 44% reduction in prevalence. This is a similar result to EFSA QMRA, where a 20-40% reduction in the risk of illness/number of cases per year for MS1, MS3 and MS4 was estimated, but much less for MS2. The author concludes with some statements that we also subscribe to: the need for proper inclusion of cross-contamination, the need for mechanistic modelling, and the need for more quantitative data to fill the data gaps. We can compare the MS2 results of the current model with that of a MS2 Salmonella in pigs farm-to-consumption risk assessment developed by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA, 2009). The VLA model follows a similar model framework to the current model incorporating: Farm, Slaughterhouse, Further Processing, Distribution and Consumption modules. The current model is, in many ways, a more complex model than the VLA model, building on the methods of the VLA model and, due to the European-wide scale of the project, being able to acquire more data for parameterisation of processes that could not be considered in the VLA QMRA (such as cross contamination in the slaughterhouse). The model explicitly considers variability and, similar to here, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were carried out. It was found that the model was sensitive to the parameters: cooking temperature, duration of infection of pigs on the farm, degree of clustering of Salmonella on the product, whether the product is frozen and use of a chopping board. Uncertainty analysis suggested that the human dose-response, the transfer of Salmonella from pig meat to hands and the duration of infection of pigs on the farm were important. Comparison between the two models should be done with care (and certainly only for MS2), particularly as the VLA model looks at the risk associated with pork chops, bacon and sausages (typical MS2 sausages meant for heat treatment before consumption as opposed to the fermented ready-to-eat sausages considered here). Comparing the two farm modules, there are methodological differences between them, for example the VLA model makes the distinction between 'excretor' and 'carrier' pigs, with excretors always shedding Salmonella in their faeces and carriers never (although a pig may switch between the states over time) while the current model does not make this distinction (infected pigs are assumed to shed intermittently, which is analogous to the excretor and carrier state combined). However, the average prevalence of 'infected' (i.e. excretor + carrier pigs in the VLA QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Results from the VLA QMRA at the end of the consumption stage are shown in Table 15.1. Comparing the EFSA QMRA results to the VLA results, we can see that there is a difference in the average risk and number of illnesses predicted per year for MS2, with the VLA risk assessment predicting an average of 557 cases per year while the current model predicts 13,802. However, it should be remembered that this was for different product types (pork chops are only a fraction of all types of pork cuts and likewise sausages could be considered only a fraction of all minced meat). The VLA risk assessment also looked at the effect of interventions at both the farm and slaughterhouse. It found, similar to the current study, that prevention of faecal leakage at the slaughterhouse was effective at reducing the number of human cases. As part of the project the results of the QMRA intervention analysis were used as part of a cost-effectiveness analysis. An Irish model (Barron et al. 2009) looked at the transmission of Salmonella at the slaughterhouse (modelling process from stunning to jointing). They modelled the different stages using different approaches including; stochastic regression analysis and meta analysis. The model estimated a mean prevalence of Salmonella on pork joints at Irish boning halls of 4%, with a 95% confidence interval of (0.3%-12%). This compares favourably with our predicted MS2 retail prevalence of 4% for pork cuts. As MS2 and Ireland are in the same EU cluster and have similar slaughter pig Salmonella lymph-node prevalence (16.1% for Ireland compared to 21.2% for MS2 (EFSA, 2009)) the comparison of the Irish results to MS2 is appropriate.

The three products were chosen to represent a range of different production practices, and also different consumption patterns within the EU. The model has been designed to be a generic model for the EU; therefore having a clearly defined set of parameters that may vary between countries, the values of which can be easily input for any specific EU MS. The model is stochastic, using Monte Carlo sampling as a means for dealing with variability in the parameters. To demonstrate the QMRA were selected: MS1, MS2, MS3 & MS4. As requested by the Terms of Reference, the model covers the whole food chain. In particular it includes the role of piglets as a source of Salmonella , cross-infection between batches during transport and lairage, due to carry-over of Salmonella within the environment and cross-contamination within the abattoir and during the preparation phase. Finally, a dose-response model allows the outcome of exposure to be assessed, providing an estimate of the probability of illness. For all four MSs the average probability of illness, across all product types, is between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 10 million servings. Across all products, MS2 and MS4 are predicted to have a higher probability of illness than MS1 and MS3. For all of the MSs (except MS4), the product with the highest probability of illness per serving is fermented sausage; for MS4 it is minced meat. The lowest risk per serving is associated with pork cuts (MS1, MS2); minced meat (MS3) and fermented sausage (MS4). The total number of cases attributable to the three product types are 949 (MS1); 25248 the highest number of cases was attributable to pork cuts and in MS2 and MS4 to minced meat products. Although difficult to validate the outputs from any QMRA, due to the uncertainty associated with the observed data, it is probable that the QMRA is overestimating the number of cases. Reasons for this may be that the observed data is uncertain due to the under-reporting of Salmonella in different MSs and also that the proportion of cases attributable to pork is unknown. Investigations undertaken as part of this project concluded that around 10-20% of human infections in EU may be attributable to pigs and pork, but this is a cautious assessment. However, this \"guesstimate\" is believed to vary considerably between MSs depending on, for instance, Salmonella prevalence in pigs and pork, consumption patterns and preferences, pig production systems and the relative importance of other sources. In terms of the QMRA, the over-estimation could be attributable to a number of factors, including the consideration of all S. spp within the QMRA, with no account taken for differences between Salmonella serovars in their ability to grow/survive in the environment or to infect humans (virulence). Other factors include uncertainty associated with the consumption data, the dose-response model and many other parameters used within the exposure assessment, particularly MS specific parameter estimates (where sometimes, due to lack of data, the parameters for one MS had to be estimated using data from another MS). Considering this likely over-estimation, it is necessary to address the impact this may have on drawing conclusions about the effect of interventions. Given current uncertainties listed above, and the fact that many QMRAs currently over-estimate human illness attributable to a particular pathogen/host pair, then it is important to QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

We must also consider how far out from reality the model predictions are. Subjectively, we could say we are perhaps an order of magnitude out (if MS2 results are representative of our case study MSs): in this case it is not unreasonable to think we are at least close enough such that the results of the intervention analysis stand. The QMRA was also validated at earlier points within the farm-to-consumption pathway and, in particular, post-lairage and at retail. However, similar to the epidemiological data, it cannot be assumed that the observed data are perfect as, for example, tests used to detect Salmonella at abattoir or retail will not be 100% sensitive. At post-lairage the output of the QMRA (average proportion of Salmonella positive lymph nodes) was compared to the EFSA slaughter pig baseline survey results. From this, it was concluded that the QMRA was producing realistic estimates for MS1, MS2 and MS4 at the start of the Slaughter & Processing module. It is uncertain why the model may be underestimating the prevalence in MS3, but it is likely to be attributable to the model not capturing a specific aspect of MS3 at the farm and particularly within the small farm model as MS3 has a much larger proportion of small farms than the other MSs. At the point of retail validation data were only available for MS1 and MS2 and these compared reasonably well to the QMRA predictions. Although it was not possible to get data for all product types in each case study MS EFSA data provided ranges of Salmonella prevalence across different EU MSs. For pork cuts the prevalence ranged from 0%-6.1%, for minced meat 1.3% - 5.9% and for ready-to-eat minced meat/minced meat products (which includes fermented sausages) of 0%-3.3%. The model predictions are in the same order of magnitude, with the results from all case- studies falling within or slightly below these observed intervals. Across a number of EU MSs, studies show that contamination on retail cuts is comparatively low (scaling up to the unit of a serving commonly less than 10 CFU/portion). The average number of Salmonella contaminating the three product types was predicted by the QMRA to range from 1-11CFU/portion for all MS/product-type combinations. It was therefore concluded that the QMRA is producing realistic enough results at the point of retail to differentiate between MSs and provide a baseline from which to conduct an intervention analysis. A key part of the QMRA was the investigation of interventions. In this respect, EFSA provided a number of scenarios that the QMRA needed to address. Each of these is considered below: The expected reduction of Salmonella cases in humans (or pig meat at retail) by a reduction (e.g. 5- or 10-fold) of Salmonella prevalence in slaughter pigs (based on bacteriology or serology at slaughter). Marked reductions in cases can be achieved by reducing slaughter pig prevalence, and indeed for MS2 and MS4 there is a strong linear relationship between slaughter pig lymph-node prevalence and the number of human cases. The major effect of reducing slaughter pig prevalence was to reduce the number of infected pigs with high infection/contamination loads enter ing the slaughterhouse, hence eventually reducing the number of highly-contaminated servings consumed by consumers. . The linear relationship shows that factors that would be expected to introduce a non- linear relationship into the model, such as cross-contamination at the slaughterhouse, growth during retail storage and dose-response, although accounted for in the model, seem to have limited importance for the assessed relationship QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Data from the EFSA baseline survey support a modest linear relationship at a MS level, at least for infection and carcass contamination at evisceration. The sources of infection for slaughter pigs at farm level. We have investigated the relative importance of source of infection by simply turning off each source of infection within each MS model. The results show that for MSs with a higher breeding pig herd prevalence (MS2, MS4) switching breeding pig herd prevalence to zero, hence assuming that the breeding pig herd cannot be re-infected from the finishing herd, removes the vast majority of infections at depopulation of the fattening herds. Conversely, removing feed or external contamination from the model does little to change the national slaughter pig prevalence in MS2 and MS4. The reverse trend is true in MSs with low breeding pig herd prevalence (MS1, MS3) as feed contamination seems to be the most important factor for the national slaughter pig prevalence in these MSs. This strongly indicates that breeding pig herd prevalence is a strong indicator of national slaughter pig prevalence - i.e. if a relatively low number of breeding pig herds are positive, national slaughter pig prevalence will be relatively lower than in MSs with more infected breeding pig herds. Finally, external sources of contamination appear to have a general low impact on the slaughter pig prevalence. The reduction of the prevalence in slaughter pigs by the most important potential treatments or control measures at farm level Evidence that specific farm and transport inte rventions consistently work is sparse. This is presumably due to the more complex environment in which these interventions will have to be applied and the difficulty in standardising experiments to trial interventions. Hence, while the evidence for consistent effects is sparse, some farm interventions may well be effective. This lack of evidence for a consistent and/or quantitative effect meant that specific farm interventions could not be modelled. Therefore, in order to provide some assessment of farm interventions, we have modelled the effect of the varying mechanisms applied to farm interventions (e.g. modifying the dose-response for vaccination, lowering the contamination of pens due to cleaning). Modifying the pig dose-response relationship to Salmonella exposure, perhaps by changing feed type, adding organic acids to feed/water, or vaccination, could have a significant effect in reducing slaughter pig prevalence within a MS, which would subsequently reduce number of cases. However, a large increase in this dose- response relationship - broadly speaking increasing the resistance of ALL of a MS' pigs such that an extra half-log to a log dose is needed to cause the same previous probability of infection - would be needed to see significant change in the MS slaughter pig prevalence. This type of effect has rarely been seen in the literature and it is debatable whether such an effect could be achieved consistently at a national herd level. A similar conclusion can be reached for increased cleaning - significant reductions could be achieved in a MS' slaughter pig prevalence if cleaning efficiency was increased so that an extra 1-2 logs was consistently removed from the pen environment before repopulation, but so far these improvements have only been trialled on a small scale.

The effect was greater in MSs with a low prevalence (MS1) of positive breeding pig herds than in MSs with relatively high breeding pig herd prevalence (MS4). The results of these farm interventions suggest that farm interventions could work, although the significant reductions that would be required to achieve the same effect as slaughterhouse interventions would probably be unlikely for any single farm intervention. Large reductions in slaughter pig prevalence were not seen in the literature for any of the current farm interventions. The impact of transport, lairage and slaughter processes on contamination of carcasses Due to the unavailability of data on the contamination of hides, it was not possible to model the cross-contamination of hides during .Transport & Lairage. Therefore the contamination on the skin was estimated at the point of slaughter and used as an input to the Slaughter & Processing module. Within the Slaughter & Processing module, cross-contamination has been extensively modelled. The QMRA results predict that, for all four MSs, the evisceration step in a large slaughterhouse model greatly increases both the microbial load and also the prevalence of ca rcass contamination. This increase is due to the possibility of the gut being punctured during evisceration, therefore allowing the carcass (and subsequent carcasses on the line) to become highly contaminated. The increase in prevalence is also attributable to house flora, although the microbial load transferred from this source to the carcass is assessed to be low. In addition, the load and prevalence is increased during the dehairing phase (primarily due to faecal leakage) in MS2 and MS4, which had the higher infection prevalence at the point of slaughter. In the small slaughterhouse, the microbial load decreased over each phase but there was a small increase in the prevalence of contamination during the combined step of trimming/singeing. The expected reduction of Salmonella cases in humans (or pig meat) by the most important control measures during transport, at lairage or during the slaughter process. Transport interventions (logistic transport, increased cleaning), even assuming 100% uptake and 100% compliance/effectiveness, were assessed to have an insignificant effect in reducing the probability of human illness. Marked reductions can be achieved by applying some decontamination measure, or reducing faecal leakage, at the slaugh terhouse. An intervention that could consistently achieve a 1 log decontamination of carcasses pre-chill could reduce the number of cases up to 20-40% in low-prevalence MSs (MS1, MS3, MS4), but further reductions (up to 2 logs) would be needed in other MSs with higher prevalence (i.e. MS2), as the initial contamination levels are predicted to be higher. Further reductions can be achieved by further reducing concentrations on carcasses at pre-chill (e.g. a reduction of 3 logs) with all case study MSs predicted to achieve a very high reduction (95-100%) in their number of cases Practical non-chemical interventions have been shown to produce reductions in the order of 1-2 logs. If such interventions are shown to be as effective when scaled up and applied across a MS's slaughterhouses, it is concluded that a control measure that reduces Salmonella QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

The consideration of multiple interventions Reviews of Salmonella in have concluded that it was not possible to control Salmonella with the adoption of just one measure. In other words, the control of the Salmonella can only be achieved by the introduction of multiple interventions across the farm-to-consumption pathway. In order to investigate the impact of multiple interventions we considered three combinations of interventions: 7. Change to wet feed and 1 log decontamination pre-chill 8. 1 log modification of dose-response with 1 log decontamination pre-chill 9. 3 day downtime with 1 log decontamination pre-chill The analysis was carried out for MS4 only and it is concluded that a combination of interventions can, if applied judiciously, produce reductions greater than the sum of the individual interventions alone. The major reason for this is that both interventions (e.g. changing farms to wet feed and applying a 1-log decontamination step pre-chill) will affect the contamination level of carcasses. We also predict similar results for MS1, MS2 and MS3 although, of course, the impact of the combination of interventions that achieve the greatest reductions will be dependent on the situation within a particular MS, in particular the contamination levels of carcasses. Summary of the intervention analysis In summary, the farm and transport interventions are likely to vary in their ability to change slaughter pig prevalence by a sufficient amount to change numbers of salmonellosis cases. However, a combination of farm interventions applied across a large proportion of farms is likely to have a cumulative effect in reducing slaughter pig prevalence. Probably of extreme importance, but not investigated here, is the rate of uptake and correct application of interventions by farmers - if this is not universal across a MS the effect in reducing human illness will be reduced. The model results lead us to suggest those MSs with a high breeding pig herd prevalence should focus on these herds in order to reduce the burden of infected new stock entering the weaning/growing/finishing stages However, from the results of the intervention analysis we predict that it may be more effective for MSs with a low breeding pig herd prevalence to focus their attentions on feed and other sources of infection. From the current evidence, it would appear that specific slaughterhouse interventions are currently best placed to produce consistently large reductions in the number of human cases. For high breeding prevalence MSs, reducing infection in breeders would seem to be an important control measure as has been successfully implemented by the poultry industry. However, the hypothetical reductions and multiple interventions investigated here suggest that MSs can achieve larger reductions by targeting farm and slaughterhouse together. Reducing the prevalence at farm level is also considered important for preventing the transmission of Salmonella from pigs to other livestock species such as laying hens and broilers, where the prevention and control efforts are focused on the farm. Comparison of the current QMRA model against similar national QMRAs for Salmonella in pigs highlights similar conclusions across all model results: slaughterhouse decontamination interventions are effective in reducing risk; reducing prevalence of infection in slaughter pigs is also an effective risk reduction strategy QMRA on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

In summary, despite a much more complicated scope and framework, the generic EU MS QMRA model predicts similar results to the national QMRA models, but incorporates a much wider selection of interventions, and in turn these interventions can be implemented for a wide range of production systems across the EU. During the development of the QMRA, many data gaps/deficiencies were identified. These were investigated as part of an uncertainty analysis; where we assessed the effect that parameters (with a particular lack of information) have on the model output and, in particular, the probability of illness. From this analysis, it is concluded that the following parameters were both highly uncertain and influential on the probability of illness. It is therefore recommended that further data generation is undertaken in order to provide improved estimates for these parameters. The identification of such data gaps is a positive feature of any risk assessment model and many risk managers utilise such information to direct future research. Farm: Prevalence of feed contamination (MS1) Prevalence of infection within the breeding pig herd (MS1 & MS2) Maximum mass of faeces ingested per day (finishers) (MS2) Transport & Lairage: Probability of pigs being stressed during transport (MS1 & MS2)* Dose-response parameter (MS1) dehairing (MS1 & MS2) Preparation & Consumption: Minced meat storage time in fridge (MS1 & MS2)* Portion sizes of pork cuts, minced meat patties and fermented sausages (MS1 & MS2) pH of fermented sausage (MS1 & MS2) Those marked with an asterisk (*) were also identified as important in the sensitivity analysis, where the impact of the variability associated with the model parameters that are described as distributions is investigated Although not able to be included in the uncertainty analysis, in order to obtain more reliable and quantitative estimates for the importance of different source to human salmonellosis in the EU, it is recommended to develop an EU model for the attribution of human salmonellosis based on the microbial subtyping approach. This will require MS-specific data on the distribution of Salmonella subtypes in the most important sources and in humans. The latter data have been particularly difficult to obtain, which is considered most unfortunate as these data are essential for understanding the trends and sources of human salmonellosis. Finally it is important to recognise that, at this current time, this has been one of the most ambitious QMRAs ever developed in terms of both the complexity of the model (which has been built to maximise the potential for the consideration of current and future interventions) and also the requirement to produce a model that can represent all MSs within the EU. Capturing variability within a single MS is in itself a challenge; however by trying to capture variability between MSs we believe that the area of QMRA has been taken to a new level.

The model can, provided the appropriate data is available, be parameterised for any EU MS and can be used to assess the impact of interventions at the farm, during transport and lairage and at the abattoir. We therefore believe that we have: achieved the aims and objectives set by EFSA; produced a useful tool for assessing the effect of farm and abattoir interventions in reducing both slaughter pig prevalence and number of human cases attributable to pig meat consumption; and finally produced a QMRA model applicable for all EU MSs to use.
