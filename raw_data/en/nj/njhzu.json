These six-sided, terminated crystals are, however, outstanding in their own right. They are one of the rare products of nature that we perceive as perfect. The most beautiful quartz crystals are usually found in regions of the planet that underwent dramatic tectonic activity millions or billions of years ago. In the tumultuous history of the geology of our planet, when continental plates collided together, they lifted the continental crust, along with the oceans and seas, and at the same time brought rocks to the surface that had previously been miles underground, where temperatures were in the hundreds of degrees centigrade. As the crust folded, cavities formed in the midst of the intense heat and pressure, and those cavities were flooded with watery, silica-rich solutions. Once the dramatic changes began to slow, temperatures gradually dropped, the cavities stabilized, and slowly, over hundreds of thousands of years, crystals began to form in the solutions. The cavities and veins that provided the space for unobstructed growth allowed the molecules of silica and oxygen to gradually combine and, layer by layer, form perfect hexagonal, terminated crystals. In alchemical language, the interaction between fire and water makes possible the redemption of Spirit from gross matter. The final perfection of quartz crystals is the result of tremendous refinement and, as such, is a pinnacle of the evolutionary process, representing the perfection to which the most mundane of rocks aspire. From this point of view, crystals represent the Spirit, or Shen. We can use crystals to become aware of our purpose, our curriculum in this life. In this way, quartz crystals can show us the possibility of transcending our suffering and inspire us to work toward our own \"perfection.\" Quartz crystals develop at all three levels of formation: igneous/Yuan, metamorphic/Ying, and sedimentary/Wei. Regardless of where they form, they all resonate with the Source/Yuan level of human beings. They represent an internal progression of evolution and metamorphosis. Once formed, they are no longer subject to oxidation or carbonization. Enhancing Stones As previously mentioned, the Chinese name for quartz crystal, shi ying/outstanding stone, describes one of its primary characteristics: to make other stones outstanding. Traditionally, the clear quartz crystal strengthens the effects of other stones. All quartz crystals have this effect, no matter their color, but the clear quartz crystal is the one most noted for its ability to receive, store, conduct, and amplify energy. When placed with other stones, whether on the body or in the environment, the quartz crystal absorbs and directs the therapeutic properties of the other stones. Included with a combination of stones in an elixir, it amplifies and, if necessary, harmonizes the qualities of the other stones. Because the crystals absorb the vibrations of other stones, they are particularly useful when we want to utilize stones that contain potentially toxic chemicals, such as malachite/lu qing, with its high copper content, or an alchemical stone, such as cinnabar/zhu sha, with its mercury content. A quartz crystal charged with these powerful stones can be used in an elixir or placed on the skin with no risk at all. Quartz crystals also pick up our own thoughts and intentions. Because their crystalline structure and growth process create natural terminations, crystals help us direct our thoughts to plant the seeds of change and awakening in ourselves and others. As a side note, given the ability of quartz crystal to pick up energy, we need to be mindful of its placement in our homes and offices. Crystals will pick up and magnify electromagnetic radiation from appliances. This is especially true with amethyst and rose quartz. If placed in a room with a television, in a household in which action movies are a favorite, the crystal will pick up the vibrations of intensity and violence being emitted and retain those vibrations until it is cleansed. Colored Crystals Quartz crystals come in many colors. Some colors are caused by the chemical composition, such as the iron or manganese contained in amethyst or the chromium in emerald green quartz. Some colors are caused by irradiation or temperature changes, natural or otherwise. For example, clear quartz can take on a smoky quality when exposed to high heat. In general, colored quartz crystals help move stagnation out of the body. The different colors are useful in directing the effects of the stones to particular organs and meridians. For example, a dark smoky color associates with the Kidneys. A strong emerald green color associates with the Liver. Additionally, if a stone is cloudy in appearance, it has a more nourishing effect on Yin. A very clear, bright stone predominantly affects Yang. The more chemicals the stones contain, the more complicated and diffuse their therapeutic effect. The most basic, after clear quartz, is smoky quartz, which brings its effect to the lower region of the body. Smoky quartz is very protective against external pathogenic factors, including electromagnetic radiation. Next in chemical complexity are citrine and amethyst. Citrine has a strong relationship to digestive health. Amethyst brings its effect to the upper sensory portals, especially the throat. Amethyst also helps clear external pathogenic factors. Rose quartz is the most complicated. It opens the chest and the sensory orifices and has a strong relationship to the emotions. Fundamental Qi of the Earth Exploring quartz crystal from the point of view of Western chemistry, we discover that it is composed of silica and oxygen\u2014that is, silicon dioxide (SiO2). These two elements are the most abundant in Earth's crust\u2014oxygen accounts for approximately 50 percent, and silica accounts for approximately 25 percent. The perfection of the quartz crystal is rare. Many other stones, perhaps 95 percent of known rocks, also have silica and oxygen as their main constituents, but they do not form visible, perfect crystals. Given these numbers, all of the stones that contain silica and oxygen, whether perfect crystal or ordinary rock, can be thought of as the \"cement\" of the Earth. These two elements are also the fundamental Qi of plant and animal life. Oxygen accounts for about 21 percent of the volume of our atmosphere, 66 percent of the mass of the human body, and about 90 percent of the mass of the Earth's oceans. Oxygen is essential to metabolism, the subtle chemical reactions that occur in the body that are necessary to sustain life. We know that organic life requires carbon, but the presence of silica is also fundamental to organic life. In humans, the highest levels of silica are found in the skin and connective tissues, including the tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and blood vessels. Silica is also found in the teeth, eyes, glands, and organs, as well as in the blood. It is a major constituent of collagen, which helps keep our skin elastic. It works with calcium to maintain bone strength and stabilize the teeth. It is believed that the mineral is essential for the integrity of all these structural components. More and more nutritional supplements intended to support bone structure include silica in their formulas. Because of the vibrational relationship between all things, simply holding quartz crystals can excite the silica and oxygen in our own bodies, supporting our structure and enhancing our physiological functions. Drinking the elixir brings the qualities more quickly and directly to our cells, and perhaps, as believed traditionally, it brings the light contained in the crystal into the density of our bodies. Quartz crystals are very forgiving. It is hard to make a mistake when we are working with the building blocks of life. Form and Function All quartz crystals grow in the trigonal crystal system with a hexagonal crystal habit, yielding six-sided crystals with pointed terminations. Within these parameters, however, tremendous variety exists in the shape and formations of quartz crystals. The variety of formations fascinated the Chinese. Using the law of signatures, they found correlations between the compelling appearances in the crystals and issues of health and life. How does the stone look? Formations that demonstrate interference, whether with several crystals crossing each other or with the appearance of movement within the stone, are appropriate for treating conditions of Rebellious Qi or blockages. An important configuration is the single, large \"generator\" crystal, where all six sides of the crystal terminate together at the apex. These crystals are very yang in nature and strongly direct energy. Clusters, on the other hand, have a broader effect and are used to break up accumulations or blockages. Combine a small cluster of quartz crystal with bloodstone and place on varicose veins. The configurations formed by the terminations of quartz crystals are diverse. As the pointed terminations grow out of the six-sided crystals, each facet of the termination can be different. The generator crystal described above is somewhat rare, with each facet forming a perfect triangle and coming together into a perfect point. Other terminations consist of facets with different shapes, mixing perfect triangles with polygons that have varying numbers of sides. An important configuration in the new age community has been labeled a \"Dow\" crystal. The Dow crystal is fairly rare; its termination alternates triangles with seven-sided heptagons. The configuration encourages contemplation of how a hexagonal structure with a triangular inner structure can yield a seven-sided shape. A perfectly clear crystal is a pure representation of Water energy. Meditating with such a crystal can impart the clarity needed to move through or let go of life's obstacles. A crystal with bubbles and \"clouds\" demonstrates the effects of Fire energy changing water into steam. Meditating with a cloudy crystal can help us manifest our goals. Some crystals appear with tiny, perfect triangles seemingly etched into them. These appearances resemble cuneiform writing from ancient cultures. These crystals are \"record keepers,\" carrying information from long-distant times. They can be useful as a personal diary, recording prayers and affirmations. All the subtle meanings reflected by the shapes and appearances of crystals can be tools for bringing intentionality to the aspects of our lives that need work. In modern times crystals are cut and polished into many shapes, which may or may not reflect their original growth patterns. There may be a perfect termination on one of these polished stones, but within the body of the crystal a visible line of movement goes in another direction. Using such a stone to direct energy without awareness of this inner pattern will distract or interfere with our intention. While all of these different growth patterns have significance, the major therapeutic quality of quartz crystal in Chinese medicine is to strengthen and modulate the effects of other stones. | | Clear Quartz Crystal | | (See color insert plate 1) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | LU/LR/SP/ST/KI | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Chinese Name Shi ying, \"outstanding stone\" Quartz is the stone that causes other stones to become outstanding. Its major function is to strengthen the effect of other stones. Sui jing, \"water crystal\"/\"essence of water\" The phonetic for crystal is jing. While not the same character as used for Essence/Jing, it is nevertheless a reminder of its resonance to Source Qi. Color/Appearance/Light Clear, hexagonal crystals with terminations. Sometimes they refract light in such a way as to have rainbows, an indication of water content. The best harmonizers are transparent, refined crystals, which offer clear communication among the other stones. Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) Key Characteristics Clear quartz crystals are the great harmonizers of stone medicine. They are excellent conductors of energy and intensify the effects of other stones; hence their reputation as enhancers. Clear quartz is very forgiving; it simply conducts Qi. Directionality/Energetic Mechanism/Channel System All types of quartz strengthen the Lung-Kidney relationship. Energetic Mechanism: The Lung-Kidney Relationship All quartz crystals resonate with the Lung-Kidney relationship. The Lungs have two vectors of energetic movement. With in halation they direct Qi down toward the lower region of the body, affecting the Kidneys; with exhalation they disperse Qi outward. Anatomically, this process of bringing the breath to the Kidneys involves the diaphragm. The diaphragm is one of the Five Ancestral Sinews. It attaches in the front of the body at the xi phoid process at the base of the sternum and stretches diagonally through the body to attach to the spine in the lumbar region, near the point called Mingmen/Gate of Life/GV-4. For every filling of the Lungs with breath, the diaphragm descends and gently \"tugs\" on the lumbar spine, stimulating Mingmen. With every inhalation, the Lungs bring energy toward the Kidneys, which in turn \"grasp the Qi.\" This breath fans the flames of Mingmen Fire, which combusts our Essence to vaporize its density. The Essence, now gaseous in quality, is transported upward through points along the spine to be disseminated to the Organs that support who we are, constitutionally speaking. An additional aspect of the Lung-Kidney connection relates to Defensive/Wei Qi. The Lungs have a major role for managing Wei Qi, the quality of energy that deals with our instinctual responses to the environment. The Kidneys are considered the \"root\" of Wei Qi. When we are healthy, with adequate Wei Qi responding to the environment, we have confidence, we are alert, and we have an intuitive awareness of danger. This confidence comes from self-awareness and self-esteem, which emanate from the Kidneys and express outwardly through the Lungs. Another quality of the Lung-Kidney relationship is based on the Five Element model. The Lungs are associated with the fall season, the time of year when we have gathered the harvest and can begin to rest. The Kidneys are associated with winter, a quiet time of consolidation, when we can feel content with the fruits of our labor. The Kidneys grasp the Qi to delight in the bountiful. We are always seeking happiness. With cultivation, we realize that happiness is to be content with the reality we have right now. They access the Defensive/Wei and Source/Yuan levels as they pertain to the Fluids of the Stomach and Spleen. Functions and Uses Strengthens the effect of other stones. Regulates and invigorates Qi and Blood; induces relaxation. Indicated for: - shortness of breath - diaphragmatic constriction - pain Clears Heat in the Blood and in the hollow/Fu Organs. Indicated for: - palpitations, fevers - wasting and thirsting syndrome, diabetes - constipation Strengthens and regulates Spleen/Stomach function. Indicated for: - Rebellious Qi: nausea, vomiting, coughing Intentional use. Indicated for: - enhancing meditation and contemplation Methods of Application Topical Application Quartz has a particular affinity with the bottom of the foot. Rolling the foot over the crystal at KI-1/Bubbling Spring in the depression behind the ball of the foot stimulates the dynamics of the Kidneys and Lungs. Place quartz on the Bladder Shu points to direct Qi toward specific organs (see table at \"Urinary Bladder Shu/Transporting Points\" in appendix 2). Use as a wand to rub or tap the points, or place small stones on the points and heat with moxibustion or a far-infrared lamp. Press small terminated quartz \"needles\" on the corners of the cuticles to release excess energy. For weak people in poor health, place a small generator crystal with a flat bottom on the lower region of the body. For imbalanced emotions or an inability to connect with other people, place the crystal on the chest. For an inability to concentrate, place on the third eye. Internal Application Include with any combination of stones to harmonize or enhance an elixir. Drink as a single stone in an elixir or water to benefit intestinal flora, provide a climate for the proliferation of good bacteria in the gut, or treat long-term intestinal yeast. A Basic Balancing Protocol Ask the receiver to lie down\u2014a man on his stomach, a woman on her back. Rub your hands together to stimulate Wei Qi to the hands for warmth and sensitivity. Without touching, glide your hands over the person's body. Without thinking, scan to feel for anything different, or to see where the hands pause over the body. Wherever your hands are drawn to do so, place a small crystal point. This protocol doesn't use sophisticated channel theory. It is simply using small quartz crystal points to help regulate the body's energy. Leave the crystals for about twenty minutes, then remove the crystals and ask the receiver to turn over. Repeat the scanning process, again placing crystal points wherever you feel something different. Practicing this process frequently, you become more sensitive to where there is excess or deficiency and can use more sophistication in your placement of the stones, by directing the terminations of the crystals away from any excess or toward an area of deficiency. If you can't get the Qi to come up to fill the area of deficiency, put a small, flat-bottomed generator on the area to draw energy up from inside the body toward the surface. Intentional Application With the intention to affirm and focus on our redeeming qualities, quartz crystal represents the beginning of consciousness. Quartz helps to become aware of the thoughts that create our \"stuckness.\" Gaze into a crystal during meditation to support contemplation. Use a clear crystal during meditation to help bring clarity to break through problems. Meditate with a cloudy crystal to support the intention of creating abundance. Record keepers hold past prayers and affirmations. Touching them brings the strength of past affirmations to overcome present obstacles. Worn as a pendant, quartz crystal helps filter out negative vibrations (though smoky quartz is better for this purpose). Cautions and Contraindications It is recommended that you avoid using seaweed in the diet or herbally while using quartz crystal. Clear quartz, especially quartz spheres, can be a fire hazard when placed in the sun. Compare/Contrast/Differentiate Tourmaline is also a harmonizer, but it acts very differently than quartz. Quartz harmonizes by \"helping everybody to get along.\" Tourmaline harmonizes by drawing attention to issues that need work, for the purpose of ultimately resolving them and moving forward in a more harmonious fashion. Quartz and calcite have very similar functions, but the hardness of quartz brings its effect more deeply into the body. Both stones clear Heat. Quartz clears Heat at the Blood level; calcite clears Heat at the more superficial Qi level (though with extended use it also reaches deeper levels). Quartz clears Heat in the Organs of the Stomach, Large Intestine, and Small Intestine; calcite clears Heat in the Stomach channel. Since quartz is harder, it is more appropriate for chronic conditions. Calcite is more appropriate to treat an acute condition or to speed the effect of a stone combination. When using quartz crystals to enhance a treatment, amethyst is most pertinent to emotional issues and citrine is best for physical aches and pain. Clear crystals address all possibilities. The herbal equivalent to quartz crystal is licorice. Combinations Quartz strengthens the effect of single stones and harmonizes combinations of stones. Quartz crystal can absorb the energetic qualities of stones that are toxic (such as malachite and realgar); the quartz so charged can be used topically or in an elixir to yield the benefit of these stones, without their toxicity. Cleansing and Charging Cleanse quartz crystal in running water. Charge in hematite. Common Locations Brazil, Himalayas, European Alps, United States (Arkansas) Other Forms, Colors, Varieties Very clear quartz crystals were seen by the ancient Chinese as ice. They were said to be the \"tears\" of a quartz crystal; it was believed that during the crystal's formation, as it gradually condensed and solidified, water (\"tears\") emerged and subsequently froze, forming these very clear quartz crystals. Their affinities are HT/LI/SI/ST. These stones clear Heat in the Stomach and Large Intestine, as with excess acidity or constipation, and clear Heat from the Heart, as with palpitations. They also clear fevers and reduce pain. Clean them in a stream of running water and dry briefly in the sunshine. Enhydros are quartz crystals that contain pockets of water, where the condensation of water during their formation was incomplete. These stones generate strong conductivity of energy and are adjuncts to acupuncture, massage, or Reiki therapy by being placed on points or by having the receiver hold the stones. Ghost or phantom crystals contain a shadow, or a phantom crystal, visible within the larger crystal. They represent the separation of the clear from the turbid and are very important for communicating with one's own inner spirit. As an elixir, ghost crystals treat Internal Wind or Wind-Phlegm that is causing seizures. In the form of a decoction they help expel phlegm. Water made with ghost crystals helps us connect with our inner soul. These crystals are like an oracle. We can ask for revelation about something unknown and then hold the stone and channel the question into it. Dreams will come to provide an answer. Lemurian crystals have a relatively broad base and become more slender toward their terminations. They are characterized by horizontal striations and grit on the shaft of the crystal. Some say that these crystals have a particularly strong piezoelectric effect\u2014applying pressure generates a greater reception and/or discharge of energy. A faden crystal has a white threadlike zone apparently moving through the quartz crystal. These crystals are helpful for people who feel lost and without direction. | | BLUE QUARTZ | | (See color insert plate 2) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | KI/LU/LR | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Color/Appearance/Light Dull, turbid, blue crystals. The blue color pertains to the Liver as it releases Blood to nourish the Kidneys/Essence.

Methods of Application Topical Application Roll the foot on blue quartz crystal to stimulate the bottom of the foot/KI-1/Bubbling Spring. Apply at the base of the neck, in the depression below the C7 spinous process (the \"big bone\" at the base of the neck)/GV-14 to regulate blood pressure. Cautions and Contraindications None known. | | GREEN QUARTZ | | (See color insert plate 2) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | LR/LU/KI | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Color/Appearance/Light Various shades of green crystals, sometimes crusted with white \"fairy\" drusy crystals. The green color targets the Liver. Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) An emerald green is often from impurities of chromium, which affects the Blood and hormones. Key Characteristics Enhances and harmonizes combinations intended to support Liver Blood. Functions and Uses Nourishes Liver Blood. Indicated for: - insomnia Consolidates Blood, especially when the quartz occurs with drusy. Indicated for: - hemorrhaging Pacifies the Hun. Indicated for: - sleepwalking Methods of Application Note: Emerald green quartz is rare and relatively expensive. A small piece is adequate. Topical Application Place on the Source point for the Liver, in the \"V\" on the top of the foot where the metatarsal bones of the first and second toes meet/LR-3, to help bring deeply held anger to conscious awareness. Internal Application As an elixir, drink before bed for deeper sleep; affects the Hun for lucid dreaming. Drink after menstruation to replenish the Liver Blood. Intentional Application Wear as a pendant for sleepwalking. Cautions and Contraindications If the stone appears with drusy in the matrix, do not use it in an elixir. Place the stone touching a clear quartz crystal for at least twelve hours, and use the clear potentiated quartz in the elixir. Combinations Combine in an elixir with tourmaline, for its ability to clear Fire Toxins at the Defensive/Wei Qi level, potentially to address skin cancer. Other Forms, Colors, Varieties A dull green quartz has inclusions of chlorite, sometimes forming phantoms. Microscopic crystals, called drusy, often cover the crystals, giving them a frosted appearance. These chlorite-included quartz crystals have an association with prosperity. Chlorite itself is very chemically complicated. It absorbs many minerals during its formation. In an elixir, it promotes assimilation of nutrients from the foods we eat. Its Chinese name is xie cheng shi, \"successful draining stone.\" It detoxifies by binding to heavy metals and promotes elimination and detoxification. Chlorite's actions are enhanced when it is included in quartz. Another pale green quartz crystal derives its color from fuchsite, a chromium-included mica (see Muscovite/Fuchsite in chapter 17). | | LITHIUM QUARTZ | | (See color insert plate 2) | | Taste | | Spicy, sweet | | Nature | | Cooling | | Affinities | | LR/HT/LU/KI | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Color/Appearance/Light Pale rose crystals Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) + lithium Key Characteristics The spicy taste addresses the withdrawal of depression. The sweet taste quiets manic states. Lithium quartz enhances and harmonizes combinations intended for bipolar conditions. Directionality/Energetic Mechanism/Channel System Lithium quartz supports Heart-Kidney communication. Functions and Uses Calms the Shen. Indicated for: - Dian Kuang, (manic depression) Clears Wind Bi/Obstruction syndrome. Indicated for: - radiating pain, such as sciatica Methods of Application Topical Application Tape small pieces of lithium quartz to points of pain. Internal Application Include as a harmonizer in an elixir intended to address deep emotional conditions. Cautions and Contraindications None known. Common Locations Afghanistan, Pakistan, Brazil, United States | | PURPLE QUARTZ/AMETHYST | | (See color insert plate 2) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | LR/LU/HT/SP/ST | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Chinese Name Zi ying shi, \"true purple stone\" Li Shizhen identified amethyst as the true purple stone to distinguish it from purple fluorite, the \"false purple stone.\" Zi shi ying, \"purple outstanding stone\" All quartz crystals are enhancing to other stones. This is the purple stone that makes other stones outstanding. (Note that Chinese Herbal Medicine: Materia Medica, by Dan Bensky et. al., uses the name zi shi ying, \"purple outstanding stone,\" for fluorite.) Color/Appearance/Light Purple or lavender crystals. The color can be the result of radiation in the Earth and/or chemical composition. The purple or violet color is understood as a combination of red and black or red and blue\u2014fire and water. The color is usually attributed to iron content, as well as to natural radiation in the Earth. Manganese may also contribute to the color. Amethysts often line the interior of geodes, where they are usually small stubby crystals. In other environments they can grow into longer, elegant crystals. A stone on the market called green amethyst is more appropriately named prasiolite. Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) + iron and possibly manganese It can include traces of many other elements, including aluminum, calcium, titanium, magnesium, sodium, and lithium. The iron content supports the Spleen. In its formation amethyst encounters a significant quantity of gases, giving it a strong Defensive/Wei Qi affinity, hence its use for skin conditions. Key Characteristics Amethyst enhances and harmonizes combinations intended to address conditions of Qi or Blood, especially where imbalanced emotions are a factor. It is also indicated for neurological/Wind conditions. Directionality/Energetic Mechanism/Channel System Anatomical region: throat and skin Anatomical level: vessels Heart-Kidney communication Eight Extraordinary Channels: Penetrating Vessel/Chong Mai/Sea of Blood\u2014affects the trajectory of Chong Mai as it goes to the chest Divergent Meridians: Spleen/Stomach Functions and Uses Regulates Liver Qi. Indicated for: - Liver invading Spleen signs and symptoms: bloating, flatulence, constipation, nausea, vomiting - diaphragmatic constriction - fibrocystic breasts - migraines, pressure around the eyes - angry outbursts - skin conditions due to stress, neurodermatitis Tonifies Lungs; secures the exterior. Indicated for: - weakened immunity - asthma due to stress - exposure to electromagnetic radiation Tonifies the Spleen to expel Dampness and break up stagnation. Indicated for: - Phlegm misting the mind: obsessions and/or pensiveness associated with the Spleen's inability to transport and transform, poor memory, confusion, early signs of dementia (for short-term use only\u2014see Cautions and Contraindications) Opens Penetrating Vessel/Chong Mai to address Sea of Blood issues. Indicated for: - hormonal conditions; menstrual disorders, including headaches; insomnia Nourishes Liver Blood; benefits the Liver's ability to store the Blood. Indicated for: - easy bruising Clears Heat in the Blood. Indicated for: - varicosities - inflamed skin irritations, especially if stress related Nourishes Stomach Yin, generates and regulates Fluids, and directs the Pure Yang of the Stomach upward. Indicated for: - dryness in the sense organs: eyes, mouth, lips, nasal passages - Sjogren's syndrome Mends non-healing wounds, both physical and emotional. Indicated for: - going through the major transitions of life and the changing seasons - opening the throat to express feelings or one's own truth - opening the chest to support the Lungs in releasing the difficulties caused by the sadness of life - addicts who use substances to numb themselves in order to escape from reality, as compared to addicts who can't get enough of a substance Intentional use. Indicated for: - career palace, specifically to cultivate the vocation of a teacher - strengthening throat and heart chakra functions - drawing Heat from the head and opening the portals (the violet color resonates with the crown chakra) - people born in the month of February, as a birthstone Methods of Application Topical Application Hold amethyst in the center of the palm/PC-8 to help open the chest and the heart center. Best used as a sphere. In a stone layout, with the receiver lying on her or his back, place amethyst below the occiput, in the indentations lateral to the center line/UB-10 and GB-20, to relax the neck/throat region for the release of environmental pathogenic factors. In a stone layout, place amethyst approximately in the middle of the top border of the shoulder blade/SI-12 to release Wind. With a dark-colored amethyst massage wand, stroke the midline of the abdomen between the base of the sternum and the navel. Massage downward when feeling overwhelmed, or up and down to balance digestive and emotional issues. Massage, place, or tape: \u00b7 on swellings in the veins, bruises, or varicosities. \u00b7 on the foot, in the \"V\" on the top of the foot where the metatarsal bones of the first and second toes meet/LR-3 and on the Liver and Gall Bladder Luo points, both located on the lower leg (on the medial aspect of the lower leg, a little more than a hand's width up from the high point of the inner anklebone/LR-5, and on the lateral aspect of the lower leg, in a depression a little more than a hand's width above the high point of the outer anklebone/GB-37) to draw out anger held at the constitutional level; combine with howlite to pull emotion out from the Blood level if the anger is intense. \u00b7 in the depression on either side of the nostrils/LI-20 to release sinus blockage. \u00b7 on the central notch at the base of the throat/CV-22 to release the throat to support emotional expression or to treat sore throat. \u00b7 on the chest, in the intercostal space below the breast tissue, in a line below the nipple/LR-14, for alcoholism affecting the Liver. Use the elixir as a wash or spray to treat weeping, ulcerating skin conditions or cellulitis. Amethyst \"beds\"\u2014mats containing crushed amethyst and heated with far-infrared technology\u2014have become popular. From a Chinese medical point of view, the beds are strongly detoxifying, especially benefiting the skin and the throat as well as clearing Heat in the Blood. Wear as a pendant at the center of the chest/CV-17 for grief, palpitations, or asthma related to the Heart and Lungs. Wear as a bracelet to stimulate: \u00b7 the lateral aspect/Yang points on the wrist for seasonal affective disorder or depression. \u00b7 the medial aspect/Yin points on the wrist for anxiety or bipolar disorder. Internal Application Include as a harmonizer in an elixir for migraines, insomnia, or acute toxicity in the body, such as with alcohol poisoning. Include as a harmonizer in an elixir for varicosities. Intentional Application Wear as an amulet to protect against external pathological factors and harsh weather changes. Wear as a pendant to help heal deeply seated emotional trauma. Cautions and Contraindications Because amethyst forms in the presence of water, excessive use can create Dampness. It is not for long-term use when Damp-Heat signs and symptoms are present, or when treating Shen disturbance involving Phlegm mist-ing the mind: obsessions and/or pensiveness associated with the Spleen's inability to transport and transform, poor memory, confusion, and early signs of dementia. Some amethyst will fade if placed in bright light. Compare/Contrast/Differentiate The lighter shades of amethyst have more yang effect; the darker purples have more yin effect. Very dark purple amethyst helps repair Essence/Jing/DNA, increases T cells, supports Heart-Kidney communication, and boosts the immune system. Amethyst helps relieve the sadness of life; smoky quartz helps relieve the challenges of life. Amethyst has a strong Liver affinity. Rose quartz has a strong Heart affinity. Amethyst and rose quartz both affect the upper sensory portals; smoky quartz affects the lower region. Amethyst is beneficial for skin conditions resulting from Heat in the Blood or stress, but not from allergic response. For allergic skin conditions, danburite or apophyllite is more appropriate. Amethyst and purple fluorite have similarities of function but different properties. Although both have an overall cooling effect on the body, amethyst has a slightly warming nature while purple fluorite has a warming nature. For amethyst, the cooling effect comes from its ability to cause the body to emit Heat. This is what allows for its support of greater emotional expression. Purple fluorite, on the other hand, is cooling in its effect because it draws Heat inward, recycling it to the Lower Burner and yielding a net result of cooling the exterior and upper regions of the body. Amethyst forms in the presence of water, while fluorite forms in the absence of water. If the body is not sufficiently hydrated, fluorite will move Fluids via the Triple Heater mechanism to hydrate, but it does not increase Fluids. Amethyst subtly nourishes Fluids. If the treatment principle is to clear Heat and generate Fluids, amethyst is the appropriate choice. Amethyst is harder (7) than fluorite (5). Combinations Amethyst and pyrite are incompatible. Amethyst and hematite do not get along, but together they are helpful in the transition of dying: Place them together on the lateral aspect of the ankle, in the depression between the high point of the anklebone and the Achilles tendon/UB-60/Kun Lun. In this context Kun Lun is the Western Paradise, a legendary region where people go when they die. Hematite, as the matriarchal stone of the Earth, bestows permission to the person's Po/soul of the Lungs to return to the Earth. Amethyst works with the Hun, assisting the person to let go of regrets and other \"baggage\" of this lifetime, so he or she either has no need for another incarnation or willingly choose to return to this plane of existence. Using the two stones together grants passage to both the Po and the Hun. The combination is helpful during hospice care. Combine amethyst with: \u00b7 blue chalcedony if working to open the throat chakra to allow for greater expression. \u00b7 lepidolite to address Chong Mai and Yin Wei Mai issues, such as inherited alcohol addiction. \u00b7 dolomite and/or amber for asthma precipitated by stress. For children, also add chrysocolla (for example, for children who develop asthma after their parents' divorce). \u00b7 emerald for childhood asthma due to Yin deficiency. \u00b7 green tourmaline/verdilite to clear Heat burning the Blood, which causes destruction to the Jing/Essence/DNA (such as with the AIDS virus). Cleansing and Charging Cleanse amethyst in cool running water. Amethyst charges itself. (Any purple stone is said to be a balance of fire and water.) Alternatively, charge in rock crystal. Do not charge in hematite. Amethyst will change to become citrine or smoky quartz if exposed to high temperatures. Stone History The Greeks made wine goblets from amethyst for its ability to clear alcohol from the system quickly. (It clears Heat in the Blood.) Common Locations Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay, Siberia, Madagascar, Sri Lanka Zambia produces a rich color of amethyst. | | CHEVRON AMETHYST | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | LR/HT/SP/ST | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Color/Appearance/Light Purple with white arched bands or \"chevrons.\" The white color is white quartz or albite, a feldspar. Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) + iron and possibly manganese It can include traces of many other elements, including aluminum, calcium, titanium, magnesium, sodium, and lithium. Key Characteristics Enhances combinations intended to affect any of the Yin Eight Extraordinary Channels, especially Penetrating/Chong Mai as it supports Conception Vessel/Ren Mai: having the ability to connect to the self in order to connect with others. Directionality/Energetic Mechanism/Channel System Establishes Heart-Kidney communication. Affects any of the Yin Eight Extraordinary Channels, in particular Penetrating/Chong Mai as it supports Conception Vessel/Ren Mai. Functions and Uses Clears Fire Toxins. Indicated for: - damage to the Essence/Jing or DNA, cancer Methods of Application Topical Application Place chevron amethyst on the midline of the abdomen, at the \"V\" where the ribs meet the base of the sternum/CV-15 to encourage the Penetrating Vessel/Chong Mai in its support of Conception Vessel/Ren Mai to foster the ability to stand on one's own two feet (Chong) and promote the ability to connect with others (Ren). Cautions and Contraindications Amethyst forms in the presence of water; excessive use can create Dampness. It is not for long-term use when Damp-Heat signs and symptoms are present, or when treating Shen disturbance involving Phlegm misting the mind: obsessions and/or pensiveness associated with the Spleen's inability to transport and transform, poor memory, confusion, and early signs of dementia. Some amethyst will fade if placed in bright light. | | ROSE QUARTZ | | (See color insert plate 2) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | HT/LR/ST | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Color/Appearance/Light Pale pink. Usually found as chunks. When found as crystals, it is called pink quartz. It typically has a hazy translucency. The cause of its pink color is not completely agreed upon, though there is general agreement that it is probably due to submicroscopic fibers of a pink borosilicate related to dumortierite, which also accounts for its hazy translucency, or to titanium. When polished into a sphere or cabochon, a six-sided star occasionally appears, similar to the star sapphire. The star \"hovers\" above the stone, depending on the light and angle of view, and presents a stronger spiritual association to the stone. Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) Rose quartz can also include aluminum, iron, and possible traces of many other minerals, including titanium and manganese. Key Characteristics Enhances any combination intended to address emotional or inflammatory conditions. Rose quartz moves the Blood by invigorating Qi. Rose quartz is a tough, durable stone. At the same time, its pink color is soft and gentle. It understands armoring and helps us recognize our rigidity and stubbornness\u2014it helps us open our hearts to be softer and gentler and still be strong on the outside. Directionality/Energetic Mechanism/Channel System Opens the chest and the Heart center and supports the interactive/Ying Qi aspect of life. Yin Wei Mai Functions and Uses Regulates and tonifies Heart Qi and Blood. Indicated for: - low blood pressure - racing heart following exertion - poor circulation, cold extremities - palpitations, insomnia - angina Regulates and invigorates Liver Blood. Indicated for: - irregular or delayed menses, clots - infertility - headaches due to Blood stagnation Regulates and generates the Ye/Thick Fluids. Indicated for: - hypothyroidism, slow metabolism - excessive estrogen levels Absorbs Heat. Indicated for: - swollen or inflamed eyes - congested sinuses Emotional use. Indicated for: - the person who lacks warmth, either emotional or physical - soothing sadness and grief, and anchoring to the Kidneys to manage fear Intentional use. Indicated for: - creativity palace, to attract fertility - relationship palace - nurturing confidence in people who feel helpless; encouraging forgiveness, it helps us open to love - giving as a gift to someone who has \"reached their mark,\" perhaps in weight loss or quitting smoking\u2014it helps people come to terms with who they are now, to claim their new self Methods of Application Topical Application Rose quartz is generally better applied topically or held in the hand than used as an elixir. In a stone layout to open the chest, place rose quartz on the center of the sternum, in line with the nipples/CV-17, with pink tourmaline and rhodochrosite on either side. Hold rose quartz in the center of the palm to stimulate PC-8; it opens the chest and heart center to soothe sadness or bereavement. In a stone layout to address feelings of helplessness and to encourage surrender and release of that which causes pain in life, place a rose quartz generator at the center of the chest and periodically tap it. Place or tape: \u00b7 on swollen eyes to pull out inflammation. \u00b7 on either side of the nostrils to open the sinuses. Internal Application Drink as an elixir before meals for slow metabolism. Intentional Application As fengshui, place at the back right corner (relative to the doorway) of the bedroom to stabilize a relationship. Cautions and Contraindications Use caution with rose quartz as an elixir, because of its potential aluminum content. Rose quartz potentially contains many different minerals. When combined with other stones in an elixir it can distract from the treatment strategy by delivering too many messages to the body. At the same time, it has broad effects and is a good choice if you are uncertain about a strategy. Compare/Contrast/Differentiate Of all the members of the Quartz family, rose quartz has the broadest application. Rose quartz and amethyst both affect the upper portals; smoky quartz affects the lower region. Rose quartz forms with higher temperature and pressure than amethyst or smoky quartz, making it more durable. Rose quartz and rhodonite both tonify Heart Qi. Rhodonite, with its warming nature, is more yang in its effect. Rose quartz has a stronger relationship to the Blood than rhodonite. Combinations Generally, rose quartz is a good harmonizer for combinations to address inflammatory conditions. Rose quartz enhances any stone used to cultivate the relationship palace, such as pink opal, rhodonite, or green garnet. Combine rose quartz with: obsidian for sinusitis. Add tourmaline for chronic sinusitis. \u00b7 onyx for the outward expression of deeply held emotion. Place on pertinent Bladder Shu points, such as on the paravertebral muscles adjacent to the lower border of the T9 spinous process/UB-18 for anger, or adjacent to the lower border of the L2 spinous process (slightly above the waist)/UB-23 for fear. \u00b7 chrysoprase, placed together at the center of the chest, to calm the Shen, or for palpitations. Cleansing and Charging Cleanse in running water; charge with clear quartz. Common Locations It is available in many locations, including Brazil and the United States, but Madagascar currently has the reputation for producing the clearest quality of rose quartz. | | RUTILATED QUARTZ | | (See color insert plate 3) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | LU/LR/SP/ST/KI | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Color/Appearance/Light Clear crystals with lines of color, usually gold, shooting through them. Its appearance represents the internal process of metamorphosis. Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) with needlelike threads (rutiles) shooting through it. The rutiles are usually titanium dioxide, producing golden-colored threads. References here assume the rutile material is titanium, which is regenerative to the Essence/Jing and strengthens the body to help us manage the difficulties of life. Occasionally the threads are crystallized actinolite (Ca2(MgFe2+)5(Si8O22)(OH)2), yielding greenish, black, or gray needles; chlorite (OH)6, yielding a pale greenish color; or black tourmaline. The quartz magnifies the effects of whatever mineral is contained within it. Key Characteristics Enhances and harmonizes combinations intended to protect and regenerate or to address neurological/Wind conditions. Directionality/Energetic Mechanism/Channel System The titanium content brings the effect to the level of Essence/Jing. Functions and Uses Breaks up obstruction. Restores nerves and sinews. Indicated for: - carpal tunnel syndrome, numbness Regenerates damaged organs; protects against radiation. Hold or place on area being radiated. Indicated for: - cancer Emotional use. Indicated for: - working with deep emotional issues, when the Liver may release emotions that the Heart cannot manage; rutilated quartz can help modulate the process Methods of Application Topical Application Tape rutilated quartz on the inner wrist, in the center of the crease in line with the middle finger/PC-7, for carpal tunnel syndrome. When undergoing radiation therapy, hold or place on the area being treated between sessions to protect from the damaging effects. Cautions and Contraindications None known. | | SMOKY QUARTZ | | (See color insert plate 2 and plate 3) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | KI/LU/SP/ST | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Chinese Name Yun shi ying, \"cloudy outstanding stone\" Color/Appearance/Light Brownish or black crystals with varying degrees of transparency. The black color represents finding our own answers. The combination of black with clarity yields a light black and allows the stone to both absorb and reflect light. It can therefore accentuate or diminish, depending on the shade of darkness and our intention. Irradiated clear quartz crystal can appear as smoky quartz, but it is usually a dark color without luster. Smoky quartz will fade if placed in strong light (it loses its yin nature when exposed to too much yang energy). Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2), with possible inclusions of lithium Key Characteristics Enhances and harmonizes combinations intended to increase the body's ability to consolidate Essence/Jing or to otherwise direct energy toward the lower region. Directionality/Energetic Mechanism/Channel System Eight Extraordinary channels, especially Yin Wei Mai, to help with major transitions in life Functions and Uses Strengthens Kidney Qi, especially to treat Lower Burner issues. Indicated for: - incontinence - urinary tract conditions/Lin disorder (the Five Lin: cloudy, painful, stone, taxation, blood) (for both men and women, but best for men) - male impotence, infertility, diminished libido, spermatorrhea - low back pain, especially resulting from long-term coughing and wheezing - taxation syndromes such as chronic fatigue syndrome, long-term fatigue, and exhaustion Drains Damp-Heat. Indicated for: - fungal accumulations - Dampness resulting from pharmaceutical drugs Assists the Kidneys to grasp the Qi. Indicated for: - asthma and wheezing Warming for Cold Bi/Obstruction syndrome, especially in the knees and low back. Indicated for: - adhesions in the joints, arthritis - cold extremities, Raynaud's syndrome Secures the exterior. Indicated for: - electromagnetic radiation, radiation from microwaves and cell phones Emotional use. Indicated for: - major transitional times of life Intentional use. Indicated for: - travel and opportunity and creativity palaces Methods of Application Topical Application Smoky quartz is generally appropriate placed on the lower abdomen. Rub a smoky quartz massage wand over areas of pain, such as at the carpal tunnel, to reduce inflammation. Rub the major articulations (hips and shoulders) with cloudy smoky quartz to help warm and break up adhesions in the joints. Massage, place, or tape: \u00b7 in the depression at the inner corner of the eyebrow/UB-2 for occipital headaches. \u00b7 on the paravertebral muscles adjacent to the lower border of the L2 spinous process (slightly above the waist)/UB-23 and on the medial aspect of the ankle between the Achilles tendon and the high point of the anklebone/KI-3 to support consolidation of Essence/Jing. Roll the foot on tourmalinated smoky quartz for high blood pressure. In a stone layout, with the receiver lying on his or her back, place below the occiput, in the indentations lateral to the center line/UB-10 and/or GB-20, to open the neck and throat region for the release of environmental pathogenic factors. Internal Application It is said that if parents drink an elixir from smoky quartz before sexual intercourse, they will conceive a very intelligent child. Intentional Application For difficulties making life transitions, wear as a bracelet that touches the inner wrist/PC-6. It makes a good gift for a person graduating from one phase of life to another. As a pendant it is protective; it filters out negative vibrations and wards off radiation. Wear as an amulet for traveling to help overcome the fear of new challenges, especially in relationship to the Lungs, which deal with change and vulnerability. An amulet is protective when we feel vulnerable to the people around us, when what they are providing is not nourishing. Cautions and Contraindications None known. Compare/Contrast/Differentiate Smoky quartz has a simpler chemical makeup than amethyst and rose quartz. It gets down to basics. \u00b7 Smoky quartz helps relieve the challenges of life; amethyst helps relieve the sadness of life. \u00b7 Smoky quartz affects the lower region of the body; amethyst and rose quartz affect the Upper \"Portals,\" the sensory orifices. When we are present to our direct sensory experience of the world, our awareness is enhanced. \u00b7 Smoky quartz was formed during a cooling process; rose quartz was formed with more heat and pressure, making it more durable. Combinations Smoky quartz generally combines well with stones that have very strong therapeutic properties, for example black tourmaline. The smoky darkness of the quartz will \"hide\" some of the strong therapeutic effect of black tourmaline. Combine smoky quartz with: \u00b7 calcite to clear Empty Heat signs and symptoms of menopause. \u00b7 green calcite for osteoporosis. \u00b7 chrysoprase to resolve fungal accumulations. \u00b7 topaz when constant exposure to electromagnetic radiation is causing neurological signs and symptoms. \u00b7 charoite (for its ability to regenerate tissue) and selenite (to help flush out dead tissue) for an insulin-dependent person who has actual damage to the pancreas. The smoky quartz brings Kidney Qi to support Spleen Qi. Cleansing and Charging Cleanse in running water. Charge with clear quartz. A double-terminated smoky quartz can be used to cleanse other stones. Place one point touching the stone being cleansed and the other point touching a bed of sea salt. The smoky quartz will pull chaotic energy out of the stone and deposit it into the sea salt. Stone History Smoky quartz was used as an amulet or a snuff bottle for protection when traveling. Other Forms, Colors, Varieties Elestials, also known as skeletal quartz, are a particular type of smoky quartz distinguished by an almost industrial appearance. Their square-ish crystal shape has many natural facets and terminations. They have the qualities of smoky quartz with the additional complexity and depth shown by their structure, making them especially powerful for intentional use. Tabbies form in layers of flat crystals. They are nourishing to Yin and conduct Blood. Tourmalinated smoky quartz contains black tourmaline threads shooting through it. It is particularly suited to conditions involving the lower abdomen. | | TANGERINE QUARTZ | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | LR/LU/KI | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Color/Appearance/Light Dull, orange-ish crystals. A relatively newfound stone, the tangerine color is natural and not to be confused with man-made colors. It usually is available in raw crystal form that has horizontal striations. Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) + iron Key Characteristics Enhances combinations intended to address the Liver and its soul, the Hun. Functions and Uses Regulates the Liver. Indicated for: - diaphragmatic constriction - cloudy vision, visual dizziness Pacifies the Hun. Indicated for: - post-traumatic stress disorder, acute shock or fear Methods of Application Internal Application Drink as an elixir to address functions and uses. Intentional Application Hold the stone for issues pertaining to the Hun, such as soul retrieval, to heal karma. Tangerine quartz is best held in its raw, natural form. Cautions and Contraindications None known. | | TITANIUM QUARTZ | | (See color insert plate 4) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | LU/KI | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Color/Appearance/Light Quartz crystal molecularly bonded with titanium, which coats it with iridescent colors. It is often available as clusters. It has a variety of names, including rainbow and flame quartz. Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) bonded with titanium Key Characteristics Enhances combinations intended to clear Heat and regenerate Essence/Jing. Directionality/Energetic Mechanism/Channel System Supports the process of bringing pathology into latency. Functions and Uses Clears Heat in the Marrow; induces latency. Indicated for: - Steaming Bone syndrome, bone cancer - abnormal replication of cells Methods of Application Topical Application Apply titanium quartz to points to encourage the body to maintain latency. After an acupuncture treatment, place on points to solidify the effect of clearing Heat. Internal Application Prepare an elixir with clear quartz potentiated with titanium quartz to enhance a combination intended to maintain latency; drink to address functions and uses. Cautions and Contraindications The titanium is molecularly bonded to the quartz in a process called chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Unfortunately, in recent times substitute processes have been developed that are not as safe or effective as CVD. The colors are sometimes even painted on and can chip off. Buy only from a knowledgeable vendor, and if uncertain as to quality, use a charged quartz crystal in an elixir. Compare/Contrast/Differentiate Sugilite and sapphire also contain titanium, but they contain other minerals that can complicate the treatment strategy. Titanium quartz is less expensive and offers clear intention. Combinations Combine with tourmaline to eliminate Fire Toxins from the Essence/Jing level. Other Forms, Colors, Varieties It has become popular to enhance quartz crystals by bonding them with different metals, such as with gold to create \"aqua aura,\" with gold and iron to create \"champagne aura,\" and with gold and copper to create \"tangerine aura,\" among others. Quartz crystals treated in this way take on the qualities of the bonded materials and further enhance them. The bonding process works on the actual structure of the molecules. | | TOURMALINATED QUARTZ | | (See color insert plate 3) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | KI/LU/LR | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Color/Appearance/Light Clear quartz crystal with black lines shooting through it.

Tape to the inner edge of the wrist/forearm in line with the thumb, in the depression proximal to the bony landmark of the radial styloid process/LU-7, and also, in line with the index finger, four fingers' width proximal to the bony landmark at the end of the radial styloid process/LI-6 (Luo points), to ease sadness. Cautions and Contraindications None known. | | WHITE/MILKY QUARTZ | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | LU/KI | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Chinese Name Bai zhi ying, \"white outstanding stone\" Color/Appearance/Light White crystals. The white color is from evenly distributed gas and/or fluid inclusions. By the law of signatures, its white color emphasizes Lung function. Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) Key Characteristics Enhances and harmonizes any combination intended to affect the Qi level or the Lungs. Functions and Uses Strengthens Lung function. Indicated for: - coughing, shortness of breath Regulates Qi. Indicated for: - diaphragmatic constriction Methods of Application Topical Application Place white quartz crystal on the chest. Internal Application Drink the elixir to address functions and uses. Cautions and Contraindications None known. | | YELLOW QUARTZ/CITRINE | | (See color insert plate 2) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | SP/ST/LU/KI | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Chinese Name Huang shi ying, \"yellow outstanding stone\" Huang gu shi ying, \"yellow bone outstanding stone\" The color of some citrine includes both yellow and bone white. The yellow benefits the Spleen; the white, because of its resemblance to bone, benefits the Kidneys. Color/Appearance/Light Pale yellow, smoky yellow, or brownish crystals. Citrine can also appear with a green color. The yellow or orange color is associated with the Earth element and the Spleen and Stomach. Natural citrine is somewhat rare. Heat-treated amethyst is often sold as citrine, but it is a stronger yellow than the natural color. If the stone is very yellow it has probably been heat treated. Citrine \"cathedrals\" with their dark yellowish-brown crystals have probably been heat treated. Citrine can become white with overexposure to sunlight. Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) + iron The iron content affects Lung Qi and Spleen Qi. Citrine can also contain traces of sodium, lithium, calcium, aluminum, and magnesium. Key Characteristics Enhances or harmonizes any combination intended to tonify Yang or Postnatal Qi, especially with regard to digestion and metabolism. It generates heat for a quick effect. Directionality/Energetic Mechanism/Channel System Its uplifting character brings support to the Defensive/Wei level. Functions and Uses Tonifies and harmonizes Spleen Qi; regenerates Flesh. Indicated for: - poor digestion, bloating, flatulence - mental confusion resulting from Dampness weakening the Yang: Phlegm misting the mind (obsessions and/or pensiveness associated with the Spleen's inability to transport and transform, poor memory, confusion, early signs of dementia) or an inability to concentrate - fatigue, lethargy - early stages of wasting and thirsting syndrome/Ziao Ke, such as with diabetes - postsurgical wounds - jaundice resulting from Liver invading Spleen or Spleen Qi deficiency Warms and tonifies Yang; tonifies Kidney Qi. Indicated for: -weakened immunity - hypothyroidism - taxation syndrome; long-term fatigue or exhaustion, such as with chronic fatigue syndrome - poor self-image Balances the Defensive/Wei and Nourishing/Ying levels; brings Blood to the surface. Indicated for: - poor circulation, Raynaud's syndrome due to heat consuming Yang Qi Warms the Lower Burner to support the Uterus. Indicated for: - infertility (for women), low libido Emotional use. Indicated for: - upliftment\u2014promotes self-confidence - people with a sense of failure, who find no meaning in life, who receive no praise or recognition from friends or the environment, or who cannot gain weight or stature Establishes boundaries, whether emotional or physical. Intentional use. Indicated for: - wealth palace -solar plexus chakra Methods of Application Topical Application Massage, place, or tape: \u00b7 on the midline of the lower abdomen, approximately midway between the upper border of the pubic bone and the navel/CV-4 to emphasize support to the Kidneys. \u00b7 on the midline of the lower abdomen about two fingers' width below the navel/CV-6 to emphasize support to the Spleen. \u00b7 on the midline of the abdomen, midway between the navel and the \"V\" where the ribs meet the base of the sternum/CV-12, to support Postnatal Qi and digestion. \u00b7 on the navel/CV-8 to affect Kidney Qi and the Lower Burner in general. For the navel/CV-8, with the addition of moxibustion or a far-infrared lamp (not for use with tape), citrine: \u00b7 strengthens the immune system; \u00b7 treats chronic fatigue syndrome; \u00b7 warms the Lower Burner to support the Uterus for fertility; and \u00b7 improves libido. In a stone layout, citrine polished into the shape of a generator is particularly helpful to access the Blood/Ying level. In a stone layout, place citrine approximately in the middle of the top border of the shoulder blade/SI-12, or just below the occiput in the depression approximately one hand's width from the cervical spine/GB-20, for someone who carries the burdens of responsibility on his or her shoulders. Citrine's Yang-building quality encourages the release of Wind from the interior to the exterior. Citrine and Fatigue When a person is chronically fatigued, our first impulse is to tonify energy. We want the person to feel better quickly, so we might use a strategy to tonify the Yang Qi, for which citrine would be a good choice. When a person has signs and symptoms of fatigue and weakness, there is often a deficiency of Spleen Qi as it relates to digestion. An internal weakness is always the result of some excess that has led to the deficiency. For example, a person who is deficient in Spleen Qi may have previously had excessive Stomach Fire, which, over time, consumed the Spleen Qi. The Stomach Fire may have caused a hyperactive thyroid condition to develop. Gradually, as the Stomach Fire causes Spleen Qi to become more and more deficient, the thyroid condition will likely change to hypoactive. If, additionally, there is stagnation in the throat region, a goiter might develop. If we only address the Spleen Qi deficiency, the person will have more energy but the energy will be short-lived, similar to a sugar rush followed by fatigue. The person still has the tendency for Stomach Fire, and by tonifying Spleen Qi we actually support the possible return of the excessive Stomach Fire. In addition, if there is accumulation, as with a goiter, our treatment strategy must also include breaking up Phlegm stasis. Accumulations and concentrations/Juji tax the body's resources by constantly requiring them to transform and move pathology. When things begin to accumulate, decay follows. If the rate of decay is greater than our ability to regenerate, the aging process begins. Our treatment strategy must therefore address not only the deficient Spleen and Yang Qi but also the underlying tendency toward excess and the possibility of accumulation. A stone combination might include citrine to tonify Qi and yellow jasper to break up Phlegm stasis (the yellow color resonating with digestion). To balance excessive Heat or Wei Qi that the citrine might produce, use a regulating stone, such as blue tourmaline, which resonates with the upper region, to break up the stasis. Even though it is warming in nature, it balances excessive Wei Qi with its aluminum content. Place in the depression at the inner corner of the eyebrow/UB-2 for frontal/Yangming headaches. Hold to warm the hands, such as for Raynaud's syndrome. Internal Application Drink the elixir to address functions and uses. Intentional Application Citrine helps establish boundaries, whether in a room or for personal boundaries in life. For fengshui, use a sphere to encompass all directions. Cautions and Contraindications None known. Compare/Contrast/Differentiate When cut into the shape of a generator, citrine is beneficial for the Blood/Ying level; ametrine is better for the Source/Yuan level. Use a clear quartz generator if you're uncertain which level needs treatment. Purple fluorite also warms the Uterus but can only be used for a short time (days to weeks) because of its softness. Use purple fluorite to jump-start the process and follow with citrine. Citrine and apatite both regulate digestion and tonify Qi. Apatite has a stronger relationship to the Bone. Combinations Citrine is a good choice as a harmonizer in a combination to address digestive conditions. Use as an assistant in combinations of stones that affect the Wei level, for instance with agate or calcite, or, to emphasize treatment of skin conditions, with amethyst. Combine citrine with: \u00b7 dolomite for hypothyroidism. Add tiger eye to further strengthen Spleen Qi. \u00b7 epidote for hyperthyroidism, to flush Heat and clear Wind. Cleansing and Charging Cleanse in running water. Citrine holds relatively more heat than other quartz crystals and needs to be cleansed or discharged more frequently. | | YELLOW AND PURPLE QUARTZ/AMETRINE | | (See color insert plate 2) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | LR/SP | | Hardness | | 7 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Produced at all levels, predominantly igneous/Yuan Color/Appearance/Light Crystals of lavender and yellow combined (a combination of amethyst and citrine) Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) + iron Key Characteristics Enhances or harmonizes any combination intended to support Postnatal Qi for the benefit of the Penetrating Vessel/Chong Mai, our blueprint.

Regulates Wei Qi. Indicated for: - leakage of Qi\u2014incontinence, frequent urination, excessive sweating Emotional use. Indicated for: - people who are withdrawn and introverted because they didn't feel acknowledged in their early lives Methods of Application Ametrine is better held or placed on the skin than used internally as an elixir. Topical Application In a stone layout, ametrine cut into the shape of a generator is particularly helpful for accessing the Source/Yuan level. Place the generator at the center of the chest or above the crown chakra. Place on the paravertebral muscles adjacent to the lower border of the T9 spinous process/UB-18 to nourish Liver Blood. Wear a pendant at the center of the chest/CV-17 to address functions and uses. Internal Application Drink as an elixir to repair damage to the Essence/Jing or to support organ transplant. Cautions and Contraindications None known. Combinations Combine ametrine with green tourmaline/verdilite to clear Heat burning the Blood and causing destruction to the Essence/Jing/DNA (such as with the AIDS virus). Cleansing and Charging Cleanse in running water. Charge in clear quartz crystal. | | HERKIMER DIAMOND | | (See color insert plate 5) | | Taste | | Sweet | | Nature | | Slightly warming | | Affinities | | LR/SP | | Hardness | | 7-7.5 | | Crystal structure | | Trigonal | | Stone group | | Framework silicate | | Level of formation | | Igneous/Yuan Color/Appearance/Light Clear crystals, sometimes smoky. They are usually double-terminated. Specks of carbon are sometimes visible. Large crystals often appear with rainbows. Chemical Composition Silicon dioxide (SiO2) Key Characteristics Enhances or harmonizes combinations, especially to increase the strength and duration of the effect of softer stones. It has particular effect in supporting the process of detoxification. Directionality/Energetic Mechanism/Channel System Its double-terminated growth pattern conducts energy both inward and outward, making it a powerful bioregulating stone. Functions and Uses Enhances the effects of other stones, especially softer stones. Regulates Liver Qi. Indicated for: - headaches, diarrhea, and aches and pains, especially related to the process of detoxification Methods of Application Topical Application In a stone layout, or during acupuncture or massage treatment, amplify circuitry by having the receiver hold Herkimer diamond. Internal Application Because it increases the strength and duration of softer stones, fewer doses of the elixir are required per day, making compliance easier. Intentional Application Enhance the effects of a larger stone or a statue by surrounding it with Herkimer diamonds. A source of illumination will further enhance the arrangement. Cautions and Contraindications None known. Compare/Contrast/Differentiate The double-terminated form of Herkimer diamond gives it a more balancing effect than regular quartz crystal. Combinations In general, Herkimer diamonds combine especially well with softer stones, for example with calcite, barite, or selenite.
