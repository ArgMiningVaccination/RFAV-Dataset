Little, DO, CMD The population is aging at an exponential rate. Older adults are vulnerable to suffer from multimor - bidity and iatrogenesis at higher rates than younger adults. Geriatric providers have specialized train - ing to evaluate and treat geriatric syndromes that can help prevent or ameliorate frailty, sarcopenia, disability, and functional decline. However, there is a growing short - age of healthcare practitioners with an expertise in geriatric care. It is, therefore, important to train other primary care providers to identify early signs of decline and imple - ment strategies to help older adults to age successfully. One strategy is to leverage the Welcome to Medi - care and Medicare Annual Wellness Visits (MAWV). These visits were designed with the intent to provide aggressive, safe, and effective pri - mary and secondary prevention strategies for older adults. These visits are reimbursed at higher rates than the standard follow-up visit and are billed using the codes G0438 for the initial Welcome to Medicare visit (average re - imbursement $172.00, pay - able only once per lifetime) and G0439 for the subsequent M AW V (aver - age reimbur se- ment $111.00, payable every 12 months). There are three components to the MAWV: 1) healthcare risk assessment (or as we know it in the geriatrics world: the geriatric assessment) 2) provider consultation 3) personalized prevention plan. 2 Aging Successfully , V ol.

Morley, MB, BChEDITORIAL The Need to Educate Health Professionals in Care of Older Persons Health care is complicated and, in no place is this more so than in the care of older persons. Besides of - ten having multimorbidities, older persons often have specific geriatric syndromes, e.g. , frailty, sarcopenia, anorexia of aging, and cognitive dysfunction, which alter the presentation of diseases and also require to be managed individually. The problem created by the uniqueness of older persons is compounded by a shortage of geriatricians and allied health professionals with specialist train - ing in gerontology. At present, there is one geriatri - cian for every 2,546 persons over the age of 60 years. By 2030, there will only be 1 for every 4,254! Com - pounding this is that geriatricians are the lowest paid physicians, making fewer and fewer physi - cians enthused about becoming geriatricians. To overcome this deficit, it is essential that primary care health professionals receive increased training in the approach to the care of older persons. Many physicians and other health professionals re - ceived minimal training in gerontology during their education. In an attempt to overcome this deficit, the Bureau of Health Professionals at the Department of Health and Human Services has provided interpro - fessional training in geriatrics through the Geriatric Education Centers and, more recently, the Geriatric Workforce Education Program (GWEP). These pro - grams provided and are providing a minimal amount of training to equip health care professionals with tools to care for older persons. Besides an extensive interprofessional train - ing program, we, at Saint Louis University, have developed the Rapid Ge - riatric Assessment (RGA) tool (see page 5) to enable health professionals to assess older persons for geriatric syndromes and completion of advance di - rectives. In Missouri, over 5,000 older persons have been screened for these syndromes by an interprofes - sional workforce, resulting in the finding that over 20% of older Missourians have at least one of these syndromes that is not being treated appropriately. In Perry County, Missouri, this educational ef - fort has led to widespread screening and the devel - opment of a special exercise program for those with sarcopenia and cognitive stimulation therapy for persons with moderate Alzheimer's. We look forward to continued funding for these important education events, so that our older citizens can get optimal cost-effective care as they jour ney through their third age.Dr. Morley offers a daily geriatric nugget via Twitter.

FAX: 314-771-8575Short, validated tools that can be used by any member of the health - care team can be incorporated into a standardized protocol to quickly identify geriatric syndromes and other risks to health and wellness. In this article, I outline an algorithm (Figure 1, see page 16) and specific provider task list (Table 1, see page 4) that can be adopted by clinics and healthcare systems to efficiently integrate the MAWV into the pro - vider workflow. A clinic wishing to take advan - tage of this Medicare benefit will first need to establish a protocol for scheduling patients. Typically, this phase is handled by the call center schedulers with support from the clinic manager. When making ap - pointments for the MAWV, it is important to use scripts to guide the schedulers and patients. There are sample scripts available 1 but each clinic or system should tailor the script to their unique needs and pa - tient populations. The first step is to determine eligibility. One does this in two ways: 1) Electronically using 270/271 in - quiries through the practice man - agement software. This route is better for batch inquiries, for example, if a clinic would like to offer this service to a large group of existing patients. 2) Through the online provider service portal offered by the Medicare administrative con - tractor, which is better for infre - quent inquiries, such as when a single patient calls requesting a MAWV. It is critical to deter - mine if the patient has had the initial visit billed at any point in his lifetime because this code can only be used once and if the bill is rejected, the clinic will Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (continued from page 4) Figure 26 Aging Successfully , V ol. XXVI, No. 1 email: aging@slu.edu Questions? FAX: 314-771-8575lose the revenue for that visit. If it has been established that the visit is a follow-up, the scheduler will need to ascertain if the G0439 code has already been used by another provider within the last 12 months 2. When the patient has been scheduled for a MAWV, it is recom - mended that a standardized packet be mailed to the patient with information on what to expect at the MAWV and forms that the patient can complete in advance to save time in the office. The latter may be particularly im - portant for new patients to the clinic as existing patients will already have much of the infor - mation available in the chart for the providers to review and update. The patients should be asked in advance to bring in the following information: Medical, surgery, and family his - tory. Having this information readily available will help to more quickly input and review it in the clinical chart. Full medication list, including over-the-counter and supplement medications List of healthcare providers and du-rable medical equip - ment suppliers Immunization re - cord Record of screening tests (colo - noscopy, mammogram, abdomi - nal US, DEXA, chest CT, etc.) When the patient arrives for her or his appointment, a member of the team will perform the standardized MAWV assessment, which serves as the basis for the individualized recommendations that will be given by the physician or advanced prac -titioner. This portion can be done by anyone under direct (in house, not in room) supervision of physician or advanced practitioner. I recom - mend the use of a medical assistant, licensed practical nurse, or regis - tered nurse for this purpose. There are required elements of the MAWV that MUST be incorporated into this assessment. 3,4 These are: Energy Transferring Mobility Continence Weight Loss (last 3 months) Feeding DressingGood/Excellent Moves in and out of bed or chair unas - sisted. Mechanical transferring aides are acceptable. Goes out Exercises complete self-control over urina - tion and defecation No weight loss. Gets food from plate into mouth without help.

Evaluation of mood The Saint Louis University Rapid Geriatric Assessment (RGA, Figure 2, see page 5) combines several brief, reliable, validated tools that provide early detection of common geriatric problems, track changes over time, and has nearly all the elements required for the MAWV. Educational materials to train on the use of the RGA can be found on the Gateway GEC web - site: aging.slu.edu. In addition to the elements of the RGA, I recommend screening for depression using the PHQ-2 and asking the following ad - ditional safety questions: 1. Do you smoke? 2. How many alcoholic beverages do you drink a week? 3. Do you feel safe at home? 4. Do you have sex? 5. Have you had accidents or got - ten lost while driving? Once the assessment portion of the visit is completed, the patient is given his personalized prevention plan. 3,4 This is the only part that MUST be done by a physician (MD/ DO), advanced practitioner (NP/PA), or licensed healthcare provider (e.g., pharmacist, health educator, or registered dietician) under direct (in clinic) supervision of the physi - cian 5. This person reviews all the data collected from the patient and at the assessment, creates a risk factor list, creates an age-appropri - ate screening schedule (see Table 2), and gives personalized health advice and a written prevention plan (PPPS).

You MAY bill for CPT codes 99497 and 99498 BUT deductibles and Co-insurance fees must be waived. 6 Some providers and clinics choose to have the patient return for a second advanced care planning visit. At the MAWV, a FOCUSED exam is performed only as necessary. A physical exam is not a required component of the visit. It is critical that patients under - stand the purpose of the MAWV in advance of the ap - pointment. The goal is not to manage acute or chronic medical conditions. If a patient wishes to have an acute medical problem addressed, it needs to be clearly ex - plained that this portion of the encounter will be billed separately and the patient may be responsible for co-pays or other deductibles. Although the MAWV was not originally designed for non-clinic settings, we have successfully incorpo - rated these visits into our nursing home population with the assistance of the facility staff to identify eli - gible patients. The RGA was modified in this setting to include the FRAIL-Nursing Home (FRAIL-NH) scale (see Figure 3 on page 6), which was validated to identify people at high risk of mortality, functional decline, falls, and hospitalizations over 6-12 months. 7-9 Completing MAWVs in the nursing home setting can help medical providers and facilities ensure com - pliance with vaccinations (a 5-star requirement), begin advance directive discussions with caregivers, and identify residents who would most likely benefit from hospice end-of-life care. A toolkit was created to assist nursing home providers to complete MAWVs, meeting all requirements (Figure 4). In conclusion, the MAWV is an important tool for general practice providers to increase revenue and ade - quately evaluate for and treat geriatric syndromes to im - prove outcomes for older adults. Currently underutilized, algorithms and tools exist to help practices to efficiently incorporate MAWV into their workflow. Visit ag - ing.slu.edu for more information and video. Resource List 1.

XXVI, No. 1 9There are many similarities be - tween the lifespan of humans and airplanes. Beginning with the design of the airplane followed by its manu - facture which mimics the creation of a human from a genetic blue print, followed by their growth. In general, human beings live longer than air - planes - 80 years to about 35 years. However, part of the new composite designs are looking to extend air - frame longevity and the magnificent B52 bombers have been in service for 60 years and are expected to fly for another 25 years. As in humans, evaluation and maintenance of an airplane is key to its longevity. In airplanes most evaluation of the fuselage is done by non-distractive testing. This includes visual, liquid penetrant, magnetic, ultrasonic, Eddy current and radio - graphic techniques. These techniques are looking for cracks in the fuselage which need to be fixed early. This was a lesson learnt early when 3 of the de Haviland comet jet liners in 1953 and 1954 broke up in the air shortly after takeoff - these in - cidents became known as the story of the ill-fated comets that crashed like \"a ball of fire and wingless.\" These in - cidents lead to a major overhaul of jet aircraft design and also maintenance (equivalent to preventive medicine in humans). Overall aircraft stress, which leads to metal fatigue and cracks oc - curs predominantly at take-off and landing. Modern airplanes are built to tolerate 47,500 to 110,000 of these cycles. Aluminum, the most light - weight, malleable metal, has been used to manufacture most airplanes. Recently, composites are being used to replace aluminum. Composites are strong, flexible, handle tension well, allow single-piece designs and weigh less than aluminum. All of these are advantages for fuselage design and allow airplanes to carry more pas - sengers. The major reason for fatigue and cracks in the airplane fuselage is oxidative damage (corrosion). This is also a major reason by humans wear out with aging. In humans satellite cells repair the damage that occurs. In some cases, specialized cell systems, such as those in bone, strengthen and repair areas that are exposed to excess stress or are damaged. The osteocytes are mechanosensors that recognize when excess stress is applied to the bone. They also recognize cracks in the bone. The osteocytes can activate osteoclasts which clear damaged bone and osteoblasts that build new bone. Composite manufacturers are experimenting with ways for cracks in the fuselage to be automatically repaired as they occur. One method is for racks to cause release of epoxy resin and amidoamine which then mix to repair the crack. Microcap - sules can release dicyclopentadiene to interact with a ruthenium catalyst as another method to repair cracks. Problems Faced by Older Humans While Flying A major problem faced by older persons when flying is pulmonary embolism. The decreased air pressure in the cabin while flying increases the chance of persons developing clots in their leg veins. Older persons often have sarcopenia (muscle loss) decreasing the ability of the muscles to pump blood through the legs. This is further aggravated by the cramped space in airplanes limiting leg movement. Varicose veins and increased coagulability in old - er persons further increase the chances of forming blood clots. Fortunately, as increased composite use occurs, this will allow increased cabin air pressure. The reduced air pressure with lower oxygen saturations and the ex - (continued on page 10) Aerogerontology: Comparing Human and Airplane Aging By John E. Morley, M.B., B.Ch.Aerogerontology: Comparing Human and Airplane Aging10 Aging Successfully , Questions? FAX: 314-771-8575 pansion of gas in the body can make persons with lung and heart disor - ders more likely to run into trouble on long trips. Sharing bacteria and virus in the cramped quar - ters of a plane is more com - mon and older persons who may have a reduced immune system are more likely to get sick. The uncomfortable seats in planes can aggravate pain from osteoarthritis. During turbulence an elderly passen - ger walking to the bathroom has an increased risk of falls. Jet lag can be a major problem for some older persons who already have sleep disturbances. Pilot Fatigue Pilot error is the cause of over three quarters of disastrous aviation accidents. Pilots aged 60 years need 10 x more light in the cockpit than at 45. Fatigue is a major problem. This is particularly a problem in pi - lots with sleep apnea, which is now screened for in the pilot medical exam. Over age 65 there is a mea - surable decrease in reaction time and decision making. Finally, psy - chological disorders such as depres - sion can cause pilots to make major errors as occurred recently on the German Wings Flight. Conclusion A new field in aviation industry is developing. This is the design of planes to de - crease or fix aging damage of the plane, but also to redesign planes to decrease the risks to the increasingly more aging passengers. This field is called aerogerontology, and we can expect it to blossom over the next decade. I was fortunate to attend the first meeting on this subject between Airbus experts and gerontologists in Toulouse last year .

This GWEP initiative is aimed at developing competent gerontology faculty who have the skills to teach and assess students and is key to improving future care for older adults. To develop healthcare faculty with expertise in geriatrics and gerontology, the Geriatric Leadership Scholars Program provides support for three health care faculty to enhance their geriatric knowledge and skills. Scholars participate in and lead GWEP education events. Each of the Scholars are paired with a Gateway GEC Faculty Mentor who works with the Scholar throughout the year to address teaching, research, and program development issues. Devita Tarell Stall - ings, ings, Ph.D., Saint Louis School of Nursing Devita Tarell Stall - ings, Ph.D., MSN, RN, is an Assistant Professor in the Saint Louis Uni - versity School of Nursing. A member of the nursing faculty since 2013, Dr. Stallings's research focuses on helping adults reduce cardiovascular health dispari - ties by understanding and improving exercise, diet, and medication adher - ence self-management behaviors. Dr. Stallings' experiences in emergency department nursing have guided her interest in public health nursing in which she can work to address health care needs of vulnerable populations. She was recently recognized for her work with the American Heart Association Multicultural Health Initiative.

THE 2017 GERIATRIC LEADERSHIP SCHOLARS INCLUDE: 12 Aging Successfully No. 1 aging@slu.edu July 2015, the Gateway Geri - atric Education Center (GEC) was awarded federal funding from the Health Resources and Services Ad - ministration through the Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) to provide interprofessional education and training for students, faculty, and practitioners in caring for older adults and their family and care networks. Now in the second of three years of funding, the Saint Louis Uni - versity GWEP team, in collaboration with our community and university partners, have made significant pro - cess toward the goals of improving geriatric care in Missouri. Several of our initiatives are described in detail within this issue of Aging Success - fully with our progress toward fully implementing our innovative initia - tives are highlighted here. Our success in working for improved health and social service care for older adults in primary care settings is possible only through the efforts of our community and university partners that are located throughout Missouri. As indicated in the map inset, GWEP's partners include universities (A.T. Still Uni -versity, Kirksville and Washington University, St. Louis), community health systems (Perry County Memo - rial Hospital, Perryville; SSM Health; Myrtle Hilliard Davis Health Center and St. Louis County Health Depart - ment, St. Louis), Northside Youth and Senior Services, St. Louis; Health Resource Center, St. Louis; Alzheim - er's Association, St. Louis; and four Area Health Education Centers (East Central, Southeast, Southwest, and Northeast regions). The goals developed for GWEP are ambitious and far-reaching, but successes abound in each of the ar - eas outlined in the original proposal, and are highlighted here: Interprofessional Geriatric Education In striving to reach our goal of providing students and practitioners with interprofes - sional clinical train - ing in dementia, frailty, sarcopenia, nutritional, and caregiver well-being assessment, our GWEP has developed a multi-faceted approach that creates pathways to as - sessment and intervention in common geriatric syndromes. Two initiatives are underway that not only enable students and practitioners to gain competence in assessing and treating older adults, but are also providing services for older adults and their families in the community. First publicized in the 2016 issue of this newsletter, the Rapid Geriatric Assessment (RGA) (See pg.5) which provides data for the older adult and primary care provider with validated assessment of frailty, sarcopenia, nutritional needs, and cognitive sta - tus has now been administered over 5,000 times throughout Missouri in community-based health screening events, in residential communities, out-patient settings, in-patient acute care settings, and an event at the Mis - souri State Fair. The RGA has also been integrated into the health records systems of several area organizations, including a number of departments within the SLUCare system, Perry County Memorial Hospital, Myrtle Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program:A Year of Innovations Questions? aging@slu.edu Aging Successfully , V ol.

Training students and practitio - ners on using the RGA has expanded across a number of settings and edu - cational institutions. At Saint Louis University, students from medicine, nursing, occupation, physical, and speech therapies, social work, medi - cal family therapy, and interprofes - sional education receive training on the RGA along with the opportu - nity to administer the assessment in a clinical setting. Students from Washington University School of Social Work, A.T. Still University, University of Missouri\u2014Kansas City and St. Louis, and Maryville Univer - sity have also been introduced to the RGA. In total, 1,999 students have been trained, far exceeding our origi - nal goal of 1,100! To learn more about the RGA, visit the GEC website at: aging.slu.edu. For more information on scheduling a training or a screen - ing, send an email to aging@slu.edu. Our second clinical education initiative, the Interprofessional Geri - atric Assessment Clinic (GAC), was launched in February with students and faculty from medicine, occupa - tion, physical, and speech therapies, nutrition and dietetics, and social work collaborating to provide a com - prehensive assessment of older adults (age 65 years and older) and their care partner. The GAC is a partnership with the SLU Health Resource Center, a free student-led multi-clinic service. Patients for this new clinic may be self-referred or referred by a health or social service provider. The clinic is held the first Thursday of each month starting at 1:30 p.m. at the HRC, lo - cated at 1408 N Kingshighway Blvd., #213, St. Louis, MO 63113. To refer a patient or make an appointment, call Sue Brooks at 314-977-8462.A Year of Innovations (ccontinued from page 12) GWEP interprofessional educa - tion initiatives extend beyond the classroom and clinical settings. GWEP faculty have organized two Interprofessional Graduate Geriatric Case Competitions (see article on page. 22) with students and faculty from more than ten different profes - sions and five universities participat - ing in a month-long experience in which students develop an interpro - fessional plan of care which is then presented to a panel of faculty judges. The third cohort of GWEP Ge - riatric Leadership Scholars has now been selected and will begin on July 1, 2017, for a year-long experience. See page 11 to learn about the current cohort of Scholars. Each Scholar is paired with a GWEP faculty mentor to deepen her or his expertise in ge - riatric research or curricular develop - ment, participates in GWEP clinical activities, and shares his or her work with others through presentations. Our Scholars are conducting research in such areas as end-of-life care in nursing facilities around the world, Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, and physical therapy with older adults in the community. We are pleased to report that the combined efforts of many SLU facul - ty over a number of years has resulted in the approval of an Interprofessional Graduate Certificate in Gerontology. Launching in Fall 2017, students and professionals from the community can complete the 12-15 credit hour certificate program by selecting courses in medicine, nursing, social work, occupational and physical ther - apy, nutrition and dietetics, law, health care ethics, medi - cal family therapy, communication sci - ences and disorders, public health, and communication. For more informa - tion on this new program, contact Dr. Cara Wallace at wallacecl@slu.edu. With the in - troduction of the Medicare An - nual Wellness Visit (MAWV) into primary and geriatric health care, GWEP faculty have responded to a need for profes sional training. GWEP faculty Drs. John Morley and Milta Little and Nurse Practitioner Pa - tricia Abele have developed a protocol to guide the completion of the MAWV (on pages 16-17). Specialized Training Programs While identifying physical and cognitive health concerns in older adults is the first step in competent geriatric care, being able to offer interventions is critical, but often the missing piece of the compre - hensive geriatric care plan.

Still University have delivered train - ing across the U.S., developed on-line learning modules, introduced a course on Individual CST (iCST) for medical students, integrated CST into coursework for social work, communication sciences and dis - orders, and medical family therapy students, and conducted research to examine the applicability of the U.K.-developed intervention within a U.S.-based population. Here at Saint Louis University faculty mem - bers Dr. Whitney Postman (Com -munication Sciences and Disorders) and Max Zubatsky (Medi - cal Family Therapy) and their graduate stu - dents are offering CST groups, while Drs. Marla Berg-Weger and Sue Tebb (School of Social Work ) and Dan Stewart, social work doctoral student, are studying the impact of iCST on persons with dementia and their caregivers. To read about iCST, see the story on page 29 and to learn more about CST, visit our CST page at aging.slu.edu. To in - quire about training, email aging@slu.edu . Exercise and Strengthening\u2014 GWEP faculty members Kelly Hawthorne and Jill Fitzgerald, Department of Physical Therapy, have developed a training cur - riculum for exercise and strengthening to prevent falls and sarcope - nia that can be offered in community or residential set - ting. Training is available in- person or on-line at aging.slu.edu. Caregiver Well-Being and Support\u2014 GWEP faculty Dr. Sue Tebb (School of Social Work) and Geriatric Leadership Scholar, Dr. Max Zubatsky (Department of Family & Community Medicine Medical Family Therapy Program) will be debuting at the Summer Ge - riatric Institute the Caregiver Well-Being and Support training that utilizes the HRSA-produced Caregiver Training modules. The curric - ulum provides a ses - sion-based approach to facilitating a care - giver support group. To learn more about this new training, see the article on page 23. A training video will soon be available at aging.slu.edu. Looking Forward to the Future As this update on GWEP ac - tivities conveys, our GWEP team and partners continue to engage our students, faculty, partners, and professionals in education and train - ing to transform the primary health care community. Our goal remains to provide the best possible health and social service care for the old - est members of our society. As we plan for the upcoming year, our focus will be on further integrating the Rapid Geriatric Assessment into the health systems in our region, disseminating the training that has been developed in Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, Exercise and Strengthening, and Caregiver Well-Being and Support, and graduating students who will be well prepared to serve older adults.

Care Planning: Critical Self-Reflection By Cara Wallace, Ph.D., LMSW Advance care planning (ACP) for end-of-life care has a renewed public interest with the recent popu - larity of Atul Gawande's best-selling book on end-of-life care, 1 national debates surrounding current death with dignity legislation, and public - ity surrounding The Conversation Project, 2 a movement which encour - ages everyone to have conversations about their end-of-life wishes. Be - ginning in January 2016, Medicare now reimburses physicians and other qualified health care provid - ers for voluntary ACP sessions with patients and their families. 3 While these are encouraging signs that, as a culture, we are becoming more comfortable with conversations sur - rounding end-of-life care, in prac - tice, many providers do not always talk to their patients about ACP, even when opportunities emerge in a clinical visit. 4 When communication does occur, the quality and content of these conversations varies. 5 Though practitioners over - whelmingly agree on the importance of ACP and preparing for the end of life, 6 the process is fraught with both professional and personal barriers. On the professional side, physicians report barriers such as language or medical interpretation issues, patients' limited health literacy, patients' mistrust of the health care system, and a lack of understanding about patients' cultural or religious beliefs surrounding death, dying and decision-making. 7 Other reported barriers include lack of knowledge about available services, lack of train - ing, and lack of standardized criteria for referrals. 8,9 On the personal side, even physicians do not have formal conversations about their own ACP with their own providers and fami - lies, 10 citing lack of time as a primary reason for why communication and completion have not occurred. 11 As a provider, you can perhaps see yourself within these barriers and you already recognize ACP as a potential area for improvement in working with patients. For others, maybe this is less on your radar. Yet, each of us has a history that tells a story about how and why we chose to pursue the degree and career path we did. Our early experiences on this path contribute to this story and the shaping of an individual to a cli - nician. Maybe, there are clues within this history that have the power to impact how we interact with patients and families in ACP. In an autobiography written as he was faced with his own terminality, 12 Dr. Paul Kalanithi recounts many of the professional experiences that taught him about working with pa - tients on the brink between life and death: \" Amid the tragedies and failures, I feared I was losing sight of the singular importance of human relationships, not between patients and their families but between doctor and patient. Technical excellence was not enough. As a resident, my highest ideal was not saving lives\u2014everyone dies eventually\u2014but guiding a patient or family to an understanding of death and illness.\" Dr. Kalanithi's reflections al - lowed him to connect his profes - sional experiences with his personal life, enabling him to be clearer about not only what he wanted in his own healthcare, but also as a skilled clinician, how to communi - cate with patients and family members about wishes of their own. This reflective process is one that few of us engage in, but that likely has direct relevancy to how we practice direct patient care. In a current, ongoing study with SLU colleagues, Drs.

Dr. MorleyFor information contact Sue Brooks 314-977-8462.18 Aging Successfully , 1 19(continued on page 20)Through the collaborative efforts of multiple academic units and the Gateway Geriatric Education Center, approval was received in October 2016 to offer a new university-wide Graduate Certificate in Interprofes - sional Gerontology (GIGC). Begin - ning in Fall 2017, this innovative opportunity will be available to Saint Louis University graduate stu - dents and community professionals. The GIGC is a formal academic award (as defined by the U.S. De - partment of Education) conferred by the University upon the success - ful completion of all requirements. This certificate is for post-bacca - laureate students across disciplines who wish to pursue a gerontology- related career. The GIGC consists of 12 credit hours, attendance at SLU's Geriatric Education Center Summer Institute, and a discipline- specific practicum with older adults. For community members not currently enrolled in an active degree program, the practicum can be waived with gerontology-related practice experiences. The GIGC builds upon courses already offered at SLU across a num - ber of departments allowing students to take elective coursework outside of their own academic program. The goal is for students to achieve an in - terdisciplinary education alongside peers from various fields which they will encounter in the workforce. The following SLU programs and depart - ments are currently involved and/or supportive of the GIGC program: Albert Gnaegi Center for Health Care Ethics College for Public Health and Social Justice Department of CommunicationBy Cara Wallace, Ph.D., LMSW Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders Department of Health Management and Policy Department of Family and Community Medicine; Medical Family Therapy Program Department of Nutrition and Dietetics Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy Department of Physical Therapy and Athletic Training Division of Geriatrics, School of Medicine, Gateway Geriatric Education Center School of Law School of Nursing School of Social Work The certificate program will aid in addressing the increasing need for h ealth and social service professionals to care for our older adult population. U.S. Census data indicates older adults currently comprise 14.1% of the population, a number that will increase to 27% by 2050. 1 As the population of older adults increases, so does their project - ed longevity, racial/ethnic diversity, rates of poverty, potential for being childless and/or single, and number of chronic illnesses. In 2011, the CDC reports that 80% of all older adults had at least one documented disabil - ity or chronic illness and half had two or more. 2 At least one chronic illness is reported by 95% of older Missou - rians, while 80% experience at least two and 65% have at least three.3 Each of the above factors has the potential to increase older adults' risk for compromised health and impact older adults' quality of life and ability to age-in-place, thus prompting the need for competent, person-centered health and social care providers. With the passage of the Afford - able Care Act, 4 care coordination and interdisciplinary care teams were identified as important to im - proving health outcomes, prevent - ing hospitalizations, and reducing the cost of care for older adults. This certificate program will train individuals to be part of such teams. The certificate curriculum is designed using the Association for Gerontology in Higher Educa - tion's (AGHE) Gerontology Com - petencies for Undergraduate & Graduate Education as a guide. AGHE is a well-established organization consisting of experts in aging throughout the US, Canada, and abroad, whose goals are to: \"1) advance gerontology and geriatrics education in academic institutions; and 2) provide leadership and sup -SLU Launches New Graduate Interprofessional Gerontology Certificate Program20 Aging Questions? FAX: GIGC from page 17) port of gerontology and geriatrics education faculty and students at edu - cation institutions.\"5 Employment of gerontology- re - lated health care workers are all pro - jected to grow faster than the average across all occupations. See the chart above for projected growth in select occupations. Each of these identified pro - fessions need workers trained in gerontology, as highlighted by the Department of Labor Sta - tistics. \"Healthcare social work - ers will continue to be needed to help aging populations and their families adjust to new treatments, medications, and lifestyles,\" 6 and \"occupational therapists...help senior citizens maintain their independence\" and are also needed in healthcare settings to assist with patients with chronic con - ditions. 7 Similarly, physical therapists will be needed to care for adults who are remaining more active later in life. Older adults are now also \"more likely to experience heart attacks, strokes, and mobility-related injuries that re - quire...rehabilitation.\" 9 These same health conditions will also contribute to speech or language impairments requiring speech-language patholo - gists. 10 \"Psychologists will also be needed to provide services to an aging population, helping people deal with the mental and physical changes that happen as they grow older.\" 8 The growth of an aging population will also \"increase the need for dietitians and nutritionists in nursing homes\" in addition to baby-boomers looking for ways to stay healthy creating \"more demand for dietetic services.\" 11 Finally, regis - tered nurses will be at the forefront of caring for older adults who \"typically have more medical problems than younger people.\" 12 The GIGC directly aligns with SLU's Jesuit tradition and mission. Older adults are a vulnerable popu - lation in great need of coordinated services and care. With the shortage of healthcare workers identified to fill the workforce in this area, 6-12 Jesuits' mission to help \"where the need is greatest\" is particularly relevant. The holistic, interdisciplinary approach of the certificate program also aligns with a focus on \"the whole person.\" Available gerontology-focused courses are matched to identified AGHE competencies and students are required to complete a course within each of the following three compe - tency areas: Foundational Compe - tencies to All Fields of Gerontology, Interactional Competencies Across Fields of Gerontology, and Contex - tual Competencies Across Fields of Gerontology (Well-being, Health and Mental Health; Social Health; and Policy). Students are allowed to take these courses as they fit into their schedules as long as they complete the curriculum grid and take courses from at least two different departments in completing the certificate program. This enhances students' opportuni - ties to learn from interdisciplinary perspectives. In order to demonstrate achieve - ment of learning outcomes, students will work with their advisors to link chosen course assignments (papers, projects, exams, etc.) to each outcome. These assignments will be culled into a final portfolio which will be submit - ted upon completion of the certificate. The portfolio will be assessed by the student's academic advisor and the Gerontology Certificate Coordina - tor (GCC), using a standard program rubric. GIGC learning outcomes include the following: 1. Utilize gerontological frame - works to examine human devel - opment and aging.2. Relate psychological theories and science to understanding ad - aptation, stability and change in aging.3. Identify comprehensive and meaningful concepts, definitions and measures for well-being of older adults and their families. 4. Engage, through effective commu - nication with older persons, their families and the community, in personal and public issues in aging. 5. Employ knowledge of older per - sons' strengths and adaptations to maximize well-being, health and mental health To learn more about this new pro - gram, contact Cara Wallace, GIGC Coordinator, at 314-977-2746 or wal - lacecl@slu.edu.

Available XXVI, No. 1 21Jennifer Ohs, we are examining po - tential connections between: 1) practitioners' personal and profes - sional history with loss; 2) their own completion of (and com - munication about) advance direc - tives; and 3) attitudes and current practices sur - rounding ACP and referrals to hos - pice and palliative care. Initial analysis of nearly 180 health care practitioners (physicians, nurse practitioners, RNs, social workers and others) demonstrates strong cor - relations between a person's history of loss (both professionally and person - ally), completion and communication about one's own directives, and his/her attitudes and practices in professional ACP. Our experiences are inexplicitly connected with how we practice. Though many of us respectively received training on separating our be - liefs, emotions, and experiences from professional practice, we have less understanding and practice with ac - knowledging the connections between them, or how to handle the inevitable impact of the personal on the profes - sional. In a text examining emotional and countertransference responses in palliative and end-of-life care, 13 clini - cian Renee Katz posits the following: \"We propose that our professional work...is extremely personal in nature, that we are profoundly influenced by our patients and their families as much as they are impacted and influenced by us, and that our emotional responses do impact the clinical moment\u2014whether we want them to or not, whether we are aware or not, whether we can admit it or not.\" More than likely, each of us is concerned about assisting our patients with planning for their end-of-life care though many barriers remain. Perhaps the place to start is not just in having the conversations within our own lives, but also in exploring how our own experiences and emotions shape our practices and preferences, both personally and professionally. Maybe it is within this critical self-reflection where we can find mean - ingful connection to the stories of our patients, and perhaps then we can en - gage in more effective advance care planning for all of us.

FAX: 314-771-8575Interprofessional Teamwork Improves Care for Older Adults Students from Saint Louis Uni - versity, Washington University, A.T. Still University, and Maryville University participated in the 2 nd In- terprofessional Case Competition. Teams were charged with develop - ing a plan of care for a complex geriatric patient which was then presented to a panel of faculty judg - es from multiple universities and professions. Nearly 100 students in nine disciplines participated in this innovative program, based on a model developed at A.T. Still Uni - versity, Kirksville, Missouri. As interprofessional practice is the hallmark of geriatric care, enabling students to participate in an experiential learning op - portunity such as the Competition is critical to their future practice. Many older adults have complex problems best approached with interprofessional expertise. Most health professionals do not learn about the expertise of other team members as each is educated sep - arately, learning the methods and professional terminology of their discipline1. Ideally, health profes - sionals begin learning to work together during their educational experiences to gain comfort as they move into practice. As the focus of our GEC is to strengthen knowledge of in - terprofessional geriatric care, the Interprofessional Geriatric Case Competition provides a forum for students to learn about aging in a team experience to build skills for practice. The case competition design is based on the Interprofes - sional Education Collaborative 2 core competencies for interprofes - sional teamwork: 1) Work with individuals of oth - er professions to maintain a climate of mutual respect and shared values; 2) Use the knowledge of one's own role and that of other professions to appropriately assess and address the health-care needs of patients and to promote and advance the health of populations; 3) Communicate with patients, families, communities and professionals in health and other fields in a responsive and responsible manner that sup - ports a team approach to the promotion and maintenance of health and the prevention and treatment of disease; and 4) Apply relationship-building values and the principles of team dynamics to perform effectively in different team roles to plan, deliver, and evaluate patient/population-centered care and population health programs and policies that are safe, timely, efficient, effective, and equitable. In reflecting on the team simu - lation, students reported feeling positive about being submerged in a team, gaining insights into other professionals, advocating for patients and families, and of the respect and communication shown. All students said they would recommend the experience. Look for the 3rd Geriatric Case Competition in fall of 201 7, open to any health professions students in the region.

As a daughter of a newly diagnosed mother (Judy) with demen - tia and tending to her recovery from shoulder surgery, Stacey's life became complicated quickly, all while hav - ing her only child leaving for college soon. Throughout the initial appoint - ments with her mother's primary care physician, Stacey was offered little support, services, or resources. When a social worker was brought into one of these appointments, Stacey wanted the professional to hear her concerns about the future of the caregiving process. Instead, the social worker provided psychoeducation-focused information to the family about what signs and symptoms to look for in de - mentia during the following months. Judy was later referred to a geriatri - cian from a different clinic. This pro - vider wanted Judy on a higher dose of Aricept, but never communicated this information to her primary care doctor or medical team. Stacey was not only confused as to the direction of her mother's care, but had no infor - mation that can help manage her life as both a daughter and caregiver. Stacey is not an outlier in the struggles that dementia caregivers en - dure. Dementia caregivers are often seen as the \"hidden patients\" in our healthcare system, as they are at risk for increased emotional, psychologi - cal and physiological problems over time. 1 Given that a large proportion of patients with dementia are first detected in primary care, 2 the referral options and strategies after the diag - nosis are often disjointed.3 Families who are not part of the care process The Hidden Patient in Integrated Care Addressing the Health Concerns of Dementia Caregivers By Max Zubatsky, Ph.D. and Susan Tebb, Ph.D. may continually see loved ones re-admitted to the hospital multiple times for preventable reasons. Furthermore, behavioral health and other social service entities are not brought into the treatment process until it is too late. As a result, finding effec - tive methods for managing the behavioral and psycho - logical symptoms of care - givers is a public health and economic priority. 4 The evidence for an in - tegrated, family-centered approach to dementia care is essential for a number of reasons: 1) A wide range of overlapping conditions of - ten present with dementia. Healthcare providers need to assess further for other biopsychosocial issues that often present in this population. Physicians and behavioral health professionals often overlook the family caregiver(s) and systemic problems that exist around dementia (e.g., communication, boundaries of outside family, and aiding daily physical activity). Many patients often go undiagnosed with depres - sion months after a diagnosis, where caregivers may assume that isolation or flat mood might be signs of just the dementia. 2) Most dementia diagnoses are incurable, and thus debilitating on the family as a whole. Because Al - zheimer's disease and other demen - tias are progressive disorders, family members must continually prepare for increased services and needs of the care-recipient. Conversations with caregivers and support systems must be continual as their loved ones progress through certain dementia stages. Families must also commu - nicate as to who is involved in the caregiving team, whether in-town or long-distance. All family members should also have a list of providers included on the patient's care team. 3) Many individuals with dementia require consistent moni - toring over time for safety issues. As symptoms of dementia prog - ress, issues such as driving, fall risk and daily eating become concerns 24 Aging Successfully , V ol. XXVI, No. 1 email: aging@slu.edu Questions? FAX: 314-771-8575that families should speak with healthcare providers about. Patients who lack consistency in attending healthcare appointments often have greater risk of safety and fall issues. Many caregivers are unaware of the resources on safety available from the Alzheimer's Association, AARP, and other organizations and websites that provide resources for aging. 4) As the disease progresses, the compounding physical and mental health issues of caregivers leads to increased risk of earlier mortality. Caregivers are often overlooked in the initial appointments after a di - agnosis of dementia is made. If not caught early, areas such as depres - sion, anxiety, insomnia, pain, and weight problems of the caregiver often exacerbate over time. Provid - ers must be aware that caregivers often do not come forward with their health complications, sacrificing their needs for the sake of their loved one's condition and therefore health - care providers must ask about them. 5) Advances of treatment for dementia may improve survival, but also increase length of care and time needed to provide resources. As older adults have an increased risk for chronic health issues, they are also living longer. Caregivers of persons with dementia often need to be pre - pared for the \"long haul\" in the time and resources set aside for their loved one. Additionally, caregivers must weigh the options of living situa - tions throughout the course of the disease and what transition of care options will entail emo - tionally and financially. Those who work with caregiv - ers and families of individuals with dementia often struggle with specific interventions to address the strains and burdens of the disease. The fol - lowing are models and approaches that may help guide healthcare pro - viders in offering more formalized integrated care services to caregivers. Telephone-Assisted Programs The challenges of effectively coordinating services for families of dementia in primary care are well known. Traditional dementia inter - vention programs for families have often been staff intensive and require a significant amount of time to see members face-to-face. To address the barriers and access to care issues for caregivers, a collaborative care man - agement intervention has been piloted to offer support to individuals over the phone. 5 An assigned care manager is the direct link to the caregiver, care recipient, PCP and resource team, of - fering resource options to these areas while receiving continual feedback. This model produces positive out - comes for caregivers regarding access to care options, follow-up communi - cation with professionals and com - munity links to resources. Although the model was established through the Veterans Administration, this stream - line of communication and direct re - sources can apply to a number of sites where providers see older adults. REACH I and II Projects Along with the physical burdens of dementia come the challenges of individuals remaining in their homes longer and improving the safety of their living environment. REACH (Resources for Enhancing Alzheim - er's Caregivers Health) provides caregivers one-to-one counseling and education about ways to manage their loved ones living situation. Care spe - cialists at clinics and organizations develop a personalized approach to find solutions for caregivers around depression, caregiver stress, home safety and social support services in times of crisis. The REACH-II project is a modified version of the original approach, designed to promote active problem solving skills and reduce a sense of burden in caregivers. In ad - dition to the REACH interventions, providers offer a series of in-home and telephone sessions that tailor the specific needs of the caregiver and the stage of disease of their loved one. 6 The Scott and White Family Caregiver Program Although patients with dementia receive adequate care in hospitals and inpatient settings, the lack of continu - ity between providers and families upon discharge is concerning. Even in primary care settings, caregivers receive little information after demen - tia diagnosis is received. The Scott and White Family Caregiver Pro - gram (FCP) 7,8 addressed this area of concern, where patients with demen - tia and their families are identified through both electronic medical re - cords and primary care provider refer - ral sources. The program was adapted from the REACH-II program, but can be applied to a number of healthcare settings. A set of developmental ac - tivities were offered to caregivers and families by the staff and would be the first point of contact for any referral sources. These activities included a Caregiver's Notebook (series of nine sections for caregivers to read) and a Family Profile (tailored to address the risks/needs of the family in caring for the patient). Saint Louis University (SLU) and the Gateway Geriatric Education Center (GEC) also offer a number of valuable resources for caregivers and healthcare professionals alike. The Caregiver Tools and Education sec - tion on the GEC website (http://aging.slu.edu;index.php?page=caregiver-tools-education) now offers a series of Hidden Patient (continued from page 21)24 Aging Successfully , V XXVI, No. 1 25caregiver videos, covering topics such as practice strategies for profession - als, end of life decision-making and caregiver stress in the Latino popula - tion. This site also includes a training manual for facilitators looking to start a dementia caregiver support group. Professionals can even download a copy of the Rapid Caregiver Well-Be - ing Scale. 9 Addition - ally, a new Memory Clinic is now avail - able for individu - als, caregivers and family members to receive comprehen - sive services at SLU. On Monday morn - ings, the Center for Counseling and Family Therapy at SLU will provide therapy services, caregiver groups, cognitive stimulation therapy and free geriatric screenings. For more infor - mation on SLU-based resources, visit aging.slu.edu. Caregiver stress has now be - come a population health issue, where an estimated 43 million Americans are now caring for someone with a chronic illness or disability. 10 Policymakers, funders and researchers will need to see the greater role that family caregivers provide and recognize their value. The short-term investments we make to provide services and sup - port to caregivers at any stage will produce long term health benefits.

Thus, preventing aging starts at a young age. While the pearls of aging success - fully described here are aimed at persons 60 and older, most of them are equally valid at all ages.By John E. Morley, M.B., B.Ch. professionals can use to rapidly iden - tify early onset of geriatric syndromes (aging.slu.edu). The lifestyle interventions most appropriate are exercise and a Medi - terranean type diet. Exercise clearly decreases cardiovascular disease, improves muscle function preventing diabetes, sarcopenia, and frailty, and may positively influence cognitive function. The exercise component should include resistance and bal - ance exercises as well as aerobic ex - ercises. Exercise becomes even more important when an older person has mobility impairment or multiple hos - pitalizations. The optimum diet for an older person is five helpings of fruit and vegetables (one could be replaced by nuts). The secret ingredient in fruit is the polyphenols which my group has recently shown are potent memory enhancers. Similarly, extra virgin ol - ive oil (up to 1 liter a week) decreases cardiovas cular disease and enhances memory. Besides eating salads a veg - etarian dish of fish paella (the great Catalan dish) is an excellent way to get sufficient vegetables. I always double the suggested amount of olive oil to the online recipes for paella. In addition, one should have fatty fish (salmon, tuna) at least 2 to 4 times a week. Fish contains the healthy omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentanoic and docosahexanoic acid. One or two glasses of alcohol a night will do no harm (unless you are an alcoholic) and may be beneficial. A recipe for mak - ing a martini with olive oil is available online. Other olive oil based cocktails are Alligator Alley, Basil Exposition, Oliveto, and Phaedon. The best way to get vitamin D is to spend about 30 minutes each day in the sun. If you cannot do this, take no more than 1,000 IU of vitami n D dai - ly. Higher doses may cause problems for some persons. Do not measure your vitamin D as the measurement is useless without knowing your vitamin D binding protein. Remember that taking a multivitamin does no good and may do some harm. Get your vi - tamins from fruits. It is important to remember that in older persons weight loss is often bad. There are many reasons for this, but a major one is that loss of weight leads not only to a loss of fat, but also muscle and bone increasing the older In the last decade there has been an increased awareness of the im - portance of Person-Centered Care. Most older persons have a number of diseases (co-morbidities) and geriatric syndromes which put them at risk for polypharmacy and can modulate the approach to treatment. Your physician needs to be aware of these interac - tions and work with you to create an optimal quality of life for years. Many geriatric syndromes have easily treat - able causes, e.g., frailty - sleep apnea, hypothyroid, depression, hypotension, and vitamin B 12 deficiency; anorexia of aging - depression, medications, nosocomial infections, endocrine disorders, celiac or pancreatic disease, tion - sleep apnea, atrial fibrillation, depression, anticholinergic drugs, en - docrine disorders, hearing and vision problems, and infections. All these geriatric syndromes are responsive to lifestyle changes. In the case of recog - nizing hypotension and which blood pressure to treat in most persons, am - bulatory (home) blood pressure should be obtained.

Other ways to slow aging are to maintain socialization and brain activity, have appropriate vaccina - tions (Note: a new shingles vaccine should be available this year and it appears much better than the present one), and undergo screenings where appropriate, e.g., ultrasound for males who smoked to look for an abdominal aortic aneurysm, colonoscopy, mam - mogram, etc. Finally, at least for persons with diabetes, there is emerging evidence that METFORMIN (a $2 a month drug) may improve memory (see our letter to JAMDA - Liccini, et al .

For all of us aging in the 21st cen- tury we can be almost guaranteed of a robot in our future. The rapid advance in robotic technology and the desire of baby boomers to stay at home rather than to go to an assisted living or nursing home will increase the momentum to making home a safe place for the disabled and the cognitively impaired. Telemedicine is already here and for most of us it will clearly become the method of choice for a physician visit. For those of us who cannot get out of bed, \"Reba the Nurse\" - a bear- like robot - is almost ready for prime time. She can safely whisk us out of bed and into a wheelchair or chair. Mobile toilets that can be summoned to the bedside by the patient will help to provide dignity and timely toilet - ing. Japan has developed a toilet that can be worn by persons in bed and will evacuate feces and urine and wash and dry the patient's bottom. Perhaps the most exciting invention is the \"Smart Care Bed\" which allows changing sheets without moving the patient, provides massage for the pa - tient to prevent pressure ulcers, has a toilet/bidet system to allow toileting in bed and can be engineered to allow a bath to be part of the bed. For feeding individuals, \"My Spoon\" is already in existence. A variety of entertainment robots such as \"Aibo the dog\" and \"Paro the seal\" have been shown to improve quality of life. Exercise robots to lead ex - ercise sessions in nursing homes are also in existence. The Wii represents another robotic exercise system. A variety of electronic detection devices exist that can monitor how long a person spends in bed, whether they use the toilet or refrigerator, if they fall, if they have a change in walking speed or if they leave the house (and track them if they do). This approach has been used by Marilyn Rantz and team at Tiger Place in Missouri to de - velop the ability of older persons to be successfully monitored w it hout having an intrusive individual checking up on them. A number of robotic devices are being developed for rehabilitation, which re - duce the need for one-on-one assistance from a physical therapist. The most exciting of these is the exoskeletons which can allow persons with paraplegia to walk. Companionable is an EU re - search project that has created a mo - bile robot to act as a companion for older persons living at home. Besides providing companionship it monitors falls, can make emergency calls, pro - vide reminders such as to take their medicine, store and make available objects such as keys, play cognitive stimulation games and act as a video communication with health care pro - fessionals, family and friends. The robot can also monitor physiological signs. Mobiserv is another EU project that acts as a social companion; inter - acts with smart clothes that monitor vital signs, falls and sleep patterns; and interacts with a smart home en - vironment. Japan has developed some humanoid robots, such as ChihiraAico and Pepper, which can respond to humans, show emo - tions and read to humans. The first set of 1,000 Peppers costing $1,600 each sold out within the first hour. Encore Smart is an assisted walker that can enhance the ability of older persons to ambulate. When in Japan last year, I had the opportu - nity to try out one of Cyber - dyne's assisted limbs. Most incredibly these limbs can move by picking up peripheral electrical impulses when the individual thinks of walking or moving a limb! We are not yet at the level of the movie \"Robot and Frank.\" In this movie Frank, a cognitively impaired older person, was given a robot as a companion. Frank, who had spent most of his life robbing banks \"con - vinced\" the robot to help him rob a bank! However, companionable and Mobiserv are not that far away. It would appear that it is time that we all accepted that there will be an assis - tive robot in our future.

Stewart, MSG The nu mber of individuals devel - oping dementia is rapidly increasing. A progressive and chronic illness in nature, a diagnosis can be devastating and daunting. While a cure remains unknown, health professionals and caregivers continuously seek effective and innovative treatment for persons with dementia. Historically, dementia has been seen and treated through a biomedical lens, changing attitudes towards dementia care have led to in - creased interest in more holistic forms of treatment. While pharmaceuticals continue to have their place in de - mentia care, innovative non-pharma - cologic treatment options are gaining popularity. Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (iCST) is a one-on-one non-pharmacologic psychosocial interven - tion for individuals with dementia. Created by a team of researchers and clinicians at the University College London (UCL), iCST is largely based on Cogni - tive Stimulation Therapy (CST). Drs. Aimee Spector and Martin Orrell of the University College London created CST in the mid-2000s. Combining the most effective aspects of various non-pharmacologic inter - ventions ( e.g., reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, reality orientation, cognitive stimulation), CST was cre - ated to provide cognitive and social stimulation within a group setting (5-8 individu-als) for persons with mild to moderate dementia. Over the last decade, CST has gained popularity across the United Kingdom and abroad. Along with its increased utilization, there is an ever-increasing body of evidence regarding CST's effect on cognition and quality of life. In studies from teams in the UK as well as Saint Louis University GEC's own CST research and training team, group CST has shown to improve cognition, decrease depression, and improve overall qual - ity of life. Therefore, building on the success of the group intervention, the UCL research team developed iCST and the subsequent manual, Making a Difference 3: Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy in 2014. iCST incorporates the principles and the structure of CST, however delivers it within a one-on-one model rooted in a person-centered perspective. Person-Centered Care While dementia care has been conceptualized from a medical point of view and pharmaceutical interven - tions continue to be a mainstay of treatment, more and more families have expressed interest in non-phar - macologic options to replace or com - plement pharmaceutical interventions. This interest in non-pharmaceutical interventions for dementia goes hand-in-hand with a paradigm-shifting theory known as person-centered care. Person-centered care refers to intervention that puts the \"person\" as the main focus of their care plan rather than the disease or service. Dementia care historically relied on the view of dementia as strictly a biomedical phe - nomenon. The traditional approach to dementia management involved assessment, diagnosis, and treatment guided by medical interventions and did not consider the personhood of the patient or the impact of the en - vironment and the importance of interpersonal relationships. In the 1993 seminal article, Towards a Theory of Per - sonhood in Dementia Care , social psychologist Tom Kit - wood revolutionized demen - tia care with his application of a \"patient-centered\" ( e.g., \"individualized\") perspec - tive on dementia care, thus setting the stage for a more holistic approach to demen - tia care in which not only physical health is promoted but also choice, opinions, and purpose. Incorporating the princi - ples of person-centered care, along with the most ef fective elements of non-pharma - cologic interventions, the (continued on page 30) Table 1.

XXVI, Questions? FAX: 314-771-8575UCL team created iCST with the intention of making a difference in the lives of people with dementia and their caregivers. Seeking to not only improve cognitive abilities but also quality of life, iCST was also intended to recognize value and personhood and reduce the long periods of inactivity often common for individuals with dementia. iCST Key features iCST has various key features that distinguish it from group CST as well as other non-pharmacological interventions. Most distinctively, iCST is delivered one-on-one with the same facilitator and partici - pant as a means of cognitive stimu - lation and relationship building. iCST is appropriate for individuals with dementia whose caregivers wish to deepen their relationship, individuals who may benefit from one-on-one attention, and persons who do not wish to participate in a group setting or are no lon - ger appropriate for a group CST intervention. T hough iCST was envisioned with a familial caregiver in mind, the intervention is appro - priate for paid careg ivers as well as professionals to administer. What is important is that the same facilitator and participant can commit to admin - istering the intervention. Seventy-five sessions have been designed for administration three times a week over a 25-week time period. Ideally, iCST should be administered at the same time and place with each ses - sion being approximately 20- 30 minutes and following the same structure throughout the 25 weeks. The format includes a welcoming, an opening discussion orientation to time and place, and reading and discussing a news article, followed by the main iCST activity. Each iCST activity is based on a theme that is explicitly de - scribed in the manual. Session themes vary from physical games, art discus - sion, to using money. Within each ac - tivity are two levels of activities (level A and level B). Level B presents more cognitive challenge. Regardless of the activities theme, each of the sessions provides an opportunity for active engagement and stimulation. In order to provide consistency and predictability for the individual with dementia, each iCST session fol - lows the same format. At the outset, the administrator spends five minutes to introduce the session and orient the person to the task at hand. This warm-up can include a light snack, singing a favorite song, or engaging in an active game (such as a ball toss). During this time, the administrator can gauge the participant's alertnes s and receptivity. After a warm-up, the administrator then implicitly orients the participant to the day, weather, and season. This routine beginning of each session sets the stage for an engaging activity and time well spent. After the introduction and orien - tation, the facilitator and participants spend time reading and discussing a current news article which is used as a means to stimulate conversa - tion, encourage opinion sharing and promote language use. By pro - viding a new piece of information (such as a news article), participants are more inclined to show interest as well as give both facilitator and participant a novel topic to discuss. While \"human interest\" stories are always a crowd pleaser, Spector and colleague recommend not shying away from more controversial news stories. When the introduction, orienta - tion, and the news article discussion have been completed, the facilitator introduces the main activity outlined within the Making a Difference 3 iCST manual. The main activity is structured to engage the participant in ways that pique interest. iCST rec - ognizes that each individual possesses unique ideas, interests, experiences, and abilities that do not disappear with a dementia diagnosis. Though the manual outlines each activity with a set theme and accompanying task, the creators encourage the facilitator to adapt the activity to fit the needs and interests of the participant. iCST Key Principles iCST is grounded in many of the same key principles as CST. These key principles are crucial for under - standing and administrating the inter - vention. Each principle stems from a variety of different disciplines, theo - retical frameworks, and clinical expe - riences. The creators of iCST find it is essential to understand and follow the thirteen key principles every session in order to successfully implement the intervention. Presented in Table 1, these key principles include ideas such as mental stimulation, encour - aging new ideas, thoughts, and as - sociations, using a 'person-centered' approach, and enjoyment and fun. iCST (continued from page 30) Ruth and Rich Fleschner30 Aging Successfully , V No. 1 31iCST Benefits Evidence suggests iCST can improve the relationship between caregiver and care- recipient. Based on research from the University Col - lege London, cognitive function and quality of life outcomes have not been shown to significantly improve with iCST. Of note is the fact that these studies utilized familial caregivers who completed less than half of the required sessions. These findings sug - gest that iCST may be more beneficial when administered by a paid caregiver or a trained professional. Unlike some other non-pharmacologic interven - tions, iCST does not require a specific educational background or licensure. If an individual has an understanding of dementia and the disease process and a desire to learn about the inter -vention and the person with dementia, she or he has the tools to be successful. iCST and CST are evidence- based forms of cognitive stimulation. Person-centered, this non-pharmaco - logic intervention can provide poten - tial cognitive and emotional benefit while offering a medium to socialized and improve language skills. The facilitator also experiences the ben - efit of deepening a relationship with the person with dementia as well as recognizing and seeing the person beyond their dementia. Through the use of the iCST manual as well as the GEC Train-the-Trainer iCST video (available at http://aging.slu.edu/index.php?page=cognitive-stimulation-ther - apy-cst-project), caregivers and pro - fessionals can learn more about this individualized cognitively stimulation intervention.
