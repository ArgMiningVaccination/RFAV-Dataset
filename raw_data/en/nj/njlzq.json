But how often do you actually do every step you're supposed to? Well, [dental expert](https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/expert-advice) Dr Sameer Patel has claimed that failing to follow the correct brushing procedures could be fatal in some cases, as poor oral hygiene can lead to not just bad breath and tooth decay - but could also have an impact on your [cardiac health. ](https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/healthy-living) The founder of Elleven Dental told [Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11859177/Dental-experts-reveal-common-mistakes-avoid-teeth-clean-healthy.html): \"Increasingly, studies show the importance of flossing for neurological and cardiac health as well.
