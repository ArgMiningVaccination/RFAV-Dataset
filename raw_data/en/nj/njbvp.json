Essential oils (EOs) emerge as very common natural ingredients in cosmetics and toiletries as a result of both their odorous character for the design and manufacturing of fragrances and perfumes, and the many beneficial properties of their individual components (EOCs), e.g., anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, and, nowadays, the cosmetic industry includes EOs or different mixtures of their individual components (EOCs), either as active ingredients or as preservatives, in various product ranges (e.g., moisturizers, lotions and cleanser in skin care cosmetics; conditioners, masks or antidandruff products in hair care products; lipsticks, or fragrances in perfumery). However, the unique chemical profile of each individual essential oil is associated with different benefits, and hence it is difficult to generalize their potential applications in cosmetics and toiletries, which often require the effort of formulators in seeking suitable mixtures of EOs or EOCs for obtaining specific benefits in the final products. This work presents an updated review of the available literature related to the most recent advances in the application of EOs and EOCs in the manufacturing of cosmetic products. Furthermore, some specific aspects related to the safety of EOs and EOCs in cosmetics will be discussed. It is expected that the information contained in this comprehensive review can be exploited by formulators in the design and optimization of cosmetic formulations containing botanical extracts.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-12-03", "cleaned_text": "Essential Oils and Their Individual Components in Cosmetic Products [https://doi.org/10.3390/cosmetics8040114](https://doi.org/10.3390/cosmetics8040114) [Feature Papers This has driven the research and development strategy of the cosmetic industry towards seeking green ingredients for manufacturing new products and reformulating others. This is mandatory to provide a suitable response to the demands of modern consumption patterns in relation to eco-sustainability without comprising the effectiveness of the final product nor the consumer satisfaction, which becomes a very complex challenge, overcoming the limits of cosmetic science, and needing a multidisciplinary approach [ [2](#B2-cosmetics-08-00114), [3](#B3-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Furthermore, the transition to a more \"natural cosmetic\" has also become a demand arriving from the current international regulations, which have banned the use of many traditional chemicals for the fabrication of products for human use, recommending their progressive substitution for other compounds, preferably from renewable natural sources, including both plants and microorganisms (biotechnological sources) [ [4](#B4-cosmetics-08-00114), [5](#B5-cosmetics-08-00114), [6](#B6-cosmetics-08-00114), [7](#B7-cosmetics-08-00114), [8](#B8-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Plants and microorganisms provide a broad range of cosmetically acceptable active ingredients, which can find different applications in the production of cosmetics and toiletries, e.g., protection against UV irradiation and pollution, fabrication of creams, production of fragrances, or mitigation of skin aging effects [ [1](#B1-cosmetics-08-00114), [9](#B9-cosmetics-08-00114), [10](#B10-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [11](#B11-cosmetics-08-00114)]. However, it is only in recent years that \"natural cosmetics\" occupied such a big quota of the market of cosmetics and toiletries (around 40 billion USD by 2021 which corresponds to about 10% of the global market of cosmetics and toiletries) [ [12](#B12-cosmetics-08-00114), [13](#B13-cosmetics-08-00114)], and every day consumers are more attracted to the quality and effectiveness of products containing natural ingredients, including different botanical extracts and their individual components, as fragrances, preservatives or antioxidants [ [14](#B14-cosmetics-08-00114), [15](#B15-cosmetics-08-00114), [16](#B16-cosmetics-08-00114)]; compounds extracted from minerals, antioxidants or tyrosinase inhibitors [ [17](#B17-cosmetics-08-00114), [18](#B18-cosmetics-08-00114)], and compounds isolated from fungi and bacteria, such as polysaccharides or biosurfactants (e.g., rhamnolipids or sophorolipids) which presents a growing interest within the hair care and conditioning industry [ [6](#B6-cosmetics-08-00114), [7](#B7-cosmetics-08-00114), [19](#B19-cosmetics-08-00114), [20](#B20-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [21](#B21-cosmetics-08-00114), [22](#B22-cosmetics-08-00114), [23](#B23-cosmetics-08-00114), [24](#B24-cosmetics-08-00114)]. EOs have been widely incorporated in a broad range of cosmetic products, perfumes, and household products so that some of their properties, e.g., analgesic, antiseptic, and antimicrobial properties, but mainly their pleasant aroma, can be taken advantage of [ [25](#B25-cosmetics-08-00114)]. This review tries to provide an updated perspective on the current uses of EOs, and their individual components, in the cosmetic industry. Furthermore, some fundamental aspects related to the potential precautions required in the use of EOs and EOCs in the formulation of cosmetics and toiletries will be also discussed. 2. General Aspects of EOs [16](#B16-cosmetics-08-00114), [26](#B26-cosmetics-08-00114), [27](#B27-cosmetics-08-00114), [28](#B28-cosmetics-08-00114), [29](#B29-cosmetics-08-00114)]. They form a broad family of substances characterized by a unique chemical profile defined by their individual components, the so-called essential oil components (EOCs) [ [29](#B29-cosmetics-08-00114), [30](#B30-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Therefore, a single essential oil should be considered as a complex mixture of bioactive compounds, with their final compositional profile, and hence their bioactivity, dependent on different factors: (i) method of extraction, drying and storage; (ii) time of harvest and climate conditions, and (iii) plant species and which part of the plant was used for their isolation [ [11](#B11-cosmetics-08-00114)]. This compositional richness presents a key characteristic in the broad range of essential oil applications, for contributing to improved health, hygiene, beauty and wellness [ [31](#B31-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [1](#B1-cosmetics-08-00114), [32](#B32-cosmetics-08-00114)]), which play a very important role in defense, signaling or as part of their secondary metabolism [ [26](#B26-cosmetics-08-00114), [33](#B33-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [Table 1](#cosmetics-08-00114-t001)includes some examples of EOs, with their origin, properties, and active components. [47](#B47-cosmetics-08-00114), [48](#B48-cosmetics-08-00114), [49](#B49-cosmetics-08-00114)]. In particular, the bactericidal and fungicidal role of some of their individual components allow their inclusion in the formulation of a broad range of cosmetic products, e.g., creams, gels, and ointments, without needing the addition of chemical preservatives [ [50](#B50-cosmetics-08-00114)]. It is worth mentioning that EOs present several drawbacks, including their high volatility, poor solubility in water, and their thermal and chemical labilities (most of these molecules are fragile to oxidation upon exposure to the environment), which makes their handling difficult for a rational design of cosmetic products [ [24](#B24-cosmetics-08-00114), [26](#B26-cosmetics-08-00114), [51](#B51-cosmetics-08-00114)], and requires careful control of their packaging, conditioning, and storage conditions. Furthermore, the role of EOs, and their individual components, in the formulations is not always positive, representing a potential source of allergenic reactions, and, hence, a careful quantification of their maximum concentrations in a specific formulation is necessary to ensure the production of safe cosmetic products [ [30](#B30-cosmetics-08-00114)]. 2.1. Chemical Composition of EOs [24](#B24-cosmetics-08-00114)]. However, the compositional richness of EOs is not reflected in their biological properties, which are commonly determined by two or three components appearing at the highest concentrations (20-70% w/w) [ [34](#B34-cosmetics-08-00114)]. On the other side, the chemical composition, and hence the quality of a specific essential oil, depends on different factor, including genetic aspects, time of harvest, crop location, part of the plant used or production method [ [51](#B51-cosmetics-08-00114), [52](#B52-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [11](#B11-cosmetics-08-00114), [51](#B51-cosmetics-08-00114), [53](#B53-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [Figure 1](#cosmetics-08-00114-f001)shows some representative molecular structures of different essential oil components (EOCs) that can appear in EOs. [54](#B54-cosmetics-08-00114)]. These pathways are commonly differentiated depending on the specific chemical nature of the component, i.e., the biosynthesis of the different types of essential components follows very specific routes [ [11](#B11-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Thus, aromatic phenylpropanoids are obtained from the shikimic acid pathway, which results in the formation of phenylalanine, terpenoids derived from the isopentenyl [55](#B55-cosmetics-08-00114)]. On the terpenoids are composed by different isoprene units (C5H8) which are commonly assembled in a head-to-tail fashion following a direct assembly process, or by cyclization, rearrangements, or other types of conversions from aliphatic isoprenoid precursors [ [51](#B51-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The biosynthesis of terpenes occurs by repetitive addition of IPP units to create prenyldiphosphate precursors which are modified by terpene specific synthethases to obtain the terpene skeleton. These undergo secondary enzymatic modification, generally trough a redox process, to obtain the final terpene molecules with specific chemical structures and properties [ [11](#B11-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [51](#B51-cosmetics-08-00114)]. It should be noted that the weight ratio between volatile and non-volatile compounds is strongly dependent on the specific essential oil, and range from the 99:1 of grape fruit oil to the 60:40 of bergamot oil [ [56](#B56-cosmetics-08-00114)]. 2.2. Isolation of EOs [57](#B57-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [28](#B28-cosmetics-08-00114), [57](#B57-cosmetics-08-00114), [58](#B58-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [56](#B56-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Organic extraction in ethanol during 30 h was used for isolating Australian tea essential oil [ [59](#B59-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Other solvents used for the essential oil extraction are dicloromethane, hexane, methanol or mixtures of pentane and dicloromethane [ [60](#B60-cosmetics-08-00114), [61](#B61-cosmetics-08-00114), [62](#B62-cosmetics-08-00114), [63](#B63-cosmetics-08-00114)]. It should be noted that the extraction using organic solvents present several drawbacks: (i) it is time consuming; (ii) the low selectivity of organic solvents, which leads to extraction to the so-called concretes, i.e., complex mixtures of essential oil, waxes, resins, and other lipophilic plant materials, and (ii) the remaining residues of organic solvents. The former drawback can be overcome by applying ultrasounds or microwaves that allow reducing the time required for the extraction procedure down to 20-30 min [ [64](#B64-cosmetics-08-00114), [65](#B65-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [66](#B66-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The application of supercritical fluids for extraction relies in the combination of gas-like mass transfer properties and liquid-like solvating capacity, even though their diffusion coefficients are higher than those of liquids. The low toxicity and chemical inertness of supercritical CO2 make it the most common supercritical fluid used for extraction of natural products. Some examples of the application of supercritical fluids to the isolation of essential oils can be found in the extraction of oil from Moringa oleifera seeds [ [67](#B67-cosmetics-08-00114)], rosemary [ [68](#B68-cosmetics-08-00114)], peppermint [ [69](#B69-cosmetics-08-00114)], or cardamom [ [70](#B70-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Furthermore, the extraction using supercritical fluids can also be exploited for enhancing the essential oil quality, through fractionation and determination processes [ [56](#B56-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [71](#B71-cosmetics-08-00114), [72](#B72-cosmetics-08-00114)]. For this purpose, the plants or their specific part are incorporated over water into a distillation apparatus. Thus, as the water is heated, the steam passes through the plant material, enabling the vaporization of the volatile compounds. The obtained vapor circulates along a cooling coil, where it is condensed back to the liquid form and collected into a vessel. However, the use of distillation procedures for isolating essential oils presents three important drawbacks: (i) the possible losses of thermolabile components; (ii) the difficulties associated with its automatization, and (iii) the long time required for the isolation process. It should be noted that the use of distillation under vacuum can contribute to reduce the problems associated with the degradation induced by temperature of labile components [ [56](#B56-cosmetics-08-00114)]. 2.3. Quality of EOs [24](#B24-cosmetics-08-00114), [73](#B73-cosmetics-08-00114)]. However, the isolation of essential oils commonly presents a very reduced yield in relation to the mass of raw materials, which makes difficult to cover the large scale consumption of international markets [ [23](#B23-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Therefore, the adulteration and contamination of EOs are problems with growing importance in recent years, and, hence, the essential oil authentication is crucial for both industries and final consumers [ [74](#B74-cosmetics-08-00114), [75](#B75-cosmetics-08-00114)]. This requires the introduction of a standard definition of what an essential oil is. The \"Association Fran\u00e7aise de Normalisation\" (AFNOR) and the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) define essential oils as manufactured products from pure, identified raw materials of plant origin, obtained using hydrodistillation, steam distillation, mechanical processes, or dry distillation for some woods [ [75](#B75-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [76](#B76-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [23](#B23-cosmetics-08-00114), [75](#B75-cosmetics-08-00114)]. On the other side, adulteration of essential oils by total or partial substitution of the plant for other species is also a very common practice [ [73](#B73-cosmetics-08-00114), [77](#B77-cosmetics-08-00114)]. It should be stressed that the adulteration results in a reduction of the essential oil quality, and in many cases, can lead to safety issues. Therefore, the authentication is essential for ensuring consumer protection and the quality of the production processes of essential oils, affecting to standardization and regulatory aspects [ [78](#B78-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [79](#B79-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The evaluation of the adulteration is commonly performed following two different approaches: (i) detection of product fingerprints, and (ii) determination of specific marker in the products [ [75](#B75-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Thus, it is possible to evaluate the conformity of the product in relation to the specifications of the regulatory entities, ensuring identity, quality, safety and efficiency of the obtained essential oil [ [80](#B80-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [81](#B81-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The second level relies in the determination of different physico-chemical constants, including specific gravity, refractive index, and optical rotation. Furthermore, the solubility of the essential oil in specific solvents (e.g., ethanol) can also be considered an important parameter for determining any potential adulteration. On the other hand, the analysis of certain chemical aspects, including the acidity and the ester, alcohol, aldehyde or ketone concentrations may also provide very valuable information for determining the purity of a specific essential oil [ [82](#B82-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [83](#B83-cosmetics-08-00114), [84](#B84-cosmetics-08-00114), [85](#B85-cosmetics-08-00114), [86](#B86-cosmetics-08-00114), [87](#B87-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [Figure 2](#cosmetics-08-00114-f002)summarized the different steps for characterization of the purity of essential oils together with the advantages and disadvantages associated with the different analytical methodologies. 3. EOs and EOCs in Fragrances [88](#B88-cosmetics-08-00114)]. EOs and EOCs are frequently added for providing aroma to cosmetic products, which commonly is considered as a benefit because consumers prefer products having a pleasant aroma rather than non-aromatized products [ [89](#B89-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [90](#B90-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The industry of fragrances tends to classify the aromas as functions of their odorous characteristics, volatility, and diffusion rate in the air, which leads to three different levels defined as top, middle or base notes [ [23](#B23-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Thus, highly volatile EOs provide aromas classified as top notes, and are responsible for the first perceptible odors and freshness of the blend forming the fragrance. They are commonly light scents which fade first, including bergamot, juniper, cinnamon or gardenia [ [91](#B91-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [23](#B23-cosmetics-08-00114), [92](#B92-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [93](#B93-cosmetics-08-00114)]. This is important because the inclusion of fragrances in cosmetic products, and not only in perfumes, is often times required to mask the unpleasant scent associated with some of the compounds (fatty acids and oils or surfactants) used in the production of cosmetic products [ [92](#B92-cosmetics-08-00114)], e.g., EOs are included in antidandruff shampoos for masking the unpleasant odor of this type of products, offering a subtle, fresh and natural aroma [ [94](#B94-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Therefore, it may be assumed that EOs and EOCs are used to improve the sensorial perception, evoking particular moods or sensations, e.g., cleanliness. Furthermore, fragrances may be also exploited with a psychological effect. 4. Applications of EOs and EOCs in Cosmetic Products for Hair and Skin Care [95](#B95-cosmetics-08-00114)], such as limonene, which make them very promising active ingredients for skin and hair care [ [16](#B16-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [Table 2](#cosmetics-08-00114-t002)summarizes some of the potential applications of EOs in the design of cosmetic formulations. [24](#B24-cosmetics-08-00114), [118](#B118-cosmetics-08-00114), [119](#B119-cosmetics-08-00114), [120](#B120-cosmetics-08-00114), anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties to the formulations which may induce benefits on the hair scalp, and promote an increase of the hair shaft density or cleaning effect on the hair bulb and strengthening of the whole capillary fiber (bulb/stem system) [ [94](#B94-cosmetics-08-00114), [122](#B122-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Furthermore, EOs and EOCs are natural preservative agents which can be included into commercial products alone or in combination with other preservatives, providing protection against bacteria and fungi [ [123](#B123-cosmetics-08-00114), [124](#B124-cosmetics-08-00114), [125](#B125-cosmetics-08-00114)]. 4.1. Potential Applications EOs and EOCs in Hare Care [116](#B116-cosmetics-08-00114), [126](#B126-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The most accepted mechanism accounting for the activity of EOs and EOCs in hair reparation considers that cosmetic formulations containing EOs and EOCs present a topical action upon their application on the scalp. This is possible because some EOCs can penetrate into the scalp, supplementing the nutritional pathways, which stimulates the growth of the hair follicles, moistures the hair root and strengthens the capillary fibers. On the other side, the mechanism associated with the activity of EOs and EOCs on the hair shaft is far from clear [ [116](#B116-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [127](#B127-cosmetics-08-00114), [128](#B128-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The latter can be obtained by adding EOs from rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) or chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) in shampoo or conditioner formulations. This role of EOs in hair conditioning can be understood considering that individual components of essential oils can penetrate in the scalp quickly, which nourishes the hair follicles, contributes to the hair nutrition, moisturizes the hair roots, strengthens the hair, and helps in the removal of undesired molecules blocking the pores [ [116](#B116-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The existence of different commercial cosmetic formulations exploiting the properties of Nigella sativa as a cream, oil or shampoo for conditioning purposes should be noted [ [129](#B129-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [15](#B15-cosmetics-08-00114), [121](#B121-cosmetics-08-00114), [130](#B130-cosmetics-08-00114), [131](#B131-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Thus, the topical application of formulations containing peppermint oil extracted from Mentha piperita at a relatively low dose (3% w/w) allows the stimulation of hair growth [ [112](#B112-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Similar effects were found upon the application of formulations containing rosemary oil in a concentration allowing a final content of 3.7 mg of 1,8-cineole per mg of final product. This type of formulation is effective against alopecia, similar to formulations containing minoxidil at 2% w/w [ [132](#B132-cosmetics-08-00114)]. These results can be explained considering that the antioxidant characteristic of phenolic compounds may reduce the oxidative stress inducing alopecia. Furthermore, essential oils contribute to the blood circulation in the hair follicles, protecting the vascularization of hair dermal papilla [ [112](#B112-cosmetics-08-00114), [116](#B116-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Another important contribution of some essential oil components to the hair growth is associated with their role in the control of the expression of specific genes associated with the regulation of this process [ [133](#B133-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [116](#B116-cosmetics-08-00114)] proved a mixture conventional chemicals for preparing an antidandruff shampoo, and found that the inclusion of EOs in shampoo formulations enhanced the efficacy of the product without any additional side effect. This was ascribed to the combination of the antifungal properties of the EOs, which contribute to the removal of the dandruff origin, with the anti-inflammatory properties of some EOCs, e.g., menthol and -bisabolol in the essential oils of Mentha piperita and Matricaria chamomilla, respectively. Similar results related to the ability of EOs for dandruff removal have been reported for other essential oils, e.g., thyme oils (Thymus vulgaris), lavender (Lavandula [ [116](#B116-cosmetics-08-00114), [130](#B130-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [134](#B134-cosmetics-08-00114)], demonstrating that the high effectiveness of the prepared formulation may be associated with the synergistic antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and local immune-stimulatory actions of specific EOCs. This allows formulating an effective and safe herbal antidandruff shampoo by mixing several essential oils. Similar conclusions were reported by Halith et al. [ [135](#B135-cosmetics-08-00114)] using a combination of a different set of EOs. Furthermore, they compared the effectiveness of their essential oil-based shampoo with that obtained for a commercial formulation, finding that the experimental formulation may be considered as a cost-effective competitor to those currently commercialized. Another important disease related to the dysfunction of capillary physiology is the seborrhea, which is associated with oiliness of the hair fibers. EOCs can be also used for a partial mitigation of this type of pathology [ [136](#B136-cosmetics-08-00114)]. This is possible because the antimicrobial activity of specific essential oil compounds can reduce the proliferation of the bacteria associated with seborrhea emergence. 4.2. Potential Application of EOs and EOCs in Skin Care [130](#B130-cosmetics-08-00114), [137](#B137-cosmetics-08-00114)]. In particular, the use of EOs due to their lipophilic character can contribute the maintenance of both the skin microbiota, which presents a very critical role on the maintenance of the skin health, and the protective role of the stratum corneum [ [138](#B138-cosmetics-08-00114), [139](#B139-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [Table 3](#cosmetics-08-00114-t003)summarized some potential applications of essential oils in skin care. [140](#B140-cosmetics-08-00114), [141](#B141-cosmetics-08-00114), [142](#B142-cosmetics-08-00114), [143](#B143-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Furthermore, EOs can contribute to the reduction of the inflammation and post-acne scar formation. Lertsatitthanakorn et al. [ [142](#B142-cosmetics-08-00114)] demonstrated that the antibacterial power of citronella grass essential oil against Propionibacterium acnes, combined with its good free radical scavenging activity and its ability of inhibiting the activity of the 5LOX enzyme, contributed to the reduction of the inflammatory processes associated with acne emergence. Mahant et al. [ [144](#B144-cosmetics-08-00114)] showed that the topical application of the essential oil of Cymbopogan martini (palmarosa oil) at a relative low dose also presents a high potential for mitigating the effects of the acne, which was ascribed to the role of its main component (geraniol). This presents a strong antibacterial character, contributing to the inhibition of the tyrosinase activity and the reduction of the cytokine. Xiao et al. [ [145](#B145-cosmetics-08-00114)] demonstrated that borneol may be a potential candidate for developing natural formulations with an anti-inflammatory character for skin care, becoming an effective alternative to conventional products containing antibiotics and synthetic anti-inflammatory agents. Tao et al. [ [143](#B143-cosmetics-08-00114)] deepened on the origin of the activity of artemisin essential oil (Artemisia annua) in the mitigation of acne, and found a certain degree of correlation between the concentration of terpenes and the anti-acne activity of EOs. The terpenes provide several benefits to the skin, and help reduce the proliferation of microorganisms implicated in the emergence of acne and eczema. Furthermore, it was found that artemisin essential oil contributed in blocking the hormonal pathways associated with the emergence of inflammatory processes associated with acne emergence. [146](#B146-cosmetics-08-00114)] designed and tested a cosmeceutical formulation for a topical gel against acne emergence containing Nigella sativa essential oil. The composition per 100 g of formulations was the following: carbopol 940 of formulations presents strong antibacterial activity against acne-causing bacteria, with this activity being stronger as the concentration of the essential oil is increased. Furthermore, the obtained formulation presents higher efficacy than formulations containing synthetic anti-acne products. [147](#B147-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Furthermore, geranium essential oil allows regulating the hydration balance on the skin and the renewal of skin cells, which are very important aspects for mitigating the effects of acne [ [148](#B148-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Furthermore, geranium essential oils contribute to the minimization of different spots on the skin, e.g., dark spots, red marks, age spots or marks from skin irritation [ [141](#B141-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [149](#B149-cosmetics-08-00114)]. They found that different EOs (patchouli, nutmeg, citronella, and clove oils) upon topical application allow a significant mitigation of the skin aging induced by the exposure to UVB radiation, reducing the wrinkle formation. It should be noted that the specific composition of the essential oils modify their performance in skin care. In particular, for the set of tested EOs, the anti-aging properties follows the sequence: clove > patchouli > nutmeg > citronella oil. [150](#B150-cosmetics-08-00114)]. This is because sesquiterpenes present a significant inhibitory activity of different enzymes related to the skin aging, e.g., collagenase, elastase, hyaluronidase, and tyrosinase. Furthermore, it was reported that mixtures containing both essential oils present a stronger anti-aging effect than each individual one. On the other hand, the anti-aging activity of the formulations is also correlated to the ability for free radical scavenging as was demonstrated by Tu and Tawata [ [151](#B151-cosmetics-08-00114)] using EOs from two different varieties of Alpinia zerumbet. They found that the variety providing the essential oil with the highest concentration of antioxidant molecules, such as monoterpenes, leads to a stronger antioxidant effect against UV-induced damage of the skin. This is possible because monoterpenes produce a significant inhibition of the activity of the enzymes associated with the skin aging (collagenase, elastase, hyaluronidase, and tyrosinase), and of the melanogenesis. The latter suggests that EOs may be also used in skin-whitening materials. Lemon essential oil is considered as one of the most effective substances for slowing down the aging process because it presents a high vitamin C content, making it an essential component in many cosmetic formulation for skin care that the application of EOs of lavender and sage at a reduced dose (in the range 5-10% w/w) increases the thickness of the skin hydration layer, with the penetration of the EOs through the skin remaining very limited. This latter point should be considered a very important aspect associated with the toxicological profile of formulations containing EOs or their individual components. The potential application of other EOs as moisturizing agents has been also reported, including Hypericum perforatum, rosehip seed oil from Rosa canina, sandalwood essential oil, or chamomile essential oil [ [117](#B117-cosmetics-08-00114), [158](#B158-cosmetics-08-00114), [161](#B161-cosmetics-08-00114), [162](#B162-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The moisturizing role in the latter essential oil is ascribed to its high content in azulene [ [141](#B141-cosmetics-08-00114), [162](#B162-cosmetics-08-00114)]. However, rose essential oil has been reported as the most powerful substance for maintaining the moisture loss from skin, becoming an essential component of formulations for keeping skin hydration, lightening dark spots, eliminating pimples, and reducing fine lines and wrinkles [ [159](#B159-cosmetics-08-00114), [160](#B160-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The latter effect has been also ascribed to patchouli and ylang-ylang essential oil, with the later contributing also to tissue regeneration [ [155](#B155-cosmetics-08-00114), [156](#B156-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [154](#B154-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Its strong antioxidant character is due to its ability to stimulate the regeneration of skin cells, thus maintaining smooth skin, being one of the best choices for anti-aging purposes. This is commonly associated with the high content of flavonoids and carotenoids that contribute to the prevention of the inflammation, repairing the damaged skin by stimulating the production of vitamins A and E. Furthermore, carrot seed oil provides protection against the damages to the skin induced by sun and other free radicals, and helps in the reduction of scars and wrinkles in mature skin [ [57](#B57-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Neroli essential oil can be also exploited for reducing wrinkles due to their recognized impact on the skin's elasticity [ [156](#B156-cosmetics-08-00114), [157](#B157-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [141](#B141-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Similarly, the presence of citral in neroli essential oil can contribute to maintaining the oil balance of the skin without drying the skin [ [157](#B157-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The control of the oily secretions can also be performed using ylang-ylang essential oil [ [156](#B156-cosmetics-08-00114)], but in particular by using rosemary essential oil which contains a high ester content facilitating the control of excess sebum [ [108](#B108-cosmetics-08-00114)]. 4.3. Other Possible Applications of EOs and EOCs in Cosmetics and Toiletries [84](#B84-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [163](#B163-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Mishra et al. [ [120](#B120-cosmetics-08-00114)] studied in vitro protection upon UV radiation exposure of formulations containing Calendula oficinalis essential oil, and found that the prepared formulations present good properties for protecting skin against sunlight exposure, with the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) evaluated by spectroscopic measurements, according to the protocol developed by Mansur et al. [ [164](#B164-cosmetics-08-00114)], being within the limits expected for sunscreen products. Furthermore, the combination of the sunscreen properties of the essential oil with its antioxidant character leads to a synergistic effect which enhances the photoprotective character of the formulations [ [163](#B163-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Similarly, Kaur and Saraf [ [165](#B165-cosmetics-08-00114)] evaluated the ability of different volatile and non-volatile oils for adsorbing UV radiation to estimate their SPF, and found that non-volatile oils presents generally higher values of SPF. However, the use of peppermint oil allows preparing sunscreen formulations with a similar SPF value to those corresponding to the non-volatile oil with the best performance. This may be considered an important aspect in the choice of oils and fragrances in the design of sunscreen products. Furthermore, the correct choice of the oil becomes a critical aspects because the characteristics of the oils control the production of a uniform sunscreen film on the skin with a long duration, and contribute to the protection of the skin against drying by wind and sun actions. [166](#B166-cosmetics-08-00114)] evaluated a sunscreen cream containing essential oil from Ocimum basilicum in a relatively low concentration (0.6% w/w) and found that it's in vitro behavior was only slightly worse than that obtained for common products used for protection against sunlight. This suggests that the use of the above essential oil may be a good alternative for the preparation of sunscreen products. Patchouli essential oil was also found as a very effective alternative for protecting against the harmful UV radiation, which is mainly ascribed to the role of their antioxidant compounds (patchouli [169](#B169-cosmetics-08-00114)] introduced essential oil obtained from Hylocereus polyrhizus, demonstrating their power for enhancing the antimicrobial activity of the lipstick formulation. Furthermore, EO and EOCs are also used in lipstick formulations to provide a specific flavor to the product [ [170](#B170-cosmetics-08-00114)], or as dispersant medium for different colorants [ [171](#B171-cosmetics-08-00114)]. 5. EOs and EOCs as Preservatives in Cosmetic Products [117](#B117-cosmetics-08-00114)]. This makes necessary to manufacture formulations without any added preservative. This requirement may be partially accomplished by adding EOs which can be used simultaneously as active ingredients and preservatives, allowing the preparation of self-preserving or preservative-free formulations [ [153](#B153-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Therefore, EOs and their individual components can be considered as cost-effective preserving substances which may contribute to obtained products with enhanced dermocosmetic properties. [139](#B139-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [172](#B172-cosmetics-08-00114)] explored the use of EOs from different sources, namely Monarda citriodora, Monarda didyma, and Monarda media, as preservatives for cosmetic formulations, and found that their effectiveness against bacteria and fungi was correlated to the relative content of specific EOCs. In particular, the increase of the content of p-cymene in the essential oil allows the inhibition of the emergence of microorganisms as evidenced their limited proliferation in formulations containing Monarda media. However, the EOs of Monarda citriodora and Monarda didyma can be only included in the formulation for reducing the amount of synthetic preservative compounds since they are not effective for inhibiting microorganism proliferation. The above results suggest that the preservative role is related to the presence of specific essential oil components. [137](#B137-cosmetics-08-00114)]. They explored the antimicrobial role of up to four EOs from different sources, Artemisia afra, Pteronia incana, Lavandula officinalis, and Rosmarinus officinalis oils, against different microorganisms (fungi and bacteria), and found that the four oils may be exploited as preservatives of creams. However, slight variations on the antimicrobial properties were reported due to the different susceptibility of the tested organisms to some specific components of the EOs, which leads to a better performance of the Artemisia afra as a preservative. Furthermore, Muyima et al. [ [137](#B137-cosmetics-08-00114)] also found that fungi are more susceptible than bacteria to the preservation with EOs in agreement with the results previously reported by Mangena and Muyima [ [173](#B173-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [174](#B174-cosmetics-08-00114)]: (i) their high organism specificity requires a careful analysis of the most suitable composition for preserving against specific microorganisms; (ii) EOs and EOCs can induce the emergence of allergies; (iii) their strong odors may be inappropriate for some specific cosmetic applications, and (iv) the reduction of the antimicrobial action as result of their volatility and lipophilicity. 6. Encapsulation of EOs nanocarriers may help on preparing formulations containing the active compounds (EOs and EOCs) within a well-controlled container, which can contribute to the enhancement of their stability and availability. Furthermore, this makes possible a controlled release of the active molecules, reducing the losses during processing and storage [ [187](#B187-cosmetics-08-00114), [188](#B188-cosmetics-08-00114), [189](#B189-cosmetics-08-00114), [190](#B190-cosmetics-08-00114), [191](#B191-cosmetics-08-00114), [192](#B192-cosmetics-08-00114), [193](#B193-cosmetics-08-00114)]. On the other hand, the use of strategies for protecting the EOs and EOCs may enhance their molecular stability, retarding their crystallization, and minimizing their chemical reactivity (volatility, [195](#B195-cosmetics-08-00114), [196](#B196-cosmetics-08-00114), [197](#B197-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Therefore, the introduction of a barrier between the essential oils, or their individual components, and the environment through encapsulation processes may be a very interesting alternative for exploiting this type of materials in cosmetic industry [ [12](#B12-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [13](#B13-cosmetics-08-00114)]. The choice of the most suitable carrier material is critical because it defines most of the physico-chemical characteristic of the capsule, their stability and release characteristics [ [198](#B198-cosmetics-08-00114)]. On the other side, the encapsulation process is selected in such a way that can be reproducible, fast, effective, and scalable to an industrial process. Furthermore, the nature of the encapsulated compounds as well as their final application plays a very important role on the design of the encapsulation process [ [199](#B199-cosmetics-08-00114), [200](#B200-cosmetics-08-00114), [201](#B201-cosmetics-08-00114), [202](#B202-cosmetics-08-00114), [203](#B203-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [15](#B15-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Thus, even though there are a broad range of available techniques for encapsulation purposes, they can be commonly classified in three groups depending of their main characteristics: (i) chemical; (ii) physico-chemical, and (iii) physico-mechanical. [Table 4](#cosmetics-08-00114-t004)includes some examples of methodologies classified in terms of their respective categories. It should be noted that the aim of this work is far from providing a description of the different methodologies used for the encapsulation of actives, and the reading of references [ [15](#B15-cosmetics-08-00114), [204](#B204-cosmetics-08-00114), [205](#B205-cosmetics-08-00114), [206](#B206-cosmetics-08-00114), [207](#B207-cosmetics-08-00114)] is strongly recommended for deepen on technical aspects of such processes. [208](#B208-cosmetics-08-00114)] demonstrated the possibility for using encapsulation of lemon essential oil in microcapsules of urea-formaldehyde for preserving the duration of its fragrance upon their incorporation into cosmetic products. A similar aim was pursued by Weinbreck et al. [ [209](#B209-cosmetics-08-00114)] using a complex coacervation method for encapsulating essential oils of lemon and orange. The coacervation approach was also chosen by Martins et al. [ [210](#B210-cosmetics-08-00114)] for encapsulating thyme oil. Gumi et al. [ [211](#B211-cosmetics-08-00114)] chose the phase inversion for precipitation to enhance the preservation of vanillin. The use of a very simple emulsification methodology was used by Lucia et al. [ [21](#B21-cosmetics-08-00114)] for preparing pediculicidal lotions with different EOCs. The emulsification was also chosen by Shahtalebi et al. [ [212](#B212-cosmetics-08-00114)] for preparing a shampoo containing encapsulated eugenol, an essential oil component of the clove oil, for hair conditioning. This formulation showed good conditioning and grooming properties, contributing to the hair reparation. On the other hand, Anchisi et al. [ [213](#B213-cosmetics-08-00114)], seeking more sustainable formulations, designed chitosan capsules containing Mentha piperita essential oil. This type of formulations aws found to protect the properties of the essential oil for more than six months. EOCs in Cosmetics and Toiletries [58](#B58-cosmetics-08-00114), [230](#B230-cosmetics-08-00114), [231](#B231-cosmetics-08-00114), [232](#B232-cosmetics-08-00114)]. This requires consideration of the dose, composition, dilution, frequency of use, and application [ [233](#B233-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [234](#B234-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [11](#B11-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the oxidation of the EOCs are not always signature of an increase of their allergenic risk [ [27](#B27-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [235](#B235-cosmetics-08-00114)]. This type of reactions are commonly associated to the presence of specific EOCs, e.g., cinnamic alcohol, aldehyde, eugenol, and baptapene [ [116](#B116-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Furthermore, the use of high concentrations of EOs in cosmetic products increases the risks, and even it can trigger dermal sensitization phenomena [ [236](#B236-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Despite the potential allergenic character of EOs and EOs compounds, it should be noted that the comparison of the number of allergic reactions upon application of these substances with their widely application makes possible to consider the use of EOs and EOCs in cosmetic products as safe except for a small population of susceptible individuals [ [24](#B24-cosmetics-08-00114)]. However, it is important to take into account the possible adverse reactions when extending the use of EOs in cosmetics and toiletries. [Table 5](#cosmetics-08-00114-t005)summarizes some examples of allergenic reactions associated with the essential oils in cosmetics and toiletries. [239](#B239-cosmetics-08-00114)], which is a main component in relation to the beneficial antimicrobial effects associated with the use of tea tree oil. Other important allergenic essential oil is peppermint oil (Mentha piperita), which can lead to pruritus and inflammation. This is commonly associated with the high content of menthol, menthone, carvone, pulegone, and limonene, which the latter being currently considered an emerging allergen [ [237](#B237-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Furthermore, peppermint oil can induce allergic contact dermatitis upon topical application with an incidence close to 0.5% of the population [ [238](#B238-cosmetics-08-00114), [239](#B239-cosmetics-08-00114)]. [244](#B244-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Furthermore, the incidence of the allergic contact dermatitis associated with lavender oil is relatively high (above 10% of the population) [ [245](#B245-cosmetics-08-00114)]. This is associated with the two main components of the lavender oil (linalyl acetate and linalool) which are weak allergens and sensitizers in pure form [ [246](#B246-cosmetics-08-00114)]. However, the allergenic power of lavender oil is enhanced upon linalyl acetate oxidation [ [242](#B242-cosmetics-08-00114)]. Eucalyptus oil is also associated with the emergence of allergic contact dermatitis as result of its high content in 1,8-cineole [ [240](#B240-cosmetics-08-00114), [241](#B241-cosmetics-08-00114)]. On the other hand, the presence of isoeugenol is the responsible of sensitization in ylang-ylang oil [ [243](#B243-cosmetics-08-00114)]. 8.
