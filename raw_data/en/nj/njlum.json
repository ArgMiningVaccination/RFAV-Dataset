We also explain how to use crystals for healing, how to select your crystals, and how to care for your crystals. Let's dive in! Introduction Long before crystal healing became known as \"alternative medicine,\" healing crystals were used by ancient civilizations and peoples as medicine, regalia and to adorn religious leaders and objects. Whether they were worn by priests, warriors, shamans, chiefs, princesses or healers, it was clear that crystals were special and well-adored by these communities. From the ancient Sumerians to the Egyptians, Romans and Greeks, crystals were used in religious rituals, burial rites, spiritual practices, cultural traditions and to heal people from various ailments. Hundreds of years later, crystals were then used in Hindu and Buddhist rituals and were connected with the concepts of life-energy, or chi/qi, and chakras, energy vortices within the body that connect our physical bodies with our spiritual ones. Another example of crystals being used in the past is in ancient North America where the Hopi Native Americans of Arizona used crystals to diagnose illnesses in patients. Even in the Middle Ages lapidary medicine (the belief that precious stones have medicinal properties) became very popular and well-known. Today, crystal healing has become a popular practice for people around the world, including celebrities like Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian West, Kate Hudson, Shay Mitchell and Adele. In fact, worldwide we spend more than $1 billion dollars on crystals each year, suggesting that crystal healing is more than a trendy fad. Of course, crystals cannot be considered the latest fad when they have been on the earth for millions of years. According to the National Geographic, there are more than 4,000 different minerals and gems found within the earth's surface. Their longevity in a world that is ever changing is very comforting to some crystal users, causing them to believe that crystals are not only ancient relics but databases of knowledge. If we consider that all crystals on earth have witnessed everything that has happened for millions of years, we can begin to understand the mystical power that they hold. Imagine that the crystal you buy has remembered every major severe weather occurrence, religious ceremony or healing session that it has ever taken part in or seen and that they can then transfer that information to us and help us connect better with the Earth. Some believe that this information is transferred to people through specific vibratory frequencies. They believe that because crystals have a very low amount of entropy (a measurement of disorder), they are able to absorb and transform the different energies around them. This is why some people might carry lapis lazuli to calm themselves down before speaking in public or hematite when they know they will be in a stressful, hateful or otherwise negative environment. By being close to these crystals, they can heal what ails us but also transform us into better versions of ourselves--the version that is able to manifest everything we have dreamed of. Crystal healing can come in a variety of forms, from crystal bathing to meditation. Even just holding or being near a crystal can invite healing into our lives. Crystals are also used in Reiki, sound therapy and other energy disciplines. Crystals can help us physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. All we have to do is be open to the power that crystals harness and set out to do the work necessary to achieve our dreams and reach our goals. This post will include: Can Crystals Be Used for Healing? How to Use Crystals for Healing How to Care for Your Crystals How to Select Your Crystal Best Crystals for Healing Can Crystals Be Used for Healing? According to most alternative health practitioners, the short answer to the above question is \"yes\". However, the long answer is necessary in order to understand and get the most out of your crystal healing experience. According to its most basic definition, \"crystal healing\" is the alternative medical practice of using crystals to treat people and their energy systems by placing crystals on or near the body. Crystal healers and users believe that crystals are capable of drawing out negative energy while promoting good, positive energy flow, which can result in curing physical and emotional ailments and protecting against disease. As the crystals radiate positive, calming and uplifting energy, they can help us heal our mind, body and soul. Crystals can also help us access our full potential and our highest selves. Due to the plethora of crystals found on earth, there are crystals to assist with almost any issue, blockage or ailment. There are numerous crystals that have been assigned different properties that treat different things, including the following: Healing depression, anxiety and other mental disorders Bringing forth wealth and prosperity Attracting love Improving self-love and self-expression Encouraging creativity, productivity and motivation Releasing physical pain and stress Dismissing fear or negative thoughts, and more The key to crystal healing is an open mind and heart. You must be open to the powers crystals possess in order for their energy to benefit you physically and emotionally. So, if you are a skeptic, it is likely crystals will not do you any good. However, they are unlikely to harm you, so, at the same time, there is no risk in at least trying them out. Scientifically speaking, crystal healing is characterized as a pseudoscience. This is because there is no peer-reviewed scientific evidence that crystals can do all the things people claim that they can do. Furthermore, science does not support the idea of an \"energy flow\" within the body. As primary care physician and medical director for One Medical, Navya Mysore, MD, explains, illnesses are not caused by negative energy or vibrations so technically crystals cannot cure disease with positive energy or vibrations. So, while the scientific community does not support the idea that crystals can emit positive energy, they do suggest that they are associated with more positive thinking. The positive thinking that comes with using crystals, sometimes called the placebo effect, can indeed make you feel better in the short-term, but there is still no scientific proof that crystals can cure disease or treat health conditions. In 2001, a study was carried out by University of London psychologist Christopher French. In the study two groups were given crystals to meditate with. Both groups were told that they were holding real crystals, however, one group was just given an object that looked like a crystal. The group with the fake crystal was just as likely to respond positively to the crystal as the group with the real crystals. This suggests that the expectation that something will help can result in our brain and body believing that it has helped. Despite the scientific community's dismissal of crystal healing, it is important to note that more than 30% of US adults use health care methods considered as alternative medicine, a designation that crystal healing falls under. If you do, however, suffer from a serious medical issue, it is suggested you seek treatment from a licensed physician, but feel free to use crystal healing as a compliment to traditional treatments. How to Use Crystals for Healing There are several different ways to use crystals for healing. One way you can use crystals for healing is to place crystals on or around the body. The crystals act as channels for healing which draw out any negative energy and replace it with positive and healing energies. Sometimes healers will align crystals or specific types of crystals to correspond with the seven main chakra points. Other times, some practitioners will construct an energy grid around the body to surround the body with healing energy. Another way to use crystals for healing is to incorporate them into your meditation and to set an intention on your crystal. To do this, sit or lie in a comfortable position (however you would sit for meditation) and hold your crystal(s) in your hand. Close your eyes and visualize a white light passing through the crystals. Start opening a line of communication with the crystal itself by asking how it can help you. After this, set intentions for the crystal's use by giving it purpose or a goal. Do this by taking three deep breaths. Envision the Earth, a place you love or a happy memory. This reflection should help you connect with your highest vibration. While in this space of positive energy, ask the crystal to help rid you of unwanted energy, a physical or emotional ailment or even guidance. Then, each day, work with your crystal to manifest your goals and dreams. Crystals enhance the work you are already doing--they cannot do the job alone. Crystals assist and compliment you in your journey and growth, so you must work alongside your crystal to reap its benefits. The crystals used in crystal healing can also be used as reminders. Place these crystals in areas where you spend the most time, such as some place where you will see it very often. Whenever you look at these crystals, consider the amount of time it took for the stones to form, evolve and change, and how such beautiful and shiny stones can be made and found in the earth. Reflect on their power and what they can do to heal us and help us along our own journeys. Let them remind you of the abundance and beauty of nature. Allow them to quiet your mind and to slow your routine. Just as these crystals once did, we must all learn, grow and evolve into the best versions of ourselves.

Just a reminder from an idea shared in the previous section: the key to crystal healing is an open mind and heart. Crystal healing is self-care that requires mindfulness, patience, reflection, acceptance, openness and respect towards your crystals. Negative energy or skepticism has no place in crystal healing. How to Care for Your Crystals Although crystals have survived for millions of years, if using crystals for healing there are special precautions and upkeep necessary to care for them. If you have just inherited or purchased crystals, it is important that you cleanse them. Because any crystal you come across contains energy from its former surroundings, it is necessary to remove any lingering or dense energy. There are several methods to clean your crystals. When you first bring new crystals into your home, for example, you should hold them under cold, running water and then leave them in the sunlight to dry. Sometimes your crystals will require a more thorough cleanse; one way to do this is to bury the crystals in the earth for a week (or at least 24 hours). If you do not have access to dirt in a garden or yard, burying them in a flower pot will suffice. By returning them to the earth and its natural vibrations, they are able to cleanse and recharge. You can also clean your crystals with salt water. Salt water can purify and absorb negative energy. However, be very careful cleaning your stones with water as some crystals disintegrate when wet. Common crystals that should not get wet include: amber, angelite, coral, selenite, turquoise and red coral. A general rule is that if it ends in \"ite,\" it is not water-friendly. Another great way to cleanse your crystals is by leaving them in the moonlight. Set your crystals outside or on a windowsill three days before and three days after the full moon (or for at least 24 hours). Lunar energy can cleanse and recharge stones anytime of the month but during the full moon the moon's light and energy is the brightest and strongest. If a six day cleaning process is a bit too long for your schedule and needs, you can also purify stones by burning sage, Frankincense rise or Copal incense. Simply run your crystals through the smoke. Certain types of crystals can also be used to cleanse other crystals. For example, selenite is known to function as a powerful cleansing stone because it is able to ensure positive energy flow between your other crystals. Finally, tingsha chimes, singing bowls and tuning forks can be used to recharge crystals because the crystals can absorb the sound vibrations as the instruments are played. Crystals that are used regularly, sit on an altar, promote positivity, or are known for removing negative energies must be cleansed at least once a month (preferably during or around the full moon). Crystals that are worn as jewelry or are held daily should be cleansed once a week. If someone else touches your crystal, it should be washed immediately or at least before you use or wear it again. If there are noticeable fingerprints on your crystal or it requires sanitization, you can wipe them down with a soft cloth and isopropyl alcohol. How to Select Your Crystal There are many different crystals to choose from and it can sometimes be a little overwhelming when you are a beginner with crystal healing. It can also be challenging because everyone is different and can resonate differently with the same crystals. It is important to keep in mind that because there are so many different types each crystal has its own characteristics, benefits and abilities to heal the mind, body and soul. Furthermore, the energy a crystal possesses can depend on its size. Generally speaking, the bigger the crystal, the more energy it possesses. However, be mindful when choosing larger crystals because there is such a thing as too much energy and it can easily overwhelm newcomers to crystal healing. Crystals can be broken up into three aesthetic categories. The first, \"cut stones,\" refers to crystals that resemble gem or jewelry stones. They are perfectly polished and cut and take a lot of time and effort to produce. The second category, tumblestones, are polished versions of crystals that are smaller and more economical than cut stones. The last category, raw stones, refers to crystals that have not been smoothed and shined so they are generally the most affordable kind of crystal. Some crystals are more rare than others or more difficult to extract. When it comes to these types of crystals, you will always pay a higher price than more common and abundant crystals. Luckily, there are crystals in every price range so do not let high prices on certain types of crystals deter you. Another factor that may influence what kind of crystal you select is how you plan on using your crystal. For example, if you want to have close proximity to your crystal at all times, the best crystal type for you will be cut stones found in gemstone jewelry. On the other hand, if you plan to only meditate or receive a crystal bath with your crystals, you can use tumbled stones or raw stones that can be held, carried in a pocket or placed on an altar, desk or bedside table. When picking out the best crystal for you, it is important to first identify what you feel your life is missing or what you feel needs to be improved. By identifying your needs, you can find a stone that can offer specialized help. It also helps some practitioners to know the lineage of the crystal that they are about to purchase. Because crystals carry energy from past environments, some crystals have a better physical history than others. For example, some crystals may be sourced ethically and sustainably while others crystals are mined using child labor, or the mining practices used to extract the crystals result in environmental damage. If this matters to you, simply ask the crystal store owner how they source and harvest their stones. After narrowing it down from there, let your intuition take over. A crystal might catch your eye, feel warm in your hands and you may feel a physical pull toward it. This is your inner subconscious guiding you to pick the right crystal for you. If a crystal is right for you, it will speak to you in one way or another. All crystals work in perfect harmony within nature's innate balance, but that does not mean any and all crystals will work for you. If a crystal does not feel right, do not force a connection; it is simply not the crystal needed for your healing. Once you have picked out your new crystal you can begin to establish an intimate connection. Best Crystals for Healing 1.
