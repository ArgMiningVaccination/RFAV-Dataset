A global health non-profit organization, Arogya World (http://www.arogyaworld.org) and its India affiliate, Arogya World India Trust, work hard to prevent non-communicable diseases, NCDs - diseases like diabetes, heart disease, cancer and chronic lung diseases - through health education and lifestyle change. Arogya World targets workplaces for chronic disease prevention because work is where so many people spend a large part of their day. An estimated 20 percent of Indians have at least one chronic condition. Some 70 million Indians live with diabetes, and one million die from it each year. Indians develop type 2 diabetes in their 30s and 40s, at the peak of their productivity, and some 10 years earlier than most Westerners, making the public health burden in the country truly alarming. It is expected that there will be 869 million working-age Indians by 2020, making workplaces a smart platform for tackling NCDs. According to the World Health Organization, NCDs are largely preventable with lifestyle changes - 80% of heart disease, 80% of diabetes and 40% cancer can be prevented by avoiding tobacco, eating healthy foods, and increasing physical activity.
