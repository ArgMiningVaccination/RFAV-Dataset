Defini tion and Brief Description of the Community Served For the purposes of the Community Health Needs Assessment, Albany Memorial Hospital defines its primary service area as Albany and Rensselaer Counties which represent the home zip codes of 82% of its patients. Albany Rensselaer Population 289,629 92.2% 90.7% Median Household Income $63,329 $65,831 Much m ore information about the community demographics is contained in Section III. Review of the Previous Community Health Needs Assessment (2016) Key findings of the 2016 CHNA included issues pertaining to Chronic Disease and Behavioral Health. Diabetes and Asthma were the specific health conditions within chronic disease that were selected to be addressed. Asthma in particular was selected due to the significant disparities evident among sub- populations. Prevention of Substance Abuse (e.g. opioid) was selected to be addressed within behavioral health. Coordinated and led by the Health Capital District Initiative (HCDI), regional task forces were developed: The Regional Behavioral Health Task Force, The Regional Diabetes/Obesity Task force. Asthma/Tobacco was led by the Asthma Coalition of the Capital District. Diabetes/ Obesity Over the past three years, o ur plan focused on increasing screening rates for pre -diabetes especially among economically disparate populatio ns; promoting culturally relevant chronic disease management education and creating community environments that promote and support healthy food and beverage choices and physical activity. We worked to expand school and employee wellness programs. Lifesty le change and self -management strategies were promoted to significantly improve quality of life and reduce treatment costs to those with diabetes. These strategies helped to foster an environment that engages individuals in the prevention and self- manageme nt of diabetes. Collectively, the Regional Diabetes/Obesity Task Force executed the following tactics: o Health care professionals were trained on pre -diabetes screening and resources within the community o National Diabetes Prevention Programs (NDPP) particip ation increased in Albany and Rensselaer Counties o Creating Health Schools and Communities Grant provided technical assistance in developing implementation strategies for health and wellness policies within Albany and Rensselaer County school districts o 2,00 0 revised Diabetes Resource guides were printed and distributed to providers and consumers (also available electronically) o Employer sponsored wellness program continued to increase access to healthy lifestyle and physical activity o 1500 children withi n Alba ny and Rensselaer counties participated in Soccer for Success, an evidence -based after school program focused on physical activity and healthy lifestyle. 88% of participants either maintained or decre ased their individual BMI level St. Peter's Health Partners (St. Peter's Hospital, Albany Memorial Hospital and Samaritan Hospital) Related Initiatives: Facilitated a total of 12 National Diab etes Prevention Program (NDPP) groups 194 participants completed a NDPP program, having an average weight loss of 4.4% per group and an average of 200 activity minutes recorded As a result of our Healthy Vending policy, 60% of the snack and beverage selections are from healthier stocking standards Provided employee wellness and physical activity programs to our 12,000 colleagues. Five to six wellness and physical activity programs were offered yearly Provided technical assistance to 6 school districts within Albany and Rensselaer counties to implement strong school wellness policies As a result of these initiatives both collectively and internally, obesity rates decreased in Albany County. Adult: from 26% to 25.3%. Children: 17% to 16%. Asthma/Tobacco Cessation: During the past three years, members of the Asthma Coalition of the Capital District worked to reduce the prevalence of uncontrolled asthma in high prevalence neighborhoods. The focus was on increasing the number of patients engaged in an asthma continuum of care and increasing the utilization of asthma action plans and controller medication. Strategies promoted community environments in enacting tobacco -free policies and engaging the community in tobacco cessation programs. Collectively: Our work with the community agencies resulted in numerous communities implementing tobacco free parks and public housing units becoming tobacco free; passage of tobacco control legislation, such as local and statewide Tobacco 21 and Tobacco Free Pharmacies in Albany Co unty Over 3,500 healthy neighborhood and certified asthma educator visits were conducted in order to expand asthma home based self -management programs Over 3,330 individuals within Albany and Rensselaer counties were referred to the NYS Smoker's Quitline for tobacco cessation assistance St. Peter's Health Partners (St. Peter's Hospital, Albany Memorial Hospital and Samaritan Hospital) Related Initiatives: The SPHP Home Based Asthma program, which arranged for patient visits in their homes by a Respiratory Therapist, Registered Nurse and Community Health worker provided appropriate asthma education to 1,030 patients SPHP Health Care Providers were educated on the availability of the home based asthma program and tobacco cessation resources, in order to decrease the number of adults who use tobacco products 50+ individuals have been trained as asthma educators through our Certified Asthma Educator Program Our work with community agencies resulted in several legislative changes such as tobacco free pharmacies in Albany County, local and statewide Tobacco 21, which prohibits the sale of tobacco products (inclusive of electronic cigarettes and vaping devices) to persons under the age of 21 126 participants enrolled in The Butt Stops Here tobacco cess ation program offered at St. Peter's Health Partners locations An electronic referral system was created enabling patients of SPHP to be referred to be the NYS Smokers Quitline by SPHP physician practices, through direct connectivity for referrals from the electronic medical record. 3,064 individuals from our hospitals and ambulatory sites were referred to the NYS Smokers Quitline f or tobacco cessation assistance As a result of these initiatives both collectively and internally, the age adjusted asthma hospitalization rate per 10,000 decreased from 11.2% to 5.7% in Albany County and from 10.5% to 6.1% in Rensselaer County. Also, the percentage of adults who smoke decreased from 24.8% to 18.3% in Rensselaer County. Substance Abuse (particularly opioid abuse) : In order to increase education and practice strategies to reduce opioid overdose and non -medical use of opiates, our plan , over the last three years, included provider education of addiction & pain management (prescribing guidelines & community re sources for prevention, addiction treatment & recovery support), information to provide to patients regarding risk of harm and misuse, promotion of safe storage & proper disposal of unused prescription medications (community education, increase disposal op portunities), New York State Opioid Overdose Prevention Training and establishment of ambulatory detoxification service locations. Collectively, members of the Regional Behavioral Health Task Force: Trained over 2,500 individuals Naloxone/Narcan Training to prevent heroin overdosing and sudden death within Albany and Rensselaer counties Both Albany and Rensselaer counties participated in task force meetings, which provided a forum for coordinating activities of public health, public safety and beh avioral health resources, with regards to the non -medical use of opioids and prescription pain medication Established ambulatory opioid withdrawal programs and increased the number of \"x waivered\" licensed health care providers Dozens of locations partici pated in regularly scheduled drug \"take back \" days to remove opioids from consumer's homes Health Care Providers were educated regarding prescribing consistent with updated state & federal guidelines St. Peter's Health Partners (St. Peter's Hospital, Samaritan Hospital and Albany Memorial Hospital) Related Initiatives: Established four ambulatory opioid withdrawal programs, which provided services to nearly 1,000 patients An additional 13 providers became \"x\" licensed, meaning the provider is waivered to prescribe & dispense buprenorphine in office -based treatment of opioid disorders 630 of our providers were educated on addiction and pain management, consistent with updated state and federal guidelines. Written Comments on Prior CHNA The CHNA is well -known in our community and local health departments as well as numerous community based agencies have been involved throughout the process of selecting priorities and developing improvement plans . No specific written comments have been received. Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Albany Memorial Hospital, along with its sister hospitals , collaborated with other local health systems, county health departments and community based agencies to complete a six county (Albany, Rensselaer, Schenectady , Saratoga, Columbia and Greene) Community Health Needs Assessment, led by the Healthy Capital District Initiative (HCDI). HCDI is an incorporated not - for-profit which works with others in the community to determine ways in which the Capital Region could be more effective in identifying and addressing public health problems. For the purposes of its CHNA, Albany Memorial Hospital used data and information from this assessment relating to Albany and Rensselaer Counties which represent the home zip codes of 82% of its patients. Other health systems will be addressing the needs of remaining counties in the assessment based on their location and patient population. Data Sources and Indicator Selection The health indicators selected for this report were based o n a review of available public health data and New York State priorities promulgated through the Prevention Agenda for a Healthier New York . Upon examination of these key resources, identification of additional indicators of importance with data available, and discussion with public health as well as health care professionals in the Capital Region , it was decided that buildi ng upon the recent 2013 -2018, and new 2019- 2024 Prevention Agenda would provide the most comprehensive analysis o f available public health needs and behaviors for the Region. The collection and management of these data has been supported by the state for an extended period and are very likely to continue to be supported. This provides reliable and comparable data over time and across t he state. While the 2019 -2024 Prevention Agenda objectives and indicators have been developed, the present Prevention Agenda Dashboard still contains 2013 -2018 indicators with corresponding data (as of May 2019). T hese measures, when complemented by the r ecent Expanded Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and Prevention Quality Indicators, provide health indicators that can be p otentially impact ed in the short- term. The Common Ground Health provide d SPARCS (hospitalizations and ED visits) and Vital Statistics Data Portals that were utilized to generate county and ZIP code level analyses of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency room utilization, for all residents, by gender, race and ethnicity. The time frames used for the Zip code analyses were 2010 -2015 Vital Statistics and 2012- 2016 Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) data. The 5 -year period establishes more reliable rates when looking at small geographic areas or minority populations. Additional data was examined from a wide variety of sources: Prevention Agenda 2013 -18 Dashboard of Tracking Indicators (2016) Community Health Indicator Reports Dashboard (2014- 2016) County Health Indicators by Race/Ethnicity (2014- 2016) County Perinatal Profiles (2012 -2014; 2014- 2016) Vital Statistics Annual Reports (2014, 2015, 2016) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and Expanded BRFSS (2016) Cancer Registry, New York State (2011- 2015) Prevention Quality Indicators (2014- 2016) Communicable Disease Annual Reports (2013 -2017) The Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS) (2014- 2016) Student Weight Status Category Reporting System (2014 -2016) County Opioid Quarterly Reports (April 2017 -October 2018) NYS Opioid Data Dashboard (2016 -2017) NYS Child Health Lead Poison ing Prevention Program ( 2013 birth cohort; 2014 - 2016) NYS Kids' Well -being Indicator Clearinghouse (KWIC) (2012- 14, 2017) County Health Rankings (2019) American Fact Finder (factfinder2.census.gov) (2017) Bureau of Census, American Community Survey (2012 -2016) These data sources were supplemented by a Siena College Research Institute Community Health Survey. The 201 8 Community Health Survey was conducted in December 2018 by the Siena College Research Institute. The survey was a representative sample of adult (18+ years) residents of the Capital Region. The survey included 1,204 (MOE +/ - 3.4%) total interviews made up of a phone sample, oversample of low income residents, and a small online sample. This consumer survey was conducted to learn about the health needs , barriers and concerns of residents in the Capital Region . The Appendix (2018 Capital Region Community Health Survey) contains a detailed summary of the findings, as well as the questionnaire used. Collaboration and Community Engagement Engaging the community in the health needs assessment process was a priority of St. Peter's Health Partners and other stakeholders. Broad community engagement began with participation in the community health survey. The survey offered multiple choice and open- ended questions to learn about residents' health needs and priorities, health behaviors, barriers to care, and social determinants of health. Demographic information collected by the survey allowed review of inf ormation by age, gender, race/ethnicity and income. Survey results regarding the public's experience with opioid abuse and opinions on the seriousness of public health issues were incorporated into the examination of health needs by the members of the four Capital Region Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work Groups (Albany - Rensselaer, Columbia- Greene, Saratoga and Schenectady). The Work Groups included community voices through representatives from community based organizations that serve low-income residen ts, the homeless, and other vulnerable populations; federally qualified health centers; advocacy groups; employers; public health departments; providers and health insurers. Participants were encouraged to share data of their own and to advocate for the needs of their constituents. HCDI and its stakeholders strategically invited partners with unique access to the medically underserved population. Selection of Priorities Selection of the top health priorities for the Capital Region was facilitated by a ne w Public Health Issue Prioritization tool created by HCDI based on feedback from the 2016 -2018 Prioritization Cycle. In the fall of 2018, HCDI staff reviewed approximately 170 Public Health Indicators across the five Prevention Agenda priority areas and in corporated the key indicators into 30 Public Health Issues. Public Health Issues were identified by reviewing the present Prevention Agenda Focus Areas, as well as Public Health Issues incorporated in the last Prioritization Process in 2016, and were ranke d for each of the six counties in the Capital Region. The ranking tool utilized a quantitative method, based on previous prioritization efforts (e.g. Hanlon Method), to assist the county selection process from 30 Public Health Issues to a short er list of health issues for participating partners to examine and make their final selections. Each indicator variable was scored on five dimensions: Size relative to Upstate; Impact on quality of life; Trend from 2013- 2015 or a comparable timeframe; Dispa rity (Index of Disparity using race/ethnicity); and Absolute number of individuals affected. A comprehensive overview of the ranking methodology can be found on the HCDI website (http://hcdiny.org ) by selecting \"Explore b y County\" and locating \"Public Health Issue Prioritization Methodology Review\" in the \"County Data and Resources\" section. A Prevention Agenda Work Group Steering Committee with participation from local health departments of Albany, Columbia, Greene, Rens selaer, Saratoga and Schenectady counties, St. Peter's Health Partners, Ellis Medicine, Albany Medical Center, Saratoga Hospital, and Columbia Memorial Hospital met in winter 2018 to review the Ranking Methodology and provide oversight and guidance in the prioritization process. Using the quantitative rankings provided by the tool as well as consideration of the availability of quality data, adequacy of current efforts, organizational capacity, upstream vs. downstream factors, and potential for evidence - based interventions, Steering Committee participants selected 12 -15 Public Health Issues for more comprehensive review by the Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work Groups. The local Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work Groups were formed to review data analyses prepared by HCDI for the Public Health Issues identified by the Prevention Agenda Work Group Steering Committee and to select at least two priorities with one health disparity to be addressed. Available data on prevalence, emergency department visits , hospitalizations, mortality, and trends were included for each indicator. Equity data for gender, age, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood groupings were presented as available. Prior to the presentation, the full data set reviewed by the Prevention Agenda Work Group Steering Committee was made available to Capital Region partners on the HCDI website (http://hcdiny.org/ ). Presentations can be found by selecting \"Explore by County\" and opening the \"2019 Prevention Agenda Pri oritization Presentation\" under the \"County Data and Resources\" section. After the presentation of each set of health indicators, a discussion was held to answer any questions, or allow individuals to share their experiences with the health condition in t he population. Participants were encouraged to consider the importance of the condition in the community based on three qualitative dimensions: what the data and organizational experiences suggested; if there was community awareness and concern about the c ondition; and the opportunity to prevent or reduce the burden of this health issue on the community. Participants were provided with a Prioritization Tracking Tool to record their own comments and measure their thoughts on the local experience, community v alue, and potential opportunity regarding each health indicator. Upon completion of the data summaries, Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work Groups members were given an opportunity to advocate for the priority they believed was most meritorious and the group voted on the top two Prevention Agenda categories. Behavioral health and chronic disease categories received the greatest amount of votes by far, because they impacted the largest number of people in the most significant ways, both directly and indirectly, through their influence on other health conditions. They al so contributed most significantly to the cost of health care. Albany -Rensselaer Prevention Agenda Prioritization Workgroup The Albany -Rensselaer Prevention Agenda Prioritization Workgroup was spearheaded by the Albany County Department of Health, the Rensselaer County Department of Health, Albany Medical Center, and St. Peter's Health Partners. Because the hospitals ' catchment areas covers both counties, a joint county w orkgroup was felt appropriate. Two meetings were held on March 1 and March 21, 2019. During these meetings, HCDI presented data for t he 9 selected heath indicators and facilitated Albany -Rensselaer Prevention Agenda Prioritization Workgroup discussions. The Power Point data presentations used during these meetings were made available to the Albany -Rensselaer Prevention Agenda Prioritization Workgroup members and the public on the HCDI Website http://www.hcdiny.org/ ). The Albany -Rensselaer Prevention Agenda Workgroup chose their pr iorities at the second workgroup meeting. Organizations participating in the Albany -Rensselaer Prevention Agenda Prioritization Workgroup : - Albany County Department for Aging - Albany County Department of Health - Albany County Department of Mental Health - Albany Medical Center - Albany Medical Center: DSRIP (Better Health for Northeast New York, Inc.) - Alliance for Better Health - Alliance for Positive Health - AVillage, Inc. - Blue Shield of Northeastern New York, Inc. - Burdett Birth Center - Capital District Boys and Girls Club - Capital District Physicians' Health Plan (CDPHP) - Capital District Tobacco -Free Coalition - Capital Roots - Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Albany - Cornell Cooperative Extension - Healthy Capital District Initiative - Hudson Valley Community College - Independent Living Center of the Hudson Valley - MVP Health Care, Inc. - Promesa/Camino Nuevo - Rensselaer County Department of Health - Rensselaer County Department of Mental Health - St. Peter's Health Par tners - The Baby Institute - The Food Pantries for the Capital District - United Way of the Greater Capital Region - Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood - Whitney Young Health Center Almost all of these organizations serve medically underserved, low inco me or minority populations; many offer specific programs targeted towards these groups Albany and Rensselaer Counties completed the Community Health Prioriti zation Meetings in March 2019. Attendance during the two prioritization meetings consisted of 89 participants representing many healthcare, community based and public service providers . Participants were engaged in the data presentations, raised many questions, and offered a service provider's perspective. During the diabetes data presentation, ther e was discussion on how pre -diabetes data is unavailable, and most individuals with pre -diabetes are unaware of their condition. Diabetes is one of the most expensive health conditions because of its sequelae, yet it can be prevented with early diagnosis a nd management. Participants also suggested that obesity data may underrepresent the issue, as those who are overweight but not clinically obese are not represented. Obesity was discussed as an \"upstream\" issue and a root cause for many other health problems. During the asthma data participants reflected on the stunning racial and ethnic disparities. Interventions should be culturally competent, and take into account environmental factors such as how living near a train affects air quality. Smoking was disc ussed as a similarly disparate health indicator, and participants raised concerns about e -cigarettes and a recent increase in the use of traditional tobacco. When discussing mental health and drug use, participants remarked about decreased physician presc ribing of opioids, but expressed concern about increased mental health hospitalizations and a lack of access to pediatric mental health services . Almost all of these organizations serve medically underserved, low income or minority populations; many have specific programs targeted towards these groups. Albany and Rensselaer Counties selected the following priorities: I. PRIORITY AREA: PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASE Reduce Obesity and Prevent Diabetes Prevent/Control Asthma and Prevent Tobacco Use II. PRIOIRTY AREA: PROMOTE WELL- BEING AND PREVENT MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Prevent Mental Disorders Existing task forces will have their scope modified or new task forces will be established t o develop and implement Community Health Improvement Plans for each of the priority areas selected. For example, the existing Obesity -Diabetes Task Force will review and revise their efforts to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes, and help patients learn h ow to self -manage and live a healthy lifestyle. The asthma/tobacco prevention task force will work with existing coalitions like Capital District Tobacco -Free Communities, who currently partners with the Albany County Strategic Alliance for Health, as well as the Asthma Coalition of the Capital Region. Addressing mental health will require collaboration with both Albany and Rensselaer counties' Departments of Mental Health. Mental health may also call upon DSRIP (Delivery System Reimbursement Incentive Payment Program) activities as well as the regional health home, Capital Region Health Connections.

He facilitated the prioritization process and provided focus for the development of the Community Health Improvement Plans. Mr. Medvesky, the Director, Health Data Anal ytics (HCDI), provided invaluable insights and tech nical expertise in public health indicators to be included, as well as detailed review of the data analysis, findings, and narrative contained in the Community Health Needs Assessment. Mr. Lake and Ms. Beltrani, Research Analysts (HCDI), made si gnificant contributions to the text and in generating the tab les and charts. Mr. Lake prepared the Appendices co ntained in the Report. The HCDI Public Health Planners, Ms. Emily Lipton, Ms. Rebecca Starzyk, Ms. Jordyn Watts, as w ell as the PHIP Program Manager, Mr. Dylan Hall, were instrumental in coordinating the regional Prioritization Work Gr oups, as well as supporting the regional Community Health Improvemen t Plan (CHIP) Development Work Groups. Ms. Lillie R uby, Communications Coordinator, HCDI, was invaluable in the formatting of the document and its accompanyin g appendices. This document benefited from the review and input o f the members of the Prevention Agenda Workgroup of the Healthy Capital District Initiative. These individuals are subject matter experts from area county public heal th departments and each of the Capital Region hospitals. Their review of the narrative and the data resulted in helpful e dits. They were joined by representatives from county agencies, community based organizations, businesses, consumers, schools , academics, and other partners, for a total of over 90 differen t organizations participating in the four Capital R egion Public Health Prioritization, and CHIP Work Groups, who considere d a data summary of the findings and to develop reg ional priorities. The member organizations of HCDI also provided valu able financial support for the development of this Report and the community health survey. We are grateful for the co ntributions of each and every one of these knowledg eable contributors. Financial Support : This project would not have been possible withou t the generous support of the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) through the Populatio n Health Improvement Program (PHIP). This report, h owever, solely reflects the analysis of the authors and is not a production of the NYSDOH. 2 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE I Health Profile of New York's Capital Region, 2019 In 1997, the counties of Albany, Rensselaer, and Sc henectady implemented a joint project to engage health providers and community members in a regional health assessment and prioritization process. This was the first major co llaborative venture undertaken by the three local governments, health care providers, insurers, other community organizations and residents to assess health status, identify health priorities , and develop plans to improve the health status of the Capital District. The projects that resulted from these plans have directly resulted in improved health and access to needed health service s for residents in the Capital District. The 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) i s now the sixth analysis of the health needs in the region to be conducted in support of c ommunity health improvement planning. In addition to the original three Capital District cou nties of Albany, Schenectady and Rensselaer, the 2019 CHNA includes the counties of Saratoga, Co lumbia and Greene. The 2019 CHNA examines hospitalization and emergency department d ata, prevention quality indicators, demographic data and health behaviors. The structur e of this report is based upon the 2019- 2024 Prevention Agenda of New York State. Utilizing the Prevention Agenda framework for examining public health data, aligns our analysis w ith that of the New York State Department of Health, creating opportunities to compare the Ca pital Region to other Upstate counties and New York State goals. This analysis is not completely comprehensive of ev ery health condition or public health issue. In addition, individuals working on a particular he alth issue, or experiencing it first hand, will undoubtedly have other local data and valuable know ledge to contribute beyond the data reported. The analysis completed was chosen based u pon the availability of reliable, comparable data and the delineated priority health areas of th e New York State Department of Health. The results describe the prevalence and concentration o f the major health issues in the region. This document would not be possible without the lab or, input and support of our sponsors and members of the community. It is the result of over 8 months of meetings with member organizations and community input through our surve y of over 1,200 residents of the Capital Region. Their collaboration was invaluable. As a re sult of these efforts, the following priority areas for Capital Region counties were identified t o focus our collective efforts in the coming years on preventing or reducing the burden of obesi ty and diabetes; smoking and asthma; mental health and substance abuse. This Community H ealth Needs Assessment was completed and approved in June 2019.

Introduction and Data Summary The purpose of this report is to summarize the publ ic health needs of communities in the Capital Regio n with the most reliable data available. These indicators provide a broad array of health information that may be usef ul in determining and monitoring health promotion priorities for the community. The following sections provide an overview of the p rocesses used to select indicators and priorities, and details about individuals and organizations who participated in t hese processes. Community Being Assessed The communities being assessed in this report are t he counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Sar atoga, Columbia and Greene. They form the common service area cover ed by the local health departments in Albany, Renss elaer, Schenectady, Saratoga, Columbia and Greene Counties and the primary patient population served by Alban y Medical Center, Ellis Hospital, St Peter's Health Partners, Saratoga Hospital and Columbia Memorial Hospital, which are located within the six counties. Demographic information on the population in the Ca pital Region is available from the 2012-2016 U.S. C ensus's American Community Survey (ACS). The combined popul ation in the Capital Region is 957,553 individuals. About 28.4% were 0-19 years of age, while 16.0% were 65 years o f age or older. Approximately 11.1% were living in poverty. The race/ethnicity distribution was 83.6% White, 7.7% B lack, 4.1% and 4.6% other r aces; 4.9% were Hispanic/Latino (any race). Additional demographic details are provided in Section III. Data Sources and Indicator Selection The health indicators selected for this report were based on a review of available public health data and New York State priorities promulgated through the Prevention Agenda for a Healthier New York . Upon examination of these key resources, identification of additional indicators of importance with data available, and discussion w ith public health as well as health care professionals in the Capital Re gion, it was decided that building upon the recent 2013-2018, and new 2019-2024 Prevention Agenda would provide the most comprehensive analysis of available public health n eeds and behaviors for the Region. The collection and manage ment of these data has been supported by the state for an extended period and are very likely to continue to be suppor ted. This provides reliable and comparable data ove r time and across the state. While the 2019-2024 Prevention Agenda ob jectives and indicators have been developed, the pr esent Prevention Agenda Dashboard still contains 2013-2018 indicator s with corresponding data (as of May 2019). These m easures, when complemented by the recent Expanded Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and Prevention Quality Indicators, provide health indicators that can be potentially i mpacted in the short-term. The Common Ground Health provided SPARCS (hospitali zations and ED visits) and Vital Statistics Data Po rtals that were utilized to generate county and ZIP code level anal yses of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency room utilization, for all residents, by gender, race and ethnicity. The t ime frames used for the ZIP code analyses were 2012 -2016 Vital Statistics and 2012-2016 Statewide Planning and Research Coope rative System (SPARCS) data. The 5-year period esta blishes more reliable rates when looking at small geographic are as or minority populations. Additional data was examined from a wide variety of sources: 8 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE I I INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY Prevention Agenda 2013-18 Dashboard of Tracking Ind icators (2016) Community Health Indicator Reports Dashboard (2014- 2016) County Health Indicators by Race/Ethnicity (2014-20 16) County Perinatal Profiles (2012-2014; 2014-2016) Vital Statistics Annual Reports (2014, 2015, 2016) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and Expanded BRFSS (2016) Cancer Registry, New York State (2011-2015) Prevention Quality Indicators (2014-2016) Communicable Disease Annual Reports (2013-2017) The Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS ) (2014-2016) Student Weight Status Category Reporting System (20 14-2016) County Opioid Quarterly Reports (April 2017-October 2018) NYS Opioid Data Dashboard (2016-2017) NYS Child Health Lead Poisoning Prevention Program ( 2013 birth cohort; 2014-2016) NYS Kids' Well-being Indicator Clearinghouse (KWIC) (2012-14, Rankings (2019) American Fact Finder (factfinder2.census.gov) (2017 ) Bureau of Census, American Community Survey (2012-2 016) These data sources were supplemented by a Siena Col lege Research Institute Community Health Survey. Th e 2018 Community Health Survey was conducted in December 2 018 by the Siena College Research Institute. The su rvey was a representative sample of adult (18+ years) resident s of the Capital Region. The survey included 1,204 (MOE +/- 3.4%) total interviews made up of a phone sample, oversam ple of low income residents, and a small online sam ple. This consumer survey was conducted to learn about the he alth needs, barriers and concerns of residents in t he Capital Region. The Appendix (2018 Capital Region Community Health Survey) contains a detailed summary of the findings , as well as the questionnaire used. Local data were compiled from these data sources an d draft sections were prepared by health condition for inclusion in this community health needs assessment. Drafts were reviewed for accuracy and thoroughness by two staf f with specialized health data knowledge: Michael Medvesky , M.P.H. Director, Health Analytics, Healthy Capita l District Initiative (HCDI), and John Lake, M.S, Public Health Data Anal yst, HCDI. The 2019 Capital Region Community Health Needs Assessment Draft was sent to local subject matter experts for revie w in the health departments of Albany, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga, Columbia and Greene Counties and in St. Peter's Health Partners, Albany Medical Center, Ellis Hospital, Saratoga Hospital and Columbia Memorial, as well as being placed on the HCDI website for pub lic review and comment. Comments were addressed and changes were i ncorporated into the final document. 9 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE I INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY Structure of this Report: Health Indicators Every year, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) provides updated information on major hea lth indicators for each county. NYSDOH still provides county-level information on 2013-2018 Prevention Agenda indicat ors and objectives that can be used for tracking Prevention Agenda-based efforts, while working on the develop ment and public accessibility of the 2019-2024 Prevention Agenda Da shboard. To supplement available information, this report focuses on more detailed information, such as analyses by Z IP code level, gender, race, ethnicity and trends o ver the past decade. In order to present meaningful information for smal ler areas or subgroups, data for several years are combined. Thus, most information presented is based on three or fiv e years of combined data. Still, some areas had to o few cases to estimate rates accurately. After presenting information on demographics and ca use of death for the Capital Region, a summary of g eneral health status is presented, including information on healt h care access and usage. This is followed by secti ons specific to each of the five New York State Prevention Agenda Priori ty Areas. Topics within each Priority Area contain a brief synopsis of the condition and why it is of concern. Prevention Agenda objectives are presented and compared to st atistics for New York State, excluding New York City, the Capital Re gion, and the six Capital Region counties. If avai lable, trend data as well as information by gender and race/ethnicity ar e presented. Indicators include mortality, natality , and emergency department (ED) visit and hospitalization rates. Ad ditional information from disease registries, admin istrative data, and the Expanded Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem are also included. ZIP code groups were chosen as a small-area breakdo wn because there were insufficient data for the pri mary alternative, census tracts. The groups were selected based on a minimum of 2,000 residents and meaningful grouping s generally following municipal or multiple municipal boundarie s. Detailed tables are available in the appendices for : ZIP code neighborhood groupings by county; count y socio- demographics (age, race/ethnicity, poverty) by neig hborhood; county birth indicators by neighborhood; leading causes of death and premature death by county; county hosp italization rates by race and gender; county ED vis it rates by race and gender; county hospitalization rates by neighbo rhood; county emergency department rates by neighbo rhood; county mortality rates by neighborhood; county and neighborhood prevention quality indicators (PQI); c ounty health rankings; county-specific results of the ranking of Public Health Issues using a methodology developed by HCDI; and 2018 Capital Region Community Health Survey results . In addition, the Appendix contains a county listi ng of \"assets and resources\" specific to the Prevention Agenda Priori ty Areas chosen by the counties in the Capital Regi on. Rates and Comparisions For most indicators, age-adjusted rates are present ed in the tables. Age-adjustment considers the dif fering age distributions within populations to calculate rates that can be used for comparison purposes. Direct s tandardization was used for this report. The advantage of this method is that comparisons of Capital Region data can be made with Prevention Agenda objectives for most indicators. Prevention Agenda and NYSDOH indicators have been a ge- standardized to the United States 2000 population, thus age-adjusted rates presented in this report ar e standardized similarly. Also, most comparisons are made between Capital Region data and data for the 57 counties in New York State which are not within the City of New York (referenc ed as \"NYS excl. NYC\"). This is a well-accepted me thodology to allow comparison with typically more similar populations, excluding the sometimes unique population dynamics of the nation's largest city. 10 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE I I INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY Data Summary In 2012-16, the most recent demographic profile ava ilable, the Capital Region was home to approximatel y 957,200 residents, equally distributed between males and fe males, with counties ranging from Urban (Schenectad y-756 pop. /sq. mile) to Rural (Greene-73 pop. / sq. mile). The Reg ion's mean age of 39.9 years was higher than that o f New York State (NYS). About 17% of the population was 14 years of age or younger, while 16% was 65 years of age and o lder. Approximately 16% of the Capital Region's populatio n was non-White and 4.8% Hispanic. The Region's med ian household income of $63,758 was higher than NYS. It s poverty rate of 11.1% was lower than NYS. Over 15 % of the Region's children less than 18 years of age were be low poverty. About 7.9% of the Capital Region's pop ulation 25 years of age or older had less than a high school educati on. The health of Capital Region residents was generall y consistent with other New York counties outside N ew York City, although Capital Region residents had a higher over all age-adjusted mortality rate as well as a higher % of deaths that were premature (<65years) than NYS excl. NYC. Howe ver, the Region's rate of Years of Potential Life L ost (YPLL) was lower than NYS excl. NYC. Chronic diseases were th e leading causes of death in the Capital Region, wi th heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD), a nd stroke being the major causes. Injuries were th e major cause of death in the child, adolescent, and young adult pop ulations. Health care access indicators show the Capital Regi on having fewer barriers to care than NYS excl. NYC . Capital Region residents, both children and adults, had higher hea lth insurance coverage rates compared to NYS excl. NYC. A higher percent of Capital Region residents also had a regu lar health care provider. The Capital Region's prim ary care system also seemed to be working well compared to NYS excl. NYC . When looking at preventable hospitalizations, Cap ital Region residents had much lower rates than residents from NYS excl. NYC did. Total Emergency Department visit rates, as well as total hospitalization rates were also lower in t he Capital Region compared to NYS excl. NYC. There were many positive trends in the Capital Regi on. Coronary heart disease, stroke, asthma, childho od obesity, teen pregnancy, premature births, childhood lead screeni ng, childhood lead poisoning, fall emergency room v isits (1-4 years), fall hospitalizations to elderly (65+ years), and a lcohol-related injuries and death trends improved o ver the past decade. Children 19-35 months of age had higher immunizatio n rates, and women aged 13-17 years had higher HPV vaccination rates than NYS excl. NYC. Capital Region colorecta l and breast cancer screening rates were also highe r than NYS excl. NYC. The Capital Region had also seen a positive ch ange in certain health behaviors. Adult obesity ra tes have decreased slightly in the Capital Region, while they have inc reased in NYS excl. NYC. A higher percentage of Cap ital Region residents participated in some leisure time physical activity than NYS excl. NYC. They also consumed less sugary drinks, and ate at \"fast food\" establishments less than their NYS excl . NYC counterparts. Adult current smoking rates for Capital Region also decreased. However, many measurements were not as positive, pa rticularly in lower income, inner-city neighborhood s where many rates were 3 to 7 times higher than the county aver age. The Capital Region has seen negative trends i n Years of Potential life lost (YPLL), congestive heart failure, suicide , gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, Lyme disease, and opioid overdose ED visits, hospitalizations and mortality. Obesity an d its related diseases continue to be health issues in the Capital Region. Over 27% of adult residents were considered obese, or approximately 191,500 adult residents. Obesity i n the Capital Region's school children was also alarming, with al most 17% of children being considered obese. Diabe tes mortality and short-term complication hospitalizations were highe r in the Capital Region than NYS excl. NYC. Adult s moking rates, lung cancer incidence and mortality, and chronic lower r espiratory disease mortality rates were all higher in the Capital Region compared to NYS excl. NYC. Adult asthma prevalence , was also higher in the Capital Region. The incide nce of positive blood lead in children less than 72 months of age c ontinued to be a Capital Region issue, with rates m uch higher than 11 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE I INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY residents of NYS excl. NYC. Capital Region women h ad higher rates of infant mortality, and lower rate s for early prenatal care than NYS excl. NYC women. Capital Region teens had much higher pregnancy rates compared to their NYS excl. NYC counterparts. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis ra tes were also much higher in the Capital Region, wi th increasing trends over the past decade. Capital Region counti es presented some of the highest Lyme disease case rates in New York State. Mental Health indicators such as \"poor menta l health days\", suicide mortality, and self-inflict ed injury hospitalization rates were higher in the Capital Region compared to NYS excl. NYC. Binge drinking and cirrhosis mortal ity were also higher in the Capital Region compared to NYS excl. NYC. The Siena Community Health Survey collected respons es from a representative sample of Capital Region a dults (18+ years). The aim of the survey was to continue to le arn more about behavioral health/lifestyle practice s, health care utilization and needs, challenges to practicing hea lthy behaviors, accessing care, as well as other so cial determinants of health. About 81% of the respondents indicated that their o verall health was good or excellent, compared to 70 % of the low income population. Thirty percent of the respon dents experienced poor mental health for more than 5 days in the past month compared to 37% of low income respondent s. The survey contained social determinants of health- related questions at the individual and community l evel.

The largest difference was in the ability t o afford quality housing, and access to: childcare, education for ch ildren and adults; and recreational facilities. The survey also asked respondents about their perc eptions regarding selected public health issues. Drug abuse, Tobacco and related illnesses, Obesity, and Alcohol Abuse were the top rated public health issues for the general population. The range was 35% \"very serious \" for Drug Abuse, and 31% for Tobacco to 14% for Po or air and water, and 9% for Poor birth outcomes. Except for Health Disease, low income respondents consistently ranked the public health issues as more serious than the gener al population.

Race/Ethnicity In general, Black non-Hispanic Capital Region resid ents were at greater health risk than White non-His panic residents. Black non-Hispanics had 5.4 times the percent of fa milies below poverty compared to White non-Hispanic Capital Region residents (26.9% vs 5.0%). Hispanics had sim ilar poverty rates as Black non-Hispanics (22.8%). For 2013-15, Black non-Hispanic residents also had higher age-ad justed total mortality rates than White non-Hispani cs (784.16/100,000 vs 684.6). Hispanic Capital Region residents had the lowest age-adjusted total mortal ity rates (577.8). For 2014-2016, Black non-Hispanic residents had 2.8 times the age-adjusted total ED visit rates (7,023 /10,000 vs 2,503) and 1.5 times the age-adjusted total hospitalizatio n rates as White non-Hispanic residents (1,353/10,0 00 vs 909). When reviewing the total Prevention Quality Indicators ( PQI), Black non-Hispanic Capital Region residents h ad 2.1 times the age-adjusted total PQI rates compared to their Whit e non-Hispanic counterparts (210/10,000 vs 101). H ispanic Capital Region residents had lower hospitalization and PQI rates than White non-Hispanic residents. When compared to White non-Hispanics, Black non-His panic Capital Region residents had serious issues w ith diabetes. They had 2.2 times higher diabetes mortality rates; 3.3 times higher diabetes (primary diagnosis) hosp italization rates; and 3.6 times higher rates of hospitalizations due to short-term complications of diabetes. In additi on, Black non-Hispanic residents also had 5.3 times the asthma ED visit ra tes; 5 times higher teen pregnancy rates; 2.5 tim es higher late or no prenatal care rates; and 2 times higher low birthwe ight rates than their White non-Hispanic counterpar ts. The difference in assault hospitalizations was especially striking . Black non-Hispanics had 5.2 times the assault hos pitalization rates than White non-Hispanic residents. In addition, Black no n-Hispanic residents had 1.7 times the mental disea se and disorder (primary diagnosis) hospitalization rates, and 1.4 the mental disease and disorder ED visit rate. CLRD, one of the leading causes of death in the Cap ital Region, had unusual disparity data. Black non- Hispanic residents had 2.2 times higher age-adjusted hospitalization r ate for CLRD, while White non-Hispanics had 1.4 tim es higher CLRD mortality rates. Similarly, Black non-Hispanic resi dents had a 2 times higher age-adjusted hospitaliza tion rate for congestive heart failure (CHF), while White non-His panic residents had 1.5 times higher CHF mortality rates. However, there were conditions where the Capital Re gion White non-Hispanic population fare poorly comp ared to their Black non-Hispanic counterparts. The rate of hospit alizations of the elderly due to falls showed that White non-Hispanic residents had a 1.9 times higher rates than their B lack non-Hispanic counterparts. White non-Hispanics also had 1.3 times the age-adjusted unintentional injury mortality rat e compared to Black non-Hispanics. In addition, Whi te non-Hispanics had 1.8 times the age-adjusted suicide mortality ra tes. Recent opioid overdose indicators have moved away from targeting minority populations. White non-Hispanic Capital Region residents had 1.9 times the age-adj usted opioid overdose mortality rates and 2.2 times the opiate o verdose ED visit rates compared to Black non-Hispan ic residents. The relatively small number of Asian non-Hispanic a nd Hispanic Capital District residents cautions int erpretation of indicators for these populations.

County Health Rankings-2019 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, together with t he University of Wisconsin Population Health Instit ute, develop annual health rankings for every county in the Unit ed States ( http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/ ). Counties are ranked on \"Health Outcomes\" (the present health of the cou nty) and on \"Health Factors\" (the future health of the county). The Appendix contains the 2019 Rankings for each of six Capital Region counties. The \"Health Outcome Ranki ngs\" show a wide range within the Capital Region with Saratoga County ranked # 4 for all New York counties, while Schenectady County was ranked #53 out of 62. However, the \"Heal th Factor Rankings\" show the Capital Region doing w ell compared to the rest of New York State counties. None of the counties fell into the 4 th (worst) quartile of counties, and ranged from Saratoga #2 to Greene #43. 28 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE II COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES II. Community Public Health Priorities Collaboration and Community Engagement Engaging the community in the health needs assessme nt process was a priority of HCDI and its stakehold ers. Broad community engagement began with participation in th e community health survey. The survey offered multiple choice questions to lea rn about residents' health needs and priorities, he alth behaviors, barriers to care, and social determinants of health . Demographic information collected by the survey a llowed review of information by age, gender, race/ethnicity and inco me. Survey results regarding the public's experience wi th opioid abuse and opinions on the seriousness of public health issues were incorporated into the examination of he alth needs by the members of the four Capital Regio n Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work Groups (Albany-Rensselae r, Columbia-Greene, Saratoga and Schenectady). The Work Groups included community voices through representa tives from community based organizations that serve low- income residents, the homeless, and other vulnerabl e populations; federally qualified health centers; advocacy groups; employers; public health departments; providers; an d health insurers. Participants were encouraged to share data of their own and to advocate for the needs of their co nstituents. HCDI and its stakeholders strategically invited partners with unique access to medically underserved populat ions. Selection of Priorities Selection of the top health priorities for the Capi tal Region was facilitated by a new Public Health I ssue Prioritization tool created by HCDI, based on feedback from the 2016-20 18 Prioritization Cycle. In the fall of 2018, HCDI staff reviewed approximately 170 Public Health Indicators across t he five Prevention Agenda priority areas and incorp orated the key indicators into 30 Public Health Issues. Public Hea lth Issues were identified by reviewing the present New York State Department of Health Prevention Agenda Focus Areas, as well as Public Health Issues incorporated in th e last Prioritization Process in 2016. The 30 Public Healt h Issues were ranked for each of the six counties i n the Capital Region. The ranking tool utilized a quantitative method, ba sed on previous prioritization efforts (e.g. Hanlon Method), to assist the county selection process from 30 Public Health Issues to a shorter list of health issues for parti cipating partners to examine and final selections. Each indicator was sc ored on five dimensions: Size (percent or rate) relative to NYS excluding, NYC; Impact on quality of life; Trends from 2013-2015 or a comparable timeframe; Disparity (Index of Disparity using race/ethnicity) ; and Absolute number of individuals affected. A comprehensive overview of the ranking methodology can be found on the HCDI website ( http://hcdiny.org ) by selecting \"Explore Health Issue Prioritization Methodology Review\" in the \"County Data and Resources\" section. 29 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE II COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES A Prevention Agenda Work Group, with participation from local health departments of Albany, Columbia, Greene, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schenectady counties, St. Peter's Health Partners, Ellis Medicine, Albany Med ical Center, Saratoga Hospital, and Columbia Memorial Hospital, met in the winter of 2018 to review the Ranking Met hodology and provide oversight and guidance in the prioritizatio n process. Using the quantitative rankings provided by the tool, as well as consideration of the availability of qualit y data, adequacy of current efforts, organizational capacity, upstream vs. downstream factors, and potential for evidence-base d interventions, Prevention Agenda Work Group parti cipants selected 12-15 Public Health Issues for more compre hensive review by the local Prevention Agenda Prior itization Work Groups. The local Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work Gro ups were formed to review data analyses prepared by HCDI for the Public Health Issues identified by the Prevention A genda Work Group and to select at least two priorit ies with one health disparity to be addressed. Available data on prevalence, emergency department visits, hospitali zations, mortality, and trends were included for each indicator. Equity data for gender, age, race/ethnicity, and neighbor hood groupings were presented as available. Prior to the presentat ion, the full data set reviewed by the Prevention A genda Work Group was made available to Capital Region partners on th e HCDI website ( http://hcdiny.org/ ). Presentations can be found by selecting \"Explore by County\" and opening the \"2019 Prevention Agenda Prioritization Presentation\" und er the \"County Data and Resources\" section. After the presentation of each set of health indica tors, a discussion was held to answer any questions , and for individuals to share their experiences with the health condition in the population. Participants w ere encouraged to consider the importance of the condition in the com munity based on three qualitative dimensions: what the data and organizational experiences suggested; if there was community awareness and concern about the condition ; and the opportunity to prevent or reduce the burden of this health issue on the community. Participants were p rovided with a Prioritization Tracking Tool to record their own co mments and measure their thoughts on the local expe rience, community value, and potential opportunity regardin g each health indicator. Upon completion of the data summaries, Prevention A genda Prioritization Work Groups members were given an opportunity to advocate for the priorities they bel ieved were most meritorious and the group voted on the top two Prevention Agenda categories. Mental health, behavi oral health, and chronic disease categories receive d the greatest amount of votes by far, because they impacted the l argest number of people in the most significant way s, both directly and indirectly, through their influence on other he alth conditions. They also contributed most signifi cantly to the cost of health care. A summary of each Capital Region Preve ntion Agenda Prioritization Work Group is as follow s: Albany-Rensselaer Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work Group The Albany-Rensselaer Prevention Agenda Prioritizat ion Work Group was led by the Albany County Departm ent of Health, the Rensselaer County Department of Health, Albany Medical Center, and St. Peter's Health Part ners. Because the hospitals' catchment areas cover both counties, it was felt a joint county Albany-Rensselaer Preve ntion Agenda Prioritization Work Group was appropriate. Meetings were held on March 1, 2019 and March 21, 2019 at w hich HCDI presented data for the heath indicators selected by the Prevention Agenda Work Group, and facilitated discussions. The Power Point data presentations used during these me etings were made available to the Albany-Rensselaer Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work Group members and the pu blic on the HCDI website (http://www.hcdiny.org/). The Albany- Rensselaer Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work Gr oup chose their priorities at the second work group meeting.

Young Health, Jr. Health Center Albany and Rensselaer Counties completed the Commun ity Health Prioritization Meetings in March 2019. A ttendance during the two prioritization meetings consisted of 89 participants representing healthcare, community based and public service providers. Participants were engaged in the data presentations, raised many questions, and offered a service provider's perspective. During the diabetes data presentation, there was di scussion on how pre-diabetes data is unavailable, and most individuals with pre-diabetes are unaware of their condition. Diabetes is one of the most expensive health conditions because of its sequelae , yet it can be prevented with early diagnosis and management. Participants also suggested that obesity data may u nderrepresent the issue, as those who are overweigh t but not clinically obese are not represented. Obesity was d iscussed as an \"upstream\" issue and a root cause fo r many other health problems. During the asthma data presentation participants re flected on the stunning racial and ethnic dispariti es. Interventions should be culturally competent, and take into accou nt environmental factors such as how living near a train affects air quality. Smoking was discussed as a similarly dispa rate health indicator, and participants raised conc erns about e- cigarettes and a recent increase in the use of trad itional tobacco. When discussing mental health and substance use, pa rticipants remarked about decreased physician presc ribing of opioids, but expressed concern about increased ment al health hospitalizations and a lack of access to pediatric mental health services. 31 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE II COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES Albany and Rensselaer Counties selected the followi ng Prevention Agenda Priority Areas: I. PRIORITY AREA: Prevent Chronic Diseases a. Reduce Obesity and Prevent Diabetes b. Prevent/Control Asthma, Prevent Tobacco Use II. PRIORITY AREA: Promote Well-Being and Prevent M ental and Substance Use Disorders a. Prevent Mental Disorders Existing task forces will have their scope modified or new task forces will be established to develop and implement Community Health Improvement Plan interventions for each of the priority areas selected. For example, the existing Obesity-Diabetes Task Force will review and revise their efforts to prevent obesity and type 2 diabete s, and help patients learn how to self-manage and live a healthy lifesty le. Asthma/tobacco prevention strategies task force will work with existing efforts of Healthy Neighborhood Programs, Delivery System Reimbursement Incentive Payment Pro gram (DSRIP) Performing Provider Systems (PPS), Green a nd Healthy Homes Initiative \u00ae, and, Capital District Tobacco-Free Communities, who currently partners with the Albany County Strategic Alliance for Health, as well as t he Asthma Coalition of the Capital Region. Addressing mental health will require collaboration with both Albany and Rensselaer counties' Departments of Mental Health. Mental heal th interventions may also integrate DSRIP (Delivery System Reimbursement Incentive Payment Program), PPS and h ealth home. Columbia-Greene Prevention Agenda Prioritization Wo rkgroup The Columbia and Greene Prevention Agenda Prioritiz ation Workgroup was led by Greene County Public Health, Columbia County Department of Health, and Columbia Memorial Hospital. Columbia and Greene Counties sha re similar demographic characteristics and health metrics. For this reason, the counties elected to align their e fforts surrounding mutually-selected priority areas. Meetings were hel d during on: March 22, 2019 and April 2, 2019 at wh ich HCDI presented a total of 9 health indicators related to four Prevention Agenda Priority Areas, followed by discussion. The PowerPoint data presentations used during these mee tings were made available to the Work Group members , and the general public on the HCDI website ( www.hcdiny.org ).

Community memb ers shared that the increased percentage of school children suffering from obesity identified in the data prese ntation was representative of the issue at hand. Co mmunity participants from Cornell Cooperative Extension (CC E) highlighted the need for improving nutritional k nowledge among children and families, while taking into considerat ion the difficulties and constraints economic situa tions put upon nutrition. Meeting participants with organizational experience addressing obesity identified Hudson Ci ty School District as a high-need organization for obesity-related hea lth programs. Mental Health/Suicide and Substance Abuse was also identified as a major concern by community members. Many participating community members expressed concern a nd attested to the increased prevalence identified during the HCDI data presentations. Organizations involved wit h substance abuse programs in the community highlig hted the need for a more robust approach to mental health an d the difficulties related to this topic, as many a re comorbid issues are deeply intertwined with substance abuse. Commun ity culture also play a tremendous role in shaping the attitudes surround substances, such as alcohol. Ramping curre nt interventions and preventing new cases was at th e forefront of the discussion. Columbia and Greene Counties selected the following Prevention Agenda Priority Areas: I. Priority Area: Prevent Chronic Diseases a. Focus Area: Reduce Obesity in Children and Adults II. Priority Area: Promote Well-Being and Prevent Menta l and Substance Use Disorders a. Focus Area: Prevent Substance Abuse and support Men tal Emotional and Behavioral Disorders (MEB) screening and treatment The Greene County Mobilizing for Action through Pla nning and Partnerships (MAPP) community group and t he Columbia County Public Health Leadership group will support the development of a joint-county task for ce for each 33 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE II COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES Priority Area. Community health partners who work i n each respective priority area will comprise each Priority Area- focused task force. Each task force will meet on a monthly basis and community partners responsible fo r priority area actions will provide updates on ongoing and project ed activities and interventions. The task forces wi ll be responsible for alignment and guidance of all countywide activi ties related to each Priority Area. Schenectady Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work G roup The Schenectady Prevention Agenda Prioritization Wo rk Group was led by Schenectady County Public Healt h Services, Ellis Medicine, Sunnyview Rehabilitation Hospital, and Hometown Health Centers (the local FQHC). The W ork Group was comprised of members of the Schenectady Coalition f or a Healthy Community (SCHC), an informal coalitio n of community organizations created following the State -mandated consolidation of Schenectady's hospitals, which has met regularly for the past ten years to share informati on on community health issues. Meetings were held on February 14, 2019, March 7, 2019, and March 14, 2019 at which HC DI presented data for the heath indicators selected by the Prevention Agenda Work Group, and facilitated discu ssions.

Asthma, respiratory diseas es and tobacco use were seen by members of the Sche nectady Coalition for a Healthy Community as important heal th topics in the community where disparities also e xist. There was extended discussion about the issue of electronic c igarette use among youth and how this will impact c ombustible tobacco use rates in the future. Capital District Tobacco-Free Communities shared projects they would like to work on in Schenectady County that impact these issues, whi le Ellis Medicine's tobacco cessation program spoke about the resources they have available to assist the communi ty. The topics of mental health and suicide were discus sed by the group at length. The community thought t hat the data underrepresented the issue because of lack of forma l diagnosis for many with poor mental health. Suici de data is also not captured correctly or consistently all of the t ime. Alcohol and substance abuse were also discusse d. Heroin and fentanyl use continues to concern the community and public health organizations. There are many groups working on addressing the issue of substance use and they were able to speak about their work. Schenectady County selected the following Preventio n Agenda Priority Areas: I. PRIORITY AREA: Prevent Chronic Diseases a. Focus Area: Tobacco Prevention II. PRIORTY AREA: Promote Well-Being and Prevent Mental and Substance Use Disorders Mental and Substance Use Disorders Prevention Saratoga Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work Grou p The Saratoga Prevention Agenda Prioritization Work Group was led by the Saratoga County Health Departm ent and Saratoga Hospital.

It was also noted that there are many organizations focusing on obesity prevention strategies and that there are proven evidence-based interventions to bu ild upon. There was much concern about the on-going opioid cr isis, particularly in rural areas where there is a lack of harm- reduction and needle exchange programs. Participant s expressed the need for resources outside of the u rban center. Head Start is seeing more pregnant mothers dealing with opioid issues. The County shared information o n the neonatal task force's work and resources. Participants also agreed with data showing that there is an issue wit h alcohol use. Questions were raised as to whether or not the comm unity considers alcohol use an issue, particularly within the tourism and hospitality industries.

Leading causes of death in the Hispanic population in New York State include heart disease, cancer, un intentional injury, stroke, and diabetes. 3 Premature Death and Years of Potential Life Lost (Y PLL) Objective Reduce the percentage of premature deaths (before a ge 65 years) to 21.8% Premature deaths occur prior to the expected length of life. Premature death can be measured by the pe rcent of all deaths that occurred before 65 years of age, or by Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL). This is the av erage years a person would have lived if they had not died prematurely. More weight is given to deaths that occur among yo unger people. Deaths at younger ages contribute more to the prema ture death rate than deaths occurring closer to age 65.

Highlights All Capital Region counties failed to meet the Prevention Agenda objective for adults having a regular health care provider. Rensselaer County and Columbia County had the lowest Capital Region rates for adult 18-64 years having a routine checkup in the last year. Capital Region Prevention Quality Indicator (PQI) rates were higher than rates for New York State excluding NYC, with the exception of the respiratory PQI rate that was slightly higher. Of the Capital Region counties, Schenectady County had the highest diabetes and circulatory PQI rates, Columbia County had the highest respiratory rate and Greene County had the highest acute rate. Capital Region Black-non Hispanic to White non-Hispanic ratios for PQI categories ranged from 1.4 for acute conditions to 3.6 for Diabetes conditions. Males residing in the Capital Region residents had higher diabetes and circulatory PQI rates, whereas females had higher respiratory and acute PQI rates. Health Care Usage More than 2.5 million adults in New York State, or 15%, lack a regular primary care provider. A lack of access to a primary care provider results in negative health outcomes. Primary care, including prenatal care, offers a prime opportunity for prevention education, early detection, early treatment, and referral to other necessary health and social services. Sustained contact with a primary care provider improves the consistency and efficacy of treatment for long-term chronic care patients.1 About 86% of adults in the Capital Region indicated that they had a regular health care provider. Over 99,000 Capital Region adults indicated that they did not have a regular health care provider; however, 80.4% to 88.4% of adults residing in the six Capital District counties have a primary care physician, clinic health center, or other place where they usually go to seek health care or health-related advice.

Only two Capital Region counties did not meet the New Yo rk State excluding NYC rate of adults who had a rou tine doctor's visit within the last year. Rensselaer and Columbi a counties had the lowest rates. 2 Structural, financial, and personal barriers can li mit access to health care. Structural barriers incl ude transportation, the distance to providers, insurance policy regulations , the lack of health care facilities, primary care providers, medical specialists, or other health care professionals to meet the public's needs. In addition to not having health insurance, financial barriers can also include not having the financial capacity to cover the cost of services or co-pays in accordance with health plan guidelines. Personal barriers incl ude cultural or spiritual differences, language bar riers, not knowing what to do or when to seek care, or concerns about confi dentiality. When these barriers exist, care is ofte n not well coordinated or as effective as it should be. Individuals may ex perience difficulty scheduling or keeping appointme nts.

Poor oral health negatively impacts a person's gene ral health and well-being. Studies have demonstrat ed a strong association between periodontal disease and diabete s, heart disease, stroke, pneumonia and adverse pre gnancy outcomes, although these relationships are not yet fully understood. The mouth can serve as a portal o f entry as well as the site of disease for microbial infections that a ffect general health. These bacteria can result in extensive localized infections but may also spread to other parts of th e body, if the normal barriers of a healthy mouth a re breached. Death from complications arising from untreated dental ab scesses is rare but does occur. Chronic pain from o ral disease can also make eating difficult. Not only does this thre aten adequate nutrition, but it also affects a pers on's ability to function normally. 1 Routine dental examinations and prophylaxis are eff ective prevention measures for improving oral health and reducing the burden of oral disease. Having regular dental visits is an importa nt indicator of general access to quality health care. 1 Oral diseases affect a large proportion of the Unit ed States population. About 47% of all adults in the United States have s ome form of periodontal disease, with 80% of individuals having at least one cavity by the age of 34. 2 In New York State, 30% of persons 65 years and ol der have lost all their teeth. 1 Approximately 1,500 men and 700 women in New York State diagnosed with oral cancer annually.3 There were over 220,500 adults residing in the Capi tal Region who did not visit a dentist within the past year. The rates for the six Capital Region Counties fluctuated, from a low in Columbia County (66.5%) to a high in Saratoga County (75.0%). Bot h Schenectady and Saratoga counties had rates above the NYS exclu ding NYC rate. 4 Untreated dental disease is more common in populati ons whose access to oral health care services is li mited.

Highlights Rensselaer and Schenectady counties had the highest obesity rates in the Capital Region, with all counties having obesity rates higher than the Preve ntion Agenda objective. Low income individuals had higher obesity rates tha n the general population. Many of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States are related to poor diet and physical inactivity. 1 Being overweight and/or obese is defined as falling into a range of weight that is greater than what i s considered healthy for a given height. For adults, obesity ranges are determined by using weight and height to calculate a number called the \"body mass index\" (BMI). An adult with a BMI betwee n 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight, and an adul t with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. 2 Obesity is caused by a complex interaction of gene tic, metabolic, behavioral, social and environmental factors. Obesity is associated with a dverse health, social and economic consequences. It is the primary cause of type 2 diabetes; indeed, more than 80% of persons with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obes e. It is also a major contributing factor to heart disease, stroke, cancer, asthma, arthritis, and a number of psychol ogical conditions, including depression. 3 Without strong action to reverse the obesity epide mic, for the first time in our history children are predicted to have a shorter lifespan than their par ents. 53 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE All obesity data presented is gathered from the New York State Expanded Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil lance Survey. Survey-based obesity rates are likely under-reporte d, as self-reported height and weight data has been demonstrated to be lower than measured data in approximately 50% of all cases . The percentage of obese adults in New York State ab out doubled from 13.9% in 1995 to 25.7% in 2017.5 There were an estimated 191,462 adults who were considered obese in the Capital Region. Of the six Capital District counties, Rensselaer County had the highest percent of obese adults. Columbia, Greene, Rensselaer, and Schenecta dy counties had obesity rates that were higher than NYS, exclud ing NYC, with none of the counties meeting the Prev ention Agenda objective. Columbia and Greene counties experienced an increase in adult obesity from the 2013-2014 BR FSS to the 2016 BRFSS. 6 There were also differences by socioeconomic status . The Capital Region's 2016 age-adjusted adult obes ity rate for individuals with an income less than $25,000/year w as 30.8%, similar to those earning less than $25,00 0 annually in New York Rensselaer Schenectady Saratoga Columbia Greene Percentage of Adults Who are Obese (BMI 30), 2016 4 Prevention Agenda Objective (24.2%) 54 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE Childhood Obesity Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2019-2024 Reduce the percentage of children and adolescents w ho are obese so that the percentage of public school children in New York State (outside N YC) who are obese is reduced to 16.4%. Reduce the percentage of WIC children (ages 2-4) wh o are obese to 13.0%. Highlights Greene, Schenectady, and Columbia counties had the highest child and adolescent obesity rates. Saratoga, Rensselaer, and Albany counties met the P revention Agenda objective. Greene and Columbia counties had the highest percen tage of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children ( WIC) children who were obese; all Capital Region counties had WIC children obesity ra tes higher than the Prevention Agenda objective. The life expectancy of children and adolescents in the United States and New York is significantly red uced due to increasing obesity rates. The prevalence of obesity in the United States has quadrupled since the 1970 s among children aged 6-19 years from 5% to 19%, and doubled from 5% to 10% among preschool children aged 2-5 years. 3 However, between 2004 and 2012, obesity among children 2-5 y ears decreased from 14% to 8.1%. 7 For children and teens ages 2-19, overweight and ob ese are defined differently than for adults. Overwe ight is defined as a BMI at or above the 85 th percentile to below the 95 th percentile and obese is at or above the 95 th percentile on CDC growth charts for children. Additionally, an age- a nd sex-specific percentile is used for BMI rather t han the BMI categories used for adults. Children's body composi tions vary at different ages and vary between boys and girls. 3 55 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE The Student Weight Status Category Report provides information from schools on children and adolescent BMI and weight status. Saratoga, Albany, and Rensselaer cou nties are meeting the Prevention Agenda objective o f 16.4% of children with a BMI at or greater than the 95th per centile. Greene County has the highest prevalence, with 21.4% of students classified as obese. Schenectady, Columbia , and Greene counties showed increases in the perce ntage of children and adolescents who are obese from 2014-20 16 to 2016-2018.8 For preschoolers, obesity data are available for ch ildren aged 2-4 years from low-income families enro lled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants an d Children (WIC). For the Capital Region, Columbia County had the highest obesity rate for these children at 18.6 %, followed by Greene County at 17.8%. No counties in the Capital Region met the Prevention Agenda objective of Schenectady Saratoga Columbia Greene Percentage of Children and Adolescents Who Are Obes e, 2014- 16 and 2016-18 Greene Percentage of Children WIC who are O bese (95th Percentile), 2014-2016 4 Prevention Agenda Objective (13.0%) NYS excl. NYC 56 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE Like with adults, childhood obesity is disproportio nately distributed among lower-income populations. According to the New York State Department of Health, Division of Ch ronic Disease Prevention, public school districts i n the fourth quartile of eligibility for free lunch had obesity rates twice as high as those in the first quartile for eligibility for free lunch. 9 Physical Activity Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2019-2024 Increase the percentage of adult New Yorkers who en gage in some type of leisure time physical activity to at least 77.4%. Highlights Schenectady and Rensselaer counties had the lowest rates of leisure time physical activity, and failed to meet the Prevention Agenda objective. Physical inactivity is a significant factor leading to overweight and obese children and adults. A lac k of physical activity can also lead to many chronic diseases or condition s, including hypertension, heart disease, stroke, t ype 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Physical activity is proven to help m aintain a healthy weight and lower the risk of hear t disease and related risk factors, diabetes, and premature morta lity. It can also help reduce depression and increa se cognitive function in older adults. Staying active provides h ealth benefits in all aspects of life. 10 Adults need at least 2.5 hours a week of moderate-i ntensity aerobic activity (or 75 minutes of vigorou s-intensity aerobic activity) and two or more days of muscle strengthen ing activity a week. Adults 65 and older should fol low the adult guidelines as closely as possible. Children and ado lescents should be physically active at least 60 mi nutes daily, and do aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and bone-strengtheni ng activities at least 3 days a week. 10 There were an estimated 167,787 adults residing in the Capital District who did not engage in any type of leisure time physical activity in the past month. Of the six Cap ital District counties, Rensselaer and Schenectady counties did not meet the Prevention Agenda objective of 77.4% of ad ults engaging in leisure time physical activity. 6 57 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE Sugary Beverages Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2019-2024 Decrease the percentage of adults ages 18 and older who consume one or more sugary beverages per day to 22.0% Highlights Rensselaer and Greene counties had the highest rate s of daily sugary beverage consumption, and failed to meet the Prevention Agenda objective. Sugar-sweetened beverages include drinks such as fr uit juices, soda, sports drinks, and coffee beverag es with sugar. In the United States, half of the population consumes at least one sugary beverage daily. Many people do not realize how many calories they are taking in with sugary drinks , and cutting sugary beverages out of one's diet is an easy way to reduce daily caloric intake. For example, one 12 ou nce serving of cola has 136 calories and a 20 ounce bottle has 227 calories. 11 Since the mid-20 th century, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has increased significantly in the US. Standard soda bottles prior to 1950 were just 6.5 o unces, 1/3 the size of the standard 20 ounce soda b ottles Schenectady Saratoga Columbia Greene Age-Adjusted Percentage of Adults Who Engaged in Le isure Time Physical Activity in the Past 30 Days, 2016 6 Prevention Agenda Objective (77.4%) 58 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE today. 12 In 2001, these drinks made up 9% of the daily calo ric intake for people in the US. Further, caloric i ntake from the consumption of sugary beverages does not create a feeling of being \"full,\" and therefore people us ually do not compensate by eating less. 13 Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has been a ttributed to increased risk of obesity, type 2 diab etes, heart disease, and gout. Studies in children have found t hat replacing sugary beverages with non-caloric opt ions, like water, can improve weight management among children who ar e overweight, and decrease the accumulation of weig ht and fat in normal-weight children. 12 About 147,320 Capital Region adults consume sugary beverages daily. Rensselaer and Greene counties did not meet the Prevention Agenda objective of having less than 22. 0% of adults consuming sugary drinks daily. 6 References 1. New York State Department of Health.

Decrease the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults with an income less than $25,000 to 15.3%. Decrease the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults who report frequent mental distress to 20.1%. Highlights Columbia and Schenectady counties had the highest c urrent smoking rates in the Capital Region, but all counties had rates higher than the Preventi on Agenda objective. All counties, except Albany County, experienced a d ecrease in the percent of adults currently smoking between 2013-2014 and 2016. Low socioeconomic residents, as well as residents w ith poor mental health, had higher smoking rates than the general population. Preventing and reducing tobacco use is a cornerston e of public health. Tobacco use and dependence on t obacco are the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortali ty in New York State and in the country. Cigarette use alone results in an estimated 443,000 deaths each year in the U.S ., including 25,400 deaths in New York State. 1 In addition to its direct impact on people who smok e, smoking negatively affects non-smokers in proxim ity to smokers. Every year, 2,600 New Yorkers die from the effects of second-hand smoke. Secondhand smoke contains hun dreds of toxic and cancer-causing chemicals. The Surgeon Gen eral has stated that there is no safe level of expo sure to secondhand smoke. The United States Environmental P rotection Agency has classified secondhand smoke as a known human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent). 1 There are 389,000 children alive today who will die prematurely from second hand smoke. Many more chil dren exposed to secondhand smoke will suffer from respiratory il lnesses, including bronchitis and pneumonia, asthma , and eye and ear problems. 1 More than half a million New Yorkers currently have a disease caused by smoking, resulting in about $8 .17 billion in health care expenditures annually. Tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure causes heart disease and stroke; chronic lung disease; cancers of the lung, mouth, p harynx, esophagus, and bladders; and other lung and vascular diseases. Tobacco use during pregnancy leads to poo r birth outcomes and increases the chances for sudd en infant death syndrome .1 61 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE In the Capital Region, there were approximately 119 ,161 adult current smokers ages 18 years and older. The prevalence of current smokers was highest in Columbia County, followed by Schenectady and Rensselaer counties. Al l six counties in the Capital Region had higher current smoking ra tes compared to NYS, excluding NYC, with all six co unties also having rates higher than the Prevention Agenda obje ctive of 11.0%. 3 Smoking rates decreased since 2013-2014 in all counties, except Albany County. 2 Capital Region current smoking rates vary by socioe conomic status: 30.5% of individuals with incomes <$25,000 currently smoke, which greatly exceeds the Prevention Agenda objective of 15.3%. All Capital Region counties failed to meet the Prev ention Agenda objective. 2 Additionally, those who report poor mental health a lso have higher rates of smoking. Neither New York State nor the Capital Region met the Prevention Agenda objective of 20.1% smoking prevalence for this population.

According to the New York State Department of Health, the cigarette smoking p revalence in youth increased for the first time since 2000, f rom 4.3% in 2016 to 4.8% in 2018. At the same time, there has been an alarming trend in electronic cigarette use among hi gh school students in NYS. The use of e-cigarettes has increa sed from 10.5% in 2014 to 27.4% in 2018; a 160% inc rease. 4 References 1.

Black non-Hispanics had the highest rates of COPD/C LRD hospitalizations rates in the Capital Region and NYS, excluding NYC. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or ch ronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD), is a lung d isease that makes it harder to breathe over time as the tubes t hat carry air into and out of the lungs are partial ly blocked or damaged. It is a group of diseases and includes emp hysema, chronic bronchitis, or a combination of the se and can coexist with asthma. The severity of COPD/CLRD can vary, but when severe, it can affect the most basic tasks and daily living. 1,2 Early detection of COPD/CLRD might alter its course and progress. A simple spirometry test can detect COPD/CLRD before the symptoms become severe. 1 In the United States, a history of current or former tobacco use is a key factor in the development and progression of COPD/CLRD. Smoking accounts for 8 out of 10 COPD-related deaths. 3 COPD/CLRD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, 1 and the third leading cause of death in all counties in the Capital Region. 4 It is estimated that there are over 16 million people living with COPD in the United States, with millions more suffering from the disease witho ut a diagnosis.2 In addition, COPD/CLRD is an important cause of hospitalization in older populations. 1 In 2016 there were 2,700 hospitalizations due to CO PD/CLRD in the Capital Region. The highest hospital ization rate was in Columbia County with 28.9/10,000.

Highlights Saratoga and Albany counties had the highest adult current asthma prevalence in the Capital Region. Schenectady County had the highest rate of asthma e mergency department visits for all ages in the Capital Region. Schenectady County had the highest rate of asthma e mergency department visits for ages 0-4 years in the Capital Region. Rensselaer County had the highest rate of asthma ho spitalizations for all ages and for ages 0-17 years in the Capital Region. Asthma is a disease that affects the lungs and is c haracterized by difficulty breathing. In most cases the causes of asthma are unknown. Symptoms of asthma include whee zing, tightness in the chest, breathlessness, and c oughing at night or early in the morning. It is one of the mos t common long-term diseases of children, but is pre valent in adults as well. 1 Nationwide, about 6.2 million children, or 8.4% of children, and 19.0 million adults, or 7.7% of adult s, are living with asthma. 2 In New York State, more than 1.1 million adults and 1 in 13 school-aged children have asthma. 3 An asthma attack is a distressing and potentially l ife-threatening experience. When an attack occurs, the sides of the airways in the lungs swell, causing the airways to shrink. As a result, less air is able to able to ge t in and out of the lungs. If poorly treated, asthma can lead to persis tent hospitalization and possibly death. Triggers f or an asthma attack vary from person to person. Some triggers include t obacco smoke, dust mites, outdoor air pollution, co ckroach allergen, pets, mold, and smoke from burning wood or grass. 1 Asthma can interfere with daily activities, especia lly without proper management and treatment. Asthma is the leading cause of missed days of school for children. Parent s are also affected, as they frequently miss days o f work due to their child's asthma. About 1 in 3 adults with asthma als o miss at least one work day per year. 4 67 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE Direct and indirect health care costs due to asthma add up to $56 billion yearly in the United States.4 Adults are less likely than children to receive care when cost is a n issue. Cost also prevents routine doctor visits a nd medicine use, which makes asthma management difficult. 2 Asthma is a major health concern for the Capital Re gion. In the Capital Region, there was an estimated 96,173 adult s living with asthma. Saratoga and Albany counties had the highes t adult current asthma prevalence rates in the Region. 5 In addition, there were nearly 4,000 emergency department (ED) visits due to asthma complications and flare-ups in the Capital Region. All Capital Region counties fell below the New York State Prevention Agenda objective for asthma ED visits (77.7/10,000). The highest rate was in Schenectady County, with a rate of 56.7/10,000.

All Capital Region counties fell below the Prevention Agenda objective of 177.1/10,000. Schenectady, and Albany, counties had rates higher than NYS, excluding NYC.7 Severe asthma attacks and complications may lead to hospitalizations. Hospitalizations usually indicate a lack of properl y managing the condition. A combination of early medical intervent ion and the avoidance of asthma triggers can help to prevent su ch severe flare-ups. All Capital Region counties had hospitalization rat es below the Prevention Agenda objective of 10.3/10,000, as well as the NYS, excluding NYC, rate of 6.3/10,000.

Only Albany and Schenectady counties experienced an increase in adult diabetes prevalence between 2013-2014 and 2016. Rensselaer and Schenectady counties had the highest diabetes mortality rates in the Capital Region. Rensselaer and Schenectady counties had the highest diabetes ED visit rates, and Albany and Greene counties had the highest hospitalization rat es. Rensselaer and Schenectady counties had the highest diabetes short-term complications hospitalization rates. Black non-Hispanic residents had higher diabetes sh ort-term complications hospitalization rates, hospitalization rates, and mortality rates than whi te non-Hispanic residents. Diabetes is a serious public health concern. About 30.3 million people in the United States are estima ted to have diabetes, over 9% of the population. Another 84.1 m illion U.S. adults, one-third of the population, ar e estimated to be at risk of diabetes, commonly referred to as prediabet es. 1 Diabetes is a group of diseases marked by high leve ls of blood glucose resulting from defects in insul in production, insulin action, or both. There are two major type of diabet es: type 1 and type 2. 1 Type 2 diabetes, or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), accounts for about 90% t o 95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes. 2 This type of diabetes has become more prevalent in the United States, particu larly among minorities. Type 2 diabetes, formerly c alled \"adult\" diabetes, is being seen with alarming frequency amo ng children. 1 In 2017, the total cost of diagnosed diabetes in th e US was estimated to be $327 billion, an increase of $82 billion since 2012. Approximately 1 in 7 health care dollars are spent caring for people with diabetes and its compl ications. Medical costs for people with diabetes are 2.3 times higher than those without. 3 Diabetics choosing to make lifestyle changes could significantly reduce their chances of future health complications, as well as their healthcare c osts.

NYC 8.2% 8.5% 72 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE The estimated prevalence of diabetes among adults i n the Capital Region is slightly below that of NYS, exclu ding NYC. An estimated 64,920 adults in the Capital Region have been diagnosed with diabetes. Adults in Albany and Schen ectady counties had the highest prevalence of adult diabet es in 2016, were the only Capital Region counties with a prevalence higher than the NYS, excluding NYC, and were the only coun ties to have in increase in diabetes prevalence from 2013-2014 t o 2016. 4 Short-term complications of diabetes are a result o f extreme fluctuation in blood sugar levels. They i nclude: hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) , diabetic ketoacidosis (high blood sugar with keto nes), hyperglycemic hyperosmolar non-kenotic syndrome (high blood sugar without ketones). 5 In 2016, there were 353 diabetes short-term complic ations hospitalizations for Capital Region resident s 18 years of age and older. The diabetes short-term complications ho spitalization rate for all Capital Region counties, except for Saratoga County, exceeded the NYS, excluding NYC, rate. 6 Diabetes short-term complications had a 2013-2018 P revention Agenda objective of 3.9 per 10,000. Only Saratoga County m et this objective.

Schenectady, Greene and Rensselaer counties do not meet the Prevention Agenda objective for heart atta ck hospitalization rates. Schenectady County had the highest coronary heart d isease hospitalization rate, while Columbia and Greene counties had the highest coronary heart dise ase mortality rates. Schenectady County had the highest congestive heart failure hospitalization and mortality rates. Schenectady County had the highest stroke hospitali zation rate, while Columbia and Schenectady countie s had the highest stroke mortality rates. Black non-Hispanics had higher rates for most of th e cardiovascular indicators compared to White non- Hispanic and Hispanic residents across all Capital Region counties. Cardiovascular disease refers to a group of disease s that affect the heart and the circulatory system. Almost 630,000 Americans die from cardiovascular diseases each yea r, which is 1 in every 4 deaths. Risk factors for c ardiovascular disease include high blood pressure, high low-densi ty lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and smoking, of wh ich 49% of Americans live with at least one of the three. 1 More than one third of the population live with som e form of cardiovascular disease. 2 These diseases take more lives than the next five leading causes of death combined, excluding cancer (cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, injuries, stroke, Alzheimer Disease). 3 In New York State, Cardiovascular disease was responsible for almost 4 0.0% of all statewide mortality. 4 Heart Attack and Coronary Heart Disease Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013-2018 (no obje ctive for 2019-2024) By December 31, 2018, reduce the age-adjusted hospi talization rate for heart attack to 14.0 per 10,000 residents of all ages. Heart disease is the leading cause of death both in the United States and in New York State. 4 Residents of New York State are 22% more likely to die from coronary heart disease than the next leading cause of death.5 Coronary heart disease is a disorder that affects t he coronary arteries (blood vessels that supply blo od to the heart) and the heart muscle. A serious consequence of coronary heart disease is a heart attack, which occurs when the supply of blood to the heart is greatly reduced or stopped du e to blockage in a coronary artery and the heart mu scle is damaged. 6 76 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE It is estimated that in the U.S., 13% of 2016 death s, 363,452 individuals, were attributed to coronary heart disease. 7 Heart attacks occur in approximately 735,000 Americ ans annually. Approximately every 40 seconds, an American will suffer coronary event, and every minute someone wil l die from one. 8 The Capital Region had over 1,700 heart attack hosp italizations in 2016. Schenectady County had the hi ghest heart attack hospitalization rate in the region, with 18. 0/10,000 persons. The Capital Region falls above th e Prevention Agenda objective, as do the counties of Rensselaer, Schenectady, and Greene. 6 In 2016, there were over 2,900 hospitalizations due to coronary heart disease in the Capital Region. All Capital Region counties had CHD hospitalization rates lower than that of New York State excluding NYC, with the exception of Schenectady County. CHD rates have decreased over the past decade for NYS excluding NYC and the Capital Region counties. 10 Age-Adjusted Coronary Heart Disease Hospitalization Rate per 10,000, 2016 10 NYS excl.

Only for Saratoga County was the CHD hospitalization rate for Black non-Hispanics lower than that of Hispanics and White non-Hispanics. Black non- Hispanics had the highest rate of CHD of the three race/ethnicity groups across all counties, with the exception of Rensselaer and Saratoga counties. 11 In 2016, there were over 1,335 deaths due to corona ry heart disease in the Capital Region. All Capital Region counties had CHD mortality rates lower than that of New York State excluding NYC, wi th the exception of Columbia and Greene counties. 12 Congestive Heart Failure Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a specific catego ry of cardiovascular disease (CVD), as are coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease (stroke). 4 In contrast, unlike the prior two diseases, CHF is not one of the leading causes of death in the state; however, it is one of the fastest growing subgroups of CVD, making it a cause for concern and attention. CHF affects about 5.7 million people wit hin the United States. It is a contributing cause o f one in nine deaths yearly, and approximately half of individuals who d evelop heart failure die within 5 years of diagnosi s. 13 CHF accounts for 9% of all coronary deaths in the United States.7 CHF is a disorder where the heart loses its ability to pump blood efficiently, causing fatigue and sho rtness of breath. CHF is not a single disease, but the result of diff erent types of heart and artery diseases, including Coronary Artery Disease, Heart Attacks, Cardiomyopathy, High Blood Pressure, Irregular Heart Valves, Abnormal Heart Rh ythms, and Blood Clots. 13 The most common causes of congestive heart failure are Coronary Artery Disease, High Blood Pressure and Diabetes.

Of the Capital Region counties, Schenectady County had the highest rate of congestive heart failure hospitalizations, with 21.7/10,000. Only Albany and Saratoga counties had rates lower than New York State excluding NYC. 14 Over 260 deaths occurred due to congestive heart failure in 2016 in the Capital Region, with mortality rate lower than New York State exclu ding NYC. Schenectady County has the highest rate in the Capi tal Region with 21.8/100,000. 15 When comparing race/ethnicity across the Capital Re gion, White non - Hispanics generally had higher rates of congestive heart failure mortality than Black non-Hispanics and Hispanics. T he black non- Hispanic rate was greatest in Rensselaer County, wh ereas the Hispanic rate was greatest in Columbia and Schenectady count ies. 16 Cerebrovascular Disease Cerebrovascular disease, or stroke, is the fifth le ading cause of death in the United State and is a m ajor cause of adult disability. According to the Centers for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention (CDC), each year 140,000 Ameri cans are killed by stroke. In the United States, someone has a stroke every forty seconds and dies from a stroke every fo ur minutes. 17 Stroke occurs when a blood vessel, which brings oxy gen and nutrients to the brain, bursts or is blocke d by a blood clot or some other particle. With this rupture or blocka ge, part of the brain does not get the blood and ox ygen it needs. Deprived of oxygen, nerve cells in the affected are a of the brain die within minutes. 17 Some risk factors for stroke are uncontrollable, su ch as heredity, age, gender, and ethnicity. Other c onditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart diseas e, diabetes, smoking, being overweight or obese, an d previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, can increase your ris k of stroke. 17 Age-Adjusted Congestive Heart Failure Mortality Rate per 100,000, 2014-2016 15 NYS excl.

The Capital Region's stroke hospita lization rate was higher than New York State excluding NYC. With the exception of Columbia and Saratoga counties, the Capital Region counties had hospitalization rates higher than NYS excluding NYC . 18 There were over 380 deaths due to stroke in 2016 in the Capital Region, which had a mortality rate similar to NYS excluding NYC. Rensselaer, Schenectady and Columbia counties had cerebrovascular mortality rates higher than NYS excluding NYC and the Capital Region. 19 When comparing cerebrovascular mortality by race/ethnicity, Black non-Hispanics had higher rates in Rensselaer and Schenectady counties as compared to the rates for White non- Hispanics and Hispanics. In Columbia, Saratoga and Greene counties, Hispanic rates were the greatest, and in Albany, the rate of stroke mortality for whites was the greatest. 20 References 1.

The Capital Region had higher breast cancer inciden ce, and late stage incidence rates compared to NYS, excluding NYC. Albany and Schenectady counties had the highest lat e stage breast cancer incidence, as well as breast cancer mortality in the Capital Region. Black non-Hispanic women had higher last stage brea st cancer incidence than White non- Hispanic or Hispanic residents. Greene, Columbia and Albany counties had the lowest cervical cancer screening rates, falling below the screening rates for NYS, excluding NYC. Greene County had the lowest colorectal screening r ate in the Capital Region; all other counties having rates above NYS, excluding NYC, but none mee ting the Prevention Agenda objective. Compared to NYS, excluding NYC, the Capital Region had lower colorectal cancer incidence, but higher mortality rates, with Rensselaer, Columb ia and Greene counties having the highest incidence and mortality rates. All Capital Region counties had lower prostate canc er incidence rates, and all but Rensselaer had lower mortality rates than NYS, excluding NYC. The Capital Region had higher lung cancer mortality rates than NYS, excluding NYC, with Greene and Rensselaer counties having the highest i ncidence and mortality rates in the Capital Region. Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells in the body grow out of control. It can be caused by many different factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and the environment. C ancer is the second leading cause of death in New Y ork State, as well as in the Capital Region. Each year, about 110,000 New Yorkers are diagnosed with cancer and over 35, 000 New Yorkers die from malignant cancers each year. Lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers account fo r the majority of cancers in New York and nationally. 1 Many cancer deaths are preventable through early de tection. For several types of cancer, detection at an early stage significantly increases the options for treatment a nd its overall success. \"Early stage\" is defined as identifying invasive cancers before they have spread from the tissue of origin. Cancer screening helps to identify cancers at an early stage before the onset of clinical symptoms. 1 In general, gender and race are important factors i n the frequency of different types of cancers. At a ll ages, women have lower cancer incidence and mortality rates than men in the same age group. This gender difference has remained stable over time in New York State. 1 82 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE Female Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States, exceeded o nly by lung cancer. All women are at risk for breast cancer. M en can also get breast cancer, but this is rare. In New York State, about 15,400 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. 1 Behavioral risk factors amenable to change include obesity after menopause, heavy consumption of alcoh ol and, possibly, high-fat diets and lack of exercise. Rep roductive factors, including having a first child a fter age 30 and never having children, increase the risk of breast cancer . These identified risk factors, however, do not e xplain the high frequency of the disease in the population. 2 Around 80% of breast cancer cases occur in women ov er the age of 50. Women who have regular mammograms beginning at age 50 can reduce the risk of dying fr om breast cancer by nearly 30%. Screening for breas t cancer allows early identification and treatment and is the prima ry way of reducing mortality. It is recommended tha t all women perform monthly self-breast exams and have routine clinical breast exams. 3 The most recent screening guidelines in New York State recommend women between the ages of 50 and 74 receive a screening mammogram every two years. Wom en at a higher risk of breast cancer may need to begin scre ening earlier. 4 In 2016, 80.4% of women ages 50-74 and older in the Capital Region reported having had a mammogram wit hin the past two years which was slightly higher than the N YS, excluding NYC, rate of 79.2%. Only Albany, Columbia and Greene counties had higher screening rates than NYS, exclu ding NYC. Rensselaer and Saratoga counties had the lowest breast cancer screening rates in the Capital Region. 5 The fatality of invasive breast cancer is strongly influenced by the stage of the disease at diagnosis . Early detection of breast cancer plays a significant role in the reduc tion of breast cancer mortality. When breast cancer is Schenectady Saratoga Columbia Greene Percent of Women Aged 50-74 Receiving Breast Cancer Screening Based on Recent Guidelines, 2016 5 83 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE early, or localized, stage, 98.7% of women survive for at least five yea rs.

The strongest risk factor is unsafe sexual practices, including having multiple partners and having a history of sexually transmitted diseases. Smoking, giving birth to three or more children, an d using birth control for five or more years are also risk factors. 7 The Pap test (or Pap smear) is an effective screeni ng test that can detect cervical cell abnormalities that, without treatment , could lead to cancer. This test can detect cervical cancer in situ , an early stage of cervical cancer, where the cells are changing in shape and o rganization but are still localized and have not spread. Pap tests are recommended every three years for women ages 21-65. In New York State , the cervical screening recommendation is that women should start getting Pap tests at the age of 21 and have them every 3 years, more frequently if there is an abnormal finding, and Pap tests and HPV tests every five years between the ages of 30 and 65. 8 During 2016, the percentage of women 21 years of ag e and older, having a Pap test within the past three years in th e Capital Region is the same as the percentage in NYS, excluding NYC.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer i n men and women. It is also the second leading caus e of death from cancers that affect both men and women. 9 Each year, about 9,100 adults in New York State ar e diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and 90% of them are over age 50.1 Routine screening can reduce colorectal cancer dea ths by at least 60%. 9 When colorectal cancer is diagnosed in its earlies t stage, 90.4% of individuals live five years after diagnosis. In comparison, for late stage diagnosis the five year survival rate dramatically decreases to 14.0%. 10 Lifestyle factors that contribute to increased risk of colorectal cancer include lack of regular physi cal activity, low fruit and vegetable intake, a low-fiber and high-fat diet , overweight and obesity, alcohol consumption and t obacco use. 10 Colorectal cancer screening is recommended for men and women aged 50-75 using high-sensitivity fecal o ccult blood testing (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy. 11 During 2016, no Capital Region County met the Prev ention Agenda objective. 12 Of the Capital Region counties, only Greene County had a colorectal cancer screening rate lower than a Colorectal Canc er Screening Ages 50-75 years, 2016 12 Prevention Agenda Objective 80.0%) 86 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE V CHRONIC DISEASE Colorectal cancer incidence is slightly lower in th e Capital Region than NYS, excluding NYC, with the Region averaging 460 cases per year.

In New York State, around 14,300 men are diagnosed wit h prostate cancer annually and there are about 1,70 0 deaths due to prostate cancer each year. 1 The causes and risk factors for prostate cancer are not well understood. The chance of having prostate cancer greatly increa ses after age 50. Black men are over twice as likely to have prostate cancer, be diagnosed at a late state, and die of prostate canc er as White males. A family history of prostate cancer also increases th e risk of getting the disease. 13 The Capital Region averages 650 cases of prostate c ancer annually. All Capital Region counties had age -adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates below the NYS, excl uding NYC, average, with Saratoga County having the highest rate. 5 There were an average of 78 prostate cancer deaths per year in the Capital Region from 2013-2015.

Healthy and Safe Environment Childhood Lead Poisoning Highlights I n the Capital Region, 2,600 children born in 2013 did not have one lead screening by 9- 17 months of age and 4,100 children born in 2013 did not have two lead screenings by 36 months of age. All counties had increases in their 9-17 month screening rates from 2010 to 2013. Schenectady County had the highest incidence rate of elevated blood lead levels in children under 6 years of age. With the exception of Saratoga County, all Capital Region counties had incidence rates of elevated blood lead levels higher than NYS, excluding NYC. Lead poisoning is a completely preventable public hea lth problem. Lead is a heavy metal that was used in many products and materials before the risk to young children was identified.1 For example, paint containing lead was used in m any houses built before 1978.2 Products that can be hazardous still remain. Lead is also found in air, water, soil, or d ust. Lead poisoning leads to serious adverse health, developmental, and cognitive outcomes that can affect individuals throughout their lives.1 Lead Screening Lead poisoning often occurs with no obvious symptoms. Therefore, it is important to screen children for elevated blood l ead levels before they are harmed. Screening is performed by physicians using a blood draw or a finger prick. In New York State, healthcare providers are required to obtain a blood test on all children at 1 and 2 years of age. In addition, children age 6 months to 6 years are required to be assessed annually as a part of routine care, with a blood lead level obtained for any child with an increased risk of exposure. Early identification of lead exposure can prevent harm and minimize further exposures.1 I n the Capital Region, 2,591 children born in 2013 did not have at least one lead screening test done by the age of 9-17 months, and 4,103 did not have two lead screenings by 36 months.3,4 Saratoga and S chenectady counties were the only Capital Region counties with 9-17 month lead screening percentages above the NYS, excluding NYC, percentage of 71.7%. Columbia County had the lowest rate of all the counties at 52.3%.3 Albany, C olumbia, and Greene counties had rates below that of NYS, excluding NYC, for children with two lead screenings by 36 months. Columbia County had the lowest rate in the Capital Region at 38.6%.4 When comparing the 2 010 and 2013 birth cohorts, all counties had increases in the percentage of 9-17 month-olds that received at least one lead screening: Albany (51.0% to 70.3%), to 52.3%), and Greene County (27.5% to 70.3%).3Percentage of Children Born in 2013 with At Least One Lead Screening by 9-17 months, or 2 Lead Screenings by 36 months 3,4 9-17 Months Up to 36 Months NYS excl.

In 2008, more than 3,000 children under age six we re newly identified with blood lead levels (BLLs) 10 micrograms per dec iliter (\u00b5g/dl) and above; 80 percent resided in jus t 13 of the states' poorest counties with the oldest housing stock. 5 New York State consistently ranks high in many of t he factors associated with childhood lead poisoning , such as childhood poverty, large immigrant populations, and an older, deteriorated housing stock. The main cau se of lead poisoning among children is exposure to paint chips and dust from degrading lead-based paint in their homes. 5 Annually, an average of 152 children under the age of six living in the Capital Region have confirmed blood lead levels at or above 10\u00b5g/dl. Schenectady County had the highest incidence rate of elevated blood lead levels with 14.9/1,000 children tested, followed by Albany County with a rate of 13.4/1,000 children tested. Of the Capital Region counties, only Saratoga County had a rate lower than NYS, excluding NYC.6 References 1.

New York State Prevention Agenda 2013-2018 (no obje ctive from 2019-2024) Reduce ED visits due to falls among children ages 1 to 4 to 429.1 per 10,000 residents. Falls in Young Children The primary location of falls for children is in th e home. Falls are the leading cause of injury-relat ed hospitalizations and ED visits for children up to 14 years of age. 4 In the United States emergency departments, approxi mately 8,000 children are treated daily, amounting to almost 2.8 million children annually. 5 Rapid early development provides various opportunities for children to fall. Babies and youn g children have bigger heads in comparison to the r est of their bodies, causing the head to hit the ground first. This incr eases the likelihood of head trauma due to falls. W hen babies start to roll and kick, they are at increased risk of fallin g off high surfaces. Similarly, when children learn to crawl and walk, they increase their chances of falling out of windows an d off furniture. Injury due to falls can lead to permanent disabilit y, traumatic stress, and decreased ability to perform age-appropriate activities, among other things. 4 Age-Adjusted Motor Vehicle Accident Hospitalization s per 10,000, 2014-2016 3 ED Visits Hospitalizations NYS excl.

Rensselaer County had the highest ED visit rate, followed by Albany and Schenectady counties. Falls in Older Adults Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among older adults and the most common cause of nonfatal injuries and hospital admissions for trauma. Due to falls, 140 o lder New Yorkers are hospitalized daily, with two d eaths every day in the same population. Approximately 60% of those hos pitalized for a fall end up in a nursing home or re habilitation center. Such falls incur $1.7 billion in annual hos pitalization charges in New York State. 7 Unintentional falls are a serious threat to the liv es, independence and well-being of adults ages 65 a nd older. Each year in the United States, 3 million older adults visit the ER due to falls. These falls can cause injuries such as fractures, bruises, and head traumas, which can increase the r isk of early death and make it difficult to live in dependently. Falls are also the most common cause of traumatic brain i njury (TBI). TBI accounts for almost half of fatal falls among older adults. Hip fractures are the most frequent type of fall-related fractures. Developing a fear of falli ng is common among people who fall, even among those who are not injur ed. This fear causes them to limit activities. Such a response leads to reduced mobility, which actually increases their risk of falling. 8 408.5 307.3 351.9 441.3 311.7 191.1 202.0 210.8 050 100 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 NYS excl.

Reduce the rate of assault-related hospitalizations to 3.0 per 10,000 Reduce the rate of ED visits due at assault to 38.1 per 10,000. Highlights In the Capital Region, Schenectady County had the h ighest rate of homicide mortality; Schenectady and Rensselaer were the only counties n ot to meet the Prevention Agenda objective. Schenectady County had the highest assault ED visit rate in the Region, with Saratoga County being the only Capital Region county that met the P revention Agenda objective. Albany County had the highest assault hospitalizati on rate, and, together with Schenectady and Greene counties, did not meet the Prevention Agenda objective. Black non-Hispanics were 5 times more likely to hav e an assault-related hospitalization than White non-Hispanics. In the Capital Region, the urban counties had highe r violent crime rates than NYC excluding NYC. Schenectady County had the highest rates of firearm -related, property and violent crimes, while Saratoga County had the lowest firearm-relate d and violent crime, and Greene County had the lowest property crime. Although crime is usually considered to be in the d omain of law enforcement and the criminal justice s ystem, there is a growing realization that violent crime is a public health concern as well. Not only does crime comprom ise physical safety, but it can also affect mental health. Crime , vandalism, and graffiti, among other things lead to a decrease in physical activity and an increase in accumulated st ress and fear within the community. Residents of hi gh-crime areas who do not practice healthy behaviors are at higher risk for chronic disease and disability. Continuin g stress may exacerbate hypertension, contribute to obesity, and increase the prevalence of other chronic condition s such as upper respiratory illness and asthma. 1 The health consequences of violent crime on the vic tim are better-documented. Victims of violence are more likely to injure themselves or commit suicide. High school st udents who are exposed to violence are at higher ri sk of running away from home, dropping out of school, having a ch ild, and encountering the criminal justice system i n later adolescence .2 Age-Adjusted Homicide Mortality Rate per 100,000 Population, 2014-2016 3 101 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE VI HEALTHY AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT In 2016, there were 16 homicide deaths in the Capit al Region. Schenectady County had the highest rate of homicide mortality in the Capital Region, with 4.2 per 100,000 population. Sc henectady, and Rensselaer counties had higher rates than that of N YS excluding NYC, and failed to meet the 2019-2024 Prevention Agenda objsective.3 In 2016, the Capital Region had 3,544 assault-relat ed ED visits and 267 assault-related hospitalizatio ns. For hospitalizations, Albany, Schenectady and Greene co unties had a higher rate than the Prevention Agenda objective. The highest hospitalization rate was in Albany County, with a rate of 4.1/10,000. For ED visits, only Sara toga County met the Prevention Agenda objective.

Violent crimes include offenses th at involve face-to-face confrontation between the vict im and the perpetrator, including homicide, non-neglig ent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravate d assault. Firearm-related crimes are defined as thos e that include the presence of a firearm during the commission of a murder, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault. Property crimes include burglar y, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. For firearm-relat ed crime, property crime and violent crime, Schenec tady County consistently has the highest rates of the Capital R egion, and are all higher than the rates for NYS ex cluding NYC.

In the Capital Region, only 19.3% of employed worke rs used alternative modes of transportation. All Capital Region counties failed to meet the Prev ention Agenda objective for use of alternative modes of transportation. Over 115,000 (30%) of Capital Region occupied housi ng units were considered substandard. Greene had the largest percentage (35.8%, n=6,300), while Albany had the largest number (n=38,700, 31.3%) of substandard housing units in t he Capital Region. All Capital Region county met the \"low access to su permarket\" Prevention Agenda objective. The highest percentage of low-income residents with low access to supermarkets was in Greene County. Climate Smart Communities Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2019-2024 By December 31, 2024, increase the proportion of pe ople who live in a certified Climate Smart Community to 37.0%. Communities across New York State are encouraged to protect health in the presence of climate change b y participating in New York's Climate Smart Communities (CSC). The Program provides local governments with guidance on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save taxpayer doll ars, and advance local goals for health and safety, economic strength, energy independence, and quality of life. 1 All communities in New York State can register to b ecome a CSC by taking the CSC pledge, and documenting a suite of a ctions that mitigate and adapt to climate change at the local level. 2 The Capital Region's percentage of population livin g in CSC of 67.4% is higher than both NYS, excludin g NYC, and the Prevention Agenda objection. Only Saratoga and Gree ne counties did not meet the Prevention Agenda obje ctive. 3 105 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE VI HEALTHY AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT Alternate Modes of Transportation Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2019-2024 By December 31, 2024, increase the proportion of pe ople who commute using alternate modes of transportation, i.e., public transportation, car pool, bike/walk, and telecommute to 47.8%. Public transit provides many health benefits, but n ot enough people take advantage of the alternative modes of transportation. While people who use alternative mo des of transportation are more likely to stay fit, less than half of Americans achieve this goal. This sedentary lifesty le contributes to many health problems such as less active individuals having a 30-50 percent greater risk of developing h igh blood pressure. 4 61.6 67.4 100.0 Schenectady Sar atoga Columbia Greene Percent of Population that Live in a Certified Smar t Community, 2017 3 Prevention Agenda Objective (37.0%) NYS excl.

Their goal is to improve the design and infrastructure of the env ironment in order to promote healthy lifestyles and sustainabil ity. An important part of this effort is to increase the pe rcentage of commuters who use alternative modes of transportati on. Only 22.9% of the population in NYS, excluding NYC, uses alternative modes of transportation. In the Capital Region, onl y 19.3% of employed workers used alternative modes of transpor tation. The highest rate was in Columbia County (22.4%), wh ile the lowest rate was in Greene County, (16.6%). All Capi tal Region counties fall below the Prevention Agenda's objecti ve. 5 Substandard Housing Most Americans spend about 90% of their time indoor s, and about 2/3 of that time at home. Substandard housing conditions may expose residents to lead paint that can lead to lead poisoning, and indoor allergens, s uch as mold or dust, that can lead to or exacerbate asthma. Housin g is also a major expense, the largest single month ly expense for many individuals. Cost-burdened households often ne ed to make choices as how best to utilize limited r esources (e.g. food, clothing, housing, medical care) which constr ains their ability to address indoor health risks. Overcrowded housing often leads to stress and increased exposure to dis ease. 6 In NYS, there were over 3 million substandard housi ng units or 41.9% of all housing units. To be consi dered substandard, the housing unit must have one of the following conditions: lacking complete plumbing fac ilities; lacking complete kitchen facilities; 1.01+ occupants per ro om; housing costs > 30% of household income. 6 Over 115,000 (30%) of Capital Region occupied housi ng units were considered substandard. Greene had th e largest percentage (35.8%, n=6,300), while Albany had the l argest number (n=38,700, 31.3%) of substandard hous ing units in the Capital Region. 6 Percentage of employed civilian workers age 16 and over who use alternative modes of transportation to work or work from home, 2012-2016 5 Prevention Agenda Objective 47.8 NYS excl.

A series of studies throughout the United States ha s found a direct correlation between access to supe rmarkets and the rate of obesity in the population. Residents with a ccess to supermarkets or stores with healthy afford able food tend to eat more healthily than those who are not in close proximity to these stores. For example, one study f ound that for every additional supermarket in a census tract, Bla cks increased their produce consumption by 32% and Whites increased their produce consumption by 11%. At the same time, those living in food deserts, or people without easy access to supermarkets, eat much fewer fruits and v egetables than their counterparts in close proximit y to affordable healthy food. Access to supermarkets is associated with an increase in healthier eating and a decrease in obesity and diet-related diseases. A combination of a lack of s upermarkets, a lack of affordable healthy food opti ons in local stores, an abundance of convenience stores that sell highly -processed food, and a lack of transportation produ ces the opposite effect- an unhealthy and obese nation. 7 41.9 30.7 31.3 31.3 32.5 26.6 32.5 6108 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE VI HEALTHY AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT In Albany County, Hosler et al demonstrated that urban minority communities have less access to supermarkets than rural communities do in the Capital Region. The lack of supermarkets leads to more barriers to fresh fruits and vegetables In addition, more than 80% of minorities live in an area without a store that sells low fat milk and high fiber bread.8 Of all of the Capital Region counties, Greene County had the highest percentage of low income residents with l ow access to supermarkets, with a rate of 6.22%.. All counties in the Capital Region have rates higher than the Prevention Agenda objective. Improving access to affordable nutritious food involves the entire community. Tax and zoning laws can make it easier for grocery stores, community gardens, and farmer's markets to operate in target areas. Governments can also regulate the nutritious standards of foods brought with government funding and increase enrollment in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs. Public transportation can be planned or rerouted to improve access to supermarkets. Additionally, residents and community leaders can plant community gardens and establish programs that provide heathy food to those in need. 3.934. 71 4.71 Sarat oga Columbia GreenePercentage of Low Income Residents with Low Access to Supermarket, 2015 9 Prevention Agenda Objective (2.24%)NYS excl.

Highlights All Capital Region counties, except Rensselaer County, fall below the Prevention Agenda objective for fluoridation of community water sources. Fluoride in water has continuously proven to be effective in preventing tooth decay. Drinking water with a fluoridation level of 0.7 to 1.2 ppm can reduce tooth decay by 25% over a person's lifetime. Since tap water is accessible to all parts of the population, this system has been a very cost-effective way of reducing cavities across the public spectrum.1 The percentage of people receiving fluoridated water in the United States steadily rose from 57.4% in the early 2000s to 74.4% in 2014.2 The New York State Department of Health notes that the percentage of New York residents receiving fluoridated water in 2017 was 70.8%. Only 38.3% of Capital Region residents had access to fluoridated water. With the exception of Rensselaer County, all Capital Region counties fall below the New York State's Prevention Agenda objective of 78.5%.3 Columbia County provides the least amount of fluorid ated water in the Capital Region, with a percentage of 0.0%.

Healthy Women, Infants, and Children Prenatal Care Highlights Columbia County had the lowest percentage of births receiving prenatal care during the first trimester, while Albany County had the highest rate of late (3rd trimester) or no prenatal care in the Capital Region. Across the Capital Region, Black non-Hispanic mothers and Hispanic mothers had lower percentages of births which received early prenatal care (first trimester) and adequate prenatal care. The Capital Region's high risk neighborhoods had 1.1 to 2.0 times higher rates of late or no prenatal care compared to NYS, excluding NYC. Prenatal care improves the likelihood of both a healthier mother and a healthier baby. Comprehensive prenatal care not only includes routine ultrasounds and screening for health conditions the mother may develop, but also focuses on improving nutrition and health habits. It can also provide psychological and social support to assist in quitting smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy.1 The Prevention Agenda aims to promote pre-conception health care, emphasizing screening and risk assessment. As many health factors can affect birth outcomes, women of reproductive age should maintain regular preventive care. Inquiry into exposure to environmental toxins, medication use, nutrition, folic acid intake, weight management, genetic conditions and family history should be made as well in order to address them prior to conception. These inquiries and regular monitoring of health, may help to reduce disparities across racial and ethnic groups and also to prevent negative birth outcomes.2 In 2016, there were 2,151 births without early prenatal care, or prenatal care received in the first trimester in the Capital Region. For 2014-2016, Albany, Rensselaer, Columbia and Greene counties had lower percentages of early prenatal care than NYS, excluding NYC, with Columbia County having the lowest rate. Approximately 445 Capital Region births had late (3rd trimester) or no prenatal care. Only Saratoga and Columbia counties had late or no prenatal care rates which were better than NYS excluding NYC, with Albany County having the highest percentage of births with late or no prenatal care. 3 Percentage of Births with Prenatal Care 2014-2016 3 Early (1st trimester) Late (3rd trimester) or No NYS excl.

This is determined by the month of pregnancy when prenatal care began and the number of prenatal care visits. Women who attend 80% or greater of the recommended number of visits are considered to have received adequate prenatal care.4 In the Capital Region, there were 1.970 births to women who did not receive adequate prenatal c are.

Black non-Hispanic mothers had the highest percentage of pre-term birth and low birth weight rates in comparison to both White non-Hispanic and Hispanic mothers. Medicaid-insured mothers had higher preterm birth rates than Non-Medicaid mothers did in Albany, Rensselaer and Schenectady counties. Only Saratoga and Columbia counties had low birth weight rates lower than NYS, excluding NYC; Rensselaer County had the highest rate of low birth weight in the Capital Region. Schenectady had the highest infant mortality rate. Only Saratoga and Columbia counties had infant mortality rates lower than NYS, excluding NYC; both met the Prevention Agenda objective for infant mortality. Preterm Births Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2019- 2024 By December 31, 2024, reduce the rate of preterm birth in New York State to 8.3%. Preterm births are those that occur any time before 37 weeks of gestation. Although the direct causes are still uncertain, there are known risk factors. Smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, late or no prenatal care, certain gum diseases, vaginal infections, high blood pressure, diabetes, being overweight or underweight, and short spacing between pregnancies can all contribute to preterm births. Additionally, having a prior preterm birth significantly increases the risk of a preterm delivery.1 Preterm Birth is the leading cause of infant death in the United States and is a leading cause of long-term neurological problems in children. The final weeks of pregnancy are vital; this is when the baby's organ systems develop to maturity. Infants born preterm may exhibit cerebral palsy, vision and hearing impairment, and developmental delays. Earlier delivery results in a higher risk for infant death or severe disability. 1 There were 884 preterm births in the Capital Region in 2016. Overall the Capital Region had a slightly lower prematurity rate than NYS, excluding NYC. For 2014-2016, Schenectady, Rensselaer and Greene counties had the highest prematurity rates in the Capital Region. Only Saratoga and Columbia counties currently meet the Prevention Agenda objective of 8.3% preterm births. 117 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE VII HEALTHY WOMEN, INFANTS, CHILDREN I n the Capital Region, Black non- Hispanic mothers had the highest percentages of preterm births in comparison to both White non- Hispanic and Hispanic mothers.

Low Birth Weight Births Low birth weight is a term used to describe infants weighing less than 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds) at birth. Low birth weight is a major cause of infant mortality a nd long term disability. 5 Risk factors associated with low birth weight are extremes of maternal age, poor nutrition, inade quate prenatal care, cigarette smoking, drug abuse, history of having a low birth weight baby, infections such as cytomeg alovirus, low socio-economic background, low educat ional background and preterm labor. 5 The Capital Region had 750 low birth weight births in 2016 and its low birth weight rate was slightly lower than NYS, excluding NYC.

Infant Mortality has long been considered an indicator of a community's health status. Causes of infant mortality in the United States include respiratory distress and other disorders due to low birth weight and preterm birth. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), unintentional injury, birth defects, preterm labor, pregnancy complications, and injuries are other causes of infant mortality. 6 Infant mortality is reduced when pregnant women make healthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking cessation and avoidance of other harmful substances, maintenance of a nutritious diet and obtaining early prenatal care. These choices are more common among pregnant women in a community that likewise chooses healthy lifestyles. Infant mortality is reduced in communities that have neonatal specialty care for sick newborns and access to comprehensive pediatric care. This specialized medical care commonly occurs in communities that have comprehensive medical care in general. Infant mortality therefore varies among communities in as much as lifestyles, preventive services and medical care varies.6 5.05.9 5.86.99.1 3.35.2 Saratoga Columbia GreeneInfant Mortality Rate per 1,000 Births, 2014-2016 2 Prevention Agenda Objective (4.0/1,000)NYS excl.

Medicaid mothers had 1.7-2.3 times the unintended p regnancies compared to non-Medicaid mothers. Unintended pregnancies are pregnancies that were mi stimed or unwanted at the time of conception. Unint ended pregnancies are due to inconsistent or incorrect us e of contraceptive methods or the lack of their use at all. Women may not be in optimal health for childbearing when they unexpectedly become pregnant, and they are more li kely to delay early prenatal care. The rate of infant mortality, maternal mortality, and sudden infant death syndrom e (SIDS) is much higher in live births resulting from unintended pre gnancies than from intended ones. relationship prob lems, and score lower on verbal assessments and overall grade point -averages. 2 Additionally, unintended pregnancies in women over age 40 pose unique health concerns as they are more susceptible to complications arising during pregna ncy, such as gestational diabetes and hypertension.

H ighlights All counties in the Capital Region fall below the Prevention Agenda Objective for adolescent pregnancy rates. Schenectady County had the highest rate in the Region at 21.5/1,000. Schenectady County had the highest rates of adolescent pregnancy for White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic adolescents. Albany County had the highest Black non-Hispanic/White non-Hispanic (5.7) teen pregnancy ratio, while Columbia had the highest Hispanic/White non-Hispanic ratio (13.2) in the Capital Region.. I nfants born to adolescent mothers (ages 15-17 years) are at higher risk of low birth weight, neonatal mortality, preterm births, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) compared to infants born to mothers in their twenties and thirties. Teen motherhood also reduces a woman's education and employment opportunities.1 The New York State Prevention Agenda for 2013-2018 focused on teen pregnancies rather than births to teen mothers. Four out of five pregnancies among women ages 19 and younger were unintended and 3 in 10 girls become pregnant before the age of 20. Children born to single teen mothers are more likely to have behavioral and emotional problems, poorer physical health, and more likely to use tobacco and alcohol. Adolescent parents are more likely to have economic instability, less educational attainment and more likely to live in poverty.1 There were 191 teen pregnancies to Capital Region teens 15-17 years of age in 2016. The Capital Region rate of 11.2/1,000 was higher than the NYS, excluding NYC, rate of 9.9. All counties in the Capital Region fall below the Prevention Agenda Objective rate of 25.6.

Emerging evidence shows that spacing between births affects health outcomes of the mother and the baby . A shortened birth interval, defined as the time between the las t birth and the birth of the next child, is associa ted with an increased risk to the second infant and mother during the sec ond pregnancy. Adverse outcome such as miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, low birth weight, stillborn, and mat ernal death are much more common in pregnancies and births occurring within 24 months of a previous pregnancy.1 Other complications may include placenta previa and placental abruption. 2 It is possible that short intervals between pregna ncies, those less than 24 months, do not allow the mother's body enough time to recover from the first birth. A dditionally, the mother's nutrients may be depleted , leading to insufficient folate and iron during conception and pregnancy. Along with other physiological stresses, this can cause neural tube defects, preterm birth and low birth we ight. Adverse health outcomes after a short birth i nterval may also be related to the population this indicator affects ; behavioral and social factors such as inadequate use of medical care, socioeconomic status, and unstable lifestyles may d etermine health outcomes as well. 1 Highlights All Capital Region counties were above the Preventi on Agenda objective for percentage of live births occurring within 24 months of a previous pre gnancy; Saratoga and Schenectady counties had the highest rates of short pregnancy intervals. 129 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE VII HEALTHY WOMEN, INFANTS, CHILDREN In the Capital Region during 2013, over 2,100 birth s occurred within 24 months of pregnancy, for a rat e of 21.7%.

Schenectady County had the lowest percentage of exc lusive breastfeeding in the hospital in the Capital Region. There is a significant racial/ethnic disparity in w hich Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic infants have lower percentages of exclusive breastfeeding w hen compared to White non-Hispanic infants. Medicaid mothers had lower breastfeeding rates comp ared to Non-Medicaid mothers. All Capital Region counties had lower rates of WIC mother breastfeeding compared to NYS, excluding NYC, and fell below the Prevention Agenda objective of 45.5%. Breastfeeding is the healthiest way to feed a baby. A mother's milk provides vital vitamins and nutrie nts for the baby, supporting the developing brain and boosting the im mune system. Additionally, breastfed babies are les s likely to develop diseases and infections, such as diabetes, asthma, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), childh ood obesity and allergies. Breast milk protects the infant against a growing list of chronic diseases, including cardi ovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Since breast milk is easier t o digest than formula, it also causes less vomiting and diarrhea. Automatically adjusting to the baby's changing need s and eliminating the use of bottles, breastfeeding may be more convenient for the mother as well. Breastfeeding st rengthens the bond between mother and baby and may help prevent certain cancers, depression, and osteoporosis in th e mother. 1 The positive economic impact of exclusive breastfee ding is well documented. In addition to families sa ving $1,200- $1,500 in formula expenses in the first year, healt hier babies and mothers put less financial stress o n insurance companies and workplaces. If 90% of mothers breastf ed exclusively for six months, the United States wo uld save $13 million annually in medical and other expenses. 2 New York State Prevention Agenda 2019-2024 By December 31, 2024, increase the percentage of in fants born in New York State who are exclusively breastfed in the hospital to 51 .7%. By December 31, 2024, increase the percentage of in fants enrolled in WIC who are breastfed at 6 months to 45.5% among all WIC infant s. 131 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE VII HEALTHY WOMEN, INFANTS, CHILDREN In the Capital Region, there were almost 5,500 infa nts exclusively breastfed in the hospital in 2016. 3 The New York State Department of Health's goal is to increase the numb er of babies who are exclusively breastfed in the h ospital to 51.7%. 4 Hospitals that promote exclusive breastfeeding help both mother and baby more easily transition to ful l time breastfeeding. All counties in the Capital Region m et the Prevention Agenda Objective and had higher r ates of exclusive breastfeeding than NYS, excluding NYC. Schenectady County had the lowest rate in the Capital Region (5 3.7%). 4 There are clear racial disparities between Black no n-Hispanic and White non-Hispanic infants who are e xclusively breastfed and between Hispanic and White non-Hispan ic infants. For White non-Hispanic infants, the low est percentage of exclusive breastfeeding in the hospital was in R ensselaer County, with 63.9%.

The World Health Organization 6 recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. In the United States, while 74% of mothers start off exclusively breastfeeding, only 1 3% are still doing so at the end of six months. 2 Breastfeeding information on the state and national level has bee n collected from the Women, Infant and Children (WI C) Program, which offers nutritious food and education on healt hy eating to low income mothers and their children. The number of New York State WIC mothers breastfeeding at 6 month s had increased 9% over the last decade, from 28.1% in 2005-07 to 30.7% in 2014-16. 7 The rate of Capital Region WIC mothers breastfeedin g at six months of 23.7.%, was markedly lower compared to the statewide rate of 30.7%, and well below the 2024 Prevention Agenda objective of 45.5%. Greene County (18.4%) had the lowest of WIC mothers were s till breastfeeding at six months in the Capital Reg ion. 7 The CDC has identified numerous obstacles to mother s who wish to breastfeed, including healthcare prov iders who do not provide up-to-date information and instruction and hospital policies and childbirth practices that interfere with breastfeeding initiation. Other obstacles include l ack of support and understanding from family and co mmunity members, and lack of accommodation at the workplace . 2 References 1.

Well-child visits are important to promote health i n children and youth. Well-child visits begin short ly after birth and continue through the teen years. During a well-chil d visit, the doctor checks the child's growth and d evelopment by measuring their height and weight, gives any immuni zations that are due, and tests hearing and vision. Lead poisoning screenings and vaccinations are scheduled as well. 1 Well-child visits allow children and parents to ass ess and address concerns, reinforce healthy behaviors and parenting practices, obtain information and guidance from pe diatricians and establish and maintain positive relationships betwe en the family and pediatrician. These visits allow for monitoring of a child's general health and development and health r isks and special needs to be identified and address ed before they become serious. 2 Highlights No Capital Region county met the Prevention Agenda objectives for well child visits, children 0-21 years, among government sponsored insurance pr ograms.

Mental Health and Substance Abuse Poor Mental Health Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2019-2024 Reduce the age adjusted percentage of adults with poor mental heal th (14 or more days) in the last month to no more than 10.7%. Reduce the age adjusted suicide rate to 7.0 per 100,000. Highlights Greene, Schenectady and Rensselaer counties did not meet the Prevention Agenda Objective for poor mental health days in the past month. The Capital Region had higher mental disease and di sorder ED visit and hospitalization rates than NYS excl. NYC; Schenectady County had ED visit and hospitalization rates 1.5 times higher than NYS excluding NYC. Black non-Hispanic residents had 1.9 times the ment al disease and disorder ED visit, and 1.7 times the hospitalization rates compared to White n on-Hispanic residents. All counties had higher age-adjusted suicide mortal ity rates than the Prevention Agenda Objective. Males had higher rates of suicide-related mortality than females; females had higher self-inflicted hospitalization and ED visit rates than males. All counties had higher rates of hospitalizations a nd ED visits for self-inflicted injuries in those 15+ years of age compared to NYS excl. NYC; Schenec tady had the highest rates in the Capital Region. Mental health is a core function which has physical , spiritual, and socio-economic impacts. Poor menta l health is a cause of adverse physical health outcomes, academic under -achievement, homelessness, unemployment and isolat ion. One in five New Yorkers experiences a diagnosable mental d isorder annually; and one in ten experiences an ill ness serious enough to impair functioning. 1 An estimated 84,500 adults in the Capital Region reported 14 or more d ays with poor mental health in the last month. 2 138 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE VIII MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE In the Capital Region, the percent of poor mental h ealth days is higher than in NYS excluding NYC, wit h Schenectady and Greene counties having the highest prevalence o f 14 or more poor mental health days in the past mo nth. 3 Greene, Schenectady and Rensselaer counties did not meet th e Prevention Agenda objective for poor mental healt h days in the past month. Mental illness is treatable and preventable, and Ne w York State has one of the world's largest mental health systems in the United States. The Capital Region provides a br oad network of mental hygiene services to meet the needs of residents affected by mental illness or emotional d isturbance. These services include public, private and not-for-profit providers and target mental health needs from early childhood identification to the unique challenges of seniors. Provider efforts span three disability areas: menta l health, chemical dependency, and mental retardati on and developmental disabilities. While many New Yorkers with serious mental disorders are eligible for Medi caid, considerable numbers are part of the \"working poor. \" Many people with mental illness are underinsured or uninsured and have difficulty paying for needed services.

Columbia and Greene counties had the highest r ates in the Region. The most recent estimates suggest there are 1.9 mil lion New Yorkers with a substance abuse problem, re presenting approximately 12% of the population. 1 This figure does not fully represent the widesprea d impact of substance abuse, however, because of the millions of other individua ls whose lives are also affected: the children, spo uses, and extended families of substance abusers, as well as other aff ected bystanders. Additionally, reluctance to seek help for substance abuse problems and stigma associated makes it likel y this estimate is lower than the true rate. New Yo rk has also been struggling with an opioid epidemic. Opioid deaths i ncreased sharply in 2015 and 2016, with 2016 death rate almost three times higher than it was in 2010. 7 Alcohol Abuse Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2019-2024 Reduce the age adjusted percentage of adult binge drinking (5 or m ore drinks for men on one occasion, and 4 or more drinks for women on one occasion) dur ing the past month to no more than 16.7%. Alcohol is the primary substance used by adults. Fo r youth, alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs are principal concerns. Binge drinking is a common pattern of exc essive alcohol use that brings a person's blood alc ohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 percent or above. Binge drinking is associated with many health problems, like 144 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE VIII MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE unintentional and intentional injuries, alcohol poi soning, sexually transmitted disease, unintended pr egnancy, children born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, cardiov ascular disease, neurological damage and more. Bin ge drinkers are 14 times more likely to report alcohol-impaired dri ving than non-binge drinkers. Binge drinking is als o more prevalent in males than in females. 2 In the Capital Region, only Albany County meet the Prevention Agenda Objective of 16.7% of adults repo rting binge drinking in the past 30 days.

Increase the age-adjusted Buprenorphine prescribing rate for substance use disorder (SUD) to 43.1 per 1,000 population. Reduce the age-adjusted opioid analgesics prescript ion for pain rate to 343 per 1,000 population. Reduce age-adjusted ED visits (including outpatient s and admitted patients) involving any opioid overdose to 53.2 per 100,000 population The present opioid epidemic can likely be traced to the overuse of prescription opioids, leading to op ioid addiction. Prescription opioids have been used to treat modera te-to-severe pain, with a dramatic increase in use over recent years. In the US, as many as one in four patients receivin g long -term opioid therapy in a primary care setti ng struggles with opioid additiction. 5 Nearly 9 million opioid prescriptions were dispense d in New York State in 2015. Between 2011 and 2014, approximately 165,000 New Yorkers annually ab used or were dependent on opioids. 6 Opioid overdose mortality in New York State was abo ut three times higher in 2016 (15.1/100,000) than i t was in 2010 (5.4). There was also an increase in New York State overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (e.g. fentanyl) from 1.4/100,000 in 2014 to 8.3/100 ,000 in 2016. 7 In New York State, first responders and others like ly to witness an opioid-related overdose have been trained to reduce the impact of opioid overdoses and prevent death by using naloxone. Naloxone is a medication that counters the effects of opioid overdose. 7,8 146 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE VIII MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE New York State had almost 3,100 opioid overdose dea ths in 2016. The Capital Region contributed 108 opi oid overdose deaths to this figure.

The white non-Hispanic population had higher rates (20.3) than either the black non-Hispanic (10.7) or Hispanic (1 2.8) populations. 9 Buprenorphine is used in medication-assisted treatm ent to help people reduce or quite their use of opi ates. Use of buprenorphine, in combination with counseling and b ehavioral therapies, provide an effective approach to the treatment of opioid dependency. 10 19.4 12.3 9.6 8.4 Age-Adjusted Opioid Overdose (Any Opioid) Mortality R ate per 100,000, 2016 9 Prevention Agenda Objective (14.0/100,000) 147 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE VIII MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE While all Capital Region counties met the 2019-2024 Prevention Agenda objective for Buprenorphine pres cribing, the Region's rate was lower than that of NYS, excl.

Infectious Disease Vaccine-Preventable Disease Highlights All Capital Region counties had higher percentages of children ages 19-35 months who had completed the immunization series than NYS excl. NY C, with no Capital Region counties having met the Prevention Agenda objective. All Capital Region counties, except Schenectady, fe ll below the Prevention Agenda Objective, 50% for females aged 13-17 years who were fully imm unized for HPV. No Capital Region counties met the Prevention Agend a objective of 70% of adults, ages 65 and older, receiving a flu immunization in the past yea r. Only Albany and Schenectady counties met the Preven tion Agenda Objective of 76.2% of the 65 + year population ever receiving a pneumococcal vaccination. Vaccines are used worldwide to protect against dise ase by inducing immunity. Immunization is a proven tool for controlling and even eradicating disease. Thanks to vaccines, diseases such as smallpox have been erad icated and many other vaccines have saved millions of lives all ove r the world. Vaccines contain the same antigens tha t cause disease; however, the antigens in vaccines are either killed or weakened in order not to cause disease. 1 Childhood Immunization Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013-2018 (2019-20 24 Objective changes age group) Increase the rates of immunization among 19-35 mont h olds with the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series (4 Tdap, 3 polio, 1 MMR, 3 Hep B, 3 Hib, 1 varicell a, 4 PCV13) to 80% or higher. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) sets a standard child immunization schedule of re commended ages to be vaccinated. Receiving vaccines at a youn g age allows infants and children to become immune early in life, before they are exposed to any of the diseases. Del aying or skipping shots can put children at risk of developing diseases during the delay period. 2 In the United States, high immunization rates have greatly helped to reduce the prevalence of vaccine preventable diseases. In New York State, school entry laws requ ire children to receive their vaccinations prior to starting school, which helps to keep immunization levels high. The i mmunization rates of children younger than school-a ge, specifically those 19-35 months of age, in New York are still be low the Healthy People 2020 goal and the Prevention Agenda objective of 80 percent. 3 153 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE IX INFECTIOUS DISEASE In 2016, 4,000 children, ages 19-35 months in the C apital Region were not fully immunized.

However, no Capital Region counties meet the P revention Agenda objective of 80%. 4 Human Papillomavirus Immunization Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013-2018 (2019-20 24 Objective changes age group) Increase the three-dose HPV immunization rate among adolescent females, ages 13-17 years to 50%. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexua lly transmitted disease. An estimated 79 million Am ericans are infected with HPV, with about 14 million people bec oming infected each year. 5 HPV is easily spread by skin to skin contact with an infected individual. There are more than 40 types of HPV that an affect the genital, a nal, mouth, and throat areas of men and women. Types of HPV referre d to as \"low-risk\" strains can cause genital warts, which in many cases are not visible to the naked eyes. Most infec ted persons do not develop symptoms and are unaware they have HPV, increasing the chances of unintended transmiss ion. 5 Certain types of HPV\u2014the \"high-risk\" strains\u2014cause cancer. Cervical cancer is developed most frequentl y. Nearly all cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV. Cervica l cancer does not cause symptoms until it is at an advanced stage. It can be treated only when it is diagnosed at an earl y stage, through screening. 6 64.0 72.6 67.7 Co lumbia Greene Percentage of Children with 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 Immunizat ion Series, Aged 19-35 Months, 2016 4 Prevention Agenda Objective (80.0%) 154 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE IX INFECTIOUS DISEASE The recommended ages for administration of vaccines are 11 or 12 years. Males are able to get the vacc ine up to the age of 21 years and females up to the age of 26 yea rs. For men with compromised immune systems and who have sex with other men, the vaccine is available up to age 26 years as well. It is important that both doses o f the vaccine be given before sexual activity begins in order for th e vaccine to be most effective. 7, 8 In the Capital Region, over 16,800 females between t he ages of 13-17 years were not immunized for HPV i n 2016.

Complications from the flu include: pneumonia, ear or sinus infections, dehydration, and worsening of chronic medical conditions (such as congestive hear t failure, asthma or diabetes). 10 The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccination. The CDC recommends an annual flu shot for anyone 6 months and older, especially those at high risk of developing flu-related complications. Influenza vir uses undergo frequent antigenic change, causing the vaccine to c hange frequently as well. It is necessary to receiv e an annual vaccination against the influenza viruses forecaste d to be in circulation each year. 11 In the Capital Region almost 62,400 adults aged 65 and older did not receive a flu vaccine in 2016.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that can led to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, AIDS. The virus attacks the cells of the immune system, making it more susceptible to life-threatening infections and diseases and unable to fight them off. HIV progresses to AIDS, the most advanced stage of the disease, in which the body can no longer fight off infections.1 HIV testing is the only way to know definitively if a person is infected with HIV. The virus is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids such as blood, semen, genial fluids, or breast milk. Unprotected sex and sharing needles or syringes with an infected person are the most common ways the virus is transmitted. Flu-like symptoms can occur within 2-4 weeks after exposure and last from a few days to several weeks. Although it may take 10 or more years for symptoms of HIV to develop, HIV antibodies can be detected in most people within 3 to 12 weeks of infection.1 Post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, is a method to prevent HIV infection following a recent unprotected sexual encounter, sharing needles, sexual assault or occupational exposure. It involves taking antiretroviral medicines within 72 hours of the exposure event. PEP should only be used in emergencies. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a method to prevent HIV negative individuals in high-risk populations by taking daily antiretroviral medicines to decrease the chances of becoming infected. High-risk populations may include HIV negative individuals who are in an ongoing sexual relationship with an HIV positive partner, or anyone who does not regularly use condoms during sex with partners of unknown HIV status who are at substantial risk of HIV infection.1 There is no cure for HIV currently. Once infected, a person has HIV for life. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a treatment for persons infected with HIV that consists of taking a combination of at least three medications that work to slow the growth of the virus. ART can extend the lives and improve quality of live for those infected with HIV. As more people are living longer due to ART, the prevalence of HIV has increased.1 In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that there are about 1.1 million people living with HIV as of 2016, and in 2017, there were 38,739 newly diagnosed HIV cases in the United States and dependent areas.2 The CDC estimates that of that number, 1 in 7 did not know they were infected and may have unknowingly transmitted the virus to others. Research had shown that the majority of people who know they are infected take steps to prevent Highlights Columbia County had the highest new HIV case rate, whereas Albany County had the highest AIDS case rate and AIDS mortality rate in the Capital Region. Black non-Hispanics were 7-13 times more likely to be newly diagnosed with HIV than White non-Hispanics. Hispanics were 5-11 times more likely to be newly diagnosed with HIV than White non- Hispanics . 159 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE IX INFECTIOUS DISEASE transmission to their partners. It is vital to iden tify new cases in order to control and accurately m easure the HIV prevention efforts and their effectiveness. 2 During 2014-16, the Capital Region had an annual av erage of 59 newly diagnosed HIV cases. The Region's rate was lower than NYS, excluding NYC. Columbia County had the highest case rate (8.7/100,000) within the Capi tal Region. Columbia, Albany, and Schenectady did not meet the 2019-2024 Prevention Agenda objective of case rates lower than 5.2/100,000.

The highest rate of Chlamydia in women was in Schen ectady County (1,943.0/100,000), with none of the Capital Region counties having met the 2019-2024 Prevention Agenda objective (667.0/100,000). Saratoga, Greene and Schenectady counties met the P revention Agenda objective for Syphilis in males, whereas Albany County (25.4), Columbia Co unty (13.1) and Rensselaer County (15.2) did not. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) continue to ha ve a significant impact on the health, safety and w elfare of the citizens of New York State. As in prior years, STDs are the leading category of reported communicable diseases in the state. 141,000 New Yorkers had STDs, representing 5 0% of all communicable diseases reported statewide in 2016. 1 Sexually transmitted disease control programs acros s New York State that conduct public health activit ies aim to: educate the public on safer sex behaviors; prevent the spread of STDs through counseling and treatment of those infected; and provide health services to partners o f persons infected with STDs. 2 Gonorrhea Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013-2018 By December 31, 2018, reduce the Gonorrhea case rat e among persons aged 15- 44 in New York to no more than 183.1 cases per 100, 000 females and 199.5 cases per 100,000 males. Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported sexu ally transmitted disease (STD) in New York State. 3 Gonorrhea is an infection spread through sexual contact with ano ther person. The bacteria are found in the mucous a reas of the body. 4 Early detection and appropriate treatment is import ant. If Gonorrhea is left untreated, it will lead t o complications such as infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and ectopic pregnancy. PID is a painful condition t hat occurs when the infection spreads throughout the reproductive organ s and can lead to sterility in women. Men may suffe r some swelling of the reproductive organs. Both sexes may suffer f rom arthritis, skin problems, and other organ infec tions caused by the spread of gonorrhea within the body. 4 163 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE IX INFECTIOUS DISEASE In 2016, there were over 1,100 cases of Gonorrhea r eported in the Capital Region. For both males and f emales, the Capital Region counties that did not meet the Preve ntion Agenda objectives for gonorrhea rates were Sc henectady Albany, and Rensselaer counties.

Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis . Although chlamydia is easily treated, 70% of women and 50% of men do not show sy mptoms. 2 Complications of the infection may lead to inflammation of the cervix in women and inflammatio n of the urethra in men. Additional complications i nclude pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to infer tility. In fact, chlamydia is the leading cause of infertility in the United States. Pregnant women can pass chlamydia to their babies during childbirth. This may cause problems i n newborns, like chlamydial pneumonia or conjunctivitis. Patien ts are also more susceptible to HIV infection and o ther STDs, if exposed. 7 In 2016, there were 2700 cases of Chlamydia amongst women aged 15-44 years in the Capital Region. 8 The highest rate was in Schenectady County (1,943.0/100,000). None o f the counties of the Capital Region met the Preven tion Agenda objective (667.0). Albany and Schenectady counties were also both above the NYS excluding NYC rate. Wi th the exception of Greene and Rensselaer counties, the Ca pital Region counties have experienced increases in female Chlamydia rates over the Rate per 100,000 Chlamydia case rate per 100,000 women- aged 15-44 ye ars, 2014-2016 8 Prevention Agenda Objective (667.0) 165 HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITATIVE IX INFECTIOUS DISEASE Syphilis Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013-2018 By December 31, 2018, reduce the case rate of prima ry and secondary Syphilis to no more than 10.1 cases per 100,000 for males an d 0.4 cases per 100,000 for females. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused b y the bacteria Treponema pallidum . It progresses through various stages that can last months or years depending on t he individual. The primary stage is marked by a pai nless sore at the location where syphilis entered the body. Left untr eated, the sore will go away in a few weeks, and th e disease will progress to the secondary stage. This stage is repr esented by skin rashes or legions in the mucous mem branes, and can be accompanied by fever, weight and hair loss, musc le aches, and swollen lymph glands. The rashes may be too light to be noticed, however, and untreated syphilis will pa ss into the late and latent stages when left untrea ted. At this point, all symptoms disappear and the disease can lay latent f or months or years. In 15% of untreated people, syp hilis can lead to difficulty coordinating muscle movements, paralysis , numbness, dementia, and/or death. Pregnant women with untreated syphilis can pass the disease on to their babies, causing low birth weight, developmental de lays, or death. People with genital sores are also at higher risk f or transmitting or acquiring HIV. Curing syphilis c an be done with an intramuscular injection of penicillin or an appropr iate antibiotic, such as tetracyclin. 9,10 Although the disease was more prevalent in heterose xual minorities ages 30-39 in the 1990s, the 2000s saw an epidemiologic shift. More recently, syphilis is mos t prevalent in 20-29 year-old men who have sex with men (MSM). 79.6% of all primary and secondary syphilis cases i n the United States in 2017 were found in MSM. 9 In 2016, there were 68 cases of syphilis in men in the Capital Region. With the exception of Albany, R ensselaer and Columbia counties, the Capital Region counties met the Prevention Agenda objective for no more than 10 .1 cases per 100,000 males.

Greene, Columbia and Rensselaer counties respectively had t he top three rates of all New York State counties. Lyme disease is the most commonly reported tick-bor ne disease in the United States. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted to humans through the bite of infe cted blacklegged ticks. Typical symptoms include headache, fever, fatigue a nd erythema migrans, a characteristic bull's eye skin rash . If left untreated, the disease can progress, affecting the nervous system, heart and joints. 1 Early detection of the disease is important, as pat ients in the early stages of the infection usually recover rapidly and completely with treatment. According to the Nationa l Institutes of Health (NIH), studies have shown th at most patients can be cured with a few weeks of antibiotics taken by mouth. Intravenous treatment with antibiotics ma y be necessary for more advanced patients with neurological or car diac forms of the illness. 1 Patients diagnosed with later stages of disease may have persistent or recurrent symptoms. Known as po st-treatment Lyme disease, patients experience fatigue, persiste nt pain, impaired cognitive function, or unexplaine d numbness after treatment. Studies have shown that prolonged course s of antibiotics are not helpful among individuals with these symptoms and can cause serious complications. 2 The Capital Region had over 2,300 cases of Lyme dis ease in 2017. Greene, Columbia and Rensselaer counties had the top three Lyme disease rates of all New York State counties. 3 References 1.

The a im of the survey was to continue to learn more abou t behavioral health/lifestyle practices, health care utilization and needs, challenges to practicing hea lthy behaviors and accessing care as well as other socia l determinants of health. The Siena College Resear ch Institute (SCRI) was contracted to collect the data for this Community Health Survey. A random sampli ng design was applied to recruit a representative samp le of residents of the Capital District (including the counties of Albany, Columbia, Greene, Rensselaer, S aratoga, and Schenectady) and augmented by an oversample of lower income individuals (defined as yearly household income of no more than $50,000). The sample from each county was statistically weigh ted to the proportionate share of the population of the entire region making the overall margin of error in cluding the design effects of weighting +/- 3.4 per centage points across the sample of 1204 residents at the 9 5% confidence level. Additionally separate weighte d estimates were prepared for: 1) Albany, Rensselaer (n=529), Columbia, Greene (n=258) (n=226), 4) Schenectady (n=191), and 5) lower incom e respondents across the six counties (n=724). The data collection instrument was developed by HCD I in collaboration with the Prevention Agenda Workgroup and Siena College. The behavioral questi ons were asked in reference to a 12 month period to improve consistency in response. The questionnaire was pilot tested before adopted for use. Trained interviewers at Siena College administered the ques tionnaire to ensure fidelity of the data. Particip ants who were 18 years of age or older and eligible to take part in the study were interviewed on their cellpho nes or landlines.
