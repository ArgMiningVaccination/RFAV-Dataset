Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine where your pets doctor uses only his or her hands to diagnose vertebral subluxations (misalignments) along the spine and then relieves those subluxations. The objective is to restore nervous system function in order to allow the body to heal itself without the need for any outside stimulus. Chiropractic care is most often performed on horses and dogs, but can be performed on any species. At the beginning of the appointment, a full history will be taken before the veterinarian begins to visually inspect the animal standing still and then while moving. After movement, the examination will begin with any problems (subluxations) corrected throughout the exam. If you have any questions, or would like information at any time, do not hesitate to ask. At the completion of the exam, both you and your veterinarian will discuss follow-up care specific for your animal. Some possible benefits of chiropractic include a reduction in back pain, increased joint mobility, improvement in mentation, and numerous other functions. Below you will find scientific articles related to the benefits of chiropractic care in animals.

YES! Whether young or aged, a chiropractic adjustment could have benefits that set your animal up for a longer and healthier life. Performance animals are not the only ones that need help as well. Even the \"couch dog\" will develop decreased motion and thus limited movement. If you would like more information, or would like to schedule an appointment for a chiropractic visit, give us a call "}
