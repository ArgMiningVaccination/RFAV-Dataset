Importantly, this small volume is already compatible with tissue micro array (TMA) cores and core needle biopsies, while our results and its ease-of-use indicate that further downsizing is feasible.

Introduction [1](#B1-ijms-23-04443)]. FFPE allows the preservation of tissues in a \"life-like\" state while preserving spatial features and keeping them accessible for subsequent downstream analyses, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), and genomic (hotspot) sequencing, without the requirement of expensive equipment for sample storage [ [2](#B2-ijms-23-04443), [3](#B3-ijms-23-04443), [4](#B4-ijms-23-04443), [5](#B5-ijms-23-04443)]. Vast FFPE tissue archives are available in clinics around the globe. These represent an invaluable resource for precision oncology and clinical research [ [1](#B1-ijms-23-04443), [6](#B6-ijms-23-04443)] because the archives often include pathological, clinical, and outcome data that are linked to the clinical samples, which have often been collected from a patient during different stages of disease. [7](#B7-ijms-23-04443)]. These technological advances now enable the proteomic profiling of minute sample amounts. Both system-wide 'discovery' data on aberrant protein expression/signaling pathway activity and targeted data providing actual protein concentrations for selected protein targets can provide important phenotypic information from FFPE samples that cannot be extracted from genomic screening or from IHC staining, and which may be in disagreement with genomic [ [8](#B8-ijms-23-04443), [9](#B9-ijms-23-04443), [10](#B10-ijms-23-04443)]. [11](#B11-ijms-23-04443)]. In addition, formalin-induced crosslinks have to be reversed prior to protein extraction, which is then typically followed by a bottom-up proteomic workflow. A central component of almost all deparaffinization protocols is xylene, which is a toxic and highly flammable solvent [ [12](#B12-ijms-23-04443), [13](#B13-ijms-23-04443)]. It has also been reported that xylene may negatively affect protein extraction and quantitative proteomic analysis [ [3](#B3-ijms-23-04443), [14](#B14-ijms-23-04443)]. Most studies agree that heat, the choice of detergents and protein denaturants, as well as the pH of the extraction buffer and physical agitation, are important parameters affecting the efficacy of protein extraction [ [3](#B3-ijms-23-04443), [15](#B15-ijms-23-04443)]. [Figure 1](#ijms-23-04443-f001)). The absence of xylene in our protocol is in line with the principles of \"green chemistry\" [ [16](#B16-ijms-23-04443)] as it avoids the use of chemicals that are both hazardous to nature and involve a hazardous synthesis. 2. Results 2.1. Water-Based Deparaffinization Competes with the Gold-Standard Xylene and Takes Only a Fraction of the Time [18](#B18-ijms-23-04443)], and 2017 by Mansour et al. for Western proteins that were quantified between the two methods show a good agreement between depW and depX (correlation coefficient R = 0.94, slope = 0.97, [Figure 2](#ijms-23-04443-f002)C). In general, the choice of the deparaffinization method did not significantly impact the recovery of hydrophobic or hydrophilic proteins (see [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-ijms-23-04443)); however, almost half of the quantified high-abundance cytosolic ribosomal showed poorer recoveries Benjamini-Krieger adjusted p value <0.01, median depW/depX = 0.25), while membrane and nuclear proteins of interest in cancer biology, such as TOMM5 [ [19](#B19-ijms-23-04443), [20](#B20-ijms-23-04443)], TOMM7 BCCIP (BRCA2 interacting protein) [ [22](#B22-ijms-23-04443), [24](#B24-ijms-23-04443)], had significantly better recoveries using depW (adj. p < 0.01, depW/depX= >2.08). Notably, other important cancer proteins, such as EGFR (adj. p = 0.20, depW/depX = 1.36), EIF4E (adj. p = 0.13, depW/depX = 1.19), or AKT1S1 (adj. p = 0.31, depW/depX = 1.71) seem to show better recoveries using water-based deparaffinization, but this was not statistically significant. 2.2. Efficient Tissue Homogenization Using Micropestles [25](#B25-ijms-23-04443), homMP or homBM in exSDC and digested using FASP. be found in [Section 4.3.1](#sec4dot3dot1-ijms-23-04443). [Figure 3](#ijms-23-04443-f003)A). LFQ of the quantitation of 1405 (homMP) and 1364 (homBM) unique proteins showed that both methods are equally reproducible (%CVs of of 1410 proteins that were quantified by both methods showed a good correlation (r = 0.94, slope = 0.98, [Figure 3](#ijms-23-04443-f003)C), with a tendency toward higher intensities for homMP ( [Figure 3](#ijms-23-04443-f003)D). The proteins with significantly differential recovery ( [Figure 3](#ijms-23-04443-f003)D), however, do not seem to indicate a role of pI, hydrophobicity, subcellular localization, or molecular weight in the enrichment/depletion with either method (see [Supplemental Table S2](#app1-ijms-23-04443)). Based on a slightly better overall performance, ease of use, and lower cost, we prefer the disposable micropestle to the BioMasher III. 2.3. Improved Protein protein modifications observed in FFPE tissue [ [30](#B30-ijms-23-04443), [31](#B31-ijms-23-04443)]. These protein modifications can ultimately lead to protein-protein, DNA-protein, and/or RNA-protein crosslinking (e.g., Schiff base reaction). Combining heat [ [32](#B32-ijms-23-04443), [33](#B33-ijms-23-04443)] with high concentrations of detergents is considered to be the most effective approach for protein extraction from FFPE tissue and the reversal of protein-crosslinking that had been induced during the fixation process. We, therefore, compared a standard SDS buffer (exSDS), as used in many studies [ [3](#B3-ijms-23-04443), [15](#B15-ijms-23-04443)], seems to improve the denaturation of FFPE-preserved proteins and facilitates downstream processing. We use the identification of peptides with lysine methylation as an indicator of effective denaturation and decrosslinking in FFPE samples. We observed 4.95 \u00b1 with exSDS and 0.26% with exSDC. This indicates lysis buffers are effective for decrosslinking, but exSDC seems to be marginally better. In our hands, the exSDC buffer yielded significantly higher amounts of total protein (unpaired t-test, p = 0.0341, [Figure 4](#ijms-23-04443-f004)A) than the SDS buffer, which is thought to be the 'gold-standard'. [Figure 3](#ijms-23-04443-f003)B). A direct comparison using LFQ enabled the quantitation of 1722 unique proteins quantified by both methods and showed a slight tendency towards higher intensities, and consequently, are more likely to be a better extraction efficiency for exSDC ( [Figure 3](#ijms-23-04443-f003)C,D). A closer look into the physicochemical properties of proteins exclusively quantified in each method reveals that exSDC is significantly better for extraction of larger (unpaired t-test, p = 0.0001), more acidic (unpaired and p = 0.0001) than exSDS (see [Supplemental Table S3](#app1-ijms-23-04443)). 2.4. PAC and STRAP Are Good Alternatives to FASP [37](#B37-ijms-23-04443), [38](#B38-ijms-23-04443)], which is still one of the most-widely used sample preparation methods, in addition to the more recent protein-aggregation capture (PAC) [ [39](#B39-ijms-23-04443)] and suspension trapping using micro spin columns (STRAP) [ [40](#B40-ijms-23-04443)] that enable a simpler sample preparation with improved parallelization and automation capabilities [ [31](#B31-ijms-23-04443), [41](#B41-ijms-23-04443), [42](#B42-ijms-23-04443), [43](#B43-ijms-23-04443), [44](#B44-ijms-23-04443)]. For each method, 20 were digested after the individual methods that FASP also had the lowest intra-method %CV (15.6%, n = 1496) followed by PAC with 16.9% (n = 1482) and STRAP with 17.7% (n = 1496; [Figure 5](#ijms-23-04443-f005)B). A quantitative comparison of the three methods based on LFQ led to the quantitation of 1436 unique proteins quantified by all methods. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on the normalized abundances of these proteins (multiple hypothesis testing using FDR-based approach by Benjamini-Krieger, FDR 1%, [Figure 5](#ijms-23-04443-f005)C) shows good agreement between the three methods. A closer look into the physicochemical properties of proteins that were exclusively recovered with one of the methods shows that PAC seems to be better suited for small and more-acidic proteins, although not statistically significant (see [Supplementary Table S4](#app1-ijms-23-04443)). A pair-wise comparison of the three methods by LFQ shows that FASP results in a slightly better overall protein recovery than PAC, while both methods are superior to STRAP (see [Figure 5](#ijms-23-04443-f005)D-F). 3. Discussion [50](#B50-ijms-23-04443)]. Other relevant cancer targets, such as translational elongation and initiation factors (e.g., EIF4E), membrane receptors (e.g., EGFR), as well as RNA binding proteins, also showed a tendency towards better recovery, albeit not statistically significant. These results may reflect the differential impact of water- and several rounds of ethanol-washes on the partial removal of either soluble or hydrophobic proteins. [40](#B40-ijms-23-04443), [41](#B41-ijms-23-04443), [43](#B43-ijms-23-04443), [51](#B51-ijms-23-04443)], but the availability of AFA systems that can handle multiple samples in standard laboratories is limited because of the high cost of both the instrumentation and the required consumables. In our hands, sonication of the small sample amounts used in this study results in a high risk of sample loss, even when a single tube is used. A heat-based homogenization/lysis in SDC buffer with TCEP, together with autoclavable micropestles, enabled effective decrosslinking, homogenization, and extraction, using a simple protocol. A BCA kit compatible with reducing agents (RAC-BCA) is recommended to account for interferences in the colorimetric detection and quantitation of total protein. [52](#B52-ijms-23-04443), [53](#B53-ijms-23-04443)]. STRAP is a very attractive sample preparation method because the available cartridge formats cover a wide range of total protein amounts (1-100 \u00b5g, 100-300 \u00b5g or 300 \u00b5g) [ [40](#B40-ijms-23-04443)]. It also allows tryptic digestion in as little as 3 h, with comparable digestion efficiency to overnight digestion used for FASP. In our hands, however, STRAP was slightly less reproducible than PAC and FASP, with PAC being the best choice for very low sample amounts. PAC requires tryptic digestion for only 3 h and has already been successfully automated in several laboratories [ [41](#B41-ijms-23-04443), [45](#B45-ijms-23-04443), [46](#B46-ijms-23-04443), [47](#B47-ijms-23-04443), [48](#B48-ijms-23-04443)]. Moreover, available (e.g., amine-reactive, carboxylic, HILIC, etc.) which might be adapted based on specific research needs. Notably, to enable efficient PAC-based sample preparation for FFPE samples, we had to increase the recommended protein-to-bead ratio by a factor of three, likely as a result of FFPE-matrix effects that reduced the protein binding capacity. 4. Materials and Methods [Figure 1](#ijms-23-04443-f001)). To avoid a systematic bias derived from tissue heterogeneity, we used 1 mm-diameter cores that had been obtained from a single FFPE block for each step (i-iv) of the protocol to be optimized, and randomly assigned these to the different protocols in order to have a total of 5 replicates per condition. Thus, any statistically significant differences observed should result from methodical differences rather than tissue heterogeneity. 4.1. Chemicals and Reagents [37](#B37-ijms-23-04443), [38](#B38-ijms-23-04443)] was conducted on Centrifugal Filters (30 kDa molecular cut-off, Merck KGaA #MRCF0R030, purchased through Sigma bead-based preparation, beads with MagReSyn\u00ae Amine functional groups (ReSyn Biosciences, Gauteng, South Africa) were used. For sample preparation using suspension trapping, S-Trap [ [51](#B51-ijms-23-04443)] micro-cartridges with a binding capacity of <100 \u00b5g total protein were purchased from ProtiFi (Farmingdale, NY, USA, #CO2-micro-80). 4.2. Source of Specimens [Figure 6](#ijms-23-04443-f006)). A total of 1 \u00d7 105 human DCIS cells (MCF10DCIS.com; Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC, USA) were injected into the mammary fat pads of an athymic nude mouse. DCIS tumors were resected after 1.5 weeks, were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and stored under ambient conditions (~1 year) [ [17](#B17-ijms-23-04443)]. 4.3. Sample Preparation of Core Needle Biopsy-Sized Specimens 4.3.1. Optimization of Deparaffinization [2](#B2-ijms-23-04443), [31](#B31-ijms-23-04443), [42](#B42-ijms-23-04443)]. We compared a standard protocol for xylene/ethanol washes (depX) used in most clinical laboratories for paraffin removal, to a 'green' and solvent-free deparaffinization approach based on hot deionized water (80 \u00b0C; depW) using 5 FFPE cores per protocol. - (a) - depX [ [54](#B54-ijms-23-04443)]: The samples were washed with 1 mL of 100% xylene and incubated for 10 min at room temperature (RT), followed by centrifugation at 14,000\u00d7 g for 2 min and disposal of the supernatant, followed by another 2 repetitions. Then, the samples were washed twice each with 1 mL of 100%, 96%, and 70% ethanol, followed by incubation for 1 min at RT and centrifugation as above. - (b) - depW (modified from [ [14](#B14-ijms-23-04443)]): The samples were washed 2\u00d7 with 500 \u00b5L of hot deionized water and incubated for 1 min at RT under vigorous vortex mixing. Each washing step was followed by centrifugation at 20,000\u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant, containing paraffin either floating on the liquid surface or stuck to the wall of the tube ( [Figure 7](#ijms-23-04443-f007)), was discarded and the deparaffinized and rehydrated core was transferred to a clean LoBind Eppendorf tube. [37](#B37-ijms-23-04443), [38](#B38-ijms-23-04443)] with slight modifications [ [55](#B55-ijms-23-04443)]. Briefly, lysate corresponding to 20 \u00b5g of total protein was diluted to 450 \u00b5L with freshly prepared 8 M Urea,100 mM Tris, pH 8.5 [ [56](#B56-ijms-23-04443)] and loaded onto a 30 kDa Microcon filter. The sample was centrifuged for 25 min at 13,500\u00d7 g and the eluate was discarded, followed by three washes using 100 \u00b5L of the same buffer and three washes with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AmBic). Finally, 100 \u00b5L of digestion buffer comprising 1:20 (w/w) trypsin:protein in 0.2 M guanidine-hydrochloride (GuHCl), 50 mM AmBic, 2 mM CaCl2 were added and the sample was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 14 h. The tryptic peptides were recovered by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,500\u00d7 g, followed by two additional washes using 50 \u00b5L of 50 mM AmBic and 50 \u00b5L of ultrapure water. The collected peptide sample was dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid (FA) for nano-LC-MS/MS. 4.3.2. Optimization [15](#B15-ijms-23-04443), 50 mM pH 8.5 (exSDC). Then, 250 \u00b5L of either exSDS or exSDC buffer were added to each deparaffinized core. Samples were homogenized and digested as described for homMP. Samples were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 0.1% FA for nano-LC-MS/MS. 4.3.4. Optimization [57](#B57-ijms-23-04443)], protein aggregation [ [39](#B39-ijms-23-04443)], and suspension trapping using S-Trap micro-cartridges (STRAP) [ [40](#B40-ijms-23-04443), The cores were 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM TCEP, pH 8.5 (exSDC). - (a) - FASP was performed as described above. - (b) - PAC was performed using amine microparticles (MagReSyn) based on Batth et al. [ [39](#B39-ijms-23-04443)]. 20 \u00b5g of protein lysate, 12 \u00b5L of microparticle stock solution \u00b5g/mL) with 100 \u00b5L of 70% ACN, briefly vortexed and placed on a magnetic rack to remove the supernatant. This step was repeated another two times. Next, the protein extracts were added to the beads and the sample was adjusted to a final concentration of 70% ACN, thoroughly vortexed and incubated for 10 min at RT without shaking. The following washing steps were performed on a magnetic rack without disturbing the protein/bead aggregate. The supernatants were discarded, and the beads were washed on the magnetic rack with 1 mL of 95% ACN for 10 s, followed by a wash with 1 mL of 70% ACN without disturbing the protein/bead aggregate. The tubes were removed from the magnetic rack, 100 \u00b5L of digestion buffer (1:20 (w/w) trypsin:protein in 0.2 M GuHCl, 50 mM AmBic, 2 mM CaCl2) were added and the samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h. After acidification with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 2%, the tubes were placed on the magnetic rack for 1 min, followed by removal of the supernatant. To remove residual beads, the samples were centrifuged at 20,000\u00d7 g for 10 min. The supernatants were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 0.1% FA for nano-LC-MS/MS. - (c) - STRAP digestion was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions [ [51](#B51-ijms-23-04443)]. Lysate corresponding to 20 \u00b5g of total protein was acidified to a final concentration of 1.2% phosphoric acid. SDS was added to a final concentration of 2% followed by a 7-fold dilution with STRAP binding buffer (90% methanol, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.1). The sample was loaded onto the STRAP and centrifuged at 4000\u00d7 g for 1 min, followed by three washes with 150 \u00b5L binding buffer, with the spin-column being rotated by 180\u00b0 between centrifugation steps. Then, 200 \u00b5L of STRAP digestion buffer, comprised of 1:10 (w/w) trypsin:protein in 0.2 M GuHCl, 50 mM AmBic, 2 mM CaCl2 were added to the STRAP, which was briefly spun on a benchtop centrifuge to assure saturation of the column material with the digestion buffer. The flow-through was loaded again on top of the column. The sample was incubated at 47 \u00b0C for 3 h. Peptides were eluted by sequential elution (1000xg, 1 min) using 40 \u00b5L of 50 mM AmBic, 40 \u00b5L of 0.1% FA, and 35 \u00b5L of 50% ACN, 0.1% FA. The collected peptide sample was dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 0.1% FA for nano-LC-MS/MS. 4.4. Data Analysis [31](#B31-ijms-23-04443)]. Mass tolerances were set to 5 ppm for precursor- and 0.02 Da for product-ions. The data were filtered to a false discovery rate (FDR) < 1% on the peptide and protein levels. Only proteins that were (i) identified with at least two unique peptides and (ii) quantified in at least 3 out of 5 replicates of at least one of the methods to be compared, were considered for the quantitative comparison. Protein LFQ data obtained from Proteome Discoverer were normalized based on summed protein intensities to correct for differences in sample loading. For proteins passing the abovementioned criteria, missing protein intensity values were imputed using 1.5\u00d7 the minimum observed intensity for this particular sample. The obtained normalized abundances were used for unpaired t-tests (two tailed, 95% confidence) and Pearson correlation analyses. Differential expression analysis was performed on log2-transformed normalized abundance data with multiple hypothesis testing using a false discovery approach by Benjamini-Krieger false discovery rate (FDR 1%). Proteins having q-values of <0.01 and absolute log2 fold-changes >1 were considered as differential between tested workflows. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (San Diego, CA, USA). [58](#B58-ijms-23-04443)] with the identifier PXD031946. 5. Conclusions [Supplemental Table S4](#app1-ijms-23-04443)).

Tissue areas of interest as small as ~1 mm3 and, based on the total amounts of extracted protein, even considerably smaller volumes of FFPE tissues should be compatible with this workflow.
