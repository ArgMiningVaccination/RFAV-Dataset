If your usual workout tends to last about 2 hours, Naked Energy will provide enough energy to help you perform at your best and carry you through. Some other brands will use synthetically created caffeine. However, the caffeine we use in Naked Energy is pure and sourced from unroasted coffee beans.

I can feel the pump help on heavy sets. really great product. thank you for supplying these clean products! I was satisfied. My first pre tho so I don't have anything to put it up against I understand they are supposed to have minimal ingredients, but the flavor is just weird. No way to describe it. It works well and I do like, but just the same as the protein powder, the flavor is less than desirable. Does exactly what it says it will. Great pump everytime after use! Get one that has flavor.

This is the cleanest pre-work out with the cleanest energy that I have ever had. Being that it is unflavored and no sugar, the taste is obviously not super pleasant, but that is expected.
