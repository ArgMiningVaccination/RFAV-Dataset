Various literature searches located a total of 29 studies that included 2623 patients. The results showed that the clinical effectiveness in the treatment of hypertension with CHM+WM was considerably higher than that with WM alone, clinical effective (RR 1.23, 95% CI [1.17, 1.30], P < 0.00001), and markedly effective (ME) in the patients (RR 1.66, 95% CI [1.52, 1.80], and P < 0.00001). Random in SBP (MD 7.91 mmHg,[6.00, 6.43], P < 0.00001), a subgroup analysis was carried out based on the type of intervention, duration of treatment, and CHM formulas that showed significance. Furthermore, no severe side effects were reported, and no patients stopped treatment or withdrawal due to any severe adverse events. The authors concluded that compared to WM alone, the therapeutic effectiveness of CHM combined with WM is significantly improved in the treatment of hypertension. Additionally, CHM with WM may safely and efficiently lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in individuals with PHTN. However, rigorous randomized controlled trials with a large sample, high quality, long duration of treatment, and follow-up are recommended to strengthen this clinical evidence.

Impressive in the sense of being impressively prone to bias, particularly knowing that [~80% of Chinese research findings have been shown to be fabricated](https://edzardernst.com/2016/10/data-fabrication-in-china-is-an-open-secret/) and considering that Chinese authors as good as [never publish anything negative about TCM](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9551280/). But perhaps you still believe that the results reported here are 100% true? In this case, I might even agree with you. The reason is that the authors demonstrate in exemplary fashion what I have been saying so often before: Blood pressure is one of the many endpoints that are highly prone to placebo effects. Therefore, even the addition of an ineffective CHM to WM would lower blood pressure more effectively than WM alone. But there is a third way of explaining the findings of this review: [some herbal remedies might actually have a hypotensive effect](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16392435/). The trouble is that this review does come not even close to telling us which. "}
