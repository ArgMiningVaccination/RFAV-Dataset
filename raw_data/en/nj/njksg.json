Rudolf Steiner8 Edited by17A listair John . Andrew Welburn713 EDITORIAL; SIGNS OF THE TIMES Anthroposophy springs from the work and teaching of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). He spoke of it as \" a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe . The aim of this Annual is to bring the outlook of Anthroposophy to bear on questions and activities which have relevance to the present time. The title derives from a reference by Rudolf Steiner to an old Persian legend. \" Djemjdid was a king who led his people from the north towards Iran, and who received from the God, whom he called Ahura Mazdao, a golden dagger, by means of which he was to full his mission on earth ... It represents a force given to man whereby he can act upon and transform external nature \".h a t I S a h e a l t h y e c o n o m y ?

F o r t h e immigrant, or the descendant of immigrants (particularly those who are black) integration through work is crucial; the sense of membership in the community depends on this.

T h e y c a nlead to what is diagnosed as mental illness, or to violence, or to all sorts of confusion of mind and feeling. These fragmentary memories call for integration into our whole understanding of the world and of ourselves. Soon after the rst world war, Rudolf Steiner pointed to three things which our civilisation needs, if it is to recover from decline: a living cos mogony , a real impulse towards inner freedom, and genuine altruism.R u d o l f S t e i n e r s p o k e o f h o w t h e s e e d s o f t h e s e q u a l i t i e s a r e d i s t r i b u t e d t h r o u g h t h e w o r l d ; o f l i v i n g c o s m o g o n y i n t h e W e s t , o f i m p u l s e s t o w a r d sfreedom in Europe, of altruism in the East.

A.B.8THE HUMAN HEART9 T H E H U M A N H E A R T RUDOLF STEINER A lecture given at Dornach on 26 May, 1922* W e h a v e o f t e n e x p l a i n e d h o w t h e d e v e l o p m e n t o f m a n t a k e s p l a c e during the rst periods of life, and it is many years since I rstindicated how the child behaves to a great extent as an imitative being during the period up to the change of teeth. More or less instinctively - and intensively \u2014 he experiences all that is going on in his environment. Later on it is only in the sense-organs that the processes of the outer world are thus intensively experienced, although we are not conscious of this fact. In our eyes, for example, we have a process imitating in a cert- tain sense what is going on in the outer world - reproducing it, just as a camera reproduces whatever is there in front of the lens. The human being becomes aware of what is thus imitatively reproduced in his eyes, and thus he gains information about the external world. It is the same with the other senses. But this restriction of the imitative principle to the periphery of the human organism occurs only at a later stage in life. In early childhood, until the change of teeth, the whole body par takes in this imitative process, though to a lesser extent. At this stage the whole body is in a certain respect related to the outer world as the senses are during the rest of human life. The child is still in the main an imitative being. He follows the way in which outer things work in upon him and he imitates them internally. Hence it is very important to let nothing happen in the young child's environment, not even in the form ing of our thoughts and feelings, which the child cannot rightly absorb and make his own. With the change of teeth it begins to be possible for the child to be have no longer like a sense-organ, but to assimilate something in the nature of ideas. The child begins to take as his guide-line what we say to him. Previously he has taken as his guide-line all that we did in his envir onment; now he begins to grasp what we say. Authority thus becomes the decisive factor between the change of teeth and puberty. The child will quite naturally follow and be guided by what is said to him. Lang uage itself he will of course learn by imitation, but that which is ex pressed and communicated through language - this can become a determining factor for the child only after the change of teeth. And a true power of judgment, when the child or adolescent begins to make his own faculty of judgment felt, comes only at the time of puberty .

These facts can be observed by anyone with an unbiased sense of truth. But they are connected with h i g h l y s i g n i c a n t i n n e r p r o c e s s e s , a n d i t i s o f t h e s e t h a t I w a n t t o s p e a k to-day. I have often pointed out how the human etheric body lives in intimate union with the physical body until the change of teeth begins. Therefore, a s I h a v e a l s o s a i d , w e c a n d e s c r i b e t h e c h a n g e o f t e e t h a s m a r k i n g t h e essential birth of the etheric body. Likewise we can refer the birth ofthe astral body to the time of puberty . However , that again is only an external account. To-day we will try to arrive at a rather more inward characterisation of these processes. Let us consider man in the spiritual world, long before he develops the tendency to descend into physical embodiment. We see him there as a being of soul and spirit in a world of soul and spirit. So were we, all of u s , b e f o r e w e d e s c e n d e d t o u n i t e w i t h w h a t w a s p r e p a r e d f o r u s , a s p h y sical body , in the maternal organism. With this physical body we then united, to undergo our period of earthly existence, between birth anddeath. Long before this, as I said, we were beings of soul and spirit. What we were, and what we experienced there, is very different from what we experience between birth and death here on Earth. Hence it is h a r d t o d e s c r i b e t h e e x p e r i e n c e s b e t w e e n d e a t h a n d a n e w b i r t h ; t h e y are so utterly different from earthly conditions. Man models his ideas on h i s e a r t h l y e x p e r i e n c e s , a n d i t i s t o t h e s e i d e a s t h a t w e m u s t a l w a y s h a v e recourse for our descriptions. T o-day, however, we will not dwell so much on the character of man within the world of soul and spirit; we w i l l r a t h e r e n v i s a g e h i m , t o b e g i n w i t h , o n h i s d e s c e n t , w h e n h e a p p r o a c h e s t h e E a r t h t o i m b u e h i m s e l f w i t h a n e w p h y s i c a l b o d y . Before he approaches his physical body - or rather the germ, the em- bryo, of it \u2014 man draws into himself the forces of the etheric Universe. Here on Earth we live in the physical world - in the world character ised by all that we see with the senses and understand with earthly in tellect. But there is nothing in this world that is not permeated by the etheric world. And before man gets the inclination to unite \u2014 through the embryo - with the physical world, he draws to himself the forces of the etheric world, and, in so doing, he forms his own etheric body. But to say that man clothes himself with his etheric body is to say very little. We must enter a little more closely into the nature and constit ution of this body. The etheric body , as it forms and develops itself in the human being, is a universe in itself - a universe, one might say; in picture-form. At its circumference it manifests something in the nature of Stars, and in1 0 T H E H U M A N H E A R T its lower portion; something that appears more or less as an image of the Earth. It even has in it a kind of image of the Sun-nature and the Moon-nature. This is of great signicance. On our descent into the earthly world, when we draw to ourselves the forces of the universal ether, we actually take with us in our etheric body a kind of image of the cosmos. If we could extract the etheric body of a man at the moment when he is unit ing with the physical, we should have a sphere - far more beautiful thanhas ever been wrougiit by mechanical means \u2014 a sphere complete with Stars and Zodiac and Sun and Moon. These congurations of the etheric body remain during the embryo time, while the human being coalesces more and more with his physical body. They begin to fade away a little, but they remain. Indeed they remain right on into the seventh year - that is, until the change of teeth. In the etheric body of the little child, this cosmic sphere is still quite recognisable. But with the seventh year - with the change of teeth - these forms that we behold in the etheric body begin to ray out, in a manner of speaking. Previously they were more star-like; now they be gin to be like rays. The stars dissolve away in the human ether-body; but as they do so they become rays, rays with a tendency to come together inwardly. All this goes on gradually throughout the period of life between the change of teeth and puberty . At puberty the process is so far advanced that these rays, having grown together here in the centre, form as it were a distinct structure - a distinct etheric structure of their own. The stars have faded out, while the structure which has gathered in the centre be comes especially living. And in the midst of this central etheric structure, at the time of puberty, the physical heart, with its blood-vessels, is sus pended. So we have this strange phenomenon of the star-ether-body drawing inwards. As etheric body it is, of course, present throughout the human being, but in later life it is undifferentiated at the periphery of the org anism \u2014 very little can be distinguished in it there. On the other hand, during the time from the change of teeth until puberty, it is intensely radiant, raying from without inwards. Then it gathers itself together, and there, clearly suspended within it, is the physical heart. You must not suppose that until then man has no etheric heart. Cer tainly he has one, but he obtains it differently from the way in which he acquires the etheric heart that will now be his. For the gathered radiance that arises at the time of puberty becomes the true etheric heart of man.T H E H U M A N H E A R T U The etheric heart he has before this time is one that he received as a heritage through the inherent forces of the embryo. When a man getshis etheric body , and with it makes his way into the physical organism, a kind of etheric heart \u2014 a substitute etheric heart, so to speak \u2014 is drawn together by the forces of the physical body . He keeps this etheric heart during his childhood years, but then it gradually decays, (this may not be a very beautiful expression, by our usual standards, but it meets the case exactly .) The rst etheric heart slowly decays, and in its stead, as it were constantly replacing that which falls out in the etheric process of decay, there comes the new, the real, etheric heart. This etheric heart is a concentration of the whole cosmic sphere we brought with us as an ether-form, a faithful image of the cosmos, when we proceeded through conception and birth into this earthly life. Thus we can trace, throughout the time from birth or conception until puberty, a distinct change in the whole etheric form that the human being bears within him. One may describe it by saying: Not until puberty does the human being possess his own etheric heart - that is, the etheric heart formed out of his own etheric body , and not supplied provisionally by external forces. All the etheric forces that are working in man until puberty tend to endow him with this fresh etheric heart. It is, in the etheric sphere, a process comparable to the change of teeth. For, as you know, until the change of teeth we have our inherited teeth, these are cast out, and their place is taken by the second teeth \u2014 those that are truly our own. So, likewise, the etheric heart we have until puberty is cast out, and we now get our own. That is the point \u2014 we get our own etheric heart. But now there is another process running parallel with this. When we observe man just after his entry into the physical world \u2014 i.e. as a very young child - we nd a multitude of single organs distinguishable in his astral body. Man, as I have said, builds for himself an etheric heart, which is an image of the outer universe. In his astral body, however, he brings with him an image of the experiences he has uncfergone, between his last death and his present birth. Much, very much, can be seen in this astral body of a little child, great secrets are inscribed there. Much can be seen there of what the human being has experienced between his last death and his present birth. Moreover, the astral body is highly differen tiated, individualised. And now, this is the peculiar thing: during the very time when the aforesaid process is taking place in the etheric body , this highly differen tiated astral body becomes more and more undifferentiated. Originally it is an entity of which we can say it comes from another world, from a w o r l d w h i c h i s n o t t h e r e i n t h e p h y s i c a l , o r e v e n t h e e t h e r i c u n i v e r s e . B y the time of puberty , all that is living in this astral body - as a multitude12THE HUMAN HEARTT H E H U M A N H E A R T13 of single forms and*structures \u2014 slips into the physical organs \u2014 primarily into those organs which are situated (to speak approximately) above the d i a p h r a g m . M a r v e l l o u s s t r u c t u r e s , r a d i a n t l y p r e s e n t i n t h e a s t r a l b o d y i nthe rst days of life, slip by degrees into the brain-formation and sat urate the organs of the senses. Then, other structures slip into the breath i n g o r g a n i s m ; o t h e r s a g a i n i n t o t h e h e a r t , a n d t h r o u g h t h e h e a r t i n t o t h e arteries. Into the stomach they do not come directly; it is only through the arteries that they eventually spread into the abdominal organs. Thus we see the whole astral body , which man brings with'him through birth into this physical existence - we see it diving down gradually into the organs. It slides into the organs. This way of putting it is quite true to reality , though naturally it sounds strange to the habitual ideas of today . By the time we have grown to adult life, our organs have imprisoned in themselves the several forms and structures of our astral body. Precisely herein lies the key to a more intimate knowledge of the human organs; they cannot be truly understood unless we also under stand the astral which man brings with him. We must know in the rst place that every single organ bears within it, in a sense, an astral inher itance, even as the etheric heart is, to begin with, an inheritance. More over, we must know that this inherited astral becomes permeated grad- uaUy , through and through, with that which man brings with him as hisown astral body , which dives down bit by bit into the physical and etheric organs. The heart is an exception, in a certain sense. Here, too, an astral part dives down; but in the heart not only the astral process, but the etheric, too, is concentrated. Therefore the heart is the uniquely important organ which it is for man. The astral body becomes more and more indenite, for it sends into the physical organs the concrete forms which it brings with it from an other hfe. It sends them down into the physical organs, so that they are imprisoned there; and thereby the astral body itself becomes more or less like a cloud of mist. But \u2014 and this is the interesting thing \u2014 while from this side the astral body turns into a cloud of mist, new differen tiations come into it from another side \u2014 first slowly, then with fuU regularity and increasingly from the age of puberty onwards. When the baby is kicking with its little legs, you notice very little of this in the astral body. True,, the effects are there, but the differen tiations which the astral body has brought with it are far more intense. Gradually these forms disappear, they slide into the physical organs. The astral body more and more becomes a cloud of mist. When the child kicks and dgets, all manner of effects come up into the astral body from these childish movements, but they impinge on what they nd there, they are cast back and disappear again. It is as though you madean impression on an elastic ball: the ball recovers its shape immediately. All this, however, changes proportion as the child learns to speak and develops ideas which are retained in memory. We then see how his move ments - intelligent movements, now, walldng about, moving the arms, and so on - are increasingly retained in the astral body. Y es, indeed, untold things can be inscribed in this astral body . When you are forty-ve years old, almost all your movements are inscribed in traces there, and many other things, too, as we shall see. The astral body can absorb very much of all that has taken place since you learned to speak and think and since its own conguration was dissolved. Into this undifferentiated entity all that we do now is inscribed \u2014 the move ments of our arms and legs, and not only these, but all that we accomp lish through our arms and legs. For instance, when we hold a pen in writing, all that we thus accomplish in the outer world is there inscribed. When we chop wood, or if we give someone a box on the ears, all is in scribed into the astral body. Even when we do not do something our selves, but give instructions to a person and he does it, this, too, is inscri bed, through the relation of the content of our words to what the persondoes. In short, the whole of man's activity which nds expression in the outer world is written into the astral body; so does the astral body become in manifold ways congurated throu^ all our human actions. This process, as I said, begins when the child learns to speak - learns to embody thoughts in speech. It does not apply to ideas which the child revives, but cannot afterwards remember . It be^s from the time towhich he can remember back, with ordinary consciousness, in later life. And now the strange thing is:all that is thus inscribed in the astral b o d y h a s a t e n d e n c y t o m e e t i n w a r d l y , j u s t a s t h e r a d i a t i o n s o f t h e e t h e r - body meet in the etheric heart. All that our human deeds are - this, too, comes together within. Moreover, this has a kind of outer causation. Simply as human beings on Earth, we are bound to enter into manyforms of activity. This activity expres^s itself, as I said just now, throughout the astral body. But there is a perpetual resistance. The in fluences that are exerted on the human organism cannot always go right up, as it were. There is always a certain resistance; they are driven down again. All that we do, in connection with our physical organs, tends to stream upwards to the head, but the human organisation prevents it from reaching there. Hence these influences collect together and form a kind of astral centre. This, once again, is clearly developed at the time of puberty. At thesame place where the etheric heart - our own etheric heart - has formed itself, we now have an astral structure too, which gathers together all our actions. And so from puberty a central organ is created wherein all our doing, all our human activity, is centred. It is so indeed: in the veryT H E H U M A N H E A R T region where man has his heart, all his activity is centralised - central ised, in this case, neither physically nor etherically, but astrally. And the important thing is that in the time when puberty occurs (naturally, the astral events coincide only approximately with the physical) man's own etheric heart is so far formed that it can receive these forces which develop out of our activity in the outer world. Thus we can truly say (and in so saying we mark a real event in the human inner being); from puberty onwards Man's whole activity becomes inserted, via the astral body , in his etheric heart - in that which has grown out of the pictures of the stars, out of the images of the Cosmos. This is a phenomenon of untold importance. For, my dear friends, we have here a joining-together with the Cosmos of what man does in this world. In the heart, as far as the etheric universe is concerned, you have a Cosmos gathered up into a centre; while at the same time, as far as the astral is concerned, you have a gathering-together of all that man does in the world. This is the point where the Cosmos \u2014 the cosmic process \u2014 is joined to the Karma of man. This intimate correspondence of the astral body with the etheric body is to be found nowhere in the human organism except in the region of the heart. But there, in truth, it is. Man has brought with him through birth an image of the Universe in his etheric body, and the entire Uni verse, which is there within him as an essence, receives all that he does and permeates itself with it. By this constant coming-together - this mutual permeation - the opportunity is given throughout human life for human actions to be instilled into the essence of the images of the Cosmos. Then when man passes through the gate of Death, this ethereal astral structure \u2014 wherein the heart is floating, so to speak \u2014 contains all that man takes with him into his further life of soul and spirit, when he has laid aside the physical and the etheric forms. Now, as he expands ever more widely in the Spirit, he can hand over his entire Karma to the Cos mos, for the substance of the vdiole Cosmos is contained within him; it is drawn together in his heart, in the etheric body of his heart. It came from the Cosmos and changed into this etheric entity , then it was gather ed up as an essence in the heart, and now it tends to return into the Cos mos once more. The human being expands into the Cosmos. He is re ceived into the world of souls. He undergoes what I described in my book, Theosophy, as the passage through the world of souls and then through spirit-land. Indeed, and in truth it is so. When we consider the human organisation in its becoming, we can say to ourselves: In the region of the heart t h e r e t a k e s 4 ) l a c e a u n i o n o f t h e C o s m o s w i t h t h e e a r t h l y r e a l m , a n d i n this way the Cosmos, with its cosmic conguration, is taken into ourTHE HUMAN HEART etheric body . There it makes ready to receive all our actions, all that we do in life. Then we go outward again,together with everything that has formed itself within us through this intimate permeation of the cosmic ethereal with our own human actions. So do we enter again into a new cosmic existence, having passed through the gate of Death. Thus we have now described in a quite concrete form how the human being lives his way into his physical body , and how he is able to draw himself out of it again, because his deeds have given him the force to hold together what he had rst formed within him as an essence out of the Cosmos. The physical body, as you know, is formed within the physical and earthly world by the forces of heredity; that is, the forces of the embryo. What man brings with him from the spiritual world, having rst drawn together his etheric body, comes into union with this. But we must now go further . In the astral, that wonderful entity he has brought with him, there lives the Ego, which, having passed through many earthly lives, has a l o n g e v o l u t i o n b e h i n d i t . T h i s E g o l i v e s i n a c e r t a i n c o n n e c t i o n o f s y m pathy with all the complex forms that are present in the astral body . (By using the word 'sympathy' in this connection, I am once more des cribing something absolutely real.) Then, when these astral forms slidem t o t h e o r g a n s o f t h e p h y s i c a l , a s e x p l a i n e d a b o v e , t h e E g o r e t a i n s t h i s s y m p a m y ' a n d e x t e n d s t h e s a m e i n n e r s y m p a t h y t o t h e o r g a n s t h e m - Au increasingly into the organs and takes pos- rlSn to childhood, indeed, the Ego is in a certainrelation to the organs.

It slides into the organs ofthe lung, and, with the blood-vessels that pass from the lung to the heart approaches nearer and nearer to the heart. More and more closely unitedwith the blood-circulation, it follows the paths of the blood. By way of the forces that run along the courses of the blood, the Ego enters into that which has been formed from the union of the etheric and the astral heart, wherein an etheric from the Cosmos grows together with an astral from ourselves. As I said, this astral body comes by degrees to contain an uncountable amount, for all our actions are written in it. And that is not all. Inso-16 T H E H U M A N H E A R T 17 much as the Ego has a relation of sympathy to all that the astral body does, our intentions, our ideas, too, are inscribed there \u2014 the intentions and ideas, I mean, out of which we perform our actions. Here, then, you have a complete linking up of Karma with the laws of the whole Cosmos. Of all that thus goes on within the human being, people today know ^heartily little' (herzlich wenig); and we can repeat the words with emphasis, for all these things, of which the people of today are ig norant, relate to the human heart. They know what goes on here in the physical world, and they consider it in relation to moral Jaws. The true fact is that all that happens in the moral life, and all that happens physically in the world, are brought together precisely in the human heart. These two \u2014 the moral and the physical \u2014 which run so indep endently and side by side for modem consciousness today , are found in their real union when we learn to understand all the congurations of the human heart. Naturally , all that takes place in the heart is far more hidden than the event which happens openly with the change of teeth. We have our in herited teeth; then we form teeth again out of our own organism. The former fall away , the latter remain. The former have an inherent tenden cy to go under; nor could they ever keep themselves intact, even if they did not fall out. The permanent teeth, on the other hand, are destroyed chiefly by extraneous conditions - including, of course, those of the organism itself. Likewise at puberty: in an invisible way, our etheric heart is given over to disintegration, and we now acquire a kind of per manent ether-heart. Only this permanent ether-heart is fully adapted to receive into it self our activities. Therefore it makes a great difference whether a human being dies before puberty or after. When he dies before puberty, he has only the tendency for what he has done on Earth to be karmically in herited later on. Even when children die before puberty , this or that can certainly be incorporated in their Karma, but it is always rather vague and fleeting. The forming of Karma, properly speaking, begins only at the moment when the astral heart takes hold of the etheric heart and they join together. This, indeed, is the real organism for the forming of Karma. For, at death, what is gathered up and concentrated there in the human being becomes increasingly cosmic; and in our next earthly life it is incorporated in the human being once again out of the Cosmos. Everything we do, accordingly , concerns not ourselves alone. Incorpor ated within us is something that comes from the Cosmos and retains the tendency , after our death, to give over our deeds to the Cosmos once more. For it is from the Cosmos that the karmic laws work themselves out, fashioning our Karma. So do we bear the effects of what the Cosm o s m a k e s o f o u r d e e d s b a c k a g a i n i n t o e a r t h l y l i f e , a t t h e b e g i n n i n g o f our next life on Earth.THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND Edited by Alistair Macdonald Introduction The 1977Golden Blade tookas one of its themes the spiritual task of Europe, particularly as embodied in the mysterious gure of Kaspar Hauser. For the 1978 Golden Blade 1 have been asked to gather from a num ber of people some brief accounts of their hopes and fears for the future of England - England specically, for Scotland and Wales show vigorous intentions of developing in their own characteristic ways, while the character and future role of England seem, in many respects, un certain and obscure. The size of the response has exceeded my expectations. For a number of people the time was too short to write even briefly on such a theme; but here are seventeen contributions from people in a wide range of ages and accupations. On a voyage of discovery such as this there are many hazards to be faced, with little hope that they can all be avoided. 1 hope that what has been brought back will at least enable the reader to feel that the undertaking was worth while.

W e may agree on the relevance of a certain fact or pro cess for the social situation of our country , and still disagree on whether to look at this phenomenon as another example of the sad destruction of civilised values or as the sign of a healthy development. The reasons for this fortunate and fertile disagreement are twofold. Rudolf Steiner, in order not to impinge on our freedom, was seldom explicit in moral and social matters, and when he was outspoken \u2014 as so often in the years of the Threefold Social Movement and, later, in the crisis of the Society (1923) - he often spoke to the deaf. How difcult it is to wean oneself from the habits of the society in which one grew up happily can be seen in the following episode. A fellow anthroposophist and good friend told me of a factory where the workers demanded a pay rise. They said to the management that they realised1 8 T H O U G H T S O N T H E F U T U R E O F E N G L A N D the rm could not afford it, but this was not their fault and somehow the company would have to nd the money. My reaction was one of anger over the short-sighted, self-destructive attitude of the British worker, until my friend pointed out that this was pure Steiner: Labour costs must be independent of economic protability, they are a given fact, like the cost of raw materials involved in manufacture. We can go further. Is there anyone who describes more lovingly than Steiner the divine and cosmic order of the natural world, and the beauty and wisdom of the great cultures of the past, divinely led and hierarchi cally structured? We learn to look at the laws of the stars, to admire the wisdom of the group soul of the spider, to receive the words of the initiate with greatest respect. We learn to re-live imaginatively the many historical forms of a hierarchic or feudal society in which order prevailed; each one of us had a given social role to play and most of us were secure and content - indeed happy, because, in the words of an Indian friend of mine, 'we loved our father.' Having learned to appreciate the laws of the cosmos, the wonders of nature and the beauties of ancient civilisations, it comes as a shock to us' to hear that all this glory is not meant for us. God-given society lies in ruins so that the individual may painfully emerge; the world of nature has become cold, the wrought work of the Gods, and we have continued to destroy it further. Man is on the way to become the fourth Hierarchy . The world of nature, for better or worse, lies now in his power. The new society will be made in the same image. The prospect is so fraught with danger, the future so uncertain, that we often prefer not to look at it at all, and instinctively cling to the past. When frightened by the dangers of the future, when overawed by the glories of the past, we may contemplate the enormous expectation of the Gods in allowing us this role to play. In a religious mood we can meditate on the patience of and tolerance of the Father, Who willed such an awe-inspiring situation. But in less contemplative moments our attitudes and our judgments will vary a great deal, and so there is a fecial stimulus and interest when anthroposophists discuss contemp orary and social questions. Do we cling to the past? Do we help to bring it down? Do we concentrate on an ideal in a nebulous future? Do we act now? Rudolf lissau WHAT'S THE REAL 'NEWS'?

For those who can look and perceive, a counter-impulse towards harmony, compassion, gentleness and co operation is appearing everjwhere. Yet this may remain unnoticed un less we can grasp the holistic vision, the spiritual Weltanschauang. That is why it is so important to talk the world-picture of Oneness. If it be true that we are all integrally part of the vast and dynamic Unity of Universal Life, then none of our problems or situations can any longer be separated and seen or be solved in materialistic isolation. Look, then, at the trends, in young and old alike. Many aspects of the new awakening may still be seed-activities, as easily crushed as a rst snovdrop, but we well know that the force behind Spring is irresistible. Thus among so many is a deep dissatisfaction, a longing for a different and more humane set of values, a quest for meaning. Does this not show itself in simplifying, a readiness to cut out aspects of living which are wasteful and extravagant and meaningless? This releases funds which can be used on the more meaningful. So many look for creative outlets, turn ing again towards the crafts and the country , trying to grow organic vegetables, seeking for whole food that we may eat only life and light and cleanse the bloodstream. This food revolution is, of course, integrally part of the spiritual awakening in our time and is central among the alternative therapies. W e are seeing the rise of a healing movement feeling its way into a new soc i e t y , w o r k i n g o n l a w s o f h a r m o n y a n d c o m p a s s i o n \u2014 g o o d E s s e n e d o ctrine that all human suffering and distress is brought about by deviation f r o m t h e O n e L a w a n d t h a t t h e h e a l i n g l i e s i n o u r s t o p p i n g d o i n g t h e things that put u^ out of attunement.For the holistic world-view certainly implies that the living Universei s m u c h c o n c e r n e d n o w w i t h t h e r e d e m p t i o n o f o u r p o U u t e d p l a n e t a r i d that angelic energies are indeed being released into human consciousness a n d e n v i r o n m e n t t o b r i n g g r e a t c h a n g e s .

We can sense new stirrings of compassion, revulsion against the barbarism of factory farming, vivisection and bloodsports, a realisation that all crueltyis indivisible and that man is loading himself with a huge karmic debt through his violent treatment of the kingdoms of nature. What has been called a 'partnership of concern' moves through our society . With this comes a changing attitude to death and the beginnings of the lifting of the weight of fear . This is a key aspect in the re-awakening to the knowledge that man is in core a spiritual being in a universe spirit ual in its nature. The telepathic contact with those to whom we are closely linked out of the body becomes for many a vital source of joy ,a n d t h e w h o l e m o v e m e n t t o w a r d s c r e a t i v e a c t i o n f o r t h e s p i r i t i s s t r e n g t h ^ ened with every great soul who moves on.20 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND 21 The concept of re-incarnation becomes common knowledge, and the media increasingly present programmes giving serious consideration to E.S.P. and the like. James Elroy Flecker's quatrain well expresses our situation: Awake, awake, the world is young For all its weary years of thought. The starkest ghts must still be fought The most surprising songs be sung. We come to feel that we are all playing a part in the greatest saga of human history and that Change on a great scale is upon us as a clean sing operation on the planet. And the change chiefly works within us, so that each is called upon to take full inner responsibility and try to be come an effective channel for the creative source. This must inevitably begin to show itself in new artistic expression, for this immense picture is the greatest theme for drama, ballet, poetry , music and painting. Thus we may veritably be watching the beginnings of a new renaissance, pot entially greater than the last since it is now based on man's deliberate and conscious co-operation with the Living Whole of Spirit. This is 'News'! Increasingly the media will awaken to the fact that something is happening which counters the gloom and despair and that beyond the negativity and limitation of our time is an ocean of joy and release. There never was such a time to be alive \u2014 or, for that matter, dead! For Life Eternal impinges upon us, and all who are caught up with this excitement begin to see the prospect of a new society forming in the wreck of the old. \"Look up, for your salvation draweth nigh.\" We have to look and think somewhat apocalyptically if we ar6 to grasp what is happening. Since the rampant lion in England's heraldic coat of arms has lost his dignity, our task is to recrown her Unicorn. George Trevelyan NEW UFE FOR THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE The English language has spread out all over the world. It is used by people who have never learnt it, who have made it into something quitedifferent for their own ends, who mishandle it. No longer does it belong to England, but it has taken the flavour of English history wherever it goes. It came into existence no one quite knows how or why , against the probability that Norman Frendi would prevail for a much longer timeand that Anglo-Saxon, already on the way out, would become archaic. It was born among poets, many known only by rumour but as vigorous as those whose poems have in part survived. Through this vigour of heart, Latin gradually ceased to dominate culture and English became a worth while means of expression, both spoken and written.Nowadays the language is in danger of such simplication that it may cease to carry meaning. We can notice that it comes to life whenever thoughts are put into pictures. It has an inborn talent for words and ex pressions in which the outer and the inner meet, in which the spiritual is revealed in parables. Right back in its beginnings the talent began to show in such a poem as that of Chaucer to the daisy . The flower , the dawn, the eye of day, the new birth of the soul, the world reborn to all that is yet to come, are there in a few words. But it is and remains hard to put into exact English phrases ideas of a philosophical nature. It is an artistic language, liable to escape from grammar and rule into sounds and shapes required by experience. It calls for poets more than philosophers. It can be mangled by inartistic speakers and writers. What shall be done with the English language? Empty heads can be its ruin. Great ideas with spiritual substance, thought with vigour , put into imaginative pictures, spoken of, written about, made the content of conversation, will and should bring new life into the words. What is spiritually real carried over into artistic form would be its re-juvenation. Blake's idea that every Christian must be an artist is realised in the cele bration of the new Christian ritual in the Christian Community. When there is no ritual, religion can never be artistic at heart. In the art of speech, words spoken well, out of the being of the whole person and brought to life in recitation, or words enacted in the true movements of E u r y t h m y , c o m e a l i v e i n h u m a n e x p e r i e n c e . T h e l a n g u a g e b r e a t h e s d e e p ly again. Each single person to whom English belongs, treating the language with respect, thinking well and clearly , careful of what he says, is taking the treasure of England into his hands. Of such are the real guardians of the words which are inherited from the poets. There is an old saying, Where there is no vision, the people perish'. It could be repeated, 'Where there is no vision, the words peiish'. Where there is vision, they come to life again. Evelyn Capel A N E W R O M A N T I C R E V I V A L There are signs \u2014 not all of them pleasant \u2014 that a phase of England's literary history is ending. I mean the phase which began early in this century and has been dominated by the exponents of \"classical\" order notably T . S. Eliot. It originated, perhaps, as a counterweight to the ex perimental energies and expressive manifestations following liberationfrom the Victorian spectre, and (like the earlier \"classicism\" of the eighteenth century) was rmly established after two wars had made e v e r y o n e o p e n l y d i s t r u s t f u l o f R o m a n t i c e n e r g i e s . C r i t i c a l t h o u g h t f o ll o w e d s u i t , a n d d e c l a r e d R o m a n t i c i s m f r a n k l y u n r e s p e c t a b l e22 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLANDTHOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND23 All this is rapidly changing, and the national virtues of reticence and conservatism are endangered; creative writers are growing mystical, audacious and incoherent by turns; critics no longer think Blake insane, and if these things continue, Shelley may even be read again. Whether English Romanticism will be prepared to join hands with Anthroposophy as the mature successor of its European counterpart is something that can only be awaited with eagerness and trepidation. My anxieties, in this literary context, really concern English Anthrop osophy - for I am concerned that there should be an English strain of an identiably German original. It is true that it has drawn little support from our \"national virtues\", or from ofcial academicism, so that it is easy to see the only future road in a revolution from below, in a sort of apocalyptic dualism. My hope (possibly premature) is that not only may the serious new interest in Romantic philosophy lead to some wider appreciation of Rudolf Steiner ,but ultimately to a more happily dom iciled Anthroposophy with some roots in the sensibility of En^h Romanticism. Andrew Welburn THE SERVANT OF ALL What English heart is not moved by old John of Gaunt -' This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England .... this dear, dear land.... 'These words nd an echo in us, as in those vdio heard them more than three hundred years ago. What a stretch of history lies between! Shakespeare set the seal onthe mission of England. The echo in our hearts, thou^, is vastly different from that which resounded then with such high expectation from this seat of Mars. It was not long before Louis XIV was defeated, and Fred erick the Great referred to as Chatham's paid mercenary to keep the continent occupied while he conquered and annexed the rest of the world. Such men as Wolfe and Olive, Nelson and Wellington, dominated outer history and nally the enormous power of trade and industry dom inated the world. And now! and now! All the power and pride has evaporated into thin air. All that is left is the state and pageantry which surround the Queen. But she does not rule, she serves. From there being a Monarch who per sonied England in power, she is now the servant of all. At the age of twenty-one she dedicated her life to the service of all her peoples. To this she has been faithful. At the Guildhall during the Jubilee celebra tions she refened to that dedication, saying that she did not wish to re tract one word from her promise. It is surely this example of selfless service that has struck a chord in so many people. Prince Charles has taken up the same impulse in his Jubilee Appeal, which is to enable young people to help old people - Not I but my brother.They are all. still there - the Lord Chamberlain, the Master of the Queen's Horse, the Lord Constable of England and all the rest. Quite empty and completely out of date, you may say. Y es, indeed, but per haps they provide a thread leading back to what ms once a reality , and now, colourful and dignied, they surround and provide a frame for that which indeed belongs to the Folk Spirit of England \u2014 the way of selflessness which, in a certain quite denite and clear way, is personied in the Queen. This is one facet of this precious stone. The others must also be made to shine and sparkle. But they can do so only from a powerful spiritual impulse. Let us resolve to strive with all-out strength to unite with our Folk Spirit in service to the Spirit of our Time, that the mission of this land may stream out across the world, not in domination but in selfless ness. The way of England is the way of John the Baptist. David Qement T H E N E W J E R U S A L E M A new national anthem is what we need. This old imagination of imperialist England with God on our side confounding the 'knavish tricks' of our enemies no longer satises. It's just not possible anymore to stand up truthfully within that image of self-condent, unquestioning, superior English manhood. The Women's Institutes know Wil liam Blake's so-called 'Jerusalem', where 'mental ght' replaces imperial ist aggression, is more a relevant song. Blake declared it his purpose Ho cast off Bacon Locke and Newton from Albion's covering; to take off his lthy garments and clothe him with imagination' - Albion being his vision of the Being of England. Well, it was our destiny to take on that scientic task, to establish Empire, to enter materialism, but now that we have entered and the rst energy of it seems spent, Blake's message grows urgent. He is em erging as the image of a new type of Englishmen - 'Rouze up, 0 Young Men of the New Age! set your foreheads against the ignorant Hirelings! For we have Hirelings in the Camp, the Court & the University, who would, if they could, for ever depress Mental & prolong Corporeal War!'\u2014 a cry which during these last ten years students have directly taken up. There is such an energy in Blake. In his early poetry he takes the Devil to embody not evil but energy, as expressed in some of his 'Prov erbs of Hell' - The Tygers of Wrath are wiser than the Horses of Instr uction,' of 'Enough, or too much!' or 'Exuberance is beauty' - not exactly the kind of Hell the Engli^ feel comfortable in, our exuberancein beauty having been whitewashed over by the Puritans. 'Poetry fetter'd fetters the Human race ' Blake recognised whata disaster Puritanism had been for the English character; how it fettered the genius of one of our greatest poets - MIL T ON being the title and24 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND25 hero of one of Blake's great epics in which the Puritan poet returns, through Blake, to cast off *Moral Virtue, that cruel Virgin Babylon.' Few listened to Blake during his lifetime, but in our transitional time, when England seemingly has lost energy or direction for her energy , Blake's anthem begins to sing in us of that New Jerusalem to be built 'in Eng land's green and pleasant land.' I think of Blake's disciple, Samuel Palmer - his painting of the Magic Appletree bursting out of the hillside impossibly laden down with'fruit. 0 there's too much nostalgia in it, yes (the shepherd still piping there under the trees), but an exuberance too, and it's available to\" us again after the Wasteland we have been through. We begin to reject that dead history which drags so at our feet and to take seriously what John Michell, for instance, has been investigating \u2014 the Dragon Paths or Ley lines (lines of energy) criss-srossing our land scapes (no place is real unless rst it is imagined), Stonehenge, Avebury , Glastonbury etc. being nodal points; history as a continuous source of energy. It is out of some intuition of a power still in the land that Pop festivals are held at such centres; out of a feeling that England has some Grail or Michaelic task still to full, for all along these Dragon Paths there are churches dedicated to St. Michael. We begin to reject the bourgeois household, cut off as it is from the landscape and so polluting it. When Blake spoke about the 'dark Satanic mills' of England he was referring certainly to the horric industrial dev elopments he saw around him, but also, it seems, to those dark mills of the intellect vdiich produced that external situation. likewise with his Jerusalem image: on one level it has to do with imaginative thinking, while on another it's surely what we mean these days by 'ecology' (from the Greek Oihos, a house), a respect for the poetry actually at work in things. This is the new household which embraces landscape and coanos - not a rejection of science, not a mere return to nature, but a science of the imagination. And it seems to me that the exuberant but chaotic energy among young people ten years ago is nding some direction here. Must nd if English culture is to renew itself; and Blake's Jerusalem (fanciful though it seems) is the living image of it, charged with energy for the future. Paul Matthews FAIR ENOUGH Man's actions have a threefoldness which is not identical with the threefoldness of his body . On the one hand we have the principle of free creativeness, which affects no-one but oneself, and, opposing this, the principle of equality in the face of universal law. Between these two we must always decide how far the one principle should be allowed to influence the other . For such decisions there is no xed law . They will depend on our degree of insight, tolerance and responsibility . Here, freedom cannot be divorced from responsibility . The ability to decide wisely is an art, not a system, and can be dev eloped only from man to man, and from moment to moment. But if a group of people, however small, succeed in developing it, they will have enormous coherence as a unit. They will give each other opportunitiest o l e a r n , a n d w i l l c a r r y e a c h o t h e r t h r o u g h t h e p r o c e s s o f l e a r n i n g . In our language we have a unique expression: we \"agree to differ .\"W h e n o u r b r o t h e r c l a i m s t h e r i g h t t o a c e r t a i n c o u r s e o f a c t i o n , w e m a y say \"fair enough\", even though his kind of action may not be ours. Our concept of \"fair\" will deepen immeasurably with the penetration of our insight and the widening of our responsibility . Without this art I see no hope of a healthy threefold social order. But it is an art that we mi^t be able to develop here. Other countries have already had to borrow our English word, \"fair\". Couldn't we do more with it ourselves? Fair enough? Michael Wilson B R I T A I N A N D T H E E N G L I S H A map of the world shows the British Isles lying to the north of The European continent, at a latitude which in the rest of the world means frozen winters, but here, owing to the Gulf Stream, a temperate climate. A geological map reveals the mountain regions of Wales and Scotland, and, in England, a varied terrain sloping east and south. Ireland, with its variegated landscape, has been called the Emerald Isle. England, until unity was imposed by the Norman kings, was the most often invaded and conquered part of the British Isles. It has there by the most mixed population, least subject to tribal enmities. The attempts of English rulers to conquer Wales and Scotland failed, and helped to unite these countries as peoples. There were spurious con quests of Ireland. Eventually the geographical situation and the unitingof the four countries under a common ruler , for the time accepted by all, prepared the way for the unfolding of a world-destiny. When we reaDse that the detachment of Holland from Germany and of Portugal from Spain was the work of the guiding spirits of nations, we have to ask, what spirit or spirits guided the four British countries to a unity which could impress itself on the whole world? The presence of Scots, Welsh and Irish occupying their own houses in England, sharing and competing for jobs and being elected as Councillors,a n d M e m b e r s o f P a r l i a m e n t , h a s b e e n t a k e n f o r g r a n t e d b y t h e E n g l i s h W e c a n r i g h t l y r e v e r e t h e C e l t i c c u l t u r e a n d t h e C e l t i c l a n g u a g e s a n d 426 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLANDTHOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND 27 s u p p o r t t h e i r c o n t i n u a n c e i n s o f a r a s t h e y a r e d e m a n d e d ; b u t t h e E n glish language - enriched by writers and poets from all four countries \u2014 is spoken by over 200 million people in the world today . It is an impor tant link connecting link in India and Africa, providing a thread of unity and diversity. Rudolf Steiner once said that the English people had the gift of mat erialism, which I take to mean that they could develop a material civil isation without losing their soul in the process. A political evolution, initiated by the barons through Magna Carta to extend the political influence of their class, led on eventually to univer sal franchise. Democracy in Britain became a fact, an achievement which the rest of humanity could not ignore. The British were also pioneers of the industrial revolution, so suc cessfully that other nations had to follow. It was the observation of ind ustrial capitalism in England by Karl Marx that prompted the Communist Manifesto. One could even say that the British people, secure through centuries to pursue their own destiny , prepared the way both for Amer ican capitalism and for Russian Communism, though desiring neither for themselves. The political, commercial, industrial and nancial innovations of the United Kingdom led to a world Empire almost without intention. But there is no place in the social life of today for a world Empire, and the British people have dissolved theirs. The very factors which together led to a vast increase of population, and, in the 20th century, to comparative affluence, are now in part lia bilities. The main political parties are all split, and those at the centre and at head of affairs have no solution for the immediate problems facing the country. But the resources of skill and character begot through the ages, the possibility of unity in diversity which characterise the British people, could lead to a new solution. There is probably no other country where a \"Human Manifesto\" could be worked out and put into practice for the benet of the social future of humanity. Oliver Matthews HOW THE LIGHT COULD SHINE If one comes from the Continent or Scandinavia to England, one is amazed at her deflated life: unpunctuality , - mail arriving days too late, trains through delays almost always missing the connection; strikes which interrupt and segment the intended flow of life; dirt, slapdash food, inflation, etc. But one can also be amazed at the caring and modest humanity with which people look at and speak to you.Order, cleanliness and riches go towards haughtiness and heartlessness; outer conditionswhich make you suffer, towards brotherliness, a Russian patience and endurance. England was once, through her empire and the industrial revolution, one of the rulers of the world, the position of the \u00a3 her confirmation. Now, as the outer glory had gone, soul-qualities start to shine. When England was a ruler she was very English; to be English meant to be priv ileged, to be looked upon as better and more real than all the other nations of the world. But after World War II we saw that to be English was after all something external; the shining of the soul heralds some thing generally human, not merely English. This turning away from the nationalistic and therefore materialistic and aggressive (materialistic thoughts must socially in the long run breed violence) to the reality of the person, predisposes present-day England to a new Christian world view, as also the Festival of Mind and Body showed. The real being of Man longs for a world-view illumined by the insights of karma and reincarnation, nature understandable through metamorphosis and archetypes, culture understandable through man's evolution, and both united through the being and place of Christ. An adult education which includes religion and faith red by insight, as made possible through Rudolf Steiner and Spiritual Science, and based on the brotherliness previously described, may be more possible in England than anywhere else in the world. Back to the state of England: it is almost obvious that the strikes have not only economic reasons \u2014 only blindness would make these unjustified \u2014 but deeply human reasons also: they express a longing to partake in a stream of human and general education common to all men. We have unfortunately still got castes, in spite of Buddha and the French Revolution \u2014 castes due not so much to money or status, as before the rst World War, but to education in the widest sense (not just school) and world knowledge. And connected with the strikes and their deeper causes is inflation, this other ill which makes England's outer garments shabby. It is obvious \u2014 for those at least who watch British builders - that inflation is also caused by tardy work, intenup- ted by tea-breaks and transistors: a new incentive is needed. T o work in order to earn one's livelihood is no longer good enough. The real being of Man longs for Man, not only for a French, Chinese, English or Italian man. If outer poverty has the effect of revealing theinner , non-nationalistic light, the thou^ts of Bacon, Newton and Dar win, who helped to put on the materialistic straitjacket, will be over come. Peter Roth28 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND29 A WARMTH OF HUMAN INTEREST In following the daily news, few of us who are English can escape feelings of depression about the future of our country . However , weneed to consider that political or economic power is not necessarily a sign of true leadership. The period following the Thirty Y ears W ar , when the German States lost almost all political influence, ^w the fl o w e r i n g o f t h e i r m u s i c a l g e n i u s , - t f t e r t h e F r a n c o - P r u s s i a n W a r , t h o u g hF r a n c e s e e m e d g r e a t l y w e a k e n e d , t h e I m p r e s s i o n i s t s l e d W e s t e r n E u r o p e in the realm of art.

If we look back to the beginning of the century , when England ruled o v e r a g r e a t e m p i r e , w e c a n r i g h t l y a p p r e c i a t e t h e h i g h s t a n d a r d o f r e s p o n s i b i l i t y a n d s e n s e o f s e r v i c e o f h e r a d m i n i s t r a t o r s . B u t t h e r e w a sat the same time a great arrogance. There could be no sympathy for a n y w e a k n e s s w h i c h m i g h t c l o u d o u r i m a g e . T o m e n t i o n t w o a c t u a l e x a m p l e s : a c o n s u l w h o m a r r i e d a h i g h l y - c u l t u r e d T i b e t a n w a s d i s m i s s e dfrom the consular service; a family in a public position kept a backward c h U d h i d d e n a w a y . T h e s u p e r i o r i t y o f t h e E n g l i s h h a d t o b e u p h e l d . T oday such an attitude is rare.

Inter-marriages with other races are not uncommon. In spite of the criminal violence and hooliganism so often reported in the papers, there is increasing interest in other religions and ways of life. Not long ago, in conversation with a German friend, I regretfully commented on the lethargy and lack of incentive among English people today. She replied, \"But you English still have a sort of innocence.\"S h e h a d b e e n t r a v e l l i n g t h r o u g h v a r i o u s p a r t s o f t h e c o u n t r y a n d h a dfound everywhere a fund of easy-going kindliness.

However, we may well ask whether, apart from the easy-going friendliness in England, there is any sign of a new consciousness or of initiative in bringing new impulses, for we can never solve our present p r o b l e m s u n l e s s a t r u e u n d e r s t a n d i n g o f m a n c a n b e a w a k e n e d .The English are still able to express their genius in acts which arise out of practical situations where a warmth of human interest has been k i n d l e d .

When asked how she liked England, she said she had seen nothing of it, but if it was like the nurses and doctors who were treating her, it must be wonderful. She described a contraption of slingsa n d p u l l e y s m a d e t o b r i n g p a r a l y s e d l i m b s i n t o a c t i o n .

The Cheshire Homes are famous, but perhaps their origin is less well known. Group Captain Cheshire attempted to found an ideal self- supporting community for ex-Servicemen. But, like many communitieswithout any common aim, it foundered. However , one queer old mistu s e d t o s a y , \" I d o n ' t t h i n k C h e s h i r e w i l l f a i l . H e ' s t o o b i g . S o m e t h i n g good will come out of all this.\" It was Cheshire's care for this character when he was unwanted and incurably ill, that led to the creation of his rst home for incurables. What was chiefly remarkable about this was the consolation Cheshire could give to the dying. A short while ago a statement appeared in The Times that the rate of suicides in England had declined during the last years, whereas in most other Western countries it had increased. The suggestion was made that the cause of this might well be the devoted work of the Samaritans. Other examples could be cited from the. help given to paraplegics at Stoke Manderville; from Sally Trench's interest in destitute alcoholics and meth drinkers, or from the understanding treatment of psychotic or of handicapped children. We are not concerned here with mere 'do- gooders', but with those who through interest and intelligence act in tuitively and bring new impulses which can be taken up and developed. Illustrations can of course be found in other realms of life, such as in work on the land or in a building up a particular craft. It is hardly surprising that the English, who rst inaugurated the Industrial Revolution, should also be the rst to witness the breakdown of its material success. It is easy to see the decay of a traditional order, but much more difcult to observe the seeds of a new culture which have hardly begun to sprout. Judging by the young people who leave our schools, many today are more sympathetic and perceptive than the well- disciplined students of the days of England's greatness, when it was the required conduct to hide one's feelings and keep a stiff upper lip. While there is a widespread interest today in helping those who have lost30 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLANDT H O U G H T S O N T H E F U T U R E O F E N G L A N D 31 heart or faUed to take up their lives again with conscious aims, we should not despair of the future. Eileen Hutchins KNOWLEDGE ENTRUSTED TO US For many years now I have been concerned with children who have developmental problems and their families. It is clear that, while there isan enormous fund of goodwill in society towards these families, there is a great sense of helplessness. Despite massive welfare assistance, so many children still meet apparently insuperable obstacles in their path to a full flowering of their potential. Here I sense a yawning gap of knowledge. There is plenty of theory , but little practically helpful observation of children and their needs available to the worker at grass-roots level. We know that Steiner based his suggestions in Waldorf Education on a total living picture of the growing, developing child. Teachers in our Waldorf Schools, and particularly experienced class teachers, develop a vast store of effective knowledge. Yet the millions of children and thou sands of workers in this country who so badly need at least some of this knowledge can gain no access to it. It remains so far available only to the privileged few. The anxiety that the situation causes, and the guilt that it induces, become well nigh intolerable from time to time. My deep wish is that there shall be established in this country a high-school activity in Anthroposophical Child Psychology , as represen ted in all the knowledge and work on Waldorf Education. That this work shall be carried on as a background to the Waldorf Education movement but shall serve also to make its impulse and knowledge freely available to the many who so badly need it. The standard of this work must and can be of academic calibre - we owe this to the content of Steiner work, which can only benet in authority from such an approach. It is time we built an accessible thought-structure out of the knowledge that Steiner entrusted to us. Such high-school work will also lead in time to regular conferences at which aspects of child development can be . thoroughly examined in re lation to modern theories and dilemmas. These conferences would give teachers, social workers, doctors and many other concerned profession al workers a forum and an opportunity to refresh their thinking. In timeit may become a resource of strength and new ideas for the many strug gling workers in the eld. If we do not seize this opportunity now to make the badly-needed knowledge available, as Steiner intended, we may nd that mechanisa tion and experiment take over more and more, while the experiences that nourish the soul of the child most richly become unavailable because the knowledge of their vital importance has been lost. This result would be due to our dereliction of the duty laid upon us by the privilege of learning about Steiner's work. Eva Frommer HEALTH FESTIVALS Leamington Spa, Olympia and now (August 1977) Malvern Hills \u2014 is it signicant that the phenomenon of health festivals has, for the time being at any rate, appeared only in England? On these occasions there is on display a wide variety of unorthodox therapies, of meditation syst ems, of nutritional practices etc.; care of the soil is fundamental in many of them. Of course England is by no means the only country where increasing interest in a doctrine of wholeness is nding expression in a multitude of ways. But the bringing together at one place of such many-sided gropings for more deeply founded values in life seems to be unique. It is perhaps an indication of the typically English desire to rationalise, to nd a unifying principle which could lead to a practical and systematic develop ment more in keeping with the pragmatic side of the English character. There is a danger that the quest may become degraded by a barren reliance on the intellect; there is a hope that it could open a wider gate to the realisation of the Consciousness Soul. John Soper UNDERSTANDING TEENAGE NEEDS The future of society rests with successive waves of teenagers. Some one of fourteen today will be nearly fty by the year 2000. But the relationship of youth to schools, workplaces, families, neighbourhoods and to society is problematic. Companies are reluctant to employ \"prob lem\" teenagers; there is much youth unemployment; schools nd it difcult to cope, as also do families. Y et many teenagers are involved in conservation, social service, apprenticeships, travel, training and creativeactivities on an unparalleled scale.32 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGALND 33 In tribal societies, teenagers were taught to obey the values given by the ancestors through the elders. They were cast in the mould of age long, unchanging tradition. In industrial society, teenagers are expected to acdept the 'system', with its emphasis on economic growth, material- ian, competition for resources and technical excellence. They are expec ted to conform, to make things work more efciently, nationally and economically. Since the dawn of the twentieth century, younger generations have brought new capacities, gifts, imaginations and vision with which they could renew,,even transform, industrial society. The future is no longer an extension of the past or present, but a work to be created. T eenagers do not know \"what they are going to be\", for their future is open-ended. They are pioneers in a new country, immigrants in time, with a clearer vision than ours, and are touched with the re of the age of returning light. Their present is dimly understood by those still caught in the traditions of the dark ages. Many even fear teenagers as agents of change, instead of valuing them and enabling their contributions to be made.* It is said that contemporary teenagers are more conformist and pre occupied with themselves than the exuberant generation of the late 1960s. If this is so, then it may be commercial pressures, general insecurity, fear of unemployment, high exposure to poor food on tele vision, and the seeming \"failures\" of their preceding generation, thathave discouraged them or clouded their vision. Their need for the right conditions for self and social development is therefore even greater . What, then, are the practical steps that need to be taken by concerned people to enable teenagers discover their direction, their meaning in life, their capacities and a constructive engagement with society? The rst step is one of awareness, of fully understanding what the developmental needs of teenagers are. While infancy and childhood are w i d e l y u n d e r s t o o d a n d a c c e p t e d a s \" a g e s o f d e v e l o p m e n t ' \\ a d o l e s c e n c e K still not fully recognised as an age in itself.

Teachers and managers are co-operating together to ease the school to work transition. Industry is beginning to explore the develop ment needs of teenagers. Social workers are experimenting with \"inter mediate treatment\" for young offenders and problem teenagers, offering them experience of country life, conservation work, creative activities to help them gain a direction. If the needs of teenagers can be met, by people who have developed the insight, strength and openness for the job, then England could see successive waves of younger generations helping to fashion a post- industrial society based on the living wisdom of the human spirit in action. Martin Large * See Margaret Mead, Culture and Commitment, (bodley Head) THE FUTURE OF CAPITALISM The world stands before the question: Can capitalism have a human face? It is a question that has divided mankind into two schools of thought. Some say that capital left freely in the hands of the individual constitutes, de facto, a social relationship. From capitalism, they say, must come social benet. For such men the bad conditions in which most of humanity live under capitalism lose much of their onerousness when weighed against the tremendous rise in living standards made poss ible by capitalism. On the other hand, there are those who are convinced that capital in the hands of the individual is, de facto, a social illness. In their view the individual is not to be trusted, for he is helpless in the face of capital's corruptive power. For them the questionable moral atmosphere of Com munist States is a necessary, even salutary, austerity between men \u2014 un avoidable if the step is to be made from feudal agrarian society to demo cratic industrial life. Both points of view seem unable to recognise a middle way. The values pertaining to each of them would appear to be mutually exclusive, with the consequence that they act devisively upon mankind as a whole. The particular expression of this divisiveness - left/right, capitalist/ communist, labour/conservative \u2014 is of less significance than the divisive ness itself. Within the social order, this divisiveness is a cardinal illness. It does more harm than capitalism or communism on their own. To overcome division is a task of our times, inseparable from the quest for a less problematic form of economy .34 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND 35 Remedies for the divisions that mankind suffers today are sought in all manner of treaties and \"balances of power\". But is there any aeal balancing principle at work in these delicate, short-lived and forever threatened agreements? Are they ever more than temporary coalitions of economic interests? I believe human society needs another quality than that given it by economic interest alone. The economic quality of life is a fact irrespec tive of man; whereas the other quality must be born of man himself. He must actively develop this quality and place it over against pure economic interest. It is for men to create a moral code in the economic life that is not demanded by external events, but is called for by the human soul. This ethic can only be the creation of man's higher being. It cannot be derived from the world. Its creation depends on a mood completely opposite to divisiveness. It depends on space between men, on listening in the largest and smallest senses, on abstinence from incon trovertible stance. A glance round the world shows little promise of such a mood. The industrial West by and large does not intend to forsake its traditional goals of prot and unfair advantage. The socialist blocs cling just as tenaciously to outmoded and ill-founded dogmas about the social evils of capitalism. Even the so-called Third World subscribes to these dogmas. Although their leit-motif is more specically liberationalist, their ideol ogical basis is unquestionably Marxist. Thus, the entire world thinks in terms of an antithesis between capitalism and communism. Any effort to go beyond men's current pass must strike a blow at these ideas. One life-line exists for modern humanity. If it can be shown that capital in the hands of the individual does not of necessity mean exploitation of man by man, it will become possible for men to retrain their thinking. But there should be no illusions: to lead capitalism over into an altruistic context will require deeds, not words; evidence, not conjecture. Intuitively I am certain that in England it is possible to develop the forms from which the conduct that will of itself demonstrate the pro found social signicance of capitalism could be derived. Within the English soul there lives the expectation of an altruistic business life. The issue of capitali^ has by no means been settled decisively in this coun try. Our laws and customs offer no hindrance to those who seek to dev elop genuine altruism out of the individualistic social institutions. People will criticise one for being sentimental and idealistic, and they wUl refuse to believe it is possible. But they will not stop one's endeav ours. In modern social conditions this absence of hindrance is tanta mount to freedom. Out of it could well come the mood and the forces of soul essential to the transition from the rst historical phase of theConsciousness Soul \u2014 characterised by the philosophies of Individual ism and the emergence of traditional capitalism \u2014 to a second phase, typied by a philosophy of freedom and the quest for altruism. Whether my feelings are substantiated by the future remains to be seen, of course. They are, nevertheless, a well-spring for my work and a source of unfailing inspiration and certitude. Without such a conviction, the prospect for England would appear altogether bleak. Christopher Budd. A B A S I C S O C I A L L A W Last Spring, in the editorial of the Zurich newsletter, \"Free Education Fund\", a small organisation to help new Waldorf schools in many parts of the world, we read: \"In a world brim-full of problems, which shows little capacity for freeing itself from the old, often rigid economic and political systems, one has grown accustomed to innumerable conferences, symposiums, study groups and the like, all of which occupy themselves with the increasing difculties in the world.\" England, like Switzerland, was one of the rst countries in Europe to free itself from medieval feudalism, not because of the spreading of a political programme or manifesto, but because there were people active in society who had a consciousness independent enough to begin doing something new and could carry the responsibility for what they did. Rudolf Steiner did not reckon that his ideas for the threefold social order were likely to re-form or replace the' political systems of our time. He hoped they would act as the leaven to begin transforming what was there; to bring clarity, relevance, and brotherliness into the political thinking and attitudes of the West. He told the older pupils of the rst Waldorf School that he looked to them to begin awakening a new social thinking among their fellow-men. But many years before the founding of that school, and before the publication of *'The Threefold Commonwealth\", Steiner outlined his thoughts on several aspects of community and true social living. In an essay on Robert Owen he wrote about what he considered to be a basic social law thwarted \"from times immemorial by human egotism\", but essential for taking the next steps in our* evolution. He described this 'law' in the following words: *The well-being of a total community of human beings working together becomes greater, the less the individual demands the products of his achievements for himself; that is, the more of these products he passes on to his fellow workers and the more his36 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLANDT H O U G H T S O N T H E F U T U R E O F E N G L A N D 37 own needs are not satised out of his own achievements, but out of the achievements of others. All the conditions within a total community of people which contradict this law must sooner or later produce misery and distress somewhere.\" Several of the new Waldorf schools, founded in the last few years, aim specically at realising this \"basic law\" particularly in the way the needs of the individual are respected and met, both among the co workers and colleagues and in the way the parents of children are called upon to support and nance the school.In walking around a bazaar in Asia one often nds shops exhibiting a warning notice: \"All one price!\" The heart leaps. Everything for 20p? But it does not mean that. It means prices are as labelled, they are xed, don't try bartering with the proprietor. Thsi rigid attitude is looked up on in Asia as especially advanced and moral. It is imported from the advanced and moral West. We don't go in for nonsense here where money is concerned! But there is another ade to it. Make a clear demand to your fellow man, set a price, and he has only to decide one thing: yes or no? Can he afford it or can't he? We are appealing to his egotism to decide. But if we ask him, 'Do you really want this? What can you do to help the per son who gives it? or to help other people?' - then we are making a space for his social conscience to begin working. The fact that most people apparently have no social conscience today may well be a result of living in a society which appeals so much to egotism in all the quest ions it asks. \"Are you getting the same pay rise, the same holiday, the same retirement prospects as the man in the car in front?\" These questions are moving more and more into the centre as the focus of hundreds of other questions all appealing to the same faculty - not of true self-hood but of selshness. It is no good preaching. It is no good accusing. No good even worrying. We must offer space for social thinking to develop, and that is where we believe the new Waldorf schools have an important contribution to make. Steiner is reputed to have believed that people in England would be going barefoot by the end of the century , throu^ lack of money . Good. Then we are working in the right country. The most affluent societies will lau^ at the ideas of moral phantasy, of freedom, of social con- sdence, of brotherliness. But the combination of real poverty with a nation which once led the world in its respect for the consdence of the individual mi^t provide some interesting possibilities. Peter PattersonH O P E S F O R E N G U S H P H I L O S O P H Y The dominant philosophical tradition in England has always been empiricism. After the turn of the last century Russell and others wedded this conception to a way of dealing with pure thought (in particular, mathematics) which gave a rm way of understanding the universality and necessity of the latter. This union gave rise to the philosophy of analysis. It yielded great advances in philosophical sophistication (or consciousness.) In particular, the standard of argument rose enormously . However, philosophers are now more prepared to concede that the great advances in philosophical logic have altered the basic issues of philosophy much less than it was at rst supposed they would. English philosophers have always been temperamentally artistic, and notable stylists. They have had what Werner Jaeger, speaking of Arist otle, called \"the conscious interest of the artist in thinking.\" Richard Hare, the modern moral philosopher, has identied the three primary virtues of English philosophy as clarity, brevity and relevance. The use of this combination of faculties has always been deliberate and remains peculiarly English. Their natural morality has caused English philosophers to be less in terested in what we are to think, and more in how we are to think it. Empiricism is itself an answer to a question about a process or movement (how we obtain knowledge,) and it is one of the seven philosoph ical moods. Idealism, the great European tradition, deals in xed struc tures (the way the world is); and it is one of the twelve positive world- conceptions.*It is my belief that English philosophers have fullled the several complex conditions which will enable them to talk again to their Euro pean colleagues, and to appreciate the European method of soul-fantasy.The English method\"of soul-observation is experimental: \"Can I honest ly say that . . .?\" The effect of this on ethics has been to show people that since neither denitions nor observation can reveal what they ought to do, they really must make up their own minds. This doctrine may be false - I hope it is not - but I fear that the honesty which produced it may be lost in the future. The stable Edwar dian world in which Moore (in a dream) was unable to distinguish chairs and tables from propositions has vanished. But honesty , which is a conservative virtue, requires something for us to be honest about We can no longer feel sure of the stability of propositions, and society can give us only confusing and unstable images of ourselves. The conditions which I have mentioned also turn out to be roughly the same as those which must be fullled before The Philosophy of Freedom (idealism in the mood of empiricism) can be wholly under stood.38 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND 39 T h e y h a v e n o t b e e n f u l l y s a t i s e d s i n c e b e f o r e t h e r a d i c a l b r e a k i n p h i l o s o p h y t h a t o c c u n e d w i t h K a n t , a n d b e f o r e w h i c h L o c k e a n d L e i bniz, for example, spoke a common intellectual language.

Jonathan Westphal * See Rudolf Steiner's lectures,/</na/i and Cosmic Thought (Berlin, January 1914) AIMS OF A FUTURE UNIVERSITY If we are to develop a true Hmiversity' out of the past decadent ones in En^nd, we shall need rst of all a new understanding of what is required of such a hmiversity'. Every age, every phase of evolution, must necessarily give the pos sibility of developing unique human faculties. Let there be a true centre- point where these faculties of the jge can be consciously developed; such an aim alone justies the existence of the ^university', which strives to be the flourishing high-point of the spiritual life of its epoch. What then must be cultivated in such a centre today? What is the faculty of our age? At the heart of present change is that much misunderstood force \u2014 the Spirit - which offers itself anew out of the greatest chaos of soul- impressions; for let us remember that it is indeed out of Chaos, that this, the ordering principle of light, is born. T o grasp the Spirit straight out of chaos, is not this the faculty of our age? But there is great confuaon here, for at the root of this chaos is the impression that the soul and the Spirit are mere empty concepts, at best to be lumped together as more or less the same thing, in contrast to 'body'. But it is the Spirit alone which can arise out of chaos as the new enlightening faculty, and it makes a world of difference whether weare seeking the soul or the Spirit if we remember that \"the spiritual is as different from the soul as is the soul from the body .\" (Rudolf Steiner , Theosophy , p.23). As a great seeker of the Spirit, Hegel, correctly stated; \"It is thinking which raises the soul - with which the animal also is endowed - to Spirit.\" Thus today's chaos can be a means of developing the greatest faculty of our age, the ability to nd our own identity as the true thinking Spirit. This, too, was indicated by Steiner when he wrote: \"Man can come to a true understanding of himself only when he grasps clearly the signicance of thinking within his being.\" {Theosophy, p.24). But there is a great wave of power from the past which blunts the modern faculties that should enable us to grasp the thinking Spirit within ourselves. Already at the Council of Constantinople, in the year8 6 9 A D , b o d y a n d s o u l w e r e a l l o w e d t o m a n , w h i l e t h e t h i r d a n d t r u l y human element, the thinking Spirit which \"searches all things, even the d e p t h s o f G o d \" , w a s a b o l i s h e d a n d r e p l a c e d b y t h e e x t e r n a l l e a d e r s h i p o f Rome. As a result we have only a material (i.e. body) and soul-culture today , with sciences that rise only as high as soul-perception (psycho logy). Anthroposophy can rise to be a restoring science of the Spirit, buther e t oo t he Rom an Cat holic blow ec hoes on.

The EngHshman has to come to the self-sufcien- cy of the thinking Spirit via materialism. As Steiner put it, \"the English are especially responsible for the cultivation of the Consciousness Soul, which lives itself out in materialism.\" But there is Spirit in matter , too,' and the Englishman is particularly well able to grasp the spiritual through consistent understanding of the material. So what do we need today? Is it not a real university , a meeting- point for the spiritual life, which could offer all the materialistic know ledge found in the present universities, but would simultaneously cultivate an awareness of the Spirit in all this, right down to the last40THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND T H O U G H T S O N T H E F U T U R E O F E N G L A N D41 details? A true university will seek to be a living wellspring of the spiritual life, but new life is found only in the depths of death - a fact conrmed by all material existence. With the same necessity , materialism is the death of the Spirit, but only in the very depths of this death can the new life of the thinking Spirit be found - it is there that we must look for it. Ian Bass V I S I O N A N D T H E K E Y It strikes me as a happy thing that a symposium on England's future both begins and ends with a contribution from someone with a patently un-English \u2014 name less happy that the only thing I could find to express what seemed to me to be the present state of England was a bit of \"non sense poetry\" by which George Orwell was haunted during a bad spell of bombing in 1940:- And the key doesn't t and the bell won't ring. But we all stand up for God Save the King. In Jubilee Year, 1977,1 gladly stand up with David Clement, for God Save the Queen. Maybe, however, we do need (as Paul Matthews thinks) a new national anthem. And perhaps it is not only people of my genera tion who are opressed by the feeling that somewhere along the line since that memorable date in English history \u2014 June 7th, 1944 \u2014 a cer tain \"sense of direction\" has been lost. Of course much of the rather apocalyptic stuff that is talked and written about the \"decline of England\" is based either upon an inade quate or incorrect perception of events (most of which are by no means peculiar to England) or upon a misinterpretation of what they signify . Materially ,the En^and of 1977 may be a far less cosy place than it usedto be for a section of society. Humanly, it is, in many respects, a much better place. For all the \"bad\" that obtrudes so much into our lives there is just as much unobtmsive \"good\" waiting to be found by anyone who cares to go out and look for it. Music, to take one example, is now more alive in England, especially among young people, than it has been for centuries. So does it matter very much if the old bell sometimes fails to ring or that even Big Ben is found to be slightly out of tune? Perhaps the key we really need is not so much a \"sense of direction\" as a certain ima^native vision which would help us to see clearly where England stands in the world and what she, uniquely , can contribute to it. Here, I believe, is the heart of the problem with which we are confronted. The fact that I rst thought of this in terms of a loss of a \"sense of direction\" is perhaps in itself signicant. For somehow, I believe, we have to make a \"rediscovery\" of England, and for that we can rely less and less on those instinctive senses by which England in the past has steered her way. Sometimes, in trying to understand a tangled situation, it helps to go back to the beginnings; and so, for this reason, I tried to see what guidr ance might be found among some of those symbols and images which are so deeply connected with the history of England \u2014 the Red Rose and the White, the lion and the Unicorn, St. George and the Dragon. One only of these seemed to have still the power to speak direct, that was the red cross on a white ground, the emblem of the Resurrection, which is familiar to most of us as the Cross of St. George and the flag of England. The cross on the flag led me to see another cross, a criss-crossing of directions on which I believe it can be said that England is structured, geographically and historically. One \"axis\", or \"direction\" (call it what you like), of this cross runs from North-East to South-West across the country (very roughly from the Wash towards Lands End and the Scilly Isles). The other, nearly at right angles to it, runs North-Westwards from South-Eastern England. Of these two strongly contrasting directions, the rst seems to me to represent the axis of an older, basically agricultural England in which the memory of some ancient, cosmic wisdom is still preserved. It is the England of Avebury, Stonehenge and Glastonbury, of King Arthur and the Holy Grail. Historically , it is also the main axis of the encounter between the older Celtic peoples of Britain and the incoming \" Anglo-Saxon*\" set tlers from whom eventually emerged the English nation. The other direction I see as the axis upon which the conquerors \u2014 the Romans and the Normans \u2014 came. It represents an England which is down to earth and much concerned with power. It is the England of Church and State, of Parliament, of Industry and organising power, of technical, political and social innovation. I do not believe that either of these alone can be said to represent England truly. One was at rst dominant, then the other. But what is most truly English emerges} I think, only when these two very different Englands can be reconciled. Is it surprising, therefore, that in the region where the two axes meet and cross, in the heart of England, Shakespeare was born on St. George's Day ... ?

But for such an undertaking we rst must have the vision. In Anthroposophy, the spiritual gift that Rudolf Steiner brought to us from Central Europe, is a source of immeasurable help towards that end. But much, very much, I believe, will depend on the way in which this gift is \"translated\". Great is the debt we owe to those who have worked for this.

It developed comparatively late in the British Isles and did not really begin to flower until about the middle of the 18th century . The word 'mysterious' may perhaps be permitted, especially with regard to this form of painting, where the face and mood of the landscape of these islands are always changing, through the uncertain disposition of the weather. It has been said that Britain is all climate, and this is something the painter has to live with, for no artist working in Britain can hope that the landscape will full for him the role of a 'still-life'. Landscape painting occupies such a central place in the stream of English painting that at the outset it may be desirable to indicate what is meant by it and what the artist hopes to achieve. In 1829, John Con stable pubished an album of engravings of his work, entitled The English Landscape. In the prospectus of this volume he wrote: In Art there arc two modes by which men aim at distinction. In one, by careful application to what others have accomplished, the artist imitates their works or selects and combines their various beauties; in the other, he seeks excellence at its primitive source - nature. In the rst, he forms a style upon the study of pictures, and produces either imitative or eclectic art; in the second, by a close observation of nature, he discovers qualities existing in her which have never been p.ortrayed before, and thus forms a style which is original, Constable also said: The landscape painter must walk in the elds with a humble mind.... The art of seeing is a ^ing almost as much to be acquired as the art of reading the Egyptian hieroglyphics. In these remarks the two paths open to the artist are clearly marked, and it is possible to trace in the works of many landscape painters where the rst path, which for want of a better term we can call, \"the path of reflection\", flows into the second, \"the path inspired by nature.\" Workt h a t b e g i n s a s i m i t a t i o n i s c a r r i e d a s t a g e f u r t h e r w h e n t h e r e fl e c t i v e p r o cess in the soul of the artist begins; for the emotional element always plays a part in any artist's creation. In speaking of the arts in relation to the four-fold constitution of m a n , R u d o l f S t e i n e r r e l a t e s A r c h i t e c t u r e t o t h e p h y s i c a l b o d y ; S c u l p t u r e46ENGLISH LANDSCAPE PAINTINGENGLISH LANDSCAPE PAINTING47 to the etheric body or body of formative forces; Painting to the astral body or body of sensation or emotion; Music, and also to a higher degree Poetry, to the ego. Here, then, we are concerned with the astral element in man, as it is related to his ego through the art of painting. The colours and forms perceived in a work of art, as well as in nature itself, will call forth a response of joy or sorrow, reverence, mystery or yearn ing in the soul of the artist. Where are we to look for the source of English landscape painting; where are we to nd the emergence of a truly English spirit in this form of art? I mean an art which has its roots in and draws its inspiration from the land and the seas, the lakes and the mountains, and, not least, from the climatic conditions of our country. One is tempted to add an expression in painting by native artists, born and reared in the land itself. However, this can only be asked with certain reservations, for to be born in a country is not an absolute prerequisite, where an expression of its spirit is concerned. Did not Turner and others capture the spirit of the Italian landscape without being native to its soil? Turner and Constable are often referred to as the two greatest masters in English landscape painting, but they had forerunners. Art historians usually look back to the work of two men who have been called the T athers' of English landscape painting: Richard Wilson (1714-1782) and Thomas Gainsborough (1727-1788). John Ruskin held the belief that 'with the name of Richard Wilson, the history of sincere landscape art, founded on a meditative love of nature, begins in England\". However, Colonel M. H. Grant, in his book. Old English Landscape Painters, indicates that '^Wilson and Gainsborough, far from being Tathers', are but echoes of notes struck long before and easily traceable, less to Italy and the Netherlands than to Italians and Flemings who have worked in this country.\" Sir John Rothenstein goes further back still and tells us that the earliest existing example of landscape painted for its own sake is to be found on an end-paper of a minute Bible \u2014 a study of Windsor Castle executed about 1550 by no less a person than Edward VI (1537-1553). Before turning to Richard Wilson, who in a short study is perhaps the best artist to start from, it is worth remembering that travel on the Continent was well-nigh impossible for British artists after the outbreak of the French Revolution and during the wars that followed it. This period of enforced concentration on the landscape of their own country was certainly an advantage in helping to promote a truly national spirit. Richard Wilson was fortunate in living diortly before these times of turmoil. He started as a portrait painter, an occupation at which an artist could earn a living. Landscape painting had not yet become pop ular. In 1750 he went to Italy and stayed there for sbc years. It was inItaly that the development of his landscape painting began. He was quick to absorb and express classical themes in the subdued, somewhat Arcad ian manner which won him recognition by Zuccarelli and Vernet, artists of considerable renown. Along with the works of Claude Lorraine and Gaspard Poussin, masters in the antique idiom, the principal influence on him was the light and the geological structure of Italy. This is not surprising when we remember the effect of the Italian light on the poetsof Europe who were his contemporaries, and not least on Turner, who came after him. When Wilson returned to England, he painted views in the region of London and along the Thames, and then ^ally, when he went home to his native Wales, he saw the countryside as if through new eyes, and ex pressed in painting that meditative love of nature of which Ruskin speaks. *Wilson\", his biographer says, \"opened the way to the genuine principleso f l a n d s c a p e i n E n g l a n d . \" ^ t h o u g h h e d i d n o t b r e a k a w a y e n t i r e l y f r o m the \"classical\" manner in painting, he built the bridge to the world of nature which later artists were to cross. He opened a path to what was later to become a worship of nature; an attitude of mind both religious and devout. It was what a later generation understood by the term *Wordsworthian romanticism*. Gainsborough carries the sense of intimacy with nature even further.A more elemental force enters his painting; the ever-changing light and capricious weather play as important a part as the more solid ingredients of tree and hill. The wind rises and the spirit begins to blow through the landscapes of Gainsborough. No longer does the somewhat restricted manner of the \"classical\", which overshadowed his contemporary, Wilson, hold sway. However, the wonderful release was short-lived; his youthful exuberance for landscape was soon forsaken and he succumbed to the contemporary demand for portraiture. With John Crome (1768-1821), we have a representative of the only local school of painters which England had produced since the Middle Ages. He was the founder of the Norwich Society of Artists (1803), the nucleus of the \"Norwich School\". Born the son of a poor weaver in a small public-house in Norwich, he was rst apprenticed to a coach and sign painter but was able to paint landscapes in his spare time. He loved his native East Anglia, with its wide flat spaces and fleeting clouds, and its inspiration, along with paintings by Dutch masters and those of Wilson and Gainsborough, helped him along the road of the established painter. For a time he worked in the London studio of the portrait painter . Sir William Beechley, but soon returned to Norwich. He learnt from Wilson how to design broadly , while Gainsborough gave him the con dence to draw inspiration from the local landscape. One of his most48ENGLISH LANDSCAPE PAINTING famous paintings is \"Mousehold Heath - a boy tending Sheep\". Although primarily a painter in oils, he produced some admirable watercolours, a medium close to the soul of English painters. There is more than an echo of Dutch art in Crome's paintings and he has much in common with many painters of that school; however , the similarity between the land scape of Holland and.that of East Anglia should be remembered. Indeed, the area around the Wash is called Little Holland. The fact that this part of England has been the source of so much artistic inspiration is not without signicance. In a letter to his pupil, James Stark, Crome wrote: Breadth must be attended to, if you paint.... Your doing the same by the sky , making parts broad and of a good shape, that they may come in with your composition, forming one grand plan with the light and shade, this must always please a good eye .... Trifles in nature must be overlooked that we may haveour feelings raised by seeing the whole picture at a glance. Crome discovered through his vision this all-important element of \"breadth\", perhaps as important for him as the \"light and shade\" he had learnt from Ruysdael and the Dutch masters. His direction to overlook the 'trifles' in nature may be interpreted as bringing him closer in vision to Turner than Constable ever was. Comparisons can be at times odious, especially if they result in the tendency to play one man off against another . Who was the greater paint er , Constable or Turner? The answer is, they were both great, each in his own way . Which of the two most ably expressed the spirit of the English landscape? They both did, most admirably! With that we can leave the argument. At the recent exhibitions and celebrations held in London to mark the bi-centenaries of their births, without any doubt Turner's work caused the greatest stir. His late paintings in particular, which in his life time were almost totally unacceptable, were received with unbridled enthusiasm. The two men were very different in outlook and character, as Eric Newton points out: Turner was cosmic; Constable by contrast, parochial. Turner effortlessly identied himself with the elements. Constable painstakingly observed them with the eye of a lynx! John Constable (1776-1837) was born in East Bergholt, Suffolk, the son of a prosperous mill-owner. His father hoped that he would follow in his footsteps, but the young Constable had other plans and eventually his father fell in with them. Constable had resolved to become a profes sional painter, largely encouraged by a friendship he had struck up with a local plumber and glazier from East Berglioll, John Dunthorne by name, himself an amateur painter. With a letter of introduction to the painter Joseph Farington, Constable set off for London, where he wasTurner. Tlie Angel standing in the Sun Tate GalleryENGLISH LANDSCAPE PAINTING 49 accepted at the Royal Academy Schools, rst as:a probationer in 1799, and in 1800 as a fully enrolled student. Under the guidance of Farington he was introduced to the technique of Richard Wilson, and later, when he met the art collector Sir George Beaumont, to the works of Rubens, Ruysdael and Claude. In 1802 he exhibited at the Royal Academy a painting which he called simply \"Landscape\". From this time onward he was resolved to become a \"natural painter\". Constable's attitude to nature is so un usual that it is best described in his own words: The world is wide; no two days are alike, nor even two hours; neither were there ever two leaves of a tree alike since, the creation of the world; and the genuine productions of art, like those of nature, are all distinct from each other . His religious attitude to nature comes out in an extract in a letter to his wife in 1819: E v e r y t h i n g s e e m s f u l l o f b l o s s o m o f s o m e l a n d a n d a t e v e r y s t e p I t a k e , a n don whatever object I turn my eyes, that sublime expression of the Scriptures, \"1 am the resurrection and the life\", seems as if uttered by me. He read Luke Howard's work. On the Modication of Clouds (pub lished in 1802), which no doubt stimulated him to carry out many cloud studies. In these studies, which ran into hundreds, he noted on each the month, the time of the day and the direction of the wind. In land scape painting, he said, clouds are the chief organ of sentiment.I n m a n y w a y s C o n s t a b l e ' s a t t i t u d e t o n a t u r e w a s s i m i l a r t o t h a t o f h i s c o n t e m p o r a r y , G o e t h e . G o e t h e , t o o , h a d a g r e a t a d m i r a t i o n f o r t h e w o r kof Howard, so much so that he wrote a poem to him. Constable had a method of painting rapid sketches in oils direct from nature, and in this he foreshadowed the French Impressionists. These oil sketches, which enable us to take a glance into his workshop, in their freshness tell us perhaps a little more about the artist than do the nished studio workss u c h a s t h e p o p u l a r ' H a y W a i n ' . I n t h e s e s k e t c h e s C o n s t a b l e i s n o t s o f a r removed from T urner as we are often led to believe. Of all his country men he is closest in spirit to W ordsworth, and at times a W ordsworth poem can sound like a description of a Constable picture. In the solitude of the dawn a painter sat on his balcony overlooking the river Thames, absorbed in that age-old phenomenon, the birth of the light. The year was 1851; the man, Joseph Mallord William T urner (1775-1851). When in the evening of his days he pursued one of his favourite and life-long occupations, did perchance the words of the immortal Sophocles, written during the golden age of Greece, in 440 B.C., come into his mind?50 ENGLISH LANDSCAPE FAINTING Many marvels there are, But none so marvellous as Man. Over the dark sea he rides In the teeth of the winter storm. Driving through towering spray. From the days of Turner's boyhood, when rst he started to express himself in drawing and in water-colour , the play of light on water , the e m e r g e n c e o f t h e l i g h t a n d i t s p e n e t r a t i o n o f t h e v a p o u r y a t m o s p h e r e o f sea and sky , occupied his thoughts. His life and work could be summed up in the title he gave to one of his paintings, exhibited in 1807, 'The Sun rising through vapour .\" It is by way of this image that in his nal p a i n t i n g s h e a r r i v e d a t a p i c t u r e o f m a n ; a n i m a g e o f m a n b o r n n o t o u t o f the world of the senses but out of the supersensible. In \"Light and colour (Goethe's Theory) - the Morning after the Deluge\", (1843) and 'The Angel Standing in the Sun\" (1846), two of his very last works, an imageof man appears as if from the other side; that is, from a picture of man anived at through the experience of light and darkness, of, as Goethe would have put it, \"through the deeds and sufferings of the light.\" T h r o u g h o u t h i s l o n g l i f e T u r n e r h a d a n i n c e s s a n t u r g e t o t r a v e l - r s t within the British Isles as a youth of 14 and soon after he had entered the Royal Academy Schools, and later , when travel on the Continent became possible again, to France and the Alps.

Everywhere he went he made sketches, often in watercolour, a medium in which he had complete mastery and in which he was often to express himself in nished works. Indeed, Turner can be said to have used oils in the way that other artists have used watercolour. This was one side of his remarkable technique and also of his genius. Here I must add that any complete survey of English landscape paint ing would naturally pay tribute to the artists who, from Girtin and Cotman onwards, gave English watercolour painting its distinctive rep utation, but that would require a separate article. However, in passing it should be remembered that Thomas Girtin (1775-1802) was born in the same year as Turner, and as young men Aey worked alongside each other.

The end of each day's march is clearly ap parent from the beginning of it, and the whole is seen to be along this astonishingly homogeneous ridge. In neolithic times this would have been the highway linking the spiritual-cultural centre of Stonehenge with similar centres on the North German plain. There are even to be found along this route through Kent certain megaliths, Kits Coty House, the 'Countless Stones' and a dolmen near Trottiscliffe, which, the archaeologists tell us, are more related to those on the Continent than to those in the west of England. The other line of chalk hills, the South Downs, stretching from the cliffs of Beachy Head to the hills above Winchester, has a different character, more \"indented by combes and projecting spurs\". It contains in long stretches a fairly wide upland, which, though exposed to all the winds and though the soil is stony, is \u2014 and has been for thousands of years \u2014 cultivatable. Those stones in the soil, as we see them turned up by the plough, are flints, and are a reminder of a culture (or industry) which flourished on these hills 1000 to 2000 years B.C. \"Flint-knap ping\" was the craft of adapting these extremely hard shiny stone surfaces into knives, spearheads and other tools and weapons needed for survival. The flints were mined, like coal, and the rst systematic exploration o f t h e l a r g e s t o f t h e s e m i n e s a t C i s s b u r y C a m p , n o r t h o f W o r t h i n g , w a s undertaken between 1867 and 1875 by Lieut.

T oday there is coal-mining in Kent, and in parts of East Sussex manytraces remain of an iron-mining industry which existed in a primitive form even before the Romans came. It flourished during the Middle Ages and on through later times, until in the 17th and 18th centuries it grad ually declined and soon afterwards faded out.

In the fourteen archstones are shown the activities of the manor: the Lady, the Minstrel, the Cellarer and so on. Many of these ancient churches, which are full of architectural and artistic interest for us today, were not built to serve the towns but rather the communities of farmers, farm workers, shepherds, supported by the local squire. A relic of this form of community is to be seen in the church at West Grinstead, where still today the names of all the farms in the parish are painted on the backs of the pews - though I doubt whether they are lled by the persons so indicated. But let us turn from particular churches to the wider question : what part has this corner of England had in the development of English spirit ual and religious life?

Population was very sparse, except in the coastal strip between the South Downs and the sea, and even there the Roman centres of Anderida (Pevensey) and Regnum (Chich ester) were virtually the only towns. The forests of the Weald were a great barrier. Oddly enough it was Wilfrid who, through being turned out of his bishopric of York, settled temporarily in Sussex and converted the South Saxons. The legend of this conversion makes curious reading. It is alleged that no rain had fallen in Sussex for three years (!); the crops had failed and the people were starving. It happened that as Wilfrid started baptising the people, rain began to fall and this was hailed as a miracle. However, the rain did not immediately provide the people with food,so Wilfrid, being a practical as well as a spiritual man, showed them how to make a large net with which they were able to catch a great many sh, an activity of which - believe it or not! - they had hitherto been ignorant. I can't help thinking that this unlikely story was the inventionof later pious writers who devised it as a parable. But Wilfrid did found and build a church at Selsey on a spot now covered by the sea. The invading army of William the Norman made its rst landing at Pevensey , just as t he Romans had done, and as Hit ler would have done ifhis invasion had come off. Here is a soft spot in our coastline which is not favourable to the defenders. Following the Conquest came the monastic orders from the Contin ent, and three signicant orders established their rst houses in this south-east corner of En^and. They were the Cluniacs, the Cistercians and the Carmelites. William decided to consolidate his position in the south by granting lands to his faithful barons and encouraging them to build castles in key positions, which became the ef fective centres of power . One of these barons. Sir William de W arenne, was given the rape of Lewes and built there, on the hill above the town, a *motte and bailey' castle which commanded the approach from the sea up the Ouse valley . This William de Warenne, with his wife Gundrada, went on a pilgrim age to Rome, but they got no further than Cluny . Having been well entertained at the monastery there, they were so impressed by the A b b o t , H u g h , a n d h i s m o n k s , t h a t t h e y b e g g e d t h e A b b o t t o s e n d s o m e\u00aef his monks to found a branch of the order at Lewes. The abbot was reluctant to lose his monks and sent only three in the rst place, but subsequently , under pressure from King William, sent more, and, withintwelve years of the Conquest the Quniac Priory of St. Pancras was founded and built. It became the most famous of the Chiniac houses in England. Later on it declined, and shared the fate of all such establish-THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND ments at the Dissolution of the monasteries in 1538. It was thoroughly destroyed and the stone used in local buildings. T oday only a fragment of the dormitory range - the portion which housed the lavatories (reredorter) \u2014 is still to be seen. Even the foundations of the churchwere nally destroyed in the 19th century , when the L.B.&.S.C.R. built the railway from Brighton to Lewes. There were no protected buildings* or preservation societies in the 1840's. The second great Order to establish its rst house on English soil in the south-east was the Cistercian Order. Under Henry I its rst abbey was built in 1128 at Waverley, near Farnham, Surrey, in a meadow by the banks of the River Wey. Though it never rivalled in size or reputa tion the great Yorkshire abbeys of Rievaubc and Fountains, one of whose abbots referred to it as 'hidden away in a corner' it was never theless the parent house. Rather more than a century later a group of hermits from Mount Carmel were rescued from persecution by the Saracens and brought to England by a Baron de Grey , a crusader who gave them his manor at Aylesford on the Medway as their rst settlement in the west. (Another group was similarly settled at Alnwick, Northumberland.) These hermits then became the Carmelite Order of Friars, known as the White Friars; they held their rst general chapter at Aylesford in 1247. Their buildings were conscated in 1538 and passed into secular ownership, but in 1949 were bought back by the Carmelite Order, whose members set about restoring many of the buildings (the church had been totally destroyed) and making it once again a place of pilgrimage. Turning from the monastic to the secular Church, the area we are de scribing contains three great cathedrals built in medieval times, Canter bury, Rochester and Chichester, and one of the 20th century, Guildford. Canterbury, as the seat of the Archbishop and Primate of the Eng lish Church, has through all the centuries since Augustine been the rep resentative centre of English religious life. The present cathedral, the successor to two previous ones destroyed by re, owes its structure mainly to the personalities of Lanfranc and Anselm in the 11th century, but it was given its great length by the building of the nave and the double transepts in the 13th century. It was the shrine of St. Thomas Becket, whose murder there in 1170 brought fame to the cathedral as a place of pilgrimage, and also great wealth, over a period of more than 300 years. These pilgrimages inspired Geoffrey Chaucer to give us that incom parable picture of medieval life in his poem. The Canterbury T ales, and one can imagine the various streams of pilgrims converging on Canter bury from London by the Dover Road, from Winchester and the west over the Pilgrims' Way, and from the Continent via Dover.THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND R o c h e s t e r i s i n m a n y w a y s a n o f f s p r i n g o f C a n t e r b u r y , h a v i n g b e e nb u i l t a b o u t t h e s a m e t i m e u n d e r t h e d i r e c t i o n o f t w o \" b u i l d e r b i s h o p s \" , Gundulph and Ernulph, who had much to do with the construction of Canterbury .

Near the ferry there was a spring \u2014 cool clear water coming out of the sandstone of St. Catharine's Hills, on which stand the ruins of an ancient pilgrims' chapel. There was an iron cup on a chain for the thirsty travel ler to drink from. I wonder for how many centuries travellers quenched their thirsts there! There was a certain wonder about the place and for my memory it has always been the prototype of all springs. It surely has its guardian elemental beings. This south-east corner of England is a region in which a lot of dis tinguished men have come to reside, being attracted by the peace and beauty of the countryside in contrast to the noise and bustle of Lx)ndon, yet not too remote from it as a market place of ideas and culture. Many have built themselves ne country houses, including more than one Archbishop of Canterbury. Knole, Sevenoaks, with its 365 rooms, was built by Archbishop Thomas Bourchier in 1454. Of the literary giants, Dickens made himself a home at Gadshill near Rochester, and many of the adventures of the inimitable Mr. Pickwick happened in Kent. To Kent also came Charles Darwin, whose \"Origin of Species\" was a bomb shell in the midst of the traditional beliefs of his day. He wrote this at his house at Downe, where many relics of the great man are still to be seen. A literary giant of a different order was Rudyard Kipling who, though born in Incha, lived for ve years at Rottingdean and in later years ac quired a pleasant manor house at Burwash. His love of Sussex comes out in many of the poems he wrote at this time; here is part of one of them:T H E G A R D E N O F E N G L A N D 6 ] Each to his choice, and I rejoice The lot has fallen to me In a fair ground - in a fair ground - Yea, Sussex by the sea! No tender-hearted garden crowns, No bosomed woods adorn Our blunt, bow-headed, whale-backed Downs, But gnarled and writhen thorn - Bare slopes where chasing shadows skim And through the gaps revealed, Belt upon belt, the wooded, dim Blue goodness of the Weald. Though all the rest were all my share. With equal soul Pd see Her nine-and-thirty sisters fair. Yet none more fair than she. Oioose ye your need from Thames to Tweed, And I will choose instead Such lands as lie *twixt Rake and Rye, Black Down and Beachy Head.

They get their laughter from the loud surf. And the faith in their happy eyes Comes surely from our Sister the Spring When over the sea she flies; The violets suddenly bloom at her feet. She blesses us with surprise. w62 THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND 63 Not to be forgotten, too, is William Blake, who, though a Londoner, found peace and inspiration in his much-loved cottage at Felpham, near Bognor, for three years, 1800-1803. Soon after his arrival, in a letter to John Flaxman he wrote: \"Felpham is a sweet place for study, because it is more Spiritual than London. Heaven opens here on all sides her golden Gates, her windows are not obstructed by vapours; voices of celestial inhabitants are more distinctly heard & their forms more distinctly seen; & my Cottage is also a Shadow of their houses.\" And to his friend and patron, Thomas Butts: \"We have had but little time for viewing the Country, but what we have seen is Most Beautiful, & the People are Genuine Saxons, handsomer than the people about London.\" Of literary gures who were born in this region one may mention Christopher Marlowe, William HazUtt, P. B. Shelley, Aldous Huxley and H. G. Wells. Amongst those who may be called \"initiators of the new\" have been William Caxton, who established the art of printing in England; Richard Linacre, who founded and was rst president of the Royal College of Physicians; William Harvey, who discovered the circul ation of the blood, and two political reformers of the 19th century, William Cobbett and John Cobden, who brought about the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1845. So the south-east has contributed to the progress of this country, and it may be fair to assert that such individualities spring in the main from the middle classes, the professional classes, who are predominant in the region. They need access to the metropolis, but also freedom from its life-force draining grip; they may like the alternation between the City and the Garden which keeps the mind and the imagination fresh. Hence it is not surprising that artists and musicians abound. Ideas towards the future are cultivated, and it is not without signicance that a great num ber of practical activities emanating from the work of Rudolf Steiner - educational, religious, curative, medical, agricultural, - have established themselves in 'The Garden of England.\"M E A N I N G A N D T H E H U M A N S O U L JOHN DAVY As the ninth century saw a denial of the spirit in man*, so the special l\\ crisis of the 20th century is the denial of the human soul. This was Rudolf Steiner's prediction more than half a century ago, and the signs of its truth are all around us. The soul is the inwardness of the human being, and cannot live withr out nding the inwardness - the meaning - in other human beings and the world. Thus a rst attack on the soul was to drain nature of in wardness by filling our minds with abstractions \u2014 molecules, atoms, im personal forces. So the rocks and plants are no longer a maniJfestation of divine creation, but little more than raw material for technological ex ploitation. In factory farms, animals are well on the way to being seen as mere quantities of flesh, and during this century there are determined efforts to extend this bleak world to the transactions between human beings themselves. Y ou think your friend is smiling? No, some facial muscles are contracting, thus widening the oral aperture. A mere con ditioned response. The central citadel of inwardness, around which the battle for the soul is being fought, is language. We still assume that what people say means something. Their words are more than mere warm air and noise. In language, the inner worlds of human beings meet. And the life which sustains language, which makes it more than an exchange of verbal stimulus and response, is imagination. Here, at the heart of the battle, Owen Bareld has made his life's work. He once remarked plaintively, in an autobiographical aside, that this work had consisted mainly in thinking and writing. But his pen has been a true sword, and he has fought, with great vigour and effective ness, a battle for meaning and imagination that has attracted to his banner a growing circle of supporters and like-minded combatants, especially in the United States. It will therefore be a great joy to all his friends and admirers that a collected volumes of his essays has now been published t Three of the essays appeared originally in the Golden Blade but many have been published in journals not easily accessible to British readers, which makes this collection particularly welcome.MEANING AND THE HUMAN SOUL A l l t h e e s s a y s h a v e i n o n e w a y o r a n o t h e r t o d o w i t h l a n g u a g e , a n dw i t h m e a n i n g i n l a n g u a g e , a n d s o p r o v i d e a t h r e a d w h i c h l e a d s b a c k t ot h e s t a r t i n g - p o i n t o f O w e n B a r e l d ' s w o r k .

Everyone should write his ovm philosophy of freedom'. This, so it seems to me, is essentially what Owen Bareld has been doing over the years. He has been thinking and writing. But this has entailed a strenuous spiritual activity which helps to create a free space in which the human soul can . live \u2014 not only for himself but for our present times and times to come. It is part of the attack on the soul that the need to ght essential battles in thought is barely understood today , (except, strikingly enough, in totalitarian countries, where the really dangerous people are.^en to be those vdio think for themselves). The notion that there is a gulf between ^theory' and ^|iractice' is simply one more facet of the Cartesian dichotomy between mind and matter, or between inner and outer experience, which is at the root of the present crisis. History ^ows well enough that the assumptions and attitudes which shape society are half-conscious versions of what lives in clarity among contemporary philosophers. So it is only in the light of the spirit that the essential issues can be properly seen, and there that the most essential battles have to be fought (one of the main weapons in the attack on the soul is to engulf culture in a damp mental fog). It was here that Steiner began his own public work. Living and working in Central Europe near the turn of the century, he saw that his central task in The Philosophy of Freedom (which he once recom mended should be rendered in English as 'The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity\") must be to transcend Kant, and in particular to overcome the idea of fundamental limits to knowledge. For Kant made evident and apparently permanent a kind of imprisonment of the soul, Hrst heralded formally in our culture by Descartes. The inwardness of the human being, the soul, the mind, was placed in a cell of private ex-M E A N I N G A N D T H E H U M A N S O U L 6 5 perience, cut off from direct access to surrounding realities, an onlook er at mere appearances. In his own life and work, Steiner sprung the lock of this prison cell, and showed a road open to all human beings to nd a way to the inner realities of soul and spirit in nature and in man. And he demonstrated in practice how the needs for a renewal of practical life can be found on this path. But the battle for the soul was far from won. In the English-speaking world,through the middle part of this cen tury , the attack on the soul took a further step. It is well known that prisoners in solitary connement may begin to doubt their own identities and even their real existence. Locked in its cell by Kant, the human soul, prompted by the logical positivists and then by the linguistic phiL osophers, began to argue itself out of existence. The line of argument is now quite familiar. It is a close relation of that behaviouristic psy chology which would ban all reference to 'inner' states of mind or soul because they are *unobservable'. So 'hunger' is replaced by 'eating behaviour', and smiles by the widening of oral apertures. Correspondingly , some linguistic philosophers argued that all language which refers to 'inner' realities is meaningless. We can speak only of what is veriable by the senses. The soul is thus not only imprisoned, but gagged. Thus the soul is nally isolated not only from nature, but from other human souls. The natural conviction that human beings can meet through language is undermined. The 'problem of com munication' becomes the central neurosis of social life (and grotesque and often desperate efforts at non-verbal communication spring up in myriad weekend encounter group workshops), This is where Owen Bareld has been at work, and the collection of essays is well titled. The rediscovery of meaning \u2014 in language and in life \u2014 is a most central need of the human soul. And there is a par ticular way in to this discovery , a golden key . It is the same key we nd in Steiner, and which Goethe, the pioneer of rediscovery of meaning in nature, also knew very well. It is the idea of evolution \u2014 but an evolu tion not of one half only of the Cartesian dichotomy , of matter , but of the other half also, of mind. The moment we take this up, it works like a magic wand on the landscape of history , and a transformation scene began to take place before our eyes. Putin the most abstract possible way , the point is this: The Cartesian dichotomy was itself produced by mind. Moreover ,we ourselves reproduce it every morning as we awake from sleep and dream to look at the world 'out there' (and to become aware of ourselves*in herd). Yet by realising how this experience comes into being, whether historically , oreach morning, out of another state of consciousness, we must realise that the duality of our experience cannot be a dichotomy (in the sense66MEANING AND THE HUMAN SOULMEANING AND THE HUMAN SOUL 67 that there are two different kinds of universe which somehow abut), but must be a polarity, and therefore must contain an inward unity. One of Owen Bareld's central contributions has been to show that in the history of language, in the meaning of words, there is a kind of script, a fossil record of the evolution of the human soul. In this record,the gradual polarisation of experience out of an earlier dream-like clairvoyance can be followed at least in its most recent phases (that is, through the past three or four thousand years). The earlier essays in this collection are particularly concerned with this theme, which Owen Bar- eld announced so clearly in his rst book. History in English Words. As he has so often described, all our present abstract words - 'courage', 'disastrous', 'perceptive', 'humour', and thousands more \u2014 all once had 'outer' as well as 'inner' meanings ('disaster', for example, refers to the stars). At the same time, words which now have only outer meanings once also had inner meanings.meant winda\u00abd spirit. For the Cartesian intellect, it is not rational for words to refer to both sides of the dichotomy at once. As a consequence, the twentieth century has tried to persuade us that all use of words to refer to 'inner' exper iences (including, of course, anything that could be called poetry) is at best misleading, at worst a 'disease of language'. But once we see language as an expression of a developing polarity , a polarity of the human soul and nature, we have to see that the residual inner meanings of today's 'outer' words (and of course the residual outer meanings of today's inner words) are remnants of what Bareld calls 'original participation', a mode of experience when the life of the soul and of nature were experienced not as a dichotomy but as a unity. (There are some interesting words into which the dichotomy has as yet barely entered. We still speak quite naturally of a 'warm room' and a 'warm welcome', of a 'heart-attack' and of a 'hearty welcome'. Under the chilly scrutiny of the linguistic analyst, we should probably confess that when we attach 'warm' and 'heart' to 'welcome' we are speaking metaphorically, and hence about something unveriable by physical means. But we go on doing it all the time, and cling to the conviction that a 'warm smile' expresses a reality more fundamental than an extended widening of the oral aperture). To recognise language in this way, woven into the evolution of the soul, has far-reaching consequences. Above all, as Owen Bareld puts it in the title essay of this volume: \" the positivists are right in their conclusion that if (they would say 'because') nature is meaningless to the human mind, most language is also meaningless. But the converse is equally true, that if language is \"meaningful\", then nature herself must also be meaningful. In fact, as Emerson pointed out long ago, 'It is not only words that are emblematic; it is things which are emblematic' \". In other words, through seeing in language the record of the evolution of an 'onlooker' consciousness out of 'original participation', we are led to realise that we are, as human souls, neither insubstantial ghosts nor strangers to nature, but that in observing the 'outside' of nature we are meeting that whose inwardness we can seek in uncon scious realms of our own souls. As Owen Bareld points out, the twentieth century has brought forth a partial recognition of this polarity in elds apparently as far apart as particle physics and psychoanalysis. With quantum physics, it has to be accepted that what we see in \"nature\" depends on how she is conceived in our souls (e.g. particles or waves). Psychoanalysis has long recognised in dreams an inner experience of nature in the human organ ism. But the ghosts of positivism haunted the minds of both Freud and Jung, since both seem to have conceived the 'unconscious' as produced, fundamentally, by the physical organism. Even Jung's collective uncon scious seems to have, in the end, the status of a common property of generations of material organisms. He never seems to have taken the ex plicit step of seeing that organisms may equally well be understood as being born out of the collective unconscious - or out of what Steiner more directly called the world of soul and spirit. Yet this step is now al most staring us in the face. The dualism of mind and body still stands stubbornly in the way, and this accounts for the crucial importance of the idea of polarity in the works of Goethe, of Steiner, of Coleridge, and of Bareld. For once the idea of polarity is properly grasped, org anism and mind, inner and outer realities, can be truly distinguished without being divided, and we can see them as expressions of our pres ent mode of consciousness. All this vividly illumines the past and the present - but what of the future? Some aspects of the story which Bareld tells have been dawn ing on many people. The sense of a lost participation, of an abyss which has opened between man and nature - or even more far-reachingly between everyday consciousness and awareness of spiritual worlds - shows itself in the wave of interest in occultism, astrology. Eastern religions, 'ancient wisdom' and past spiritual practices. Those in whom such interests awaken often see correctly, that the success and power of modern science and technology depend on the Cartesian dichotomy. Only by experiencing ourselves as divorced from nature, as detached on lookers, could we have embarked on the kinds of investigations and man ipulations which have dominated our lives in recent times. This diagnosis is now widespread among those seeking 'alternatives'. But the remedy is usually to regard the whole dichotomy as an aberra tion, a wrong turning, which can be undone by a denial of intellect, by \"tuning in and dropping out\", by reviving a variety of ancient attitudes, ways of life and spiritual practices. It is seldom clearly seen that this can68 MEANING AND THE HUMAN SOULM E A N I N G A N D T H E H U M A N S O U L 69 be as drastic an assault on the soul as positivism, even if launched from the opposite direction. For it denies all meaning to the evolutionary pro cess which has led to the dichotomy. Yet this dichotomy is the primary fact of experience of every modem human soul which awakens in any way to attempt a critical appraisal of the human situation. To deny it is like denying adolescence to a child. T o seek a way back beyond the Svrong turning' is like an attempt to regress into a world of lost in nocence (indeed psychoanalysis claims to detect a powerful urge of this kind in all human souls). Rudolf Steiner seems to have been almost alone in seeing the full meaning of this evolution and its consequences. He saw the dichotomy, for all its tragedy, as the birthplace of individual freedom ( a freedom, incidentally, which all those who would choose to regress to a pre- Cartesian way of life claim as a birthright without thinking much about it). Without the experience of complete separateness from nature, the human soul could never awaken to its present and future responsibility for nature (a responsibility whose actuality in underlined daily by the so-called environmental crisis). And within this freedom for responsibility lies the seed of love - not a love inherited from or determined by nature, but germinating and unfolding freely in the shrine of the heart as the essential being of man. Here again, Owen Bareld has shown how we can seek within language for this birth of freedom. It is announced most explicitly by the Roman tics as imagination. Bareld has sometimes contrasted 'inspiration' and 'imagination' as words which point to past and future forms of 'partici pation? The poet inspired by his Muse is a vehicle for a creative process. The poet who labours inwardly for imagination begins to become res ponsible for it. What this means in life has begun to be disconcertingly clear in the sciences. The sources of experiment and technology are in the imagin ation (otherwise known as the capacity to form hypotheses). It is now rather obvious that what scientists imagine (or hypothesise) has far- reaching consequences - and should entail a more serious sense of res ponsibility. For in imagination, we reach across a threshold. It is a matter of common experience in science that the crucial advances emerge more often than not quite dimly at rst, as inner apprehensions which can barely be shaped in language, mathematical or otherwise. How are we to become responsible for such a process? Clearly, the rst step is to take seriously what is very nearly explicit in quantum physics and implicit in all science. As Owen Bareld puts it in the essay 'Science and Discovery', if we had truly left behind the idea that the mind of the scientist is totally detached from the world he in vestigates, ' We should have become naturally , unforcedly and unremittingly aware that the mind cannot refer to a natural object without at the same time referring to its own activity. And this in turn would re quire an equally unforced awareness not only that scientic discovery is always a discovery about language, but also that it is always a discovery about the self which uses language\". He goes on to show that the scientic process itself is demanding that its much-prized objectivity about objects (not, as Bareld remarks, really such a difcult feat!) should really be seen as a kind of schooling for a much more difcult feat, namely objectivity towards that which is to be found within the soul itself. We should not be surprised to nd that the moral qualities of a human being colour the world of his imagmation, or expect the scientist to be any more insulated than the poet from the powerful forces which live at the threshold of the unconscious. Thus science itself is beginning to speak an old language in a new form. It is an adventure into mysteries. But at the threshold of every past Mystery temple the neophyte was confronted with a warning and a demand that he attempt the most thorough self-knowledge. This warning reappears in all Rudolf Steiner's work on the modern 'path of knowledge', most directly and simply as the warning that every spiritual step should be accompanied by three moral steps. This is an obvious requirement of any responsible exploration into mysteries, once we recognise that they embrace both the human soul and the inwardness of nature, as a polarity . Here then is the starting point for future endeavour. But the fullest depth of meaning in this evolution of the human soul is indicated in the nal essays of this volume. One of them, 'Philology and the Incarnation', was reprinted from its original home. The Gordon Review, in the Anth- osophical Quarterly (Spring, 1969). Owen Bareld there compares an old and a new phenomenon of language. The rst is the one already mentioned - the fact that 'inner' experiences were in the pa'St described by words which referred also to the 'outer' world. The second is a recent ptenomenon, the use of words which describe qualities of a nature in terms of their effect on us. He cites 'charming', 'depressing', 'entrancing', 'amusing' and several others. These usages are very recent, not earlier than the seventeenth century. In this there is a complete change of direction in the relation between man and nature as embodied in language; in the past 'outer' words used to denote 'inner' qualities; very recently words for inner experiences used to denote outer qualities. This change of direction, Bareld says, can be located philologically quite exactly, within seven or eight centur ies on either side of the reign of Caesar Augustus. A philologist studying this period could rightly feel that here \"was the moment at which there was consummated that age-long process of contraction of the immaterialMEANING AND THE HUMAN SOUL q u a l i t i e s o f t h e c o s m o s i n t o a h u m a n c e n t r e , i n t o a n m n e r w o r l d , w h i c hhad made possible the development of an immaterial languap.

As yet only a boy of seventeen, Origen was already passionately eager to end his life as a witness to the faith in which he had been reared. The scene, with the intense and assured pieties it suggests, seems irretrievably remote from the spiritual life of to present day: we wonder what to early Fathers of the Church, the founders of orthodoxy, could still have to say to us. Rudolf Steiner's whole conception of a form of inner life and (tevelop- ment that accords with man's demand for scientic and philosophical understanding of himself and the universe, seems utterly at variance with to absoluteness with which the Alexandrian martyrs renounced the world. Or , if we visit to library and survey their vast works, we pro bably feel something between bewilderment and pity at the voluminous passion spent upon the Trinitarian controversy. But suppose we come across Origen's On First Principles , we may nd ourselves surprised- pre-existence, reinc^nation, former world-cpnditions ? That is not all what we expected from one of those pious Fathers - and suggests that we reconsider the whole question. One of Rudolf Steiner's innumerable startling and profoundly illum inating comments was that we might see in the events of the present day a resurgence of to spiritual impulse manifested in to earliest Christ ian centuries. As I shall try to suggest, this evaluation seems particularly interesting in the case of Origen. But we should not gloss over the deep differences .between the per iods. Eusebius, for instance, continues his account of to persecution by relating that when has father had been arrested, Origen was prevented from voluntarily joining him only by his motor, who hid all his clothes and thus effectively prevented him from leaving the house. He contented himself with writing a letter to his father - an exhortation to die for the faith, bidding him not to worry about his family, or have any cares for other worldly matters. Eusebius has a smile for the ingenuity of divine Providence, and praise for the precocious \"love of godliness\" in the young scholar . His piety had alarmed even his parents at times; yet we are liable to nd the hist orian's attitude rather monstrous. Piety seems to have ousted humanity. * Mr Welburn is a Research Student in Cambridge University and a Scholar of Selwyn College.72ORIGEN : TEACHER OF FREEDOM ORIGEN : TEACHER OF FREEDOM73 We shall understand this case more deeply, however, if we see it as marking a particular stage in the evolution of human consciousness, as described by Rudolf Steiner; a different attitude to personality , and a different kind of relationship between a man's ideas, or things believed and the outer world of his actions: a mode of experience in which the sense of individual selfhood was less evolved, so that men were on the whole imused to distinguishing themselves from the content of their beliefs. Still living in this \"Intellectual-soul\" mode of consciousness appropriate to the Graeco-Roman epoch, the early Christians so far identied themselves with their faith that they felt none of that lack of certainty or assurance so familiar to the modern soul. Their sense of the ego, or \"I\", was hardly subjective at all, but was membered into the faith of the whole community . The Church was no mere assembly of indiv iduals, but a real spiritual being embracing them all in a higher unity, beside which their personal, earthly lives were not only less important but less'real. It was no mere allegory when the Church was seen as the Moon returning in her unsteady fashion the constant and eternal light of Christ, the Sun, but a sense that man's spiritual life still belonged essen tially in the great processes of the cosmos. In the days of Origen this kind of awareness was being progressively undermined by a new and more dened sense of selfhood. Perhaps because of this precariousness the old kind of consciousness staged a desperate attempt to assert itself in its purest form. Just because man's consciousness was in the natural course of evolution descending into more earthly realms of experience, the ancient mode of awareness turned away in revulsion toward the spiritual heights with intensest longing. This peculiar ambivalence is the most pervasive characteristic of the Hellenistic culture of that time, and Alexandria, one of its greatest centres, was at once the home of all kinds of pleasures and diversions and of a multitude of spiritual movements. Here had flourished Basilid- es and other great gnostic initiates; here were Mystery-cults of all types from the Greek to the most decadent Asiatic; Pythagoreans and Middle Platonists lectured behind closed doors to an audience of the initiated, sworn to silence. With the decline of the earlier sense of man's belonging to the cosmos, the spiritual impulse of alchemy was turning to the ele mental forces at work in more earthly regions, and along with the mat erialistic studies of the Stoics, beginning to develop a natural science appropriate to the new mode of consciousness, less theoretical than early Greek science and more directly concerned with material pro cesses. The town itself was thronged by people of all nationalities and trad itions, with many factions and no coherent sense of cultural identity. Ideas from Greek classical thought blended with oriental and Egyptiannotions, Roman external values confronted the Judaistic cultivation ofthe innermost soul-life. With the spread of Roman rule and the miscel laneous ingredients of Hellenistic culture which it bore with it, national boundaries and values broke down. Rudolf Steiner connects this mixture of races directly with the dev elopment of the stronger sense of selfhood which was to reach its full flowering, and its moral crisis, in our own times. Indeed, does this notb r i e f s k e t c h s u g g e s t a c l o s e a n a l o g y w i t h o u r c i v i l i s a t i o n ? I t s s t r o n g a n d increasing awareness of the draw of earthly attractions; its feeling thattraditional certainties have collapsed under the impact of the relativ-istic realisation of other views of the world, utterly different, and of the transience of all conceptions of life; its flight into the haven of trans cendentalism; and its revival of ancient, atavistic methods of spiritualcultivation - do not all of these have a striking relevance to modern lifea l t e r a l l ?

But there was another , of particular interest: the possibility steeped in the complex intellectual culture of the time, th\" M transform the spiritual longing for the old wisdom ofe Mysteries into a form suitable for the new consciousness. This attempt was made by Origen. W h e n , u n d e r t h e p e r s e c u t i o n s o f S e v e r u s a l r e a d y m e n t i o n e d , C l e m e n to Alexandria fled from Egypt, never to return, his former pupil Origen Was honoured with his position as head of the Catecheticd School, &vmg instruction on the scriptures and the basic principles of Christ i a n i t y . T h a t a t t h e a g e o f e i g h t e e n h e s h o u l d h a v e r e c e i v e d t h i s a p p o i n tment is an obvious testimony to his zeal in learning, and the expanded concept of his role as he developed it at the School was to determine me nature of his future work. T eaching was primarily in the form of reading the scriptural text and ad^g comments to help the pupils interpret it correctly , so thatOrigen's task was essentially that of spanning the gulf between the events and doctrines of the Old and New Testaments and the know ledge and ideas of his pupils. These came from all the varied classes of ^exandrians \u2014 those bom into Christian families, converts from Gnost icism, paganism, Platonism and the rest. In the work of the Comment- ^es, which he began at this period, Origen sought to show how the texts, even the most baldly historical parts of the Jewish canon, had a \" s p i r i t u a l \" l e v e l o f m e a n i n g w h i c h h a d a t i m e l e s s s i g n i c a n c e f o r a n y o n e undertaking spiritual development. Moreover , many of the ways of74 ORIGEN : TEACHER OF FREEDOM thinking in which earlier interpretations had been framed had now changed subtly , and Origen found it embanassingly difcult to explain the resurrection of the physical body , or the uttering of the divine Word, or the fall from Paradise, in a way that made sense to his new hearers. The project slowly matured in his mind of writing a complete re- interpretation of the Christian world-conception. He worked with all theenthusiasm at his disposal, travelling to Arabia, to Rome and elsewhere in the course of his researches. Back in Alexandria, he revived his reading of the Greek writers and philosophers, and probably attended the lect ures of Ammonius Saccas, the teacher of Plotinus. T o the writings of the Stoics and contemporary Aristotelians, Origen added his own vast know ledge of Jewish traditions and apocryphal works, of the allegorist Philo Judaeus, his own predecessor Clement, and current theological works. Finding that his new work interfered too heavily with his work at the School, he reformed its whole structure. He handed over his work as a catechist to one of his pupils, and himself concentrated on the more advanced work in the sphere of asceticism and theology . As a result, the Catechetical School evolved into something like a University, with a preliminary course, and an advanced group to whom Origen taught philosophy and the spiritual, esoteric interpretation of the scriptures, employing the quasi-allegorical methods of Hiilo and Clement before him on an enlarged scale. The well-known and well-authenticated fact of Origen's self-castra tion calls for brief mention here, though the reasons for it are unclear: whether he was merely escaping the \"lusts of the flesh\", or trying to achieve a state beyond the nite division of the sexes, a kind of whole ness or androgyny belonging to those \"who have made themselves eunuchs for the l^gdom of heaven's sake\". Whatever the implication, it told against him when inquiries were made as to the orthodoxy of his teachings. Origen had come a long way from the belief that the soul's salvation could be assured by belief in a few fundamental dogmas. Now he con ceived of the process in the manner of successive initiations into higher stages of spiritual truth. The basic princii^es of Christianity were only a starting point from which to begin an understanding of the nature of man, and the universe around him. Thus in the preface to his treatise. On First PTmciples, he distinguishes between certain fundamental Christ ian truths - e.g. the Incarnation and Resunection \u2014 which lie beyond human verication and are to be accepted simply because they are set out in the Bible, and truths which were put into the Scriptures in order that persons with special aptitudes might interpret them allegorically and so extend their spiritual understanding.O R I G E N : T E A C H E R O F F R E E D O M 7 5 In this quest for truth the Giristian canon was by no means treated as the one and only source of truth, as we have seen. Gregory Thaumat- urgus, one of the students of the School at this period, recalled that \"nothing was prohibited us, nothing hidden, nothing placed out of reach.We were free to study any teaching whatever, Greek or barbarian, mystical or moral.\" The arbiter of truth could only be the aspirant's own ego, his inner sense of being an \"I\" in quest of knowledge. Whereas Clement of Alexandria had appealed to esoteric tradition as the founda tion of his account of the stages of initiation in the soul. Origen canies the internalisation further. With Philo's method of interpreting the Old T estament, inner experiences purely spiritud in nature replace the initiation ceremonies of the Mysteries^. The seeker after higher knowledge can no longer be guided through certain experiences and instructed in esoteric knowledge. He can no longer be guided from without to the realisation of his higher nature. This highest ideal is given in the gureof the Christ, and there stands over against this the human personality , now isolated and self-dependent^. Origen accepts the revelation of the Christ \u2014 indeed, centres his whole system upon it - and shifts the emphasis toward the personality, the \"I\", which he wants to lead on a path of knowledge illiunined by that ideal. This will demand that the soul iise all its resources, its reason, and its knowledge of all manner of things. The Christ-event had revealed to ^ men the divine nature which had been apprehended by the initiatesin the ancient Mysteries. But for Origen, it was not enough merely to be- iieve or passively accept this revelation: starting with this gift from the invisible world, the soul must grasp in ordinary consciousness its own nature and delation to the world. Anyone wishing to progress, and who \"is desirous of constructing out of the foregoing a connected body of knowledge, must use points like these as elementary and foundation principles, in accordance with the commandment to enlighten yourselves with the light of knowledge\".'* Thus Origen explains the intention, and title, of hisiJe Principiis, the brilliant epitome of his researches up to this time. It survives in a Latin translation (slightly \"corrected\"), and a number of original fragments, from which we have to deduce what Origen really intended. The \"con nected body of knowledge\" he expounds consists of nothing less than a history of the universe, explaining how it came to have its present formand condition. This sets Origen apart from most of his contemporaries, who were accomodating Christianity to the new age largely by concen trating on its devotional and ethical aspects; but he includes these new emphases by centring the motive-force of his system on the self-consc ious ego, and its faculty of free will. At the beginning of all creation, Origen writes, God created a large76 ORIGEN : TEACHER OF FREEDOM ORIGEN : TEACHER OF FREEDOM77 number of beings: all were perfect and unflawed, being of divine work manship, and ail were possessed of free will. They were as yet not of the various natures that was known in his time, such as angelic beings, daemons, men, animals etc, but all of one kind, closely akin to the Godhead's own nature. Moreover, they were not yet internally differen tiated, as man presently is into body , soul and spirit, but they were com pletely \"intellectual\" (logikoi) and contained no material or psychic substance. Origen is insistent on the importance of the freedom given to these creatures; indeed, commentators have found his painstaking discussion of it a little too protracted. But we should hold in mind that it is this above all which distinguishes his cosmology from that of the old Myst eries, and marks it off as a world-conception belonging unequivocally to the period of genuine ego-consciousness. Inevitably, one of these intel lectual natures \u2014 the being since called Lucifer - uses its freedom to revolt and thereby involves the entire created order: Some sinned deeply and became daemons, others less and became angels; others still less and became arch-angels; and thus each in turn received the re ward for his individual sin. But there remained some souls who had not sin ned so greatly as to become daemons, not so very highly as to become angels. God therefore made the present world, and bound the soul to the body as a punishment.5 Thus the whole cosmic hierarchy originated from the dispersal of the original community of equal spirits. Origen believes that he has discovered also the rationale of the exist ence of the physical universe, which God created as appropriate for those beings who through their falling away had become \"souls\". Thus, for him the physical nature of anything is a direct embodiment of its inner nature, and he concludes that all corporeal things are the outer vest ments of living beings. The sun, pioon and stars are living, spiritual natures who were only later given the material bodies we now see placed in the rmament, just as man's pre-existent soul was in due course in serted into a physical body. Here again Origen breaks with the older tradition, preserved in Greek speculations, that the heavenly bodies were immutable and eternal, and we see the process which Rudolf Steiner often indicated, whereby man's earthly mode of thinking gradually invaded even the macrocosm - the process our own age has completed. Origen's version, however, is double- edged, for it depends upon the necessity of attributing a soul-spiritual nature to the planets. He marries the old with the new. If God's action in creating the world had been the nal, once-for-all event that ordinary theology usually took it to be (as it still does), Origen would have been unable to avoid a rigid fatalism. Each bodyinto which a soul was born would have been an absolute judgement from God on its nature and eternally appropriate to it. The holy would indeed be chosen \"in their mother's womb\", and the damned would already be marked out for perdition when they fell from their primal, bodiless state. God would have effectively frozen the world-process by harden ing it in matter. This was not at all what Origen wanted. Rather, he said, the whole material world must be only one phase in a series of world-conditions. God had subjected the whole creation to material existence against its will \"for the revealing of the glory of the sons of God\". The sun and moon had to fulll their tasks of giving off light in the cosmos, so that through the long process of development they might be released again from the burden of material existence in the nal deliverance (or apokatastasisj and return to God. This, he says, interpreting St. Paul, is why the whole creation groans for the deliverance of the sons of God. The possibility of re-attaining this condition depends on the free decision of all the logikoi and just as the cosmic beings pass in varying forms through earlier and future world-conditions, so human souls are not committed to any one body, but are reincarnated many times in a variety of bodies, each one depending on the condition of the soul which resulted from its previous incarnation. In due course, a man might prot sufciently to rise to the next level of spiritual purity andbe embodied in the form of an angel \u2014 though, as is the way of Origen's world, he might well relapse in a later life to the all-too-human, or worse. Furthermore, some of the Church Fathers were startled to have it demonstrated out of scripture that the daemons, and Lucifer him self, were perfectly likely to reform, and rise through successive incar nations to the rank of archangel or beyond. Origen seems denitely to have envisaged that in the apokatastasis literally all the beings originally created would return to proximity with the divine. He assigns the dae mons insubstantial bodies of air, which in the course* of evolution would become more and more diaphanous as their natures were cleansed, and nally melt into the incorporeal. The worst fate that could befall an intellectual being in the course of its embodiments, was that it might lose its rationality and undergo transmigration into an animal form, perhaps even sinking to the vege table orinanimate level. For Origen all evil and passion is a \"likening\" to the irrational, and he does not seem willing, or able, to distinguish bet ween wicked natures who become daemonis and those which decline into irrational natures, He may have thought that conning someone in the form of a plant was a providential device for preventing him from committing much in the way of evil; but it is hard to see how a soul which had sunk so far, or to the mineral kingdom, could retain free will78 ORIGEN : TEACHER OF FREEDOM ORIGEN : TEACHER OF FREEDOM 79 and thus be able to rise again to become rational. The translator has evidently blurred mudi of the precision of Origen's thought on these matters, however, and the elucidation of it has become a matter for expert scholars. One clear point is that Origen did not regard this chan^ of nature as nal, since he asserts that even minerally bound spirits will retrace their steps. This \"dynamic\" account of the nature of the universe stemmed in part, as we have mentioned, from a desire to escape from the old idea that each thing had its place allotted \"by its nature\", and the fatalism this tended to entail. Origen is thus led into interesting reflections on what we would call karma. The concept of reincarnation is introduced to circumvent the apparently unalterable created order and to allow movement and change of heart in the logikoi, so that God is to be free of any charge of favouritism. For supposing that God created a soul at the same time as the body was born, how was it to be accounted for that one was born into a sound body and another born blind or maimed ? Or one in luxury and one in poverty ? Or what of Jacob and Esau, of whom it is said that even before they were born God loved the one and hated the other ? What more palpable \"respect of persons\" could there be ? Origen concludes that simultaneous creation of soul and body leads to arbitrariness; unless we accept that God is governed by his whims in these affairs, we must say that he already has a foundation for judge ment at birth: \"It is found that there is no unrighteousness in the fact that Jacob supplanted his brother even in the womb, provided we be lieve that by reason of his merits in some previous life, Jacob had deser ved to be loved by God to such an extent as to be worthy of being pre ferred to his brother.\"\u00ae In his search for a world-conception that will have at its heart the free, self-conscious spirit, Origen is led to the view that such a concep tion must imply reincarnation if it is not to fall victim to an appeal to mere chance or capriciousness in the nature of things. And any such appeal is in essence an admission of defeat. The doctrine of reincarnation led Origen to a view of the Incarnation rather different from the orthodox one. The problem may be summar ised. Christ, the second Person of the Trinity, cannot be a fallen being, it is clear; yet Jesus, as a man, must have had a pre-existent soul; how can these two have been identical, have been God made man ? Origen answers this by qualifying his account of the primal lapse. Whereas all other souls followed Lucifer to some degree, one only , the Jesus-soul,had looked with such profound love and contemplation on the Godhead, t h a t i t s l i k e n e s s h a d g r o w n m o r e t h a n c r e a t u r e l y a n d b e c o m e a n a f n i t y o f e s s e n c e . T h i s o n e c r e a t u r e , g r o w n o f o n e k i n d w i t h G o d , w a s n o t i n volved in the fall into physical generation.' This soul, pure of all tendency to mutability or corruption, could thus be used as the means of Christ's taking on human form. Nor was it enough that Christ should suf fer to redeem humanity alone. But as the whole strung-out hierarchy of angels and daemons had one origin, so he believed that after proclaiming the \"earthly gospel\", Christ took on the nature of the daemonic inhabit ants for their salvation in the aerial spheres. Thus in the long-drawn course of evolution Christ ministers to the various ranks of beings, slowly drawing them toward the re-union with God. As men became more spiritual, their souli would gradually be freed from the heavy physical bodies in which they were schooled, so that Christ's saving of the soul was at the same time a spiritualising of the body . The gross physical body was subject to corruption, disease and death, but in the course of the ages these bodies would be gradually metamorphosed into light, ethereal bodies. The matter would be lost,and the principle of vitality in the body would be clothed in more tenous, translucent forms. Once more the end would be like the beginr ning, for the souls who had gradually drifted earthward, taking on denser bodies as they went, until they acquired solid, mineral ones on the earth's surface, would rise again into the atmosphere in their spirit ualised bodies. In the domains of the clouds they will be caught up to see Christ again as the scriptures promised; here the saints will be educa ted in all they had learnt during their lives on earth, seen now from the vantage point of the spiritual world. Origen speculates that there must' be a \"lecture hall, or school, for souls where they may be taught\" in this region. After due instruction, souls embark on their journey throu^ the spheres, the \"mansions\" of the Father's realm (First Principles II. 11.6). Since they are now freed from the irksome necessity of earthly limbs, the ethereal body assumes a more harmonious shape. We are told that Origen taught: The Lord's body after the resurrection was ethereal and spherical in shape; and after the resurrection all other men's bodies will be the s^e; and that (Anally) when the Lord has put away his own body and all men have done likewise, the corporeal nature will disappear into non-existence.\u00ae In the far distant future, in theapokatastasis^ the state of the begin ning would be restored: the purely spiritual God would at last be all in all\". My brief summary has omitted many of the things for which historians commonly remember Ori^n \u2014 notably his contribution to Trinitar ian theology and the doctrine of \"eternal generation\". They are not,I t h i n k , u n i m p o r t a n t : b u t t h e y t e l l u s l e s s o f O r i g e n ' s p a r t i c u l a r e n t e r prise, of the special kind of interpretation he wanted. For the account of the universe he gave is primarily a scientic one, directed at explaining80 ORIGEN : TEACHER OF FREEDOM ORIGEN: TEACHER OF FREEDOM 81 empirical cireumstances, and the laws which brought then) about and which will alt<ir them in the future. It has very little to do with either theology or strict philosophy as such. The \"rst principles\" on which the system is founded are the basic postulates, comparable to the supposi tion of causality in our science. In the light of these postulates Origen provides a natural history of the cosmos, a dynamic and virtually evolu tionary (if circular) interpretation of nature. But, unlike nineteenth- century science, he did not limit his eld to the material: his guiding principles are the free spiritual beings of the incorporeal world. He was a scientist who sought an explanation of the earthly in the light of the invisible. This description is, I confess, tendentious. But it returns me to Rudolf Steiner's comment which I quoted at the outset, and enables us to see that the task of Anthroposophy is in a sense the same, yet the opposite of Origen's. Origen lived in a period when the old Mystery-knowledge was dying, and his aim was to vivify it by giving it a new, scientic form suitable for the coming phase of man's development; Rudolf Steiner found this scientic form of thought already flourishing and made it his task to raise it into the spiritual world from which it had become est ranged. The two purposes are related like mirror-images. Origen endeav ouring to maintain a continuity between the old Mystery-wisdom and Christianity, as the religion which developed self-consciousness and its virtues of freedom; Rudolf Steiner striving to carry this consciousness to the point where it can regain knowledge of the spiritual worlds. But Origen was not an initiate - he could not develop the new mode of consciousness so as to grasp anew and independently the wisdom re vealed in the Mysteries. His intellectual reconstruction depends on their traditions, and inevitably falls into error on a good many points. The attempt, however, was an appropriate one, and we can appreciate that if he had succeeded, the transition from the ancient spiritual knowledge to the new might have been more quietly achieved, and orthodox Christ ianity might not have been so completely severed from its esoteric roots.^ It was not to be. Using as a pretext that Origen was not ordained and thus had no right to teach, the Bishop of Alexandria and others supp ressed his activities, and when he was ordained by sympathisers this was declared invalid and he was excommunicated. He went into exile in Caesarea, where he devoted himself to the enormous labour of his biblical commentaries. His earlier supporters, like Jerome, now turned against him and sided with the orthodox decree. Later councils forbade the reading of his works as heretical. He preserved a noble distance and continued his studies, but with a certain disillusion about his fellow men. We hear a personal nuance in a commentary on the Exodus, seen as anallegory of the soul transcending the material body: his countrymen,the Egyptians, he says, are a people made for slavery. ^ E u s e b i u s , H i s t o r y o f t h e C h u r c h , V I , 2 . ^ S e e R u d o l f S t e i n e r , C h r i s t i a n i t y a s M y s t i c a l F a c t ( 1 9 7 2 e d . ) p . l 3 7 ^ I .

NOTE ON ORIGEN'S WRITINGS AND ON FURTHER READING Origen's literary output was enormous: his most ambitious project, the \"Six fold Bible\" (Hexapla) formed the core of his Ufc's work of elucidating the scrip tures. It consisted of the Hebrew text, a transliteration, and four Greek versions lo parallel columns. He went on to provide commentaries on ndarly all the books of both T estaments. As a general introduction he wrote the De Pnncipilis, which is surprisingly readable, and the obvious starting point for study . It is available in paperback as Origen on First Principles (Harper T orchbooks, 1966); though it proves disconcertingly hard to order in this country . The most important Commen tary is that on St. John's Gospel.

As Heidenreich reminds us, a quite new light on the vexed question of the authorship of the Book of Revelation was thrown by Rudolf Steiner's nding that the author of the Fourth Gospel and of the E p i s t l e s o f S t J o h n w a s t h e L a z a r u s w h o m C h r i s t h a d \" r a i s e d f r o m t h edead\" - or, rather, from the deathlike condition undergone during initiation in those days. But if we take .it that this same John was the author of Revelation, written (or dictated) at the age of about 90, while he was in exile on the island of Patmos during the Domitian persecu tion, we have the problem that in style and language the Apocalypse is very different from the Fourth Gospel and the Johannine Epistles, Iti s w r i t t e n , \" H e i d e n r e i c h s a y s , \" i n a m o s t e x t r a o r d i n a r y l a n g u a g e . T h e words are Greek, but, broadly speaking, the grammar is Hebrew . How c a n w e e x p l a i n t h i s ? , r i Heidenreich suggests that in John, as an initiate, the three souMacul- ties, thinking, feeling and willing, had acquired a certain independent ofone' another , so that each faculty could be given distinctive expression, as required. In the Fourth Gospel we have \"inspired thought the most wonderful level of pure Christian thought\". In the Epistles we have \"the essence of feeling\", variations on the great theme of C^istian love; while in the Apocalypse John writes \"in the sphere of his will', and Hebrew , written only with consonants, is the language of the wffl. Certainly, in reading the Apocalypse, one can feel that most powerful will-forces, often those of great Angelic Beings, are at work. Heidenreich goes on to clarify the structure of the book, showing that it falls into four great stages, each made up of seven sub-stages - seven letters to the churches in Asia, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven vials of wrath. \"And this fourfold sevenhood is introduced by thevision of the Son of Man, the great vision of archetypal Man, and is con cluded by the picture of the new Jerusalem, the human co^unity , the City\". He examines the signicance of numbers, especially 7, 12 a n d 4 , i n t h e A p o c a l y p s e , a n d g o e s o n t o d i s c u s s s o m e o f i t s m a i n e l e ments, without of course attempting to explain everything. His com mentary is wonderfully clear and readable, and very often illuminating.The Apocalypse, he observes, is written in a kind of code which has to be deciphered, and this can be done in ways which bring out its rele vance to the needs and aspirations and temptations of humanity at the present time. One lecture has the striking title, *The Freedom of Redemption and the Necessity of Doom.\" Before explaining this choiw of words, Heid enreich notes that * the verses and chapters dealing with tragedies, with d o o m , w i t h h o r r o r s , a r e f a r m o r e n u m e r o u s t l m t h e c o m p a r a ^ e l yl i m i t e d a n d r a r e c h a p t e r s d e a l i n g w i t h s a l v a t i o n , l i b e r a t i o n a n d r e d e m p tion.\" The reason for this, he suggests, is that John was acutely aware that by \"falling\" away from the Divine, humanity had brought on itself inevitable consequences, which could be predicted, but redemptioni s s o m e t h i n g t h a t m e n a r e f r e e t o s e e k o r t o r e j e c t , a n d s o i t c a n n o t e predicted in the same way.I c a n s e e t h e p o i n t o f t h i s c o n t r a s t , y e t i t s e e m s t o m e t h a t t h e A p ( > c a l y p s e d o e s p r e d i c t i n s o m e d e t a i l h o w r e d e m p t i o n w i l l c o m e a b c m t a nh o w i t w i l l a p p l y t o o n l y a p r o p o r t i o n o f h u m a n s o u l s , . w h i l e t h e r e s tw i l l b e c a s t i n t o p e r d i t i o n .

On this difcult question Heidenreich makes two important pomts.H e s a y s t h a t w h e r e t h e A p o c a l y p s e s p e a k s o f ' V i a l s o f w r a t h \" o r o f t h e84REVIEWSREVIEWS85 \"wrath of God\", the word \"wrath\" should be rendered as \"erce love, erce consuming love\". And one can, perhaps, understand that anyone who resists the love of God or is unworthy of it might experience it as a burning re. Secondly, Heidenreich refers to a statement by Rudolf Steiner to the effect that \"there will be certain types of humanity destroyed; they will have no offspring,\" and he continues: Putting things very crudely in my own words - there will be times when there are many human individualities in the spiritual world, and only the strong est, those who have made the biggest spiritual strides, will be able to form a body and be bom on earth and continue human evolution on earth. The ord inary Christian might say \"Wonderful - and the rest of us can stay in heaven!\" But that would not be wonderful, because it is deeply built into the human soul that its mission is to advance and cultivate and transform this planet; and to be in the spiritual world without a chance to come to earth must give a sense of terrible disappointment and frustration, in cosmic dimensions. We talk of frustration here and we know what it is, but think of frustration of a cosmic size: that is suffering. Here, most certainly, is something to think about, but I nd this pro spect not easy to reconcile with the lurid imagery of the Apocalypse - the plagues and torments, the streams of blood, the lake of re and brimstone - or with the \"dooms\" that fall on the earth itself - e.g. in VIII,7, where (in Heidenreich's own rendering) we read: \"And hail and re, mingled with blood, formed itself and was hurled upon the earth. And a third part of the earth was burnt up, and one-third of all the trees was burnt up, and every blade of green grass was burnt up.\" Orthodox commentators have often sought to relate parts of the Apocalypse to the precarious situation of the early Christians in the Roman world of their time. Thus the graphic account of the fall of \"Babylon, that great city\", is taken to express a longing to see Rome and its rich empire destroyed. The whole character and inspiration of the book are surely enou^ to rule out this view of its purpose, and Heidenreich has some enlightening comments on the signicance of Babylon, the Scarlet Woman and the several Beasts who gure in these chapters. Yet in the \"dooms\" one can feel at times an almost vindictive quality, and this makes me wonder whether the vision of the seer, in the course of being rendered into human language, could have been coloured in places by the conflict, very acute just then, between the persecuted Christians and the overwhelming power and wealth of Rome. At any rate it is a relief to reach the concluding chapters \u2014 \"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth\" \u2014 and the New Jerusalem comes down from heaven. Heidenreich is very helpful on what we can learn from this culmination with regard to the right treatment of our own bodies and of the material world. \" 'Let the artist not die in your soulis perhaps a message coming from the New Jerusalem.\" Margaret Roberts was ri^t to include in this volume, after the leo tures, the full text of Heidenreich's rendering of the Apocalypb, As she says, it is not and was not meant to be an exact translation, but an inter pretative rendering designed as an aid to elucidating ^me of the many difcult passages and phrases. This volume offers one more occasion for gratitude at having had Alfred Heidenreich to live and work among us. C h a r l e s D a v y A L I F E I N T H E L I G H T George Adams, Interpreter of Rudolf Steiner: His Life and a Selection of his essays. Compiled by Olive WMcher. Foreword by Owen Bareld. (Henry Goulden \u00a32.75). All but three of the essays in this most welcome volume were rst print ed in the Golden Blade. When Arnold Freeman and I were planning this annual, I remember how glad we were to have a contribution from George Adams for our rst issue, 1949. It was the year of the Goethe centenary and George's article was called \"Goethe's Concept of 'light and Darlmess' and the Science of the Future.\" It strikes me now that this title had a quite unintended relevance to George's own life and work. I always felt that his writing and lecturinghad a luminous quality; indeed, it shone from his eyes. He was at home with the light-lled spaces of the cosmos, while his clear thinkir^ explained their mobile geometry of plane and point and its bearing on the formative forces of the ethereal realm. And \"the Science of the Future\" - yes, if ways are found of bringing the ethereal realm into the recognised range of scientic inquiry, then I believe George will be remembered as a pioneer who carried forward Rudolf Steiner's indica tions in this new eld and made them fruitful, notably in coimection with the growth of plants. This volume opens with Olive Whicher's account of George's life and Work (this also appeared rst in the Golden Blade, 1964, the year after his death). She traces his life from his unusual childhood in GaUcia, where he grew up speaking English and German; his education in Eng land, leading to a Cambridge honours degree in science; his rst meeting86 REVIEWS REVIEWS 87 with Rudolf Steiner at Dornach in 1919. After this - apart from his war work with the Polish overseas broadcasting service sponsored by the B.B.C. in London - all his varied activities, including his constant com- cern for social affairs, were related to Steiner's teachings. From 1935 onwards Olive Whicher was his helper and his close col laborator in scientic work. She is thus exceptionally well qualied to bring before us George's aims, achievements, projects and disappoint ments, and she does this admirably, with intimate sympathy and discern ment. Then we come to Olive's selection of George's essays, mostly concern ed with some' aspect of science in. relation to Anthroposophy. They make one realise yet again how irreparable was the loss to our move ment when he passed on. Among the titles are \"Physics and the light of the World\", *Tlant Growth and the Forms of Space\".*The Hidden Forces in Mechanics\"; and \"Potentisation and the Peripheral Forces of Nature\"; in which George outlined the rst rational explana tion I have read of how homoeopathic remedies can be made more potent by a process of rhythinic dilution. He showed how this process, which makes no sense in terms of ordinary chemistry and has always handicapped homoeopathy in the eyes of orthodox medicine, can be seen in relation to the ethereal forces flowing in from the cosmic- periphery. C.D. A C H R I S T I A N V I E W O F R E I N C A R N AT I O N Oiristianity and Reincarnation. By Rudolf Frieling. (Floris Books, Edinburgh, \u00a33.95). In this book, rst published in Germany in 1974 and newly translated into English, Dr Rudolf Frieling, the Erzoberlenker of The Christianity Conununity carries a step further two substantial contributions by his predecessors Dr Friedrich Rittelmeyer and Emil Bock to this central question of the twentieth century. An understanding of the relationshipof reincarnation to Christianity is essential for a serious Christian person of today. In the rst part of this century the idea of reincarnation was thought to be incompatible with a serious Christian life. It was associated only with oriental beliefs. Rittelmeyer attempted, against the background of Anthroposophy , to unite it with Christianity by shomng how the ob jections to it could be overcome in a book called \"Reincarnation in the Light of Thinking, Religion and Morality\".Some years later, Emil Bock, in his book, \"Repeated Earth-lives\", showed how the idea of reincarnation had already been introduced and developed through a line of the most prominent European'thinkers which included Goethe, Fichte, Novalis, Wagner, Nietsche and M)rgen- stern. Since then a third book has appeared, Rudolf Steiner's \"Evolution, Reincarnation, Christianity\", where the idea of reincarnation is recon ciled also with evolution. Our understanding of human evolution remains incomplete as long as the line of evolution is regarded as merely an hereditary one. It is completed only when account is taken of theeffect of the unique deed of Golgotha, and of what man brings as fruit from the \"spaces\" between his earthly lives. These three books are at present not available in English, but happily we need wait no longer for a translation of Dr Frieling's very welcome Work. In Christianity and Reincarnation he fust describes the facts of Christianity: Christ's long approach to becoming man. His baptism, theo t h e r s t a g e s o f H i s e n t r y i n t o e a r t h l y i n c a r n a t i o n . H i s d e a t h o n e a r t h . H i s ascension and the event of Whitsun. All these events were unique to the life of Christ, and also in that they happened and will happen only once. At the same time they are also the means of the gradual resurrection of the earth and of all men through the fact of man's repeated incarnations on earth. Dr Frieling then traces the idea of reincarnation from Buddha to L e s s i n g .

S. Turner. (Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay). Obtainable from Rudolf Steiner Bookshops, price \u00a33.00. Mr Turner has written a tremendous book on an enormous theme. Its modest subtitle, *An enquiry into the need and the nature of a new consciousness', is accurate as far as it goes, but no such brief phrase could bring out the book's richness and range. Its theme is nothing less than the fall of man into his present state of spiritual darkness and his poten tial reascent into the li^t, the way up having been opened for 1^ by the coming of Christ at the ^turning -point of time.' The rst of the bodc's seven chapters is called 'Towards the New Revolution', and the others are all in this form. They look in turn towards the future of religion, science, psychology, education, the indiv idual, and the State. Mr Turner's general method is to describe the present unhappy con dition of religion, science and so on, as he sees it, and then to indicate in each case the glorious regeneration that could occur. Here, as space is limited, I must keep to his treatment of religion, a eld in which he is specially qualied by temperament, training and the course of his life. After taking degrees in Theology and En;^sh Literature at Oxford, he served during World War II in the Indian Army. India, its peoples and its religions, made a deep appeal to him; he stayed on there after the war, teaching English at Cdcutta and Dacca Universities until 1959, when he returned to England and spent the next ten years lecturing on the com parative study of religions at a College of Education in London. Recently he revisited West Bengal and Bangladesh, staying at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture in Calcutta and studying the relationship of Vedanta to the teachings of Rudolf Steiner. Mr Turner draws a sombre picture of the contemporary scene. In spite of vast improvements in material comforts and living standards, \"we are less contented than our fathers... A great malaise has come over us...We are that man in the New Testament who gained the whole world only to nd that in doing so he had lost his soul.\" The fundamental cause of this condition, in Mr Turner's view, lies in something that is generally quite unrecognised - the \"downward\" evol ution of human consciousness, resulting in a progressive loss of aware ness of the Divine. This loss has been necessary for the development of a free Ego-consciousness, but until it is understood as a temporary phase, due to be transcended, it will be accepted widely as normal and perman ent. Very many people will feel that they are living in a world without meaning, and that this is the inescapable human lot. It is no use looking to the Christian Churches for a lead out of this situation, for they are under the same spell. \"Nothing is so tragic in the history of the Church in the modem period as the readiness of Theology , queen of the sciences, to accept as truth the changing opinions of hermore junior and less experienced ministers in other departments.\" In other words, many Western theologians have felt bound to take as estab lished some main features of the scientic world-picture, which leaves no room for Divine activity in the material realm, and they have adapted their doctrines accordingly, usually by concentrating on the \"God with in\" and regarding Jesus as more selflessly divine than any other man. For Hinduism and Buddhism this problem has never arisen in the Same way , for they are concerned primarily with the inner life and have often tended to look on the outer world, its history and its sciences, as ^ya, a form of illusion. Mr Turner, however, emphasises that Christ ianity is concerned with the redemption not only of man but of the earth and of matter itself. And for this and other reasons he is uncom promising in his conviction that the future world religion will not be an amorphous blend of \"the best\" in all the great religions, but a regenerated Christianity , which may well arise outside the main Churches. He does not convey to me an altogether clear picture of the Christ ianity to come, but I hope I interpret him correctly in saying briefly that in his view it will be a Christianity of the Holy Spirit, through which the whole process of evolution, embracing man and earth, will be illumin ated and understood. It will recover knowledge of the Hierarchies; and it will make good the impoverishment it has suffered through having' Post all sense of its relationship with and its debt to the earlier religions and culturesout of which its faith was born The esotericism of the spiritual heritage of the East is a well from which, if we are willing to ad mit the leading of the Sphit, the invisible Christ working within oriental religions, we may draw. Those hundreds of young Americans and Europ eans who come to India's resorts of pilgrimage have a real and strong if <hm sense that there is something of value here that is not easily found at home.\"90 REVIEWS REVIEWS 91 Later, Mr Turner makes the remarkable afrmation that as the African and the Asiatic, the Hindu, Buddhist Muslim or Jew cannot be a man, a fully human being, except through the possession of a fully ade quate self-consciousness which, because of die nature and history of the self, can be found only in the being of Qirist, he must in some sense be come Christian, so conversely the European and American .... cannot call themselves Christian, cannot consciously realise the full implications and growth of their being, without in some real sense becoming Buddhists, Hindus and Jews - entering, that is, into the identities, the eros, of those earlier cultures and that of the world that preceded them. It is hard to see anything like this happening in the at all near future, but Mr Turner does not suggest that it will come about easily or that it will not be opposed. He has some powerful pages on the danger that the Ahrimanic religion of scientic materialism, with its dazzling technolo gical miracles, will obscure the need to strive for'those higher forms of consciousness of which Rudolf Steiner so often spoke. In the nal pages of his book Mr T urner offers some practical guidance on how to follow this path in its early stages and on the obstacles to be met on the way . The whole book, indeed, provides something like a foundation course in Anthroposophy , but not by way of formal exposition. What we en counter here is Anthroposophy put to active use by a writer who brings it to bear on many aspects of the world today, and contributes also an immense range of personal observations and comments drawn from his own experience and insights. There are times when I feel that Mr Turner is letting his book run away with him. His main points would stand out more clearly if they were not constantly swept along on the flood-tide of his reflections and i d e a s .

She soon realised that \"she had found a path of inner schooling which was healthy and suitable for the present time. The rest of her life served for a consistent, ever-further advance along it.\" Soon after this she met a young man, Karl Schubert, who had just arrived in Vienna after escaping from imprisonment in Russia. Through him \u2014 he was already an anthroposophist \u2014 die joined the Anthropos- ophical Society in Vienna. She was teaching in a girls' high school whenhi 1921 she was invited to join the recently founded Waldorf School in Stuttgart, where Karl Schubert was already a teacher, and her rst meeting with Rudolf Steiner soon followed. In the last essay in this volume, \"Reminiscence of Rudolf Steiner\", she says: \"T o meet a great spirit is like witnessing the rise of an incom parable star. Light from a higher source shines out across the dark fringe of the horizon .... This was my experience whenever I met Rudolf Steiner. My life found its direction: threads of destiny became visible, linking what had been to what was to come.\"The opening essays in this volume are concerned mdinly with the situation of human beings, especially the young, in countries where a materialistic outlook has wide influence on education and family life. Children today, Maria Roeschl says, bring with them unconscious picture-memories of their pre-natal existence. If they are subjected tosn aridly intellectual education, these pictures remain suppressed, and f h e c h i l d r e n w i l l \" g r o w u p i n t o u n s a t i s e d a d u l t s w h o d o n o t r e a l l y k n o w what they want.\" Some may ^'rise up in opposition out of quite uncon scious motives against the existing social forms....

This lay behind the unceasing search for a leader , for a hero92REVIEWS REVIEWS 93 and an ideal, in the Youth Movement of the early twentieth century, but because no-one ever became aware of this, no hero kept his place for long and no real guidance was discovered. * These essays have a wide range, not conned to youth problems: the subjects include 'The Signicance of St. John's Gospel for a Modern Spiritual Development\"; 'The Dynamics of the Human Life of Soul\"; and 'Tolarities\", embracing 'The Poles of Form and Life in Man\"; 'The Upper and the Lx)wer Gods\"; and \"Harmonising the Opposites.\" Anyone who is seriously following the inner path given by Rudolf Steiner, or is working with children or young people, will nd this vol ume (soon to be published) very helpful. It springs directly from the author's personal experience and has a quality of warmth which comes from the heart. C.D. A B O O K D U E F O R R E B I R T H The English Spirit, by D. E. Faulkner Jones. It is most unusual to review a book which appeared more than forty years ago and has long been out of print, and I am glad that this issue of the Golden Blade has given me the opportunity . The English Spirit, by D. E. Faulkner Jones, a Manchester schoolteacher who died not long after the end of World W ar II, was published in 1935 by the Anthropos- ophical Publishing Company (now the Rudolf Steiner Press), and it is a thousand pities that this remarkable little volume is not more widely known. In it a deep love of English literature, leading to reflections on the special nature and destiny of the En^ish people, is wedded to an equally deep understanding of Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy . An opening chapter on 'The Threefold Soul\" sets the stage by con centrating the reader's attention on the Spiritual Soul, the author pre ferring this designation to the more usual \"Consciousness Soul\", nod o u b t b e c a u s e h e r g a z e i s d i r e c t e d t o t h e f u t u r e a s w e l l a s t h e p a s t . ' T wo important, and apparently contradictory ideas frequently recur in Rudolf Steiner's work. On the one hand he regarded England, the rep resentative of the Spiritual Soul, as the source of that materialism which has spread like a blight over Europe and is now attracting the East with great power . And, on the other hand, he admitted that the English people themselves have somehow escaped the worst conifequences of the materialism they have generated It is nothing short of tragic that the rest of theworld should assimilate the materialistic and utilitarian elements in English life, while misunderstanding and rejecting its loftiest spirituality .For her own essay towards investigating this tragedy the author takes full responsibility. The views put forward are \"purely personal\", but they have arisen, she afrms, \"from a union of concepts derived from Steiner's teaching and the results not only of personal observation and experience, but of attempts to study English literature as an imaginative picture of spiritual realities\". Somehow she mapages to achieve that union, and in a way that usually carries conviction, without blurring for the reader the distinction between Steiner's concepts, and her own \"views\". Though the book is a short one, comprising 220 rather brief pages (and one wishes it were longer), it is difcult to convey an adequate impression of its richness and abundance.

Supported, as they are, by plentiful quotations, each of these chapters amounts almost to a novel exegesis of the work in question, the illuminating kind of interpretationthat may well leave a reader with the uneasy feeling that he has never properly read the work before.The insight which the author brings to bear, rst on the literature and history of England \u2014 by contrast with that of France and Germany , for instance, with which she reveals no slight acquaintance \u2014 and later also on contemporary and social political issues is based on the special relation between Spiritual Soul and physical body , which in turn is the enabling vehicle of our individualised Ego. These two, in their polarrelation to one another , she constantly compares and contrasts with the astral and etheric bodies, nearer to each other in the course of evolution than those opposites and, so to speak, \"sandwiched\" between them.

It is in the two nal chapters, entitled **The Holy Grail\" and \"King Arthur\", that the author goes farthest in her contribution to what I be lieve Rudolf Steiner once designated as the purpose of Anthroposophy \u2014 the rendering exoteric of what has hitherto been esoteric; and it is here that she draws together most of the numerous threads that form the variegated texture of the book. I would not say it is a texture in which no holes at all are to be pick ed. Occasionally we have the impresaon that the full implications of what is being afrmed have not been carefully realised. When for instance, she speaks of the new Christ impulse which began with the Reformation descending **into the human will, in as full a measure as it descended into the feeling-life at its inception \u2014 when large numbers of men and women would rather be burnt alive than deny their faith the implied judgment, that submitting to be burnt alive rather than to deny one's Faith is evidence of feeling, as distinct from will, is to say the least, questionable. But more often, when I was rst held up by some such apparent inconsistency, or contradiction, I found oh closer exam ination it was because I was overlooking some subtle distinction that had previously been made, but less conspicuoudy or less emphatically than it probably would have been in a book of greater length. It transpired in fact that the spiritual penetration was actually deeper than at rst ap peared.\" Altogether , on re-reading The English Spirit after all these years, Icannot avoid the conclusion that it is an exceptionally important and valuable hook, with a feeling of deep regret that it should have remained (Xit of print for so long a time.

Major Keyhoe had assembled a good deal of evidence to sug gest that UFOs are space-craft of a strange kind, manned by intelligent, non-human beings. Mr Constable felt sure that such beings must be able to communicate in some way with people on earth.

My life whole life began to change.\" Mr Constable had already thought of trying to nd some way of photographing the normally invisible UFOs, and Dr Lehrs's book, with its Goethean approach to optics, light and colour, led him to put this idea into practice, using infra-red-sensitive lm. Some of the photo graphs he and a friend took by this means, together with a few from other sources, are a feature of the book. They show forms in the sky; some of these look like spaceships, often surrounded by hazy \"force- elds\"; others are said to be \"biological UFOs\", the apparently prim itive organisms, rather like jellysh, which are believed to inhabit the same ethereal atmosphere as the intelligent Etherians. Mr Constable gives precise details of his photographic equipment, easily bought, but it would be no use going out anywhere and pointing your camera hopefully at the sky . Y ou should choose a high desert area, with low humidity and clear skies, and go out there between dawn and sunrise, taking a, friend to work the camera while you set about attract ing the attention of the Etherians by means of special exercises des igned to send out pulses of \"biogenetic energy\" from your own body .

Time will show how far Mr Constable's view of Reich - \"thegreatest natural scientist of this century\" - is justied, but the virulent persecution of Reich by the American Food and Drug Administrationwas surely wrong. Reich was charged with marketing his \"orgone accum ulator\" for use in medical treatment; in 1957 he died in prison and his books were ordered to be burnt. Equally deplorable, as far as one can judge, was the hounding by the same agency of Dr Ruth Drown, a pioneer of radionic medicine. Mr Con stable knew her well and gives her a high rank in his pantheon. In 1963, at the age of 72, she died of a stroke while in prison, awaiting trial on a charge of practising fraudulent medicine. On these counts my sympathies go with Mr Constable, but I think he is too ready to accept uncritically any book or report which seems to support his opinions. Thus he ^eaks of that very unreliable book, Trevor Ravencroft's The Spear of Destiny, which purports to describe Nazi occultism and its attacks on the Steiner movement, as \"this hist orical masterpiece .... one of the most vital books ever written.\" This language illustrates Mr Constable's extravagant style. He is a vigorous but verbose writeri his book would have lost nothing if he had cut out 90 per cent of his recurrent diatribes against orthodox science and its political supporters in the United States for their refusal to investigate UFOs impartially and their general hostility towards ndings that seem to challenge orthodox doctrines. These charges are not unjustied, but they become tedious when they are repeated in abusive terms at intervals t h r o u g h o u t t h e b o o k .

He has left us a book in whidi - to quote from the jacket \u2014 he \"asserts that it is the task of philosophy to provide a map of life and knowledge whidi exhibits the most important features of life in their prpper prominence . . . .Schumacher's approach also restores the *vertical' dimension to the world by highlighting the discontinuities between minerals, plant life, animal life and human life.\" Schumacher's previous book, S'ma//IS Beauft/M/, became a world-wide bestseller.
