A universal symbol of transformation, the labyrinth was created in ancient times to represent humankind's search for the core of divinity. The pattern is an archetypal form dating back thousands of years. No one knows who created the original labyrinth form. We do know from experience that embedded within each design is a pattern that guides us to our deepest inner being. Whether walked or traced in sand, the labyrinth pattern is a powerful tool for reflection, invocation, meditation and healing. These structures are storehouses of energy as they are built to incline towards Earth's magnetic field and are perfect receivers and transmitters of cosmos energy. Meditating under such a structure is called Pyramid Meditation. Experienced meditators relate profound results in their quest for expanded awareness. Used on a daily basis for meditation and healing as well as for sleeping in, it helps to protect from astral influences, de-crystallize negative patterns or habits and truly heal mind, body and emotions. This installation allows you to experience the benefits of floating motion. This is the same safe motion that we felt, gently floating in our mother's womb. It has positive effects on the lymphatic and circulatory systems, activating a deep, powerful relaxation response. Rocking also increases oxygen delivery to the cells. Your body burns food and oxygen to generate electricity to power your muscles and nervous system. Your cells are starved for oxygen until the lymphatic vessels remove toxins, blood proteins, and water. During rocking, lymphatic circulation increases while you are in a relaxed physical, emotional, and mental state. This experience provides motion that is vital to the body as it enters a more positive state, ready for healing. A fire ceremony is an invitation to be connected to a tradition of hundreds of thousands of years of ancestors, our human family, who sat around a fire to keep warm, to cook food and to dance. This class starts with a guided meditation for centering. Then, you will experience a traditional fire ceremony under the expansive desert sky. Be part of an ancient ritual that uses the transformational element of fire to release and transform the habits and behaviors that do not serve you. The ceremony serves as a meaningful way to stand in your own truth and declare your intentions. We encourage using our special breathing/walking technique to increase delivery of oxygen to your brain, nourish your cells and enhance detoxification as you meander through the beautiful walking paths that wind through our spectacular desert landscape.
