Your child had her regular tetanus shot yesterday. Now, she's having muscle spasms and running a fever. What gives? Immunizations begin in infancy with a DTaP series of shots, which is a three-in-one vaccine that protects against [diphtheria](https://ssl.adam.com/content.aspx?site=trihealthse3.adam.com&login=TRIHEALTH1897&productId=117&pid=1&gid=001608), [pertussis](https://ssl.adam.com/content.aspx?site=trihealthse3.adam.com&login=TRIHEALTH1897&productId=117&pid=1&gid=001561) and [tetanus](https://ssl.adam.com/content.aspx?site=trihealthse3.adam.com&login=TRIHEALTH1897&productId=117&pid=1&gid=000615). \"We think it's an allergic reaction to the pertussis part of it,\" explains [Jill Manahan MD](http://directory.trihealth.com/Details/1037), of [Queen City Physicians - Hyde Park](/hospitals-and-practices/queen-city-physicians/locations/hyde-park-internal-medicine/). Symptoms Your Child May Experience If your child is allergic to one of the DTaP shots, he or she usually experiences a reaction within 24 to 48 hours of the immunization. Symptoms may include: - Seizures that get worse - Other brain problems (at any time) - Mouth, throat, or face swelling within a few hours after receiving the vaccine - Difficulty breathing (serious allergy) within a few hours after receiving the vaccine - Fever of 105 degrees or higher within two days after receiving the vaccine - Shock or collapse within two days after receiving the vaccine - Persistent, uncontrolled crying that lasts for more than 3 hours at a time after receiving the vaccine Other, less common, symptoms that your child may experience later, include: - Seizures within three to seven days after injections - A serious brain problem within seven days after injection When Should I Call 911? Whether you should call your doctor or go to the emergency department depends on the severity of your child's symptoms. \"If it's a mild fever, or a mild rash, then we just have you give them some Tylenol. If it's more serious, and they're having trouble breathing or stiff muscles - that sort of thing - we may have you go to the emergency room,\" Dr. Manahan points out. "}
