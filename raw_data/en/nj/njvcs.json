This week there has been enormously wide coverage in the press for one of the [ worst papers on acupuncture](http://aim.bmj.com/content/early/2017/01/03/acupmed-2016-011208.full) that I've come across. As so often, the paper showed the opposite of what its title and press release, claimed. For another stunning example of this sleight of hand, try [Acupuncturists show that acupuncture doesn't work, but conclude the opposite: journal fails](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/05/31/acupuncturists-show-that-acupuncture-doesnt-work-but-conclude-the-opposite-journal-fails/), published in the British Journal of General Practice). Presumably the wide coverage was a result of the hyped-up press release issued by the journal, BMJ Acupuncture in Medicine. That is not the British Medical Journal of course, but it is, bafflingly, published by the BMJ Press group, and if you [ subscribe to press releases](http://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/) from the real BMJ. you also get them from Acupuncture in Medicine. The BMJ group should not be mixing up press releases about real medicine with press releases about quackery. There seems to be something about quackery that's clickbait for the mainstream media. As so often, [the press release](http://www.dcscience.net/bmj-press-release-acupuncture-colic-1.pdf) was shockingly misleading: It said Acupuncture may alleviate babies' excessive crying Needling twice weekly for 2 weeks reduced crying time significantly This is totally untrue. Here's why. | | Luckily the Science Media Centre was on the case quickly: The paper made the most elementary of all statistical mistakes. It failed to make allowance for the The paper lists 24 different tests of statistical significance and focusses attention on three that happen to give a P value (just) less than 0.05, and so were declared to be \"statistically significant\". If you do enough tests, some are bound to come out \"statistically significant\" by chance. They are false postives, and the conclusions are as meaningless as \"green jelly beans cause acne\" in And that's before you even get to the problem of the weakness of the evidence provided by P values close to 0.05. There's at least a 30% chance of such values being false positives, even if it were not for the jelly bean problem, and a lot more than 30% if the hypothesis being tested is implausible. I leave it to the reader to assess the plausibility of the hypothesis that a good way to stop a baby crying is to stick needles into the poor baby. If you want to know more about P values try One of the people asked for an opinion on the paper was [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22george+lewith%22), the well-known apologist for all things quackish. [He described the work](http://www.dcscience.net/Science-Media-Centre-Roundup-acupuncture-Jan-2017.pdf) as being a \"good sized fastidious well conducted study ..... The outcome is clear\". Thus showing an ignorance of statistics that would shame an undergraduate. On the Today Programme, I was interviewed by the formidable John Humphrys, along with the mandatory member of the flat-earth society whom the BBC seems to feel obliged to invite along for \"balance\". In this case it was professional acupuncturist, Mike Cummings, who is an associate editor of the journal in which the paper appeared. Perhaps he'd read the Science media centre's assessment before he came on, because he said, quite rightly, that \"in technical terms the study is negative\" \"the primary outcome did not turn out to be statistically significant\" to which Humphrys retorted, reasonably enough, \"So it doesn't work\". Cummings' response to this was a lot of bluster about how unfair it was for NICE to expect a treatment to perform better than placebo. It was fascinating to hear Cummings admit that the press release by his own journal was simply wrong. Listen to the interview here Another obvious flaw of the study is that the nature of the control group. It is not stated very clearly but it seems that the baby was left alone with the acupuncturist for 10 minutes. A far better control would have been to have the baby cuddled by its mother, or by a nurse. That's what was used by [Olafsdottir et al (2001)](http://www.dcscience.net/Olafsdottir-2001.pdf) in a study that showed cuddling worked [just as well as another form of quackery](http://www.dcscience.net/2009/06/18/british-chiropractic-association-produces-its-plethora-of-evidence/), chiropractic, to stop babies crying. Manufactured doubt is a potent weapon of the alternative medicine industry. It's the same tactic as was used by the tobacco industry. You scrape together a few lousy papers like this one and use them to pretend that there's a controversy. For years the tobacco industry used this tactic to try to persuade people that cigarettes didn't give you cancer, and that nicotine wasn't addictive. The main stream media obligingly invite the representatives of the industry who convey to the reader/listener that there is a controversy, when there isn't. Acupuncture is no longer controversial. It just doesn't work -see [Acupuncture is a theatrical placebo: the end of a myth](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/30/acupuncture-is-a-theatrical-placebo-the-end-of-a-myth/). Try to imagine a pill that had been subjected to well over 3000 trials without anyone producing convincing evidence for a clinically useful effect. It would have been abandoned years ago. But by manufacturing doubt, the acupuncture industry has managed to keep its product in the news. Every paper on the subject ends with the words \"more research is needed\". No it isn't. Acupuncture is pre-scientific idea that was moribund everywhere, even in China, [until it was revived by Mao Zedong](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/30/acupuncture-is-a-theatrical-placebo-the-end-of-a-myth/) as part of the appalling Great Proletarian Revolution. Now it is big business in China, and 100 percent of the clinical trials that come from China are positive. if you believe them, you'll truly believe anything. Follow-up 29 January 2017 Soon after the Today programme in which we both appeared, the acupuncturist, Mike Cummings, [posted his reaction](http://blogs.bmj.com/aim/2017/01/26/acupuncture-for-infantile-colic/) to the programme. I thought it worth posting the original version in full. Its petulance and abusiveness are quite remarkable. I thank Cummings for giving publicity to the video of our appearance, and for referring to my [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Colquhoun#Missed_short_events). I leave it to the reader to judge my competence, and his, in the statistics of clinical trials. And it's odd to be described as a \"professional blogger\" when the 400+ posts on dcscience.net don't make a penny -in fact they cost me money. In contrast, he is the salaried medical director of the British Medical Acupuncture Society. It's very clear that he has no understanding of the [ error of the transposed conditiona](https://aeon.co/essays/it-s-time-for-science-to-abandon-the-term-statistically-significant)l, nor even the mulltiple comparison problem (and neither, it seems, does he know the meaning of the word 'protagonist'). I ignored his piece, but several friends complained to the BMJ for allowing such abusive material on their blog site. As a result a few changes were made. The \"baying mob\" is still there, but the Wikipedia link has gone. I thought that readers might be interested to read the original unexpurgated version. It shows, better than I ever could, the weakness of the arguments of the alternative medicine community. To quote Upton Sinclair: \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\" It also shows that the BBC still hasn't learned the lessons in Steve Jones' excellent \" [Review of impartiality and accuracy of the BBC's coverage of science](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/editorial_standards/impartiality/science_impartiality.html)\". Every time I appear in such a programme, they feel obliged to invite a member of the flat earth society to propagate their make-believe. | | Acupuncture for infantile colic - misdirection in the media or over-reaction from a sceptic blogger? 26 Jan, 17 | by Dr Mike Cummings So there has been a big response to this paper press released by BMJ on behalf of the journal Acupuncture in Medicine. The response has been influenced by the usual characters - retired professors who are professional bloggers and vocal critics of anything in the realm of complementary medicine. They thrive on oiling up and flexing their EBM muscles for a baying mob of fellow sceptics (see my 'stereotypical mental image' here). Their target in this instant is a relatively small trial on acupuncture for infantile colic.[1] Deserving of being press released by virtue of being the largest to date in the field, but by no means because it gave a definitive answer to the question of the efficacy of acupuncture in the condition. We need to wait for an SR where the data from the 4 trials to date can be combined. So what about the research itself? I have already said that the trial was not definitive, but it was not a bad trial. It suffered from under-recruiting, which meant that it was underpowered in terms of the statistical analysis. But it was prospectively registered, had ethical approval and the protocol was published. Primary and secondary outcomes were clearly defined, and the only change from the published protocol was to combine the two acupuncture groups in an attempt to improve the statistical power because of under recruitment. The fact that this decision was made after the trial had begun means that the results would have to be considered speculative. For this reason the editors of Acupuncture in Medicine insisted on alteration of the language in which the conclusions were framed to reflect this level of uncertainty. DC has focussed on multiple statistical testing and p values. These are important considerations, and we could have insisted on more clarity in the paper. P values are a guide and the 0.05 level commonly adopted must be interpreted appropriately in the circumstances. In this paper there are no definitive conclusions, so the p values recorded are there to guide future hypothesis generation and trial design. There were over 50 p values reported in this paper, so by chance alone you must expect some to be below 0.05. If one is to claim statistical significance of an outcome at the 0.05 level, ie a 1:20 likelihood of the event happening by chance alone, you can only perform the test once. If you perform the test twice you must reduce the p value to 0.025 if you want to claim statistical significance of one or other of the tests. So now we must come to the predefined outcomes. They were clearly stated, and the results of these are the only ones relevant to the conclusions of the paper. The primary outcome was the relative reduction in total crying time (TC) at 2 weeks. There were two significance tests at this point for relative TC. For a statistically significant result, the p values would need to be less than or equal to 0.025 - neither was this low, hence my comment on the Radio 4 Today programme that this was technically a negative trial (more correctly 'not a positive trial' - it failed to disprove the null hypothesis ie that the samples were drawn from the same population and the acupuncture intervention did not change the population treated). Finally to the secondary outcome - this was the number of infants in each group who continued to fulfil the criteria for colic at the end of each intervention week. There were four tests of significance so we need to divide 0.05 by 4 to maintain the 1:20 chance of a random event ie only draw conclusions regarding statistical significance if any of the tests resulted in a p value at or below 0.0125. Two of the 4 tests were below this figure, so we say that the result is unlikely to have been chance alone in this case. With hindsight it might have been good to include this explanation in the paper itself, but as editors we must constantly balance how much we push authors to adjust their papers, and in this case the editor focussed on reducing the conclusions to being speculative rather than definitive. A significant result in a secondary outcome leads to a speculative conclusion that acupuncture 'may' be an effective treatment option... but further research will be needed etc... Now a final word on the 3000 plus acupuncture trials that DC loves to mention. His point is that there is no consistent evidence for acupuncture after over 3000 RCTs, so it clearly doesn't work. He first quoted this figure in an editorial after discussing the largest, most statistically reliable meta-analysis to date - the Vickers et al IPDM.[2] DC admits that there is a small effect of acupuncture over sham, but follows the standard EBM mantra that it is too small to be clinically meaningful without ever considering the possibility that sham (gentle acupuncture plus context of acupuncture) can have clinically relevant effects when compared with conventional treatments. Perhaps now the best example of this is a network meta-analysis (NMA) using individual patient data (IPD), which clearly demonstrates benefits of sham acupuncture over usual care (a variety of best standard or usual care) in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL).[3] 30 January 2017 I got an email from the BMJ asking me to take part in a BMJ Head-to-Head debate about acupuncture. I did one of these [ before, in 2007](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/03/17/debate-in-the-bmj/), but it generated more heat than light (the only good thing to come out of it was the joke about leprechauns). So here is my polite refusal. | | Hello Thanks for the invitation, Perhaps you should read the piece that I wrote after the Today programme Why don't you do these Head to Heads about genuine controversies? To do them about homeopathy or acupuncture is to fall for the \"manufactured doubt\" stratagem that was used so effectively by the tobacco industry to promote smoking. It's the favourite tool of snake oil salesman too, and th BMJ should see that and not fall for their tricks. Such pieces night be good clickbait, but they are bad medicine and bad ethics. All the best David This is my version of a [post which I was asked to write for the Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rio-2016-cupping-michael-phelps-swimming-what-is-it-does-it-work-no-gwyneth-paltrow-cups-marks-a7182411.html). It's been published, though so many changes were made by the editor that I'm posting the original here ( [below](#indy)). Superstition is rife in all sports. Mostly it does no harm, and it might even have a placebo effect that's sufficient to make a difference of 0.01%. That might just get you a medal. But what does matter is that superstition has given rise to an army of charlatans who are only to willing to sell their magic medicine to athletes, most of whom are not nearly as rich as Phelps. So much has been said about cupping during the last week that it's hard to say much that's original. Yesterday I did six radio interviews and two for TV, and today Associated Press TV came to film a piece about it. Everyone else must have been on holiday. The only one I've checked was the piece on the BBC News channel. That one didn't seem to go too badly, so it's here BBC news coverage It starts with the usual lengthy, but uninformative, pictures of someone being cupped, The cupper in this case was actually a chiropractor, [Rizwhan Suleman](http://www.gcc-uk.org/chiropractor-search/?postcode=&surname=suleman). Chiropractic is, of course a totally different form of alternative medicine and its value has [been totally discredited](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=chiropractic+colic) in the wake of the Simon Singh case. It's not unusual for people to sell different therapies with conflicting beliefs. Truth is irrelevant. Once you've believed one impossible thing, it seems that the next ones become quite easy. The presenter, Victoria Derbyshire, gave me a fair chance to debunk it afterwards. Nevertheless, the programme suffered from the usual pretence that there is a controversy about the medical value of cupping. There isn't. But despite Steve Jones' excellent report to the BBC Trust, the media insist on giving equal time to flat-earth advocates. The report, ( [Review of impartiality and accuracy of the BBC's coverage of science](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/editorial_standards/impartiality/science_impartiality.html)) was no doubt commissioned with good intentions, but it's been largely ignored. Still worse, the BBC News Channel, when it repeated the item (its cycle time is quite short) showed only [Rizwhan Suleman](http://www.gcc-uk.org/chiropractor-search/?postcode=&surname=suleman) and cut out my comments altogether. This is not false balance. It's no balance whatsoever. A formal complaint has been sent. It is not the job of the BBC to provide free advertising to quacks. After this, a friend drew my attention to a much worse programme on the subject. The Jeremy Vine show on [BBC Radio 2](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07mjrn6), at 12.00 on August 10th, 2016. This was presented by Vanessa Feltz. It was beyond appalling. There was absolutely zero attempt at balance, false or otherwise. The guest was described as being am \"expert\" on cupping. He was [Yusef Noden](http://www.londonhijamaclinic.com/practitioners/), of the London Hijama Clinic, who \"trained and qualified with the Hijama & Prophetic Medicine Institute\". No doubt he's a nice bloke, but he really could use a first year course in physiology. His words were pure make-believe. His repeated statements about \"withdrawing toxins\" are well know to be absolutely untrue. It was embarrassing to listen to. If you really want to hear it, here is an audio recording. The [Jeremy Vine show](http://www.dcscience.net/Cupping.m4a) This programme is one of the worst cases I've heard of the BBC mis-educating the public by providing free advertising for quite outrageous quackery. Another complaint will be submitted. The only form of opposition was a few callers who pointed out the nonsense, mixed with callers who endorsed it. That is not, by any stretch of the imagination, fair and balanced. It's interesting that, although cupping is often associated with Traditional Chinese Medicine, neither of the proponents in these two shows was Chinese, but rather they were Muslim. This should not be surprising as neither cupping nor acupuncture are exclusively Chinese. Similar myths have arisen in many places. My first encounter with this particular branch of magic medicine was when I was asked to make a [podcast for \"Things Unseen\"](http://www.thingsunseen.co.uk/podcasts/complementary-medicine-a-matter-of-faith/), in which I debated with a Muslim hijama practitioner and an Indian Ayurvedic practitioner. It's even harder to talk sense to practitioners of magic medicine who believe that god is on their side, as well as believing that selling nonsense is a good way to make a living. An excellent history of the complex emergence of similar myths in different parts of the world has been published by Ben Kavoussi, under the title \" [Acupuncture is astrology with needles](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/astrology-with-needles/)\". Now the original version of my [blog for the Independent.](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rio-2016-cupping-michael-phelps-swimming-what-is-it-does-it-work-no-gwyneth-paltrow-cups-marks-a7182411.html) Cupping: Michael Phelps and Gwyneth Paltrow may be believers, but the truth behind it is what really sucks The sight of Olympic swimmer, Michael Phelps, with bruises on his body caused by [cupping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupping_therapy) resulted in something of a media feeding-frenzy this week. He's a great athlete so cupping must be responsible for his performance, right? Just as cupping must be responsible for the complexion of an earlier enthusiast, Gwyneth Paltrow. The main thing in common between Phelps and Paltrow is that they both have a great deal of money, and neither has much interest in how you distinguish truth from myth. They can afford to indulge any whim, however silly. And cupping is pretty silly. It's a pre-scientific medical practice that started in a time when there was no understanding of physiology, much like bloodletting. Indeed one version does involve a bit of bloodletting. Perhaps bloodletting is the best argument against the belief that it's ancient wisdom, so it must work. It was a standard part of medical treatment for hundreds of years, and killed countless people. It is desperately implausible that putting suction cups on your skin would benefit anything, so it's not surprising that there is no worthwhile empirical evidence that it does. The Chinese version of cupping is related to acupuncture and, unlike cupping, acupuncture has been very thoroughly tested. Over 3000 trials have failed to show any benefit that's big enough to benefit patients. [Acupuncture is no more than a theatrical placebo](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/30/acupuncture-is-a-theatrical-placebo-the-end-of-a-myth/). And even its placebo effects are too small to be useful. At least it's likely that cupping usually does no lasting damage.. We don't know for sure because in the world of alternative medicine there is no system for recording bad effects (and there is a vested interest in not reporting them). In extreme cases, it can [leave holes in your skin](http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/popular-treatment-known-as-cupping-therapy-leaves-man-with-seven-holes-in-his-back/news-story/33b979706858045dc7fcce1523772084) that pose a serious danger of infection, but most people probably end up with just broken capillaries and bruises. Why would anyone want that? The answer to that question seems to be a mixture of wishful thinking about the benefits and vastly exaggerated claims made by the people who sell the product. It's typical that the sales people can't even agree on what the benefits are alleged to be. If selling to athletes, the claim may be that it relieves pain, or that it aids recovery, or that it increases performance. Exactly the same cupping methods are sold to celebs with the claim that their beauty will be improved because cupping will \" [boost your immune system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBnZdxCUXbk&feature=youtu.be)\". This claim is universal in the world of make-believe medicine, when the salespeople can think of nothing else. There is no surer sign of quackery. It means nothing whatsoever. No procedure is known to boost your immune system. And even if anything did, it would be more likely to [cause inflammation and blood clots](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/boost-your-immune-system/) than to help you run faster or improve your complexion. It's certainly most unlikely that sucking up bits of skin into evacuated jars would have any noticeable effect on blood flow in underlying muscles, and so increase your performance. The [salespeople would undoubtedly benefit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBnZdxCUXbk&feature=youtu.be) from a first year physiology course. Needless to say, they haven't tried to actually measuring blood flow, or performance. To do that might reduce sales. As [Kate Carter said recently](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/aug/08/does-cupping-do-olympic-athletes-any-good) \"Eating jam out of those jars would probably have a more significant physical impact\". The problem with all sports medicine is that tiny effects could make a difference. When three hour endurance events end with a second or so separating the winner from the rest, that is an effect of less than 0.01%. Such tiny effects will never be detectable experimentally. That leaves the door open to every charlatan to sell miracle treatments that might just work. If, like steroids, they do work, there is a good chance that they'll harm your health in the long run. You might be better off eating the jam. Here is a very small selection of the many excellent accounts of cupping on the web. There have been many good blogs. The mainstream media have, on the whole, been dire. Here are three that I like, | | In July 2016, Orac posted in ScienceBlogs. \" | | Photo Timothy Caulfield, wrote \" [Olympic debunk](http://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/august-2016/olympic-debunk/)!\".

Just don't bother with the comments section which is littered with Trump-like post-factual comments from anonymous conspiracy theorists. Follow-up It makes a nice change to be able to compliment an official government report. | | Ever since the House of Lords report in 2000, the government has been vacillating about what should be done about herbalists. At the moment both western herbalists and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are essentially unregulated. Many (but not all) herbalists have been pushing for statutory regulation, which they see as government endorsement. It would give them a status like the General Medical Council. | | A [ new report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/417768/Report_on_Regulation_of_Herbal_Medicines_and_Practitioners.pdf) has ruled out this possibility, for very good reasons [ [download local copy](/Report_on_Regulation_of_Herbal_Medicines_and_Practitioners.pdf)]. Back story (abridged!) My involvement began with the publication in 2008 of a report on the Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine . That led to my post, [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/06/18/a-very-bad-report-gamma-minus-for-the-vice-chancellor/). [The report](http://dcscience.net/acupunc-steering-group-2008.pdf) was chaired by the Vice-Chancellor of The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen. The membership of the group consisted entirely of quacks and the vice -chancellor's university ran a course in homeopathy (now closed). The Pittilo report recommended statutory regulation and \"The threshold entry route to the register will normally be through a Bachelor degree with Honours\". It ignored entirely the little problem that you can't run a BSc degree in a subject that's almost entirely devoid of evidence. It said, for example that acupuncturists must understand \" yin/yang, 5 elements/phases, eight principles, cyclical rhythms, qi ,blood and body fluids\". But of course there is nothing to \"understand\"! They are all pre-scientific myths. This [\"training dilemma\"](http://www.dcscience.net/dilemmas-of-cam/) was pointed out in one of my earliest posts, You'd think it was obvious, but nonetheless the then Labour government seemed to take this absurd report seriously. In 2009 a consultation was held on the Pittilo report. I and many of my friends spent a lot of time [pointing out the obvious](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Pittilo). Eventually the problem was again kicked into the long grass. The THR scheme Meanwhile European regulations caused the creation of the Traditional Herbal Registration (THR) scheme. It's run by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA). This makes it [legal to put totally misleading claims on labels](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/04/01/why-does-the-mhra-refuse-to-label-herbal-products-honestly-kent-woods-and-richard-woodfield-tell-me/) of herbal concoctions, as long as they are registered with THR, They also get an impressive-looking certification mark. All that's needed to get THR registration is that the 'medicines' are not obviously toxic and they have been in use for 30 years. There is no need to supply any information whatsoever about whether they work or not. This appears to contradict directly the MHRA's brief: \"\"We enhance and safeguard the health of the public by ensuring that medicines and medical devices work and are acceptably safe.\" After much effort, I elicited an admission from the MHRA that there was no reason to think that any herbal concoctions were effective, and that there was nothing to prevent them from adding a statement to say so on the label. They just chose not to do so. That's totally irresponsible in my opinion. See [Why does the MHRA refuse to label herbal products honestly? Kent Woods and Richard Woodfield tell me](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/04/01/why-does-the-mhra-refuse-to-label-herbal-products-honestly-kent-woods-and-richard-woodfield-tell-me/). Over 300 herbal products have been registered under the THR scheme (a small percentage of the number of products being used). So far only one product of Tibetan medicine and one traditional Chinese medicine have been registered under THR. These are the only ones that can be sold legally now, because no herbs whatsoever have achieved full marketing authorisation -that requires good evidence of efficacy and that doesn't exist for any herb. The current report Eventually, in early 2014, the Tory-led government set up yet another body, \"Herbal Medicines and Practitioners Working Group \" (HMPWG). My heart sank when I saw its [membership (Annex A.2).](/Report_on_Regulation_of_Herbal_Medicines_and_Practitioners) The vice-chair was none other that the notorious [David Tredinnick MP (Con, Bosworth)](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/15/a-curious-letter-from-david-tredinnick-mp-the-governments-resident-medical-loon/). It was stuffed with people who had vested interests. I wrote to the chair and to the few members with scientific credentials to put my views to them. But my fears were unfounded, because the report of the HMPWG was not written by the group, but by its chair only. David Walker is deputy chief medical officer and he had clearly listened. Here are some quotations. The good thing about the European laws is that \"This legislation effectively banned the importation and sale of large-scale manufactured herbal medicine products. This step severely limited the scope of some herbal practitioners to continue practising, particularly those from the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurvedic traditions.\" The biggest loophole is that \"At present under UK law it is permitted for a herbal practitioner to see individual patients, offer diagnoses and prepare herbal treatments on their own premises, as long as these preparations do not contain banned or restricted substances. This is unchanged by the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive. \" Walker recognised frankly that there is essentially no good evidence that any herb, western or Chinese, works well enough to make an acceptable treatment. And importantly he, unlike Pittilo, realised that this precludes statutory regulation. \"There are a small number of studies indicating benefit from herbal medicine in a limited range of conditions but the majority of herbal medicine practice is not supported by good quality evidence. A great deal of international, primary research is of poor quality. \" \"ts. Herbal medicine practice is therefore currently based upon traditional practice rather than science. It is difficult to differentiate good practice from poor practice on the basis of this evidence in a way that could establish standards for statutory regulation\" The second problem was the harms done by herbs. Herbalists, western and Chinese, have no satisfactory way of reporting side effects \" . . . there is very limited understanding of the risks to patient safety from herbal medicines and herbal practice. A review of safety data was commissioned from HMAC as part of this review. This review identified many anecdotal reports and case studies but little systematically collected data. Most herbal medicine products have not been through the rigorous licensing process that is required of conventional pharmaceutical products to establish their safety and efficacy. Indeed, only a small proportion have even been subject to the less rigorous Traditional Herbal Registration (THR) process. \" \"The anecdotal evidence of risk to patients from herbal products in the safety review highlighted the prominence of manufactured herbal medicines in the high profile serious incidents which have been reported in recent years. Many of these reports relate to harm thought to be caused by industrially manufactured herbal products which contained either dangerous herbs, the wrong constituents, toxic contaminants or adulterants. All such industrially manufactured products are now only available under European regulations if their safety is assured through MHRA licensing or THR accreditation; and specific dangerous herbs have been banned under UK law. This has weakened the case for introduction of statutory regulation as a further safety measure. \" Then Walker identified correctly the training dilemma. Although it seems obvious, this is a big advance for a government document. Degrees that teach nonsense are not good training: they are miseducation. \"The third issue is the identification of educational standards for training practitioners and the benchmarking of standards for accrediting practitioners. With no good data on efficacy or safety, it is difficult for practitioners and patients to understand or quantify the potential benefits and risks of a proposed therapeutic intervention. Training programmes could accredit knowledge and skills in some areas including pharmacology and physiology, professional ethics and infection control but without a credible evidence base relating to the safety and effectiveness of herbal medicine it is hard to see how they could form the basis of accreditation in this field of practice. There are a number of educational university programmes offering courses in herbal medicine although the number has declined in recent years. Some of these courses are accredited by practitioner organisations which is a potential governance risk as the accreditation may be based on benchmarks established by tradition and custom rather than science. \" \"The herbal medicine sector is in a dilemma\" is Walker's conclusion. \"Some practitioners would like to continue to practise as they do now, with no further regulation, and accept that their practice is based on tradition and personal experience rather than empirical science. The logical consequence of adopting this form of practice is that we should take a precautionary approach in order to ensure public safety. The public should be protected through consumer legislation to prevent false claims, restricting the use of herbal products which are known to be hazardous to health\" The problem with this is, if course, is that although there is plenty of law, it's rarely enforced : see [Most alternative medicine is illegal](http://www.dcscience.net/2009/01/15/most-alternative-medicine-is-illegal/) Trading Standards very rarely enforce the [Consumer Protection Regulations (2008)](http://www.dcscience.net/2009/01/15/most-alternative-medicine-is-illegal/) but Walker is too diplomatic to mention that fact. \"The herbals sector must recognise that its overall approach (including the rationale for use of products and methods of treatment, education and training, and interaction with the NHS) needs to be more science and evidence based if in order to be established as a profession on the same basis as other groups that are statutorily regulated.\" So what happens next? In the short term nothing will happen. The main mistake has been avoided: there wil be no statutory regulation. The other options are (a) do nothing, or (b) go for accreditation of a voluntary register (AR) by the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA). Walker ends up recommending the latter, but only after a lot more work (see [pages 28-29 of report](/Report_on_Regulation_of_Herbal_Medicines_and_Practitioners)). Of particular interest is recommendation 5. \"As a first step it would be helpful for the sector organisations to develop an umbrella voluntary register that could support the development of standards and begin to collaborate on the collection of safety data and the establishment of an academic infrastructure to develop training and research. This voluntary register could in due course seek accreditation from the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA).\" So it looks as though nothing will happen for a long time, and herbalists and TCM may end up with the utterly ineffectual PSA. After all, the PSA have accredited voluntary registers of homeopaths, so clearly nothing is too delusional for them. It's very obvious that, unlike Walker, the PSA are quite happy to ignore the training dilemma. Omissions from the report Good though this report is, by Department of Health standards, it omits some important points. Endangered species and animal cruelty aren't mentioned in the report. Traditional Chinese medicine, and its variants, are responsible for the [near-extinction of rhinoceros, tiger](http://www.dcscience.net/pittilo-consultation-response.pdf) and other species because of the [superstitious belief](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/9525512/Rhinos-under-24-hour-armed-guard.html) that they have medicinal value. It's not uncommon to find [animal parts in Chinese medicines](http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/local-news/endangered-species-found-mixed-herbal-6006076) sold in the UK despite it being illegal And the unspeakably cruel practice of [farming bears to collect bile](#) is a direct consequence of TCM. A bile bear in a \"crush cage\" on Huizhou Farm, China (Wikipedia) Statutory regulation of Chiropractors The same arguments used in Walker's report to deny statutory regulation of herbalism, would undoubtedly lead to denial of statutory regulation of chiropractors. The General Chiropractic Council was established in 1994, and has a status that's the same as the General Medical Council. That was a bad mistake. The [GCC has not protected the public](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2014/01/conflicts-of-interests-gcc.html), in fact it has acted as an advertising agency for chiropractic quackery. Perhaps Prof. Walker should be asked to review the matter. Follow-up You can also read [minutes of the HMPWG](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/417774/Minutes_of_Working_Group.pdf) meetings ( [and here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/417778/Small_Group_Meeting_minutes.pdf)). But, as usual, all the interesting controversies have been sanitised. Edzard Ernst has also commented on this topic: [Once again: the regulation of nonsense will generate nonsense - the case of UK herbalists](http://edzardernst.com/2015/03/once-again-the-regulation-of-nonsense-will-generate-nonsense-the-case-of-uk-herbalists/). This article has appeared, in nearly identical form, [on the UK Conversation](https://theconversation.com/quacktitioner-royal-is-a-menace-to-the-constitution-and-public-health-16448) . You can leave comments there or here. A constitutional monarch is purely ceremonial and plays no part in politics. Well actually in the UK it isn't quite as simple as that. The first problem is that we have no constitution. Things haven't changed much since the 19th century when Walter Bagehot said \"the Sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy... three rights\u2014the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.\" These are not inconsiderable powers in a country which is meant to be run by elected representatives. But nobody knows how these powers are used: it is all done in secret. Well, almost all. Charles, Prince of Wales, has been unusually public in expressing his views. [He told a conference](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/7147870/Prince-of-Wales-I-was-accused-of-being-enemy-of-the-Enlightenment.html) at St James's Palace \"I was accused once of being the enemy of the Enlightenment\" \"I felt proud of that.\" That's a remarkable point of view for someone who, if he succeeds, will become the patron of that product of the age of enlightenment, the Royal Society. I have no doubt that Prince Charles means well. He can't be blamed for his lack of education. But his views on medicine date from a few centuries ago, and he has lost no opportunity to exploit his privileged position to proclaim them. Euphemisms for quackery He set up the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (PFIH) to promote his views. ( \"Integrated\", in this context, is, of course, just the latest euphemism for \"alternative\" or \"quack\".) When the Foundation collapsed because of a financial scandal in 2010, it was replaced by the \"College of Medicine\". The name changed, but [not the people](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632) behind it. Initially this phoenix was to be named the \" [College of Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263)\", but by this time the prince's views on medicine had become sufficiently discredited that the word \"integrated\" was quickly dropped. This might be thought less than frank, but it is just employment of the classic [bait and switch](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-bait-and-switch-of-unscientific-medicine/) technique, beloved by used car salesmen. His views were well publicised in a PFIH publication, \"Complementary Healthcare: a Guide for Patients\". That volume either omitted or misrepresented the evidence about the one question that matters most to patients - does the treatment work or not? It caused me to write a much shorter, but more accurate, version, the [Patients' Guide to Magic Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). The PFIH guide was arguably a danger to public health. When, very properly, it was criticised by Edzard Ernst, [a letter was sent](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/mar/11/health.monarchy) from from the prince's private secretary to Ernst's vice-chancellor, Steve Smith. Instead of defending Ernst's public spirited action, Smith [instituted disciplinary proceedings](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=89) against Ernst that lasted for a year. The prince had intervened directly in the affairs of the university. Steve Smith was rewarded with a knighthood in 2011. None of this criticism has dimmed the prince's enthusiasm for barmy medical ideas. He is well known to write many letters to government ministers to try to persuade them to adopt his ideas in a whole range of areas. In July 2013, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, visited the prince at Clarence House. The visit was reported to be to persuade the minister to defend homeopathy, though it was more likely to have been to press the case to confer a government stamp of [approval on herbalists](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117) and traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners by giving them statutory regulation. This is a matter that was recently raised again [in parliament](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#130709h0001.htm_spnew0) by Charles' greatest ally, [David Tredinnick MP](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6007) (Con, Bosworth) who got into trouble for charging astrology software to expenses. We shall never know what pressure was applied. A ruling of the Information Commissioner judged, reasonably enough, that there was public interest in knowing what influences were being brought to bear on public policy. But the Attorney General [overruled the judgement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/written-ministerial-statement-freedom-of-information-act-veto-of-release-of-prince-charles-letters) on the grounds that \"Disclosure of the correspondence could damage The Prince of Wales' ability to perform his duties when he becomes King.\" That, of course, is exactly what we are worried about. Influence on politics The prince's influence seems to be big in the Department of Health (DH). He was given \u00a337,000 of taxpayers' money to produce his guide, and an astonishing \u00a3900,000 to prepare the ground for the setting up of the hapless self-regulator, the [Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) (CNHC, also known as Ofquack). When NHS Choices (itself set up by DH to assess evidence) tried to rewrite its web page about that most discredited of all forms of quackery, homeopathy, officials in DH [referred the new advice to Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5778), the medical director of the Prince's Foundation and, were it not for the Freedom of Information act, the DH would have caused inaccurate information to be provided. The DH has a chief medical officer and two scientific advisors, but prefers to take the advice of the Prince of Wales. The Prince of Wales' business, Duchy Originals, [has been condemned](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-440103/Duchy-original-sins--Charles-range-spotlight.html) by the Daily Mail, (of all places) for selling unhealthy foods. And when his business branched into selling quack \"detox\" and herbal nonsense he found himself censured by both [the MHRA](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/03/duchy-originals-pork-pies.html) and the [Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2009/5/Duchy-Originals-Ltd/TF_ADJ_46199.aspx) (ASA) for making unjustifiable medical claims for these products. Ainsworth's homeopathic pharmacy is endorsed by both Prince Charles and the Queen: it has two Royal Warrants. They sell \"homeopathic vaccines\" for meningitis, measles, rubella and whooping cough. These \"vaccines\" contain nothing whatsoever so they are obviously a real danger to public health. Despite the fact that Ainsworth's had already been [censured by the ASA](http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/7/Ainsworths-(London)-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_148070.aspx) in 2011 for selling similar products, Ainsworth's continued to recommend them with a \" [casual disregard for the law](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/ainsworths-pharmacy.html)\". The regulator (the MHRA) failed to step in to stop them until it was eventually stirred into action by a young BBC reporter, Sam Smith, made a [programme for BBC South West](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZf9mUzI4RI&feature=c4-overview&list=UUei35H3nu7bduw-6DBJFGrQ). Then, at last, the somnolent regulator was stirred into action. The MHRA \"told Ainsworths to stop advertising a number of products\" (but apparently not to stop making them or selling them). They still sell Polonium metal 30C and Swine Meningitis 36C, and a booklet that recommends homeopathic \"vaccination\". Ainsworth's sales are no doubt helped by the Royal Warrants. The consequence is that people may die of meningitis. In 2011, the MHRA Chief Executive Professor Kent Woods, was knighted. It runs in the family The Prince of Wales is not the only member of the royal family to be obsessed with bizarre forms of medicine. The first homeopath to the British royal family, Frederick Quin, was a son of the Duchess of Devonshire (1765-1824). Queen Mary (1865-1953), wife of King George V, headed the fundraising efforts to move and expand the London Homeopathic Hospital. King George VI was so enthusiastic that in 1948 conferred the royal title on the London Homeopathic Hospital. The Queen Mother loved homeopathy too (there is no way to tell whether this contributed to her need for a colostomy in the 1960s). The present Queen's homeopathic physician is Peter Fisher, who is medical director of what, until recently was called the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH). In 2010 that hospital was rebranded as the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine (RLHIM) in another unsubtle bait and switch move. | | The RLHIM is a The patron of the RLHIM is the Queen, not the Prince of Wales. It is hard to imagine that this anachronistic institution would still exist if it were not for the influence, spoken or unspoken, of the Queen. Needless to say we will never be told. | | The Queen and Peter Fisher Observer 8 April 2007 The attorney general, while trying to justify the secrecy of Charles' letters, said \"It is a matter of the highest importance within our constitutional framework that the Monarch is a politically neutral figure\". Questions about health policy are undoubtedly political, and the highly partisan interventions of the prince in the political process make his behaviour unconstitutional. They endanger the monarchy itself. Whether that matters depends on how much you value tradition and how much you value the tourist business generated by the Gilbert & Sullivan flummery at which royals excel. The least that one can ask of the royal family is that they should not endanger the health of the nation. If I wanted to know the winner of the 2.30 at Ascot, I'd ask a royal. For any question concerning science or medicine I'd ask someone with more education. Here is some more interesting reading Michael Baum's \" [An open letter to the Prince of Wales](http://dcscience.net/?p=645#baum): with respect, your highness, you've got it wrong\" Gerald Weissman's essay [Homeopathy: Holmes, Hogwarts, and the Prince of Wales](http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/full/20/11/1755). Channel 4 TV documentary \"meddling in politics\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=89) [Observer April 2007](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/apr/08/hospitals. health) \"Royals' favoured hospital at risk as homeopathy backlash gathers pace. The Queen loves it. But alternative medicine centre's future looks uncertain as more NHS trusts axe funding\" Follow-up The Scottish Universities Medical Journal asked me to write about the regulation of alternative medicine. It's an interesting topic and not easy to follow because of the veritable maze of more than twenty overlapping regulators and quangos which fail utterly to protect the public against health fraud. In fact they mostly promote health fraud. The paper is [now published](http://sumj.dundee.ac.uk/data/uploads/epub-article/016-sumj.epub.pdf), and here is a version with embedded links (and some small updates). We are witnessing an increasing commercialisation of medicine. It's really taken off since the passage of the Health and Social Security Bill into law. Not only does that mean having NHS hospitals run by private companies, but it means that \"any qualified provider\" can bid for just about any service. The problem lies, of course, in what you consider \"qualified\" to mean. Any qualified homeopath or herbalist will, no doubt, be eligible. University College London Hospital advertised for a spiritual healer. The \"person specification\" specified a \"quallfication\", but only HR people think that a paper qualification means that spiritual healing is anything but a delusion. The vocabulary of bait and switch First, a bit of vocabulary. Alternative medicine is a term that is used for medical treatments that don't work (or at least haven't been shown to work). If they worked, they'd be called \"medicine\". The anti-malarial, artemesinin, came originally from a Chinese herb, but once it had been purified and properly tested, it was no longer alternative. But the word alternative is not favoured by quacks. They prefer their nostrums to be described as \"complementary\" -it sounds more respectable. So CAM (complementary and alternative medicine became the politically-correct euphemism. Now it has gone a stage further, and the euphemism in vogue with quacks at the moment is \"integrated\" or \"integrative\" medicine. That means, very often, integrating things that don't work with things that do. But it sounds fashionable. In reality it is designed to confuse politicians who ask for, say, integrated services for old people. Put another way, the salespeople of quackery have become rather good at bait and switch. The wikepedia definition is as good as any. Bait-and-switch is a form of fraud, most commonly used in retail sales but also applicable to other contexts. First, customers are \"baited\" by advertising for a product or service at a low price; second, the customers discover that the advertised good is not available and are \"switched\" to a costlier product. As applied to the alternative medicine industry, the bait is usually in the form of some nice touchy-feely stuff which barely mentions the mystical nonsense. But when you've bought into it you get the whole panoply of nonsense. Steven Novella has [written eloquently](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-bait-and-switch-of-unscientific-medicine/) about the use of bait and switch in the USA to sell chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy and herbal medicine: \"The bait is that CAM offers legitimate alternatives, the switch is that it primarily promotes treatments that don't work or are at best untested and highly implausible.\". The \"College of Medicine\" provides a near-perfect example of bait and switch. It is the direct successor of the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health. The Prince's Foundation was a consistent purveyor of dangerous medical myths. When it collapsed in 2010 because of a financial scandal, a company was formed called \"The College for Integrated Health\". [A slide show](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), not meant for public consumption, said \"The College represents a new strategy to take forward the vision of HRH Prince Charles\". But it seems that too many people have now tumbled to the idea that \"integrated\", in this context, means barmpottery. Within less than a month, the new institution was renamed \"The College of Medicine\". That might be a deceptive name, but it's a much better bait. That's why I described the College as a [fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632). Not only did the directors, all of them quacks, devise a respectable sounding name, but they also succeeded in recruiting some respectable-sounding people to act as figureheads for the new organisation. The president of the College is Professor Sir Graham Catto, emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Aberdeen. Names like his make the bait sound even more plausible. He claims not to believe that homeopathy works, but seems quite happy to have a homeopathic pharmacist, Christine Glover, on the [governing council of his college](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). At least half of the governing Council can safely be classified as quacks. So the bait is clear. What about the switch? The first thing to notice is that the whole outfit is skewed towards private medicine: see [ The College of Medicine is in the pocket of Crapita Capita](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295). The founder, and presumably the main provider of funds (they won't say how much) is the huge outsourcing company, Capita. This is company known in Private Eye as Crapita. Their inefficiency is legendary. They are the folks who messed up the NHS computer system and the courts computer system. After swallowing large amounts of taxpayers' money, they failed to deliver anything that worked. Their latest failure is the [court translation service](http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/mar/02/interpreters-courts-protest-privatised-contract).. The president (Catto), the vice president (Harry Brunjes) and the CEO (Mark Ratnarajah) are all employees of Capita. The second thing to notice is that their conferences and courses are a bizarre mixture of real medicine and pure quackery. Their 2012 conference had some very good speakers, but then it had [ a \"herbal workshop\" with Simon Mills](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5360) (see a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=lGhp0PNHVnc)) and David Peters (the man who tolerates [dowsing as a way to diagnose](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541) which herb to give you). The other speaker was Dick Middleton, who represents the huge herbal company, Schwabe (I debated with him [on BBC Breakfast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3RZ6K0Ng0c&feature=player_embedded)), In fact the College's [Faculty of Self-care](/COM-Self-care.pdf) appears to resemble a marketing device for Schwabe. Why regulation isn't working, and can't work There are various levels of regulation. The \"highest\" level is the statutory regulation of osteopathy and chiropractic. The General Chiropractic Council (GCC) has exactly the same legal status as the General Medical Council (GMC). This ludicrous state of affairs arose because nobody in John Major's government had enough scientific knowledge to realise that chiropractic, and some parts of osteopathy, are pure quackery, The problem is that organisations like the GCC function more to promote chiropractic than to regulate them. This became very obvious when the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) decided to sue Simon Singh for defamation, after he described some of their treatments as [\"bogus\", \"without a jot of evidence\"](http://jackofkent.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/good-day-in-court.html). In order to support Singh, several bloggers assessed the \"plethora of evidence\" which the BCA said could be used to justify their claims. When, 15 months later, the BCA produced its \"plethora\" it was shown within 24 hours that the evidence was pathetic. The demolition was summarised by lawyer, David Allen Green, in [The BCA's Worst Day](http://jackofkent.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/bcas-worst-day-yet.html). In the wake of this, over 600 complaints were made to the GCC about unjustified claims made by chiropractors, thanks in large part to heroic work by two people, [Simon Perry](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/500-chiropractors-reported-to-trading.html) and [Allan Henness](http://www.zenosblog.com/2009/06/omnibus-complaint-to-the-general-chiropractic-council/). Simon Perry's [Fishbarrel](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/fishbarrel-easy-way-to-report.html) (browser plugin) allows complaints to be made quickly and easily -try it). The majority of these complaints were rejected by the GCC, apparently on the grounds that chiropractors could not be blamed because the false claims had been endorsed by the GCC itself. My own complaint was based on phone calls to two chiropractors, [I was told](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1542) such nonsense as \"colic is down to, er um, faulty movement patterns in the spine\". But my complaint never reached the Conduct and Competence committee because it had been judged by a preliminary investigating committee that there was no case to answer. The impression one got from this (very costly) exercise was that the GCC was there to protect chiropractors, not to protect the public. The outcome was a disaster for chiropractors, wno emerged totally discredited. It was also a disaster for the GCC which was forced to admit that it hadn't properly advised chiropractors about what they could and couldn't claim. The recantation culminated in the [GCC declaring, in August 2010](http://www.gcc-uk.org/files/link_file/Guidance_on_claims_made_for_the_chiropractic_VSC_18August10.pdf), that the mythical \"subluxation\" is a \"historical concept \" \"It is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease.\". Subluxation was a product of the fevered imagination of the founder of the chiropractic cult, D.D. Palmer. It referred to an imaginary spinal lesion that he claimed to be the cause of most diseases. .Since 'subluxation' is the only thing that's distinguished chiropractic from any other sort of manipulation, the admission by the GCC that it does not exist, after a century of pretending that it does, is quite an admission. The President of the BCA himself [admitted in November 2011](http://chiropracticreport.com/portal/images/back_issues/No_%206%20-%20Nov%202011.pdf) \"The BCA sued Simon Singh personally for libel. In doing so, the BCA began one of the darkest periods in its history; one that was ultimately to cost it financially,\" As a result of all this, the deficiencies of chiropractic, and the deficiencies of its regulator were revealed, and advertisements for chiropractic are somewhat less misleading. But this change for the better was brought about entirely by the unpaid efforts of bloggers and a few journalists, and not at all by the official regulator, the GCC. which was part of the problem. not the solution. And it was certainly not helped by the organisation that is meant to regulate the GCC, the Council for Health Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) which did nothing whatsoever to stop the farce. At the other end of the regulatory spectrum, voluntary self-regulation, is an even worse farce than the GCC. They all have grand sounding \"Codes of Practice\" which, in practice, the ignore totally. The Society of Homeopaths is just a joke. When homeopaths were caught out recommending [sugar pills for prevention of malaria](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2855), they did nothing (arguably such homicidal advice deserves a [jail sentence](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1661)). The Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) is widely know in the blogosphere as Ofquack. I know about them from the inside, having [been a member of](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) their Conduct and Competence Committee, It was set up with the help of a \u00a3900,000 grant from the Department of Health to the Prince of Wales, to oversee voluntary self-regulation. It fails utterly to do anything useful.. The CNHC code of practice, paragraph 15 , states \"Any advertising you undertake in relation to your professional activities must be accurate. Advertisements must not be misleading, false, unfair or exaggerated\". When [Simon Perry made a complaint](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/cnhc-wishes-to-place-on-formal-record_27.html) to the CNHC about claims being made by a CNHC-registered reflexologist, the Investigating Committee upheld all 15 complaints. But it then went on to say that there was no case to answer because the unjustified claims were what the person had been taught, and were made in good faith. This is precisely the ludicrous situation which will occur again and again if reflexologists (and many other alternative therapies) are \"accredited\". The CNHC said, correctly, that the reflexologist had been taught things that were not true, but then did nothing whatsoever about it apart from toning down the advertisements a bit. They still register reflexologists who make outrageously false claims. Once again we see that no sensible regulation is possible for subjects that are pure make-believe. The first two examples deal (or rather, fail to deal) with regulation of outright quackery. But there are dozens of other quangos that sound a lot more respectable. European Food Standards Agency (EFSA). One of the common scams is to have have your favourite quack treatment classified as a food not as a medicine. The laws about what you can claim have been a lot laxer for foods. But the EFSA has done a pretty good job in stopping unjustified claims for health benefits from foods. Dozens of claims made by makers of probiotics have been banned. The food industry, needless to say, objects very strongly to be being forced to tell the truth. In my view, the ESFA has not gone far enough. They recently [issued a directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:136:FULL:EN:PDF) about claims that could legally be made. Some of these betray the previously high standards of the EFSA. For example you are allowed to say that \"Vitamin C contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue\" (as long as the product contains above a specified amount of Vitamin C. I'm not aware of any trials that show vitamin C has the slightest effect on tiredness or fatigue, Although these laws do not come into effect until December 2012, they have already been [invoked by the ASA](http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2012/6/Natures-Best-Health-Products-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_179089.aspx) has a reason not to uphold a complaint about a multivitamin pill which claimed that it \"Includes 8 nutrients that can contribute to the reduction in tiredness and fatigue\" The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). This is almost the only organisation that has done a good job on false health claims. Their [Guidance on Health Therapies & Evidence](http://www.asa.org.uk/Resource-Centre/Hot-Topics/~/media/Files/ASA/Misc/Guidance%20on%20Health%20Therapies%20and%20Evidence%20QA%20%28Sept%202011%29.ashx) says \"Whether you use the words 'treatment', 'treat' or 'cure', all are likely to be seen by members of the public as claims to alleviate effectively a condition or symptom.

Sadly, though, the ASA has no powers to enforce its decisions and [only too often they are ignored](http://www.asa.org.uk/~/media/Files/ASA/Misc/3rd%20Letter%20to%20Homeopathy%20Adv%203.ashx). The [Nightingale collaboration](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/) has produced an [excellent letter](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/images/stories/POS_advertising_of_homeopathic_products.pdf) that you can hand to any pharmacist who breaks the rules The ASA has also [judged against claims](http://nightingale-collaboration.org/news/111-working-within-the-qcranial-paradigmq.html) made by \"Craniosacral therapists\" (that's the lunatic fringe of osteopathy). They will presumably uphold complaints about [similar claims](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4213) made (I'm ashamed to say) by UCLH Hospitals. The private examination company Edexcel sets [exams in antiscientific subjects](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454), so miseducating children. The teaching of quackery to 16 year-olds has been approved by a maze of quangos, none of which will take responsibility, or justify their actions. So far [ I've located no fewer than eight](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454) of them. The Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator (OfQual), Edexcel, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), Skills for Health, Skills for Care, National Occupational Standards (NOS), private exam company VTCT and the schools inspectorate, Ofsted.. Asking any of these people why they approve of examinations in imaginary subjects meets with blank incomprehension. They fail totally to protect tha public from utter nonsense. The Department of Education has failed to do anything about the miseducation of children in quackery. In fact it has encouraged it by, for the first time, giving taxpayers' money to a Steiner (Waldorf) school (at Frome, in Somerset). Steiner schools are run by a secretive and cult-like body of people ( [read about it](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Steiner+Waldorf)). They teach about reincarnation, karma, gnomes, and all manner of nonsense, sometimes with unpleasant racial overtones. The [teachers are trained ](http://www.james-gray.org/heavenly-beings-and-astral-forces/)in Steiner's Anthroposophy, so if your child gets ill at school they'll probably get homeopathic sugar pills. They might well get measles or mumps too, since Steiner people don't believe in vaccination. Incredibly, the University of Aberdeen came perilously close to appointing a [chair in anthroposophical medicine.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5261) This disaster was aborted [by bloggers](http://www.james-gray.org/heavenly-beings-and-astral-forces/), and a last minute intervention [from journalists](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5261). Neither the university's regulatory mechanisms. nor any others, seemed to realise that a chair in [mystical barmpottery](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3528) was a bad idea. Trading Standards offices and the Office of Fair Trading. It is the statutory duty of Trading Standards to enforce the Consumer Protection Regulations (2008) This European legislation is pretty good. it caused a lawyer to write \" [Has The UK Quietly Outlawed \"Alternative\" Medicine?\". ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790) Unfortunately Trading Standards people have consistently refused to enforce these laws. The whole organisation is a mess. Its local office arrangement fails totally to deal with the age of the internet. The situation is so bad that a group of us decided to put them to the test. The results were published in the Medico-Legal Journal, Rose et al., 2012. [\"Spurious Claims for Health-care Products](http://www.dcscience.net/Rose-medico-legal-2012.pdf): An Experimental Approach to Evaluating Current UK Legislation and its Implementation\". They concluded \"EU directive 2005/29/EC is largely ineffective in preventing misleading health claims for consumer products in the UK\" Skills for Health is an enormous quango which produces HR style \"competences\" for everything under the son. They are mostly quite useless. But those concerned with alternative medicine are not just useless. [They are positively harmful.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=215'#sfh) Totally barmy. There are competences and National Occupational Standards for every lunatic made-up therapy under the sun. When I phoned them to discover who'd written them, I learned that the had been drafted by the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Magic Medicine. And when I joked by asking if they had a competence for talking to trees, I was told, perfectly seriously, \"You'd have to talk to LANTRA, the land-based organisation for that.\" That was in January 2008. A lot of correspondence with the head of Skills for Health got nowhere at all. She understood nothing and it hasn't improved a jot. This organisation costs a lot of taxpayers' money and it should have been consigned to the \"bonfire of the quangos\" (but of course there was no such bonfire in reality). It is a disgrace. The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) is supposed to ensure the quality of university courses. In fact it endorses courses in nonsense alternative medicine and so does more harm than good. The worst recent failure of the QAA was in the case of the University of Wales: see [Scandal of the University of Wales and the Quality Assurance Agency](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675). The university was making money by validating thousands of external degrees in everything from fundamentalist theology to Chinese Medicine. These validations were revealed as [utterly incompetent](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) by bloggers, and later by BBC Wales journalist Ciaran Jenkins (now working for Channel 4). The mainstream media eventually caught up with bloggers. In 2010, BBC1 TV (Wales) produced an excellent TV programme that [exposed the enormous degree validation scam](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675) run by the University of Wales. The programme can be seen on YouTube ( [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ix4HTi9LWE), and [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG2kBeDer-0)). The programme also exposed, incidentally, the uselessness of the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) which did nothing until the scam was exposed by TV and blogs. Eventually the QAA sent nine people to Malaysia to investigate a dodgy college that had been revealed by the BBC. The trip cost \u00a391,000. It could have been done for nothing if anyone at the QAA knew how to use Google. The outcome was that the University of Wales stopped endorsing external courses, and it was soon shut down altogether (though bafflingly, its vice-chancellor, Marc Clement was promoted). The credit for this lies entirely with bloggers and the BBC. The QAA did nothing to help until the very last moment. Throughout this saga Universities UK (UUK), has maintained its usual total passivity. They have [done nothing whatsoever](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=42) about their members who give BSc degrees in anti-scientific subjects. (UUK used to known as the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals). Council for Health Regulatory Excellence (CHRE), soon to become the PSAHSC, Back now to the CHRE, the people who failed so signally to sort out the GCC. They are being reorganised. Their [consultation document](http://www.chre.org.uk/_img/pics/library/120416_-_standards_for_consultation_-_PDF.pdf) says \"The Health and Social Care Act 20122 confers a new function on the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (the renamed Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence). From November 2012 we will set standards for organisations that hold voluntary registers for people working in health and social care occupations and we will accredit the register if they meet those standards. It will then be known as an 'Accredited Register'. \" They are trying to decide what the criteria should be for \"accreditation\" of a regulatory body. The [list of those interested](http://www.chre.org.uk/voluntaryregisters/421/) has some perfectly respectable organisations, like the [British Psychological Society](http://www.bps.org.uk/). It also contains a large number of crackpot organisations, like [Crystal and Healing International, as well as joke regulators like the CNHC](http://crystalandhealinginternational.co.uk). They already oversee the Health Professions Council (HPC) which is [due to take over Herbal medicine ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117)and Traditional Chinese Medicine, with predictably disastrous consequences. Two of the proposed criteria for \"accreditation\" appear to be directly contradictory. Para 2.5 makes the whole accreditation pointless from the point of view of patients 2.5 It will not be an endorsement of the therapeutic validity or effectiveness of any particular discipline or treatment. Since the only thing that matters to the patient is whether the therapy works (and is safe), accrediting of organisations that ignore this will merely give the appearance of official approval of crystal healing etc etc. This appears to contradict directly A.7 The organisation can demonstrate that there either is a sound knowledge base underpinning the profession or it is developing one and makes that explicit to the public. A \"sound knowledge base\", if it is to mean anything useful at all, means knowledge that the treatment is effective. If it doesn't mean that, what does it mean? It seems that the official mind has still not grasped the obvious fact that there can be no sensible regulation of subjects that are untrue nonsense. If it is nonsense, the only form of regulation that makes any sense is the law. Please fill in the consultation. My completed return [can be downloaded](CHRE-consultation.docx) as an example, if you wish. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) should be a top level defender of truth. Its strapline is \"We enhance and safeguard the health of the public by ensuring that medicines and medical devices work and are acceptably safe.\" The MHRA did something (they won't tell me exactly what) about one of the [most cruel scams that I've ever encountered, Esperanza Homeopathic Neuropeptide](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/05/29/the-esperanza-scandal-office-of-trading-standards-useless-mhra-a-bit-better/), peddled for multiple sclerosis, at an outrageous price ( \u00a36,759 for 12 month's supply). Needless to say there was not a jot of evidence that it worked (and it wasn't actually homeopathic). Astoundingly, Trading Standards officers refused to do anything about it. The MHRA admit (when pushed really hard) that there is precious little evidence that any of the herbs work, and that homeopathy is nothing more than sugar pills. Their answer to that is to forget that bit about \"ensuring that medicines ... work\" Here's the MHRA's [Traditional Herbal Registration Certificate](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con134892.pdf) for devils claw tablets. The wording \"based on traditional use only\" has to be included because of European legislation. Shockingly, the MHRA have allowed them to relegate that to small print, with all the emphasis on the alleged indications. The pro-CAM agency NCCAM rates devil's claw as \"possibly effective\" or \"insufficient evidence\" for all these indications, but that doesn't matter because the MHRA requires no evidence whatsoever that the tablets do anything. They should, of course, added a statement to this effect to the label. They have failed in their duty to protect and inform the public by allowing this labelling. But it gets worse. Here is the MHRA's [homeopathic marketing authorisation for the homeopathic medicinal product Arnicare Arnica 30c pillules](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con049307.pdf) It is nothing short of surreal. | || | Since the pills contain nothing at all, they don't have the slightest effect on sprains, muscular aches or bruising. The wording on the label is exceedingly misleading. If you \"pregnant or breastfeeding\" there is no need to waste you doctor's time before swallowing a few sugar pills. \"Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one\". Since the pills contain nothing, it doesn't matter a damn. \"If you overdose . . \" it won't have the slightest effect because there is nothing in them And it gets worse. The MHRA-approved label specifies ACTIVE INGREDIENT. Each pillule contains 30c Arnica Montana No, they contain no arnica whatsoever. | || | It truly boggles the mind that men with dark suits and lots of letters after their names have sat for hours only to produce dishonest and misleading labels like these. When [this mislabeling](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=28) was first allowed, it was condemned by [just about every scientific society](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=30), but the MHRA did nothing. The Nightingale Collaboration. This is an excellent organisation, set up by two very smart skeptics, Alan Henness and Maria MacLachlan. [Visit their site](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/) regularly, sign up for their newsletter Help with their campaigns. Make a difference. Conclusions The regulation of alternative medicine in the UK is a farce. It is utterly ineffective in preventing deception of patients. Such improvements as have occurred have resulted from the activity of bloggers, and sometime the mainstream media. All the official regulators have, to varying extents, made things worse. The CHRE proposals promise to make matters still worse by offering \"accreditation\" to organisations that promote nonsensical quackery. None of the official regulators seem to be able to grasp the obvious fact that is impossible to have any sensible regulation of people who promote nonsensical untruths. One gets the impression that politicians are more concerned to protect the homeopathic (etc, etc) industry than they are to protect patients. Deception by advocates of alternative medicine harms patients. There are adequate laws that make such deception illegal, but they are not being enforced. The CHRE and its successor should restrict themselves to real medicine. The money that they spend on pseudo-regulation of quacks should be transferred to the MHRA or a reformed Trading Standards organisation so they can afford to investigate and prosecute breaches of the law. That is the only form of regulation that makes sense. Follow-up The shocking case of the continuing sale of \"homeopathic vaccines\" for meningitis, rubella, pertussis etc was highlighted in an [excellent TV programme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZf9mUzI4RI) by BBC South West. The failure of the MHRA and the GPC do take any effective action is a yet another illustration of the failure of regulators to do their job. I have to agree with Andy Lewis when [he concludes](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2013/01/why-does-the-mhra-not-close-down-these-homeopaths.html) \"Children will die. And the fault must lie with Professor Sir Kent Woods, chairman of the regulator.\" Although many university [courses in quackery have now closed](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4900), two subjects that hang on in a few places are western herbalism, and traditional Chinese medicine (including acupuncture). The University of Westminster still runs [Chinese medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4683), and [Western herbal medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4361) (with [dowsing](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541)). So do the [University of Middlesex](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923) and University of East London. Since the passing of the Health and Social Security Act, these people have been busy with their customary bait and switch tactics, trying to get taxpayers' money. It's worth looking again at the nonsense these people talk. Take for example, the well known herbalist, [Simon Mills](http://www.plant-medicine.com/cvs/SYMcv.htm). At one time he was associated with the University of Exeter, but no longer. Perhaps his views are too weird even for their [Third Gap](http://www.pcmd.ac.uk/research/index.php?page=1&group=17) section (the folks who so [ misrepresented their results](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4439) in a trial of acupuncture). Unsurprisingly, he was involved in the late Prince's Foundation for Magic Medicine, and, unsurprisingly, he is involved with its successor, the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/search/node/Simon%20Mills)\", where [he spoke](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/human-experiences-herbal-medicines) along similar lines. You can get a good idea about his views from [the video of a talk](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437) that he gave at Schumacher College in 2005. It's rather long, and exceedingly uncritical, so here's a shorter version to which some helpful captions have been added. That talk is weird by any standards. He says, apparently with a straight face, that \"all modern medicines are cold in the third degree\"..And with ginger and cinnamon \"You can stop a cold, generally speaking, in its tracks\" (at 21 30\" in the video). This is simply not true, but he says it, despite the fact that the [Plant Medicine](http://www.plant-medicine.com/) with site (of which he's a director) which he is associated [gives them low ratings](http://www.plant-medicine.com/freepages/find-herbs.asp?symptom2=cold,%20common) Simon Mills is also a director of [SustainCare](http://www.sustaincare.net/company.htm). Their web site says SustainCare Community Interest Company is a social enterprise set up to return health care to its owners: \"learning to look after ourselves and our families in ways that make sense and do not cost the earth\". It is founded on the principle that one's health is a personal story, and that illness is best managed when we make our health care our own. The enterprise brings clinical expertise, long experience of academia, education and business, and the connections and resources to deliver new approaches. \"As its own social enterprise contribution to this project Sustaincare set up and supported Caf\u00e9 Sustain as a demonstration Intelligent Waiting Room at Culm Valley Integrated Centre for Health in Devon\". (yes, that's Michael Dixon, again] In the talk (see video) Mills appears to want to take medicine back to how it was 1900 years ago, in the time of Galen. The oblique speaking style is fascinating. He never quite admits that he thinks all that nonsense is true, but presumably it is how he treats patients. Yet a person with these bizarre pre-scientific ideas is thought appropriate to advise the MHRA It's characteristic of herbalists that they have a very long list of conditions for which each herb is said to be good. The sort of things said by Mills differ little from the 1900-year old ideas of Galen, io the 17th century ideas of Culpepper. You can see some of the latter in my oldest book, Blagrave's supplement to Culpepper's famous herbal, published in 1674. See what he has to say about daffodils It is \"under the dominion of Mars, and the roots hereof are hot and dry almost in the third degree\". \"The root, boyled in [posset drink], and drunk, causeth vomiting, and is used with good successe in the beginning of [Agues], especially [Tertians], which frequently rage in the spring-time: a plaister made of the roots with parched Barley meal, and applied to swellings and [imposthumes]do dissolve them; the juice mingled with hony, frankincense, wine and myrrhe, and dropped into the Eares, is good against the corrupt filth and running matter of the Eares; the roots made hollow and boyled in oyl doth help [Kib'd heels [or] [here] the root is good for [Morphew], and discolourings of the skin.\" It seems that daffodils would do a lot in 1674. Even herbalists don't seem to use it much now. A recent [herbal site describes](http://medicineherbs.net/medicinal-herbs/daffodil) daffodil as \"poisonous\". But the descriptions are very like those used by present day herbalists, as you can hear in Simon Mills' talk. Chinese medicine is even less tested than western herbs. Not a single Chinese herb has been shown to be useful for treating anything (though in a very few case, they have been found to contain drugs that are useful when purified, notably the anti-malarial compound, artemesinin). They are often contaminated, some are dangerously toxic. And they [contribute to the extinction of tigers and rhinoceros](http://www.dcscience.net/pittilo-consultation-response.pdf) because of the silly myths that these make useful medicines. The cruelty of bear bile farming is legendary. In a recent [report in China Daily](http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&q=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-06/08/content_15489946.htm&ct=ga&cad=CAcQAhgAIAAoATABOAFAjtvJ_gRIAVAAWABiAmVu&cd=ZA4JQyP9VeE&usg=AFQjCNEfqSqaUnGuh7mjZkKTM_uFXyDz1w) (my emphasis). In a congratulation letter, Vice-Premier Li Keqiang called for integration of TCM and Western medicine. TCM, as a time-honored treasure of Chinese civilization, has contributed to the prosperity of China and brought impacts to world civilization, Li said. He also urged medical workers to combine the merits of TCM with contemporary medicine to better facilitate the ongoing healthcare reform in China. The trade in Chinese medicines survives only for two reasons. One is that thay are a useful tool for promoting Chinese nationalism. The other is that they are big business. Both are evident in the vice-premier's statement. I presume that it's the business bit that is the reason why London South Bank University (ranked 114 ou ot 114) that led to one of their main lecture theatres being decorated with pictures like this.\"Mr Li Changchun awarding 2010 Confucius Institute of the year to LSBU Vice Chancellor\" . I'll bet Mr Li Changchun uses real medicine himself, as most Chinese who can afford it do. Presumably, what's taught in their Confucius Institute is the same sort of [dangerous make-believe nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043).that's taught on other such courses. The \"College of Medicine\" run a classical bait and switch operation. Their \" [First Thursday lectures](http://members.collegeofmedicine.eu/courses)\" have several good respectable speakers, but then they have Andrew Flower, He is \"a former president of the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, a medical herbalist and acupuncturist. He has recently completed a PhD exploring the role of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of endometriosis\". He's associated with the [Avicenna Centre for Chinese Medicine](http://www.avicenna.co.uk/practitioners/andrew-flower/), and with the [University of Southampton's quack division](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/details.php?id=4) The only bit of research I could find by Andrew Flower was a Cochrane review, [Chinese herbal medicine for endometriosis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006568.pub3/abstract). The main results tell us \"Two Chinese RCTs involving 158 women were included in this review. Both these trials described adequate methodology. Neither trial compared CHM with placebo treatment.\" But the plain language summary says \"This review suggests that Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) may be useful in relieving endometriosis-related pain with fewer side effects than experienced with conventional treatment.\" It sounds to me as though people as partisan as the authors of this should not be allowed to write Cochrane reviews. Flower's talk is followed by one from the notorious representative of the herbal industry, [ Michael McIntyre](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269#follow), talking on [Herbal medicine: A major resource for the 21st century](http://members.collegeofmedicine.eu/courses/firstthursdayherbal?dm_i=PC7,U1NI,3PB5TI,2GPNL,1). That's likely to be about as objective as if they'd invited a GSK drug rep to talk about SSRIs. The people at Kings College London Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences are most certainly not quacks. They have made a database of chemicals found in traditional Chinese medicine. It's sold by a US company, [Chem-TCM](http://www.chemtcm.com/) and it's very expensive (Commercial license: $3,740.00. Academic/government license: $1,850.00). Not much open access there. It's a good idea to look at chemicals of plant origin, but only as long as you don't get sucked into the myths. It's only too easy to fall for the bait and switch of quacks (like TCM salespeople). The sample page shows good chemical and botanical information, and predicted (not observed) pharmacological activity. More bizarrely, it shows also analysis of the actions claimed by TCM people. It does seem odd to me to apply sophisticated classification methods to things that are mostly myth. The multiple uses claimed for Chinese medicines are very like the make-believe claims made for western herbs by Galen, Culpepper and (with much less excuse) by Mills. They are almost all untrue, but their proponents are good salesmen. Don't let them get a foot in your door. Follow-up 10 June 2012. No sooner did this post go public when I can across what must be one of the worst herbal scams ever: \" [Arthroplex](http://josephinejones.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/arthroplex-instant-relief-for-the-wallet/)\" 31 July 2012. Coffee is the subject of another entry in the 1674 edition of Blagrave. Blagrave evidently had a lower regard for coffee than I have. \"But being pounded and baked, as do it to make the Coffee-liquor with, it then stinks most loathsomly, which is an argument of some Saturnine quality in it.\" \"But there is no mention of an medicinal use thereof, by any Author either Antient of Modern\" Blagrave says also \"But this I of UCL's History department \"that the bodies of the English that indulge in this liquor to such an extent seem to degenerate into the nature of barbarians\" My boss, Lucia Sivolotti got something very like that herself. Be very impressed. Salway suggested that clearer Latin would have been \"quod on to Blagrave, but I can't find his email address. I much prefer Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi's aphorism (often misattributed to Paul Erd\u00f6s) \"A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems\" Since writing about anti-scientific degrees in [Nature (March 2007)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19), much has been revealed about the nonsense that is taught on these degrees. New Year's day seems like a good time to assess how far we've got, five years on. At the beginning of 2007 [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/) (the universities central admission service) offered 45 different BSc degrees in quackery, at 16 universities. Now there are only 24 such degrees. If you exclude chiropractic and osteopathy, which all run at private colleges, with some sort of \"validation\" from a university, there are now only 18 BSc/MSc courses being offered in eight universities. Degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy and \"nutritional therapy\", reflexology and aromatherapy have vanished altogether from UCAS. In the race to provide BScs in anti-science, Middlesex University has now overhauled the long-standing leader, Westminster, by a short head. | | Michael Driscoll, vice-chancellor of Middlesex | | Let's see what's gone. The University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN) was the first to see sense. In August 2008 they [announced closure of their \"BSc\" degree in homeopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=249). On September 2008 they announced [ an internal review ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=252)of their courses in homeopathy. herbalism and acupuncture. The report of this review [closed down all of them in July 2009.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) I first asked for their teaching materials in July 2006. I finally got them in December 2010, after winning an appeal to [the Information Commissioner](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1364), and then winning an appeal against that decision at an [ Information tribunal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) . By the time I got them, the course had been closed for over two years. That is just as well, because it turned out that UCLAN's students were [being taught dangerous nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2628). No wonder they tried so hard to conceal it. Salford University was the next to go. They [shut down their courses](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) in complementary medicine, homeopathy and acupuncture. In January 2009 they announced \" they are no longer considered \"a sound academic fit\" \". Shortly afterwards. a [letter appeared in The Times](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984) from three heavyweights (plus me) congratulating the vice-chancellor on his decision. University of Westminster For many years, Westminster was the biggest supplier of BSc degrees in quackery. At the beginning of 2007 they offered 14 different BSc degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy, nutritional therapy, \"complementary therapies\", (western) herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine with acupuncture. Some of their courses were so bizarre that some of the students and even staff sent me slides which taught things like \"amethysts emit high Yin energy\". Like UCLAN, Westminster also [held an internal review](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984). Unlike UCLAN it came to the absurd conclusion that all would be well if they injected more science into the courses. The incompetence of the review meant that those who wrote it hadn't noticed that if you try to put science into homeopathy or naturopathy, the whole subject vanishes in a puff of smoke. Nevertheless Westminster closed down entry to BSc homeopathy in March 2009 (though the subject remained as part of other courses). Three years after the [Nature article](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19), all five BSc homeopathy degrees had shut their doors. During 2011, Westminster shut down Naturopathy, Nutritional therapy, Therapeutic bodywork and Complementary Medicine. See, for example, [More dangerous nonsense from the University of Westminster: when will Professor Geoffrey Petts do something about it?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4361) [Professor Geoffrey Petts of the University of Westminster says they \"are not teaching pseudo-science\". The facts show this is not true](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4683) [University of Westminster shuts down naturopathy, nutritional therapy, but keeps Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4704) Now Westminster has only four courses in two subjects. They still teach some dangerous and untrue things, but I suspect the writing is on the wall for these too. I have seen a document, dated 11 April 2011, which states \"The following courses have been identified as 'at risk' (School definition) and will be discussed at the APRG and University Review Group2, due to poor recruitment and high cost of delivery: Integrated Health Scheme: BSc BSc Herbal Medicine\" All but Chinese medicine and Herbal medicine have already gone. Almost there. University of Wales Since my first [post in 2008](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) about the validation scam operated by the University of Wales, and some good investigations by BBC Wales TV, the outcome was the most spectacular so far. The entire [institution collapsed](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education-news/2011/12/29/can-education-heed-the-lessons-of-2011-91466-30025844/).

[Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) (October 2008) This is a 'degree' in nutrtional therapy. It is even more hilarious than usual, but it passed the validation anyway. [Scandal of the University of Wales and the Quality Assurance Agency](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675) (November 2010). This post followed the BBC Wales TV programme. At last the QAA began to notice, yet further confirmation of its utter ineptitude. [The University of Wales disgraced (but its vice chancellor is promoted)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766) (October, 2011) The eventual collapse of the university was well-deserved. But it is very weird that the people who were responsible for it have still got their jobs. In fact the vice-chancellor, Marc Clement, was promoted despite his mendacious claim to be unaware of what was going on. It remains to be seen how many of the many quack courses that were validated by the University of Wales will be taken on by other universities. The McTimoney College of Chiropractic is owned by BPP University (so much for their quality control, as [explained in Private Eye](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4422)). but still claims to be validated by Wales until 2017. Some of the more minor players Edinburgh Napier University. After an FOI request (rejected), Napier closed their herbal medicine degree in 2010. [Hot and cold herbal nonsense from Napier University Edinburgh: another course shuts.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3200) (June 2010) As expected, the Scottish Information Commissioner agreed with that for England and Wales and ordered material to be sent.

Chiropractic Surprisingly, given the total discreditation of chiropractic in the wake of the Simon Singh affair, and the internecine warfare that followed it, none of the chiropractic courses have shut yet. Some are clearly in trouble, so watch this space. Osteopathy has also had no course closures since 2007. Like chiropractic it also suffers from internecine warfare. The General Osteopathic Council refuses to disown the utter nonsense of \"craniosacral\" osteopathy. But the more sensible practitioners do so and are roughly as effective as physiotherapists (though [there are real doubts](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) about how effective that is). Excluding chiropractic and osteopathy, this is all that's left. It now consists almost entirely of Chinese medicine and a bit of herbal.

Manchester Metropolitan gets the booby prize for actually starting a new course, just as all around are closing theirs. Dr Peter Banister, who was on the committee that approved the course (but now retired), has told me \" I am sceptical in the current economic climate whether it will prove to be successful\". Let's hope he's right. But well done Westminster. Your position as the leader in antiscientific degrees has now been claimed by Middlesex University. Their \"degrees\" [ in Ayurveda](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/search/index.aspx?q=ayurveda) mark out Middlesex University as the new King of Woo. Over to you, Professor Driscoll. As vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, the buck stops with you. Both still teach Chinese and herbal medicine, which are potentially dangerous. There is not a single product from either that has marketing authorisation from the MHRA, though the MHRA has betrayed its trust by allowing misleading labelling of herbal medicines without requiring any evidence whatsoever that they work, see, for example [Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) [More quackedemia. Dangerous Chinese medicine taught at Middlesex University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923) [Why does the MHRA refuse to label herbal products honestly? Kent Woods and Richard Woodfield tell me](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269) Sub-degree courses In contrast to the large reduction in the number of BSc and MSc degrees, there has actually been an increase in two year foundation degrees and HND courses in complementary medicine, at places right near the [ bottom of the academic heap](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?v=wide). The subject is sinking to the bottom. With luck it will vanish entirely from universities before too long. Research-intensive Universities Although all of the degrees in magic medicine are from post-1992 universities, the subject has crept into more prestigious universities. Of these, the [University of Southampton](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) is perhaps the worst, because of the presence of [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956), and his defender, Stephen Holgate. Others have staunch defenders of quackery, including the University of Warwick, University of [Edinburgh](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming) and [St Batholomew's](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555). Why have all these courses closed? One reason is certainly the embarrassment caused by exposure of what's taught on the courses. Professors Petts (Westminster) and Driscoll (Middlesex) must be aware that googling their names produces references to this and other skeptical blogs on the front page. Thanks to some plain brown emails, and, after a three year battle, the Freedom of Information Act, it has been possible to show here the nonsense that has been foisted on students by some universities. Not only is this a burden on the taxpayer, but, more importantly, some of it is a danger to patients. When a course closes, it is often said that it is because of falling student numbers (though UCLAN and Salford did not use that excuse). Insofar as that is true, the credit must go to the whole of the skeptical movement that has grown so remarkably in the last few years. Ben Goldacre's \"ragged band of bloggers\" have produced a real change in universities and in society as a whole. The people who should have done the job have either been passive or an active hindrance. The list is long.

Follow-up 2 January 2012 The McTimoney College of Chiropractic (owned by BPP University) [claims that](http://www.mctimoney-college.ac.uk/category/latest-news/) its \"validation\" by the University of Wales will continue until 2017. This contradicts the statement from UoW. Watch this space. 3 January 2012. Thanks to [Neil O'Connell](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) for drawing my attention to a paper [in Pain](/white-2011-acupuncture-placebo-rct.pdf). The paper is particularly interesting because it comes from the [Southampton group](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) which has previously been sympathetic to acupuncture. Its authors include [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). It shows, yet again that there is no detectable difference between real and sham acupuncture treatment. It also shows that the empathy of the practitioner has little effect: in fact the stern authoritarian practitioner may have been more effective. Patients receiving acupuncture demonstrated clinically important improvements from baseline (i.e., a 29.5% reduction in pain), but despite this, acupuncture has no specific efficacy over placebo for this group of patients. The clinical effect of acupuncture treatment and associated controls is not related to the use of an acupuncture needle, nor mediated by empathy, but is practitioner related and may be linked to the perceived authority of the practitioner.\" Sadly. the trial didn't include a no-treatment group, so it is impossible to say how much of the improvement is regression to the mean and how much is a placebo effect. The authors admit that it could be mostly the former. Surely now the misplaced confidence in acupuncture shown by some medical and university people must be in tatters. In yet another sign that even acupuncture advovates are beginning to notice that it doesn't work, a recent article [Paradoxes in Acupuncture Research: Strategies for Moving Forward](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/180805/), shows some fascinating squirming. 3 January 2012. The [Daily Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/degree-courses/8989183/Lie-back-and-relax-reflexology-and-aromatherapy-degrees-are-dropped.html) has carried a piece about closure of university courses, written by Michael Hanlon. On [31 January](#310112) they carried a much longer piece. 3 January 2012. It is a great pity that some physiotherapists seem to have fallen hook, line and sinker for the myths of acupuncture. Physiotherapists are, by and large, the respectable face of manipulative therapy. Their evidence base is certainly not all one would wish, but at least they are free of the outrageous mumbo humbo of chiropractors. Well, most of them are, but not the [Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists](http://www.aacp.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=137&Itemid=149) (AACP), or, still worse, The [Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Energy Medicine](http://www.energymedphysio.org.uk/), a group that is truly away with the fairies. These organisations are bringing a very respectable job into disrepute. And the Health Professions Council, which is meant to be their regulator, has, like most regulators, done nothing whatsoever to stop it. 5 January 2012. Times Higher Education gives a history of the demise of the University of Wales, [Boom or Bust](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=418612). It's a useful timeline, but like so many journalists, it's unwilling to admit that bloggers were on to the problem long before the BBC, never mind the QAA. There was also a leader on the same topic, [Perils of the export business](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=418588&c=2). It again fails to take the QAA to task for its failures. Interviews for [Deutsche Welle](http://www.dw-world.de/) and [Middle East Broadcasting Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Broadcasting_Center) TV. 17 January 2012 Another question answered. I just learned that the [ludicrous course in Nutritional Therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259), previously validated by the University of Wales (and a contributor to its downfall), is now being validated by, yes, you guessed, [Middlesex University](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm). Professor Driscoll seems determined to lead his univerity to the bottom of the academic heap. His new partnership with the Northern college of Acupuncture is just [one of a long list](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/business/partners/uk/index.aspx) of validations that almost rivals that of the [late University of Wales](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766). The course has, of course, an [enthusiastic testimonial](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm), from a student. It starts I work full time as a team leader for a pension company but I am also a kinesiologist and work in my spare time doing kinesiology, reiki and Indian head massage. Evidently she's a believer in the barmiest and totally disproved forms of magic medicine. And Middlesex University will give her a Master of Science degree. I have to say I find it worrying that she's a team leader for a pension company. Does she also believe in the value of worthless derivatives. I wonder? 18 January 2012. the story has gone international, with an interview that I did for Deutsche Welle, [UK universities drop alternative medicine degree programs](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15673133,00.html). I'm quoted as saying \"They're dishonest, they teach things that aren't true, and things that are dangerous to patients in some cases\". That seems fair enough. There is also an [interesting item](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5789488,00.html) from July 2010 about pressure to drop payment for homeopathy by German health insurance 31 January 2012 The Daily Telegraph carried a prominent 1200 word account (the title wasn't mine). The [published version](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9051103/Complementary-medicine-courses-in-universities-how-I-beat-the-varsity-quacks.html) was edited slightly. One wonders about the standards of peer review at the British Journal of General Practice. The June issue has a paper, \" [Acupuncture for 'frequent attenders' with medically unexplained symptoms: a randomised controlled trial (CACTUS study)](/paterson-acu-BJGP-2011.pdf)\". It has lots of numbers, but the result is very easy to see. Just look at their Figure. There is no need to wade through all the statistics; it's perfectly obvious at a glance that acupuncture has at best a tiny and erratic effect on any of the outcomes that were measured. But this is not what the paper said. On the contrary, the conclusions of the paper said | | Conclusion The addition of 12 sessions of five-element acupuncture to usual care resulted in improved health status and wellbeing that was sustained for 12 months. How on earth did the authors manage to reach a conclusion like that? The first thing to note is that many of the authors are people who make their living largely from sticking needles in people, or advocating alternative medicine. The authors are Charlotte Paterson, Rod S Taylor, Peter Griffiths, Nicky Britten, Sue Rugg, Jackie Bridges, Bruce McCallum and Gerad Kite, on behalf of the CACTUS study team. The senior author, [Gerad Kite MAc ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/alternativemedicine/5055611/Acupuncture-Guy-of-the-needles.html), is principal of the London Institute of Five-Element Acupuncture London. The first author, [Charlotte Paterson](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=CACTUS+trial&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#hl=en&pq=paterson%20acupuncture&xhr=t&q=%22Charlotte%20Paterson%22%20acupuncture&cp=1&pf=p&sclient=psy&cr=countryUK|countryGB&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&biw=1027&bih=751&tbs=ctr:countryUK|countryGB&source=hp&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=%22Charlotte+Paterson%22+acupuncture&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=4556e706bf640e28), is a well known advocate of acupuncture. as is [Nicky Britten](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Britten+acupuncture&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#hl=en&pq=britten%20acupuncture&xhr=t&q=%22Nicky%20Britten%22%20acupuncture&cp=15&pf=p&sclient=psy&client=firefox-a&hs=ZN0&rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&source=hp&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=%22Nicky+Britten%22+acupuncture&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=4556e706bf640e28&biw=1027&bih=751). The conflicts of interest are obvious, but nonetheless one should welcome a \"randomised controlled trial\" done by advocates of alternative medicine. In fact the results shown in the Figure are both interesting and useful. They show that acupuncture does not even produce any substantial placebo effect. It's the authors' conclusions that are bizarre and partisan. Peer review is indeed a broken process. That's really all that needs to be said, but for nerds, here are some more details. How was the trial done? The description \"randomised\" is fair enough, but there were no proper controls and the trial was not blinded. It was what has come to be called a \"pragmatic\" trial, which means a trial done without proper controls. They are, of course, much loved by alternative therapists because their therapies usually fail in proper trials. It's much easier to get an (apparently) positive result if you omit the controls. But the fascinating thing about this study is that, despite the deficiencies in design, the result is essentially negative. The authors themselves spell out the problems. \"Group allocation was known by trial researchers, practitioners, and patients\" So everybody (apart from the statistician) knew what treatment a patient was getting. This is an arrangement that is guaranteed to maximise bias and placebo effects. \"Patients were randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive 12 sessions of acupuncture starting immediately (acupuncture group) or starting in 6 months' time (control group), with both groups continuing to receive usual care.\" So it is impossible to compare acupuncture and control groups at 12 months, contrary to what's stated in Conclusions. \"Twelve sessions, on average 60 minutes in length, were provided over a 6-month period at approximately weekly, then fortnightly and monthly intervals\" That sounds like a pretty expensive way of getting next to no effect. \"All aspects of treatment, including discussion and advice, were individualised as per normal five-element acupuncture practice. In this approach, the acupuncturist takes an in-depth account of the patient's current symptoms and medical history, as well as general health and lifestyle issues. The patient's condition is explained in terms of an imbalance in one of the five elements, which then causes an imbalance in the whole person. Based on this elemental diagnosis, appropriate points are used to rebalance this element and address not only the presenting conditions, but the person as a whole\". Does this mean that the patients were told a lot of mumbo jumbo about \"five elements\" (fire earth, metal, water, wood)? If so, anyone with any sense would probably have run a mile from the trial. \"Hypotheses directed at the effect of the needling component of acupuncture consultations require sham-acupuncture controls which while appropriate for formulaic needling for single well-defined conditions, have been shown to be problematic when dealing with multiple or complex conditions, because they interfere with the participative patient-therapist interaction on which the individualised treatment plan is developed. 37-39 Pragmatic trials, on the other hand, are appropriate for testing hypotheses that are directed at the effect of the complex intervention as a whole, while providing no information about the relative effect of different components.\" Put simply that means: we don't use sham acupuncture controls so we can't distinguish an effect of the needles from placebo effects, or get-better-anyway effects. \"Strengths and limitations: The 'black box' study design precludes assigning the benefits of this complex intervention to any one component of the acupuncture consultations, such as the needling or the amount of time spent with a healthcare professional.\" \"This design was chosen because, without a promise of accessing the acupuncture treatment, major practical and ethical problems with recruitment and retention of participants were anticipated. This is because these patients have very poor self-reported health (Table 3), have not been helped by conventional treatment, and are particularly desperate for alternative treatment options.\". It's interesting that the patients were \"desperate for alternative treatment\". Again it seems that every opportunity has been given to maximise non-specific placebo, and get-well-anyway effects. There is a lot of statistical analysis and, unsurprisingly, many of the differences don't reach statistical significance. Some do (just) but that is really quite irrelevant. Even if some of the differences are real (not a result of random variability), a glance at the figures shows that their size is trivial. My conclusions (1) This paper, though designed to be susceptible to almost every form of bias, shows staggeringly small effects. It is the best evidence I've ever seen that not only are needles ineffective, but that placebo effects, if they are there at all, are trivial in size and have no useful benefit to the patient in this case.. (2) The fact that this paper was published with conclusions that appear to contradict directly what the data show, is as good an illustration as any I've seen that peer review is utterly ineffective as a method of guaranteeing quality. Of course the editor should have spotted this. It appears that quality control failed on all fronts. Follow-up In the first four days of this post, it got over 10,000 hits (almost 6,000 unique visitors). Margaret McCartney has written about this too, in [The British Journal of General Practice does acupuncture badly](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=981). The Daily Mail exceeds itself in [an article by Jenny Hope](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1392181/Accupuncture-help-millions-patients-unexplained-symptoms.html) whch says \"Millions of patients with 'unexplained symptoms' could benefit from acupuncture on the NHS, it is claimed\". I presume she didn't read the paper. The Daily Telegraph scarcely did better in [Acupuncture has significant impact on mystery illnesses](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/alternativemedicine/8544735/Acupuncture-has-significant-impact-on-mystery-illnesses.html). The author if this, very sensibly, remains anonymous. Many \"medical information\" sites churn out the press release without engaging the brain, but most of the other newspapers appear, very sensibly, to have ignored ther hyped up press release. Among the worst was [Pulse](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=35&storycode=4129678&c=2), an online magazine for GPs. At least they've publish the comments that show their report was nonsense. The Daily Mash has given this paper a well-deserved spoofing in [Made-up medicine works on made-up illnesses](http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3882&Itemid=77). Brubaker, of the Institute for Studies, said: \"To truly assess the efficacy of acupuncture a widespread double-blind test needs to be conducted over a series of years but to be honest it's the equivalent of mapping the DNA of pixies or conducting a geological study of Narnia.\" \" There is no truth whatsoever in the rumour being spread on Twitter that I'm Professor Brubaker. Euan Lawson, also known as Northern Doctor, has done another excellent job on the Paterson paper: [BJGP and acupuncture - tabloid medical journalism](http://northerndoctor.com/2011/06/02/bjgp-and-acupuncture-tabloid-medical-journalism/). Most tellingly, he reproduces [the press release](http://www.rcgp.org.uk/news/press_releases_and_statements/acupuncture_frequent_attenders.aspx) from the editor of the BJGP, Professor Roger Jones DM, FRCP, FRCGP, FMedSci. \"Although there are countless reports of the benefits of acupuncture for a range of medical problems, there have been very few well-conducted, randomised controlled trials. Charlotte Paterson's work considerably strengthens the evidence base for using acupuncture to help patients who are troubled by symptoms that we find difficult both to diagnose and to treat.\" Oooh dear. The journal may have a [new look](http://www.rcgp.org.uk/news/press_releases_and_statements/new_look_for_bjgp.aspx), but it would be better if the editor read the papers before writing press releases. Tabloid journalism seems an appropriate description. Andy Lewis at Quackometer, has written about this paper too, and put it into historical context. In [Of the Imagination, as a Cause and as a Cure of Disorders of the Body](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/06/of-the-imagination-as-a-cause-and-as-a-cure-of-disorders-of-the-body.html). \"In 1800, John Haygarth warned doctors how we may succumb to belief in illusory cures. Some modern doctors have still not learnt that lesson\". It's sad that, in 2011, a medical journal should fall into a trap that was pointed out so clearly in 1800. He also points out the disgracefully inaccurate [Press release](http://www.pcmd.ac.uk/news.php?id=215) issued by the Peninsula medical school.

He assured me that the matter would be discussed at a meeting of the editorial board of the journal. Tonight he sent me the result of this meeting. | | Subject: BJGP Dear Prof Colquhoun We discussed your emails at yesterday's meeting of the BJGP Editorial Board, attended by 12 Board members and the Deputy Editor The Board was unanimous in its support for the integrity of the Journal's peer review process for the Paterson et al paper - which was accepted after revisions were made in response to two separate rounds of comments from two reviewers and myself - and could find no reason either to retract the paper or to release the reviewers' comments Some Board members thought that the results were presented in an overly positive way; because the study raises questions about research methodology and the interpretation of data in pragmatic trials attempting to measure the effects of complex interventions, we will be commissioning a Debate and Analysis article on the topic. In the meantime we would encourage you to contribute to this debate throught the usual Journal channels Roger Jones Professor Roger Jones MA DM FRCP FRCGP FMedSci FHEA FRSA It is one thing to make a mistake, It is quite another thing to refuse to admit it. This reply seems to me to be quite disgraceful. 20 July 2011. The proper version of the story got wider publicity when Margaret McCartney wrote about it [in the BMJ](/McCartney-BMJ-on-BJGP.pdf). The first [rapid response](http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4606/reply#bmj_el_267995) to this article was a lengthy denial by the authors of the obvious conclusion to be drawn from the paper. They merely dig themselves deeper into a hole. The second response was much shorter (and more accurate). | | Thank you Dr McCartney Richard Watson, General Practitioner The fact that none of the authors of the paper or the editor of BJGP have bothered to try and defend themselves speaks volumes. Like many people I glanced at the report before throwing it away with an incredulous guffaw. You bothered to look into it and refute it - in a real journal. That last comment shows part of the problem with them publishing, and promoting, such drivel. It makes you wonder whether anything they publish is any good, and that should be a worry for all GPs. 30 July 2011. The [British Journal of General Practice](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/rcgp/bjgp/2011/00000061/00000589) has published nine letters that object to this study. Some of them concentrate on problems with the methods. others point out what I believe to be the main point, there us essentially no effect there to be explained. In the public interest, I am posting the responses here [ [download pdf file](/Bjgp-acupuncture-letter-july-2011.pdf)] Thers is also a response from the editor and from the authors. Both are unapologetic. It seems that the editor sees nothing wrong with the peer review process. I don't recall ever having come across such incompetence in a journal's editorial process. Here's all he has to say. | | The BJGP Editorial Board considered this correspondence recently. The Board endorsed the Journal's peer review process and did not consider that there was a case for retraction of the paper or for releasing the peer reviews. The Board did, however, think that the results of the study were highlighted by the Journal in an overly-positive manner. However,many of the criticisms published above are addressed by the authors themselves in the full paper. If you subscribe to the views of Paterson et al, you may want to [buy a T-shirt](http://controversy.wearscience.com/design/elements/) that has a revised version of the periodic table. 5 August 2011. A meeting with the editor of BJGP Yesterday I met a member of the editorial board of BJGP. We agreed that the data are fine and should not be retracted. It's the conclusions that should be retracted. I was also told that the referees' reports were \"bland\". In the circumstances that merely confirmed my feeling that the referees failed to do a good job. Today I met the editor, Roger Jones, himself. He was clearly upset by my comment and I have now changed it to refer to the whole editorial process rather than to him personally. I was told, much to my surprise, that the referees were not acupuncturists but \"statisticians\". That I find baffling. It soon became clear that my differences with Professor Jones turned on interpretations of statistics. It's true that there were a few comparisons that got below P = 0.05, but the smallest was P = 0.02. The warning signs are there in the Methods section: \"all statistical tests were .... deemed to be statistically significant if P < 0.05\". This is simply silly -perhaps they should have read [ Lectures on Biostatistics](http://www.dcscience.net/Lectures_on_biostatistics-ocr4.pdf). Or for a more recent exposition, the [XKCD cartoon](http://flowingdata.com/2011/04/08/statistical-significance-on-xkcd/) in which it's proved that green jelly beans are linked to acne (P = 0.05). They make lots of comparisons but make no allowance for this in the statistics. Figure 2 alone contains 15 different comparisons: it's not surprising that a few come out \"significant\", even if you don't take into account the likelihood of systematic (non-random) errors when comparing final values with baseline values. Keen though I am on statistics, this is a case where I prefer the eyeball test. It's so obvious from the Figure that there's nothing worth talking about happening, it's a waste of time and money to torture the numbers to get \"significant\" differences. You have to be a slavish believer in P values to treat a result like that as anything but mildly suggestive. A glance at the Figure shows the effects, if there are any at all, are trivial. I still maintain that the results don't come within a million miles of justifying the authors' stated conclusion \"The addition of 12 sessions of five-element acupuncture to usual care resulted in improved health status and wellbeing that was sustained for 12 months.\" Therefore I still believe that a proper course would have been to issue a new and more accurate press release. A brief admission that the interpretation was \"overly-positive\", in a journal that the public can't see, simply isn't enough. I can't understand either, why the editorial board did not insist on this being done. If they had done so, it would have been temporarily embarrassing, certainly, but people make mistakes, and it would have blown over. By not making a proper correction to the public, the episode has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre and the reputation oif the journal will suffer permanent harm. This paper is going to be cited for a long time, and not for the reasons the journal would wish. Misinformation, like that sent to the press, has serious real-life consequences. You can be sure that the paper as it still stands, will be cited by every acupuncturist who's trying to persuade the Department of Health that he's a \"qualified provider\". There was not much unanimity in the discussion up to this point, Things got better when we talked about what a GP should do when there are no effective options. Roger Jones seemed to think it was acceptable to refer them to an alternative practitioner if that patient wanted it. I maintained that it's unethical to explain to a patient how medicine works in terms of pre-scientific myths. I'd have love to have heard the \"informed consent\" during which \"The patient's condition is explained in terms of imbalance in the five elements which then causes an imbalance in the whole person\". If anyone had tried to explain my conditions in terms of my imbalance in my Wood, Water, Fire, Earth and Metal. I'd think they were nuts. The last author. Gerad Kite, runs a private clinic that sells acupuncture for all manner of conditions. You can find his view of science on his [web site](http://www.geradkite.com/content/content.php?pageID=7). It's condescending and insulting to talk to patients in these terms. It's the ultimate sort of paternalism. And paternalism is something that's supposed to be vanishing in medicine. I maintained that this was ethically unacceptable, and that led to a more amicable discussion about the possibility of more honest placebos. It was good of the editor to meet me in the circumstances. I don't cast doubt on the honesty of his opinions. I simply disagree with them, both at the statistical level and the ethical level. 30 March 2014 I only just noticed that one of the authors of the paper, Bruce McCallum (who worked as an acupuncturist at Kite's clinic) appeared in a 2007 Channel 4 News piece. I was a report on the pressure to save money by stopping NHS funding for [\"unproven and disproved treatments\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=135). McCallum said that scientific evidence was needed to show that acupuncture really worked. Clearly he failed, but to admit that would have affected his income. Watch the video (McCallum appears near the end). The long-awaited government decision concerning statutory regulation of herbalists, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture came out today. [Get the Department of Health (DH) report [pdf]](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_124338.pdf) It is not good news. They have opted for statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC). This is much what was recommended by the disgraceful [Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Pittilo), about which I wrote a [commentary in the Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/columnists/article2047617.ece) (or [free version here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=251)), and [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://dcscience.net/?p=235). The DH report is merely an analysis of responses to the consultation, but the [MHRA says](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Medicinesregulatorynews/CON108795) \"The Health Professions Council (HPC) has now been asked to establish a statutory register for practitioners supplying unlicensed herbal medicines. The proposal is, following creation of this register, to make use of a derogation in European medicines legislation (Article 5 (1) of Directive 2001/83/EC) that allows national arrangements to permit those designated as \"authorised healthcare professionals\" to commission unlicensed medicines to meet the special needs of their patients.\" The MHRA points out that this started 11 years ago with the publication of the [ House of Lords report (2000)](http://dcscience.net/?p=199). Both that report, and the government's response to it, set the following priorities. Both state clearly \"... we recommend that three important questions should be addressed in the following order . . - (1) does the treatment offer therapeutic benefits greater than placebo? - (2) is the treatment safe? - (3) how does it compare, in medical outcome and cost-effectiveness, with other forms of treatment? The report of DH and the MHRA's response have ignored totally two of these three requirements. There is no consideration whatsoever of whether treatments work better than placebo (point one) and there is no consideration whatsoever of cost-effectiveness (point 3). These two important recommendations in the Houss of Lords report have simply been brushed under the carpet. Needless to say, herbalists are head over heels with joy at this sign of official endorsement (here is [one reaction](http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=312229)) Here are my first reactions. The post will be updated soon. The DH report is, in a sense, democratic. They have simply counted the responses, for and against each proposal. They seem to be quite unaware that most of the responses come from High Street herbailsts whose main aim is to gain respectability. The response of the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges counts as one vote, just the same as the owner of a Chinese medicine shop. This is not how health policy should be determined. Some intervention of the brain is needed, but that isn't apparent in the report. At present [the HPC regulates](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/professions/) Arts therapists, biomedical scientists, chiropodists/podiatrists, clinical scientists, dietitians, occupational therapists, operating department practitioners, orthoptists, paramedics, physiotherapists, prosthetists/orthotists, radiographers and speech & language therapists. I shudder to think what all these good people will think about being lumped together with people who practice evidence-free medicine (or, worse, forms of medicine where there is good evidence that they don't work). The vast majority of herbalists, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture has no good evidence that it works, In the case of soem herbal medicines and acupuncture, there is good evidence that they don't work. Yet the HPC has, as [one of its criteria](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/newprofessions/criteria/), that aspiring to be regulated by them requires \"practise based on evidence of efficacy\" The Department of Health seems to have quietly forgotten about this criterion. It cannot possibly be met. The HPC has already expressed its willingness to go along with this two-faced approach (see [Health Professions Council ignores its own rules: the result is nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284) ) Another mistake made by the Department of Health regards the value of \"training\". The report (page 11) says Would statutory regulation lessen the risk of harm? (Q2) Again, the vast majority of respondents thought it would. Reasons given were that statutory regulation would ensure that herbal practitioners and acupuncturists are carefully and thoroughly trained. That training is subject to accreditation, evaluation and periodic review by independent educational and training professionals, and disciplinary oversight by a regulating body. Incompetent or unscrupulous practitioners could be struck off the register and prevented from practising. Although it is pointed out to them in several responses, the Department of Health seems quite incapable of understanding a simple and obvious truth. Spending three years training people to learn things that are not true, safeguards nobody. On the contrary, it endangers the public. Training in nonsense is obviously a nonsense. At the end of the report is a list of organisations who responded, As expected, they are predominantly trade bodies that have a vested interest in allowing thinks to be sold freely regardless of whether they work or not. The first four are Alliance of Herbal Medicine Practitioners. European herbal and Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association (ETMPA), Association Chinese Medicine Practitioners (UK) (ACMP) and Acupuncture Society. And so on. More coming soon. Follow-up 16 February 2011. Later the same day, we see one reason why Michael Mcintyre, chair of the European Herbal Practitioners Association, got what he wanted to promote his trade. They had evidently hired a PR Agency, Cogitamus, to push their case. Now they are [ crowing about their victory](http://www.cogitamus.co.uk/?p=290). And of course his profits were not harmed by the free publicity that was given to his cause [ by the BBC](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2813), The pinheads in the Department of Health are more easily persuaded by a PR agency than by any number of people who know a lot more about it, and who have no profit motive. 17 February 2011. The herbal problem was front page news in the London free paper, the Metro: [Chinese medicine and herbal ban to see Britain defy EU laws](http://www.metro.co.uk/news/855767-chinese-medicine-and-herbal-ban-to-see-britain-defy-eu-laws) The Daily Telegraph covered the story: [Herbal medicine to be regulated, says Andrew Lansley](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8328791/Herbal-medicine-to-be-regulated-says-Andrew-Lansley.html). The comments featured some pretty mad rants from herbalists, to which I tried to reply. The Metro article elicited a fine bit of abuse from a Lynda Kane. I'm constantly amazed at the downright viciousness of cuddly holistic therapists when they get found out. I guess it is just another bad case of cognitive dissonance. I can't resist a few quotations. Sir, \"I have just come across your asinine comments quoted in the London Metro newspaper re the EU herbal medicine directive. For a supposed scientist your mis-informed, closed-minded, unsubstantiated bigotry leaves me speechless\" \"As a scientist myself, I abide by the virtues of open-minded neutrality and accepting the hypothesis until proven otherwise by null-hypothesis based research.\" \"How many of the innumerable studies on the efficacy of herbal medicine have you read? \" \"Perhaps in your 'day' professors could say whatever they liked and be listened to. That day is long gone, as you must know from the various law-suits you have been party to.\" I love the idea that statistics allow you to accept any hypothesis whatsoever until someone shows it to be wrong. This would be funny if it were not so sad (and rather painful). As always I replied politely and referred her to [NCCAM's Guide to Herbs](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm), so she can check up on that plethora of evidence that she seems to think exists. This is Lynda Kane of [energyawareness.org](http://energyawareness.org/). I can recommend her web site, if you want some truly jaw-dropping woo. She'll sell you a \"White Jade Energy Egg - may provide up to 5 times as much protection from wifi and from other peoples' energies - costs \u00a347.00\". Hmm, sounds good. How does it work? Easy. \"The human energy or \"qi\" field is shaped like an egg. It is being attacked by many forms of natural and man-made environmental stress 24 hours a day.\" I guess that's OK according to Ms Kane's interpretation of statistics which allows you to accept any hypothesis whatsoever until someone shows it to be wrong. Anyone for Trading Standards or the ASA? 17 February 2011. The excellent Andy Lewis has posted on similar problems \" [How to Spot Bad Regulation of Alternative Medicine](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/02/how-to-spot-bad-regulation-of-alternative-medicine.html)\" .20 July 2013 Nothing visible happened after this announcement. Until the government's resident medical loon, David Tredinnick MP forced [a debate on the matter](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#130709h0001.htm_spnew0). His introduction to the debate was his usual make-believe. Sadly it made much of [an exhibit at the Royal Society ](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=6105#030713)Summer Science exhibition -a bit of bait and swich by aromatherapists. After ploughing your way through pages of nonsense, you get to the interesting bit. At 10.38 am, The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, Dr Daniel Poulter, announced what was happening. It seems that there may, after all, have been some effect of all the [sensible submissions](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007) which pointed out the impossibility of regulating nonsense. The question of regulation has, yet again, been postponed. \"To ensure that we take forward the matter effectively, we want to bring together experts and interested parties from all sides of the debate to form a working group that will gather evidence and consider all the viable options in more detail,\" One wonders who will be on this working group? If they don't choose the right people, it could be [as bad as the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=6105#030713). It wasn't reassuring to read \" we want to set up a working group and to work with my hon. Friend [Tredinnick], and herbalists and others, to ensure that the legislation is fit for purpose.\" | | The Science Museum is a wonderful place. As a child it seemed magical. So all the more disappointing to find that it houses an exhibition that promotes quackery. The exhibition is uncritical and sometimes downright dangerous. It does not teach you anything about science, it teaches anti-science and uncritical thinking. It was not originally like this. Most of the objects in the exhibition were originally part of Henry Wellcome's Wellcome Museum of Medical History, based at 183 Euston Road. It was moved on permanent loan to the Science Museum in 1977 where it was known as The Wellcome Museum of the History of Medicine. | | > Recently the Wellcome-Trust sponsored exhibition was the subject of a blog post at [Purely a figment of your imagination](http://noodlemaz.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/science-wooseum/#comment-726), written by [Alex Davenport](http://twitter.com/#!/Alex_Davenport). That reminded me that last June I was sent a lot of pictures of the exhibition but never got round to finishing writing them up. Here, somewhat tardily, is some of what I got. It seems that the Wellcome Trust is not to blame, The free advertising for quacks was something added to the Wellcome collection by the Science Museum itself. At the time, I wrote to the Science Museum to find out what was going on. The response was very disappointing, merely bland PR stuff. I was told that the person responsible for the display was Lisa O'Sullivan, Senior Curator of Medicine, but she was on sabbatical, so no response from her. The clue to what went wrong came in a letter from Dr. Tim Boon, the Science Museum's Chief Curator. The letter was relayed via the Museum's Press Officer. A subsequent letter to Boon himself was not answered. \"Therefore, in addition to the overwhelming majority of the Upper Wellcome gallery that tells the story of the history of Western medicine since the rise of Civilisation up to the modern era, we devote a small section to these more anthropological concerns in our display called 'Living Medical Traditions'. Our message in this display is that these traditions are not 'alternative' systems in some parts of the world. Instead they are often the only choice of medical care to those communities. We do not make any claims for the validity of these traditions. For example, we include the use of acupuncture but do not say that acupuncture 'works'. \" Unfortunately this is really not true: the tone is very much that it does work. The reason is clear in the next paragraph. \"As with all Science Museum galleries independent experts were consulted when developing this gallery. In this instance advice was sought from leading academics in the history of non-western medical traditions as well as practitioners and users of these traditions. We maintained editorial control throughout.\" Aha they asked \"experts\", but of course it is always possible to find some 'expert' to advocate any view, however barmy. The only experts that were consulted, we are told, is historians and practitioners of anti-scientific medicine. No scientists. Clearly the Museum allowed the quacks to write their own script, with no supervision from anyone who understands the science, It is meant to be a Science Museum, not a museum of anthropology. The nonsense of quack medicine provides an excellent opportunity to explain simply how science tries to separate truth from falsehood. The Museum has not only missed that opportunity but it has actively promoted anti-science. The Museum declined to name these mystery experts, but one of them is revealed in the 2006 newsletter of the British Medical Acupuncture Society [ [download the newsletter](/BMAS-newsletter-summer-2006.pdf)]. An article by Jonathan Freedman shows the delight of acupuncturists. \"The BMAS were approached by the Museum last Summer and asked if any members would be able to contribute a case study about acupuncture to feature in the 'personal stories' section of the exhibition.\" \"I think the final product has worked extremely well and shows Western Medical Acupuncture in a positive light. A selection of needles is displayed along with the BMAS leaflet and my own practice acupuncture leaflet.\" In fact the Science Museum's good name is used by Freedman to advertise his private practice. Here is the free advertising in the Science Museum. Traditional Chinese Medicine There is plenty of this and it is totally uncritical. All it does is repeat the gobbledygook used by practitioners. In fact it was largely written by them. There are recorded commercials too. Listen to this one. [Advertising for cupping at the Asant\u00e9 Clinic](/scimus-tcm.mp3). In the recording, Dr Ke diagnoses an asthma patient as having mucus in the lungs -by looking at his tongue (no kidding) -and recommends [ cupping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_cupping). He says \"We need to clear this mucus, or the phlegm, in the chest by using cupping, It's improving, sort of, the flow of the water, and flow out, in other words, suck out the badness from the body\" This, needless to say, is total rubbish. The recording took place at the [Asant\u00e9 Clinic](http://www.asante-academy.com/), on the Archway campus of the University of Middlesex. Ah yes, Middlesex. Take a look at ' [More quackedemia. Dangerous Chinese medicine taught at Middlesex University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923)'. Unani medicine, Another advertisement for a private clinic. | | | | [Listen to a diagnosis being made by looking at the iris](/scimus-unani.mp3). Iridology is, of course, [total bunk](http://www.skepdic.com/iridol.html) Just one of the many phoney methods of diagnosis used by alternative practitioners, as an aid to selling you an expensive treatment. Ayervedic medicine [Listen to another advertisement, for private Ayurveda clinic](scimus-ayurveda.mp3) The display that accompanies the recording is totally uninformative. The practitioners have been allowed to advertise their wares with no trace of critical thought. No trace of science. | | | | | | | | | | | | The power of blogs I guess this incident is yet another example of the power of blogs. My own letters to the science museum produced precisely nothing, as is usually the case if you go through the \"proper channels\". [Alex Davenport's blog](http://noodlemaz.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/science-wooseum/),on the other hand, stung the Science Museum into a [public response](http://sciencemuseumdiscovery.com/blogs/collections/living-medical-traditions/). It's true that the response is much the same as the patronising PR junk that was sent to me last year, though it was labelled as being by [Susannah Shute, Web Content Coordinator. ](http://sciencemuseumdiscovery.com/blogs/collections/author/susannahshute/)The response even linked to a [picture of the homeopathy exhibit](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sciencemuseum/5415814080/). It seems a bit more pressure is needed to persuade the museum to change this particular exhibition into science, rather than its present anti-science. Follow-up 13 April 2011. Simon Singh arranged a meeting with the new director of the Science Museum, Ian Blatchford, and deputy director Heather Mayfield Our deputation consisted of Simon Singh, Alex Davenport, Marianne Baker and me. It was [Alex's blog](http://noodlemaz.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/science-wooseum/) on the science museum exhibit, and [my post on the museum ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4066)which followed it shortly, that caused the meeting. Alex had a [follow-up blog](http://sciencemuseumdiscovery.com/blogs/collections/living-medical-traditions/) too. I hadn't realised that Simon had resigned as a trustee of the museum five years ago, in protest about the (dreadful) alternative medicine exhibit. I had various stonewalling responses to my attempts to pursue the matter out of the limelight, so eventually went public. After the blogs appeared, the Science Museum [published a response](http://sciencemuseumdiscovery.com/blogs/collections/living-medical-traditions/) which was, sadly, entirely vacuous. We had an excellent discussion, during which Ian Blatchford said he regretted the official response and changes to the exhibit are promised. there is an account of the meeting [here](http://begsci.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/science-triumphs/). We were sent a revised version, which was improved, but not, we said improved enough. 10 May 2011. Got an email from the person who originally brought the problem to my attention. \"Visited Science museum yesterday , wonderful news - all offensive material gone, and different ok stuff there\". Well done, Science Museum. The mainstream media eventually catch up with bloggers. BBC1 TV (Wales) produced an excellent TV programme that exposed the enormous degree validation scam run by the University of Wales. It also exposed the uselessness of the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA). Both these things have been written about repeatedly here for some years. It was good to see them getting wider publicity. Watch the video of the programme ( [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ix4HTi9LWE), and [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG2kBeDer-0)) \"Week In Week Out - University Challenged.\" \"The programme examines how pop stars and evangelical Christians are running colleges offering courses validated by the University of Wales.\" (I make a brief appearance, talking about validation of degrees in Chinese Medicine). In October 2008 I posted [Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). With the help of the Freedom of Information Act, it was possible to reveal the mind-boggling incompetence of the validation process used by the University of Wales. McTimoney College of Chiropractic The Chiropractic \"degrees\" from the McTimoney College of Chiropractic are also validated by the University of Wales by an equally incompetent, or perhaps I should say bogus, procedure. More details can be found at [The McTimoney Chiropractic Association would seem to believe that chiropractic is \"bogus\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1686), and in a later post, [Not much Freedom of Information at University of Wales, University of Kingston, Robert Gordon University or Napier University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2351). Andy Lewis has also written about chiropractic in [The University of Wales is Responsible for Enabling Bogus* Chiropractic Claims to be Made](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/university-of-wales-is-responsible-for.html). Sadly the BBC programme did not have much to say about these domestic courses, but otherwise it was excoriating. In particular it had extensive interviews with Nigel Palastanga, whose astonishing admission that courses were validated withour seeing what was taught on them was [revealed here two years ago](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). After that revelation, the vice-chancellor UoW, promoted Palastanga to be pro-vice-chancellor in charge of Learning, Teaching and Enhancement (I know, you couldn't make it up). In the documentary Palastanga said \"It's a major business. We earn a considerable amount of money.\" That was obvious two years ago, but it's good to hear it from the horse's mouth. After a section that revealed a bit about what goes on at two very fundamentalist bible colleges which gave University of Wales degrees, A. C. Grayling commented thus. \"They are there to train advocates for the biblical message and that is absolutely not, by a very very long chalk, what a university should be doing.. . . A respectable British Higher education institution like the University of Wales shouldn't be touching them with a bargepole.\" Undaunted, Palastanga responded \"That's his opinion. I would say they are validated to the highest standards. They match what are called QAA benchmark. We have serious academics looking at them, and their academic standards are established at the very highest level.\" And if you believe that, you will truly believe anything. You can [download here](/PalastangaBScChiro28082008.pdf) one of many moderator's reports obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. This one is for the BSc (Hons) Chiropractic. It is entirely typical of theuncritical boxticking approach to validation, Nowhere does it say \"subluxation is nonsense\", though [even the GCC now admit that](http://www.zenosblog.com/2010/05/obituary-the-death-of-the-subluxation/). Traditional Chinese Medicine The University of Wales validates several courses in what almost everyone but them classifies as quackery. As well as [chiropractic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1686) and [\"nutritional therapy\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259), there is herbalism. For example a course at a college in Barcelona issues University of Wales degrees in Traditional Chinese medicine, a subject that is [a menace to public health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923).. I was asked to comment on the course, and on a bag of herbs that the presenter had been sold to treat depression. | Ingredients of a custom mixture. There is no good evidence that any of the ingredients help depression, in fact next to nothing is known about most of them, apart from liquorice and ginger. Swallowing them would be rather reckless. They fall right into the description of any herbal medicine, [in the Patients' Guide](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733), \"Herbal medicine: giving patients an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety. \" Of the degrees, I said \"There's no evidence that it [the herbs] does you any good. It may be dangerous because you have no idea of the dose. Degrees in Chinese Medicine consist of three years spent memorising myths and pre-scientific, er, untruths. That isn't a degree, it's a travesty.\" Palastanga. responded \"We've had long debates in the Health Committee about where we would draw the line about what we validate. They have to demonstrate to us that there is some scientific basis for the practice, that there is an established curriculum, that there is an established safe practice.\" The presenter asked him \"So you are confident that Chinese medicine works? Palastanga replied \" I didn't say that. I said that there is evidence that it does work . . We are trying to enforce these professions to undertake effective research.\" That statement is simply not true, as shown by the response of the validation committee to the application for validation of the course in \"Nutritional Therapy\" at the Northern College of Acupuncture, [documented previously](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). The fact of the matter is that the validation proceeded without looking at what was actually taught, and without even a detailed timetable of lectures. The committee looked only at the official documents presented to it and was totally negligent in failing to discover some of the bizarre beliefs of the people who were giving the course. Palastanga went on to raise the usual straw man argument, about how little regular medicine is based on good evidence (though admittedly that is certainly true in his own field -he is a physiotherapist). Fazley International College Kuala Lumpur This business college in Kuala Lumpur offered University of Wales degrees. Its 32-year old president is a part time pop star with impressive looking qualifications The presenter pointed out that \" His doctorate and his MBA were awarded in that citadel of education, Cambridge. Here he is, pictured at the city's prestigious business school. He was there for all of four days and walked away with a doctorate. But the degree was not from the University of Cambridge, but from the now defunct \"European Business School Cambridge\". It never had the right to award degrees.\" Neither the University of Wales nor the QAA had noticed this unfortunate fact. Once the TV team had done their job for them, the [UoW withdrew support](http://www.wales.ac.uk/en/InstitutionsAndCourses/FIC/FazleyInternationalCollege-KualaLumpur.aspx). though, as of 15 November 2010, that is not obvious from [Fazley's web site](http://www.fazleyic.com/). Mr (not Dr) Fazley seemed rather pleased about how students were attracted by the connection with the Prince of Wales. The fact that he is Chancellor of the University of Wales seems not inappropriate, given the amount of quackery they promote. Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) In 2007, I wrote, [in Nature](http://dcscience.net/colquhoun-nature-07.pdf) (see also [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19)), \"Why don't regulators prevent BSc degrees in anti-science? The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) claims that \"We safeguard and help to improve the academic standards and quality of higher education in the UK.\" It costs taxpayers \u00a311.5 million (US$22 million) annually. It is, of course, not unreasonable that governments should ask whether universities are doing a good job. But why has the QAA not noticed that some universities are awarding BSc degrees in subjects that are not, actually, science? The QAA report on the University of Westminster courses awards a perfect score for 'curriculum design, content and organization,' despite this content consisting largely of what I consider to be early-nineteenth-century myths, not science. It happens because the QAA judges courses only against the aims set by those who run the QAA, and if their aims are to propagate magic as science, that's fine.\" That was illustrated perfectly in the documentary when Dr Stephen Jackson of the QAA appeared to try to justify the fact that the QAA had, like the University of Wales, failed entirely to spot any of the obvious problems. He had a nice dark suit, tie and poppy, but couldn't disguise the fact that the QAA had given high ratings to some very dubious courses. The QAA sent nine people to the other side of the globe, at a cost of \u00a391,000. They could have done a lot better if they'd spent 10 minutes with Google at home. Universities UK (UUK) Needless to say, the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals has said nothing at all. As usual, Laurie Taylor had it all worked out in [ Times Higher Education (4th November)](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=414124). Speaking to our reporter Keith Ponting (30), he commended UUK's decision to say absolutely nothing whatsoever about the abolition of all public funding for the arts and humanities. He also praised UUK's total silence on Lord Browne's view that student courses should primarily be evaluated by their employment returns. When pressed by Ponting for his overall view of UUK's failure to respond in any way at all to any aspect of the Browne Review, he described it as \"welcome evidence, in a world of change, of UUK's consistent commitment over the years to ineffectual passivity\". Meanwhile, a University of Wales video on YouTube Caveat emptor Follow-up A couple of days later, a [search of Google news](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22University+of+Wales%22&hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=Itq&sa=G&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&prmd=nm&source=univ&tbs=nws:1&tbo=u&ei=UxvjTLTzL4SAhAf_08i2DQ&oi=news_group&ct=title&resnum=11&ved=0CHQQqAIwCg) for the \"University of Wales\" shows plenty of fallout. The vice-chancellor [ claims that](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/welsh-politics/welsh-politics-news/2010/11/13/minister-s-attack-was-totally-unacceptable-91466-27651062/) \"\"The Minister's attack came as a complete and total surprise to me\". That can't be true. It is over two years since I told him what was going on, and if he was unaware of it, that is dereliction of duty. It is not the TV programme that brought the University into disrepute, it was the vice-chancellor. The Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health [shut down amidst scandal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) in April 2010. In July, we heard that a new \"College of Medicine\" was to arise from its ashes. It seemed clear [from the people involved](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) that the name \"College of Medicine\" would be deceptive. Now the College of Medicine has materialised, and it is clear that one's worst fears were well justified. At first sight, it looks entirely plausible and well-meaning. Below the logo [one reads](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/about-college-medicine) \"There is a new force in medicine. A force that brings patients, doctors, nurses and other health professionals together, instead of separating them into tribes.\" \"That force is the new College of Medicine. Uniquely, it brings doctors and other health professionals together with patients and scientists.\" It is apparent from the outset that the well-meaning words fall into the trap described so clearly by James May (see [What 'holistic' really means](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095)). It fails to distinguish between curing and caring. As always, the clue lies not in the words, but in the people who are running it. Who is involved? After a bit of digging on the web site, you find the names of the people on the [Science Council of the \"College of Medicine\"](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/science-council), The preamble says \"Good medicine must be grounded in good science as well as compassion. The College's Science Council brings a depth of knowledge from many senior figures.\" But then come the names. With the odd exception the \"science council\" is like a roll-call of quacks, the dregs left over from the Prince's Foundation. The link (attached to each name) gives the College's bio, My links tell a rather different story. - [Professor George Lewith](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/professor-george-lewith)You'll find plenty about [George Lewith on this blog.](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22) - [Professor Mustafa Djamgoz](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/professor-mustafa-djamgoz)Superficially respectable but seduced by 'ancient wisdom' He once wrote to me \"There are many 'eastern' remedies (such as acupuncture that we witnessed dismissed 25 year ago) that work. \".

There are a few gaps in this table, to be filled in soon. One can guarantee that a great deal more will appear about the College on the web, very soon. The [Governing Council of the College](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council) is equally replete with quacks (plus a few surprising names). It has on it, for example, a spiritual healer (Angie-Buxton King), a homeopath (Christine Glover), a herbalist (Michael McIntyre). Westminster University's king of woo (David Peters), not to mention the infamous [Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Karol+Sikora%22). Buxton-King [offers a remarkable service](#abk1) to heal people or animals at a distance. Meanwhile, it seemed worthwhile to provide a warning that the title of the College is very deceptive. It hides an agenda that could do much harm. It is, quite simply, the Prince of Wales by stealth. Follow-up 28 October 2010 Professor Sir Graeme Catto, who has, disgracefully, allowed his name to be used as president of this \"College\" has said to me \"There are real problems in knowing how to care for folk with chronic conditions and the extent of the evidence base for medicine is pretty limited\". Yes of course that is quite true. There are many conditions for which medicine can still do little. There is a fascinating discussion to be had about how best to care for them. The answer to that is NOT to bring in spiritual healers and peddlers of sugar pills to deceive patients with their fairy stories. The \"College of Medicine\" will delay and pervert the sort of discussion that Catto says, rightly, is needed. 29 October 2010 I need a press card. I see that the BMJ also had a piece about the \"College of Medicine\" yesterday: [Prince's foundation metamorphoses into new College of Medicine](http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6126.full), by Nigel Hawkes. He got the main point right there in the title. As was [clear since July](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), the driving force was Michael Dixon, Devon GP and ex medical director of the Prince's Foundation. Hawkes goes easy on the homeopaths and spiritual healers, but did spot something that I can't find on their web site. The \"Faculties\" will include \"in 2011, neuromusculoskeletal care. Two of the six strong faculty members for this specialty are from the British Chiropractic Association, which sued the author Simon Singh for libel for his disobliging remarks about the evidence base for their interventions.\" The College certainly picks its moment to endorse chiropractic, a subject that is in chaos and disgrace after they lost the Singh affair. One bit of good news emerges from Hawkes' piece, There is at least one high profile doubter in the medical establishment, Lord (John) Walton (his 2000 report on CAM was less than blunt, and has been widely misquoted by quacks) is reported as saying, at the opening ceremony \"I'm here as a sceptic, and I've just told my former houseman that,\" he said. The target of the remark was Donald Irvine, another former GMC president and a member of the new college's advisory council.\" 31 October 2010. I got an email that pointed out a remarkable service offered by a member of College's [Governing Council](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). Angie Buxton-King, a \"spiritual healer\" employed by UCLH seems to have another web site, [The Beacon of Healing Light](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/) that is not mentioned in [her biography](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/angie-buxton-king) on the College's site. Perhaps it should have been because it makes some remarkable claims. The [page about distant healing](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/Distant_Healing.php) is the most bizarre. Absent Healing/Distant Healing \"Absent healing is available when it is not possible to visit the patient or it is not possible for the patient to be brought to our healing room. This form of healing has proved to be very successful for humans and animals alike.\" \"We keep a healing book within our healing room and every night spend time sending healing to all those who have asked for it. We have found that if a picture of the patient is sent to us the healing is more beneficial, we also require a weekly update to monitor any progress or change in the patients situation. Donations are welcome for this service.\" I wonder what the Advertising Standards people make of the claim that it is \"very successful\"? I wonder what the president of the College makes of it? I've asked him. Other blogs about the \"College of Medicine\" 30 October 2010. Margaret McCartney is always worth reading. As a GP she is at the forefront of medicine. She's written about the College in [The Crisis in Caring and dangerous inference](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=801). She's also provided some information about a \"professional member\" of the [College of Medicine](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/dr-sam-everington), in [..and on Dr Sam Everington, at the Bromley by Bow Centre....](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=803) It is one of the more insulting things about alternative medicine addicts that they claim to be the guardians of caring (as opposed to curing), They are not, and people like McCartney and Michael Baum are excellent examples. Prince of Wales to become honorary president of the \"College of Medicine?\" Last night I heard a rumour that the Prince of Wales is, despite all the earlier denials, to become Honorary President of the \"College\". If this is true, it completes the wholesale transformation of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Medicine into this new \"College\". Can anybody take it seriously now? Text messages to Graeme Catto and Michael Dixon, inviting them to deny the rumour, have met with silence. Herbal nonsense at the College 29 July 2011. I got an email from the College if Medicine [ [download it](http://www.dcscience.net/COM-Self-care.pdf)]. It contains a lot of fantasy about herbal medicines, sponsered by a company that manufactures them. It is dangeroous and corrupt. Systems biology is all the rage, No surprise then, to see the University of Westminster [advertising a job](http://liv2.www.jobs.ac.uk/employer/university-of-westminster) for a systems biologist in the The Department of Molecular and Applied Biosciences. Well, no surprise there -until you read the small print. Much has been wriiten here [about the University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=University+of+Westminster), which remains the biggest provider of junk sciencne degrees in the UK, despite having [closed two of them](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329). | | Senior Lecturer in Systems Biology University of Westminster - Department of Molecular and Applied Biosciences, School of Life Sciences Cavendish Site Salary \u00a337,886 - \u00a350,751 (Inc. LWA) The Department of Molecular and Applied Biosciences wishes to appoint a Senior Lecturer in Systems Biology. The post-holder will teach on the undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes within the School of Life Sciences, particularly in the areas of Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics and/or statistics, establish their own and participate in ongoing research programmes and undertake external income generation activities. The candidate should have an active interest in bridging the gap between western life sciences and Chinese medicine using emerging systems biology approaches, specifically in metabolomics and proteomics with a goal of developing novel diagnostic technologies facilitating the creation of a personalised approach to medical care. They should therefore be willing to work closely with colleagues in the life sciences as well as with clinicians and clinical researchers from within the East Asian medical tradition. The post is available from 1st October 2010 or as soon as possible thereafter. The closing date for applications, together with a short statement on why you believe you are suitable for the position and a description of your research plans, is Monday 6th September 2010. Interviews are expected to be held later in September. Administrative contact (for queries only): Tayjal Tailor ( Reference Number: 50000360 Closing Date: Friday 3 September 2010 A note about systems biology Systems biology is about about how whole organs behave, as opposed to single cells or single molecules, It has to be the ultimate aim of biology. There is one case in which this has been done with some success, That is the modelling of the behaviour of the whole heart by Denis Noble and his colleagues in the Phyiology department (now gone) in Oxford. They adopted a bottom up approach. They measured the currents that flow though many sorts of ion channels in single cells from various parts of the heart, and how individual cells communicate with each other. Starting from this solid basis, together with a lot of computer power, they were able to model successfully a lot of phenomena that occur in the whole heart, but can't be investigated in single cells. For example their work cast light on abnormal heart rhythms like ventricular fibrillation, and on the effect of drugs on heart rhythm. This work was mostly done before the term 'systems biology\" thought of. It was called physiology. It is impressive work, and systems biology became a fashionable buzzword among research administrators and funding agencies. Despite the amount of money thrown at the problem, I'm not aware of any success that remotely approaches Noble's.. One reason for that is that people have not been willing to put in the groundwork. In the case of the heart, the models were built on -many years of basic research on the electrophysiology of single heart cells. People have tried to model from the top down, without doing the spade work first. There has developed a perception that computing power can compensate for lack of basic knowledge about things work. It can't. The usual aphorism applies: garbage in, garbage out. Here's an example, which eas noted in the [diary pages for 29 June, 2008](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=237#sysbio). While in Edinbuurgh, to give a talk to the European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology, I noticed a poster. It described an attempt to model on a computer the entire metabolic network of yeast. \"81 of the 662 intracellular concentrations were defined . . . The remainder were set to the median concentration of c. 0.2 mM.\" Ahem. We didn't know the concentrations so we just made them up so we could run the program. It's interesting that even people in the business seem to realise that even that it isn't living up to the hype. The [Fixing proteomics](http://www.fixingproteomics.org/) web site shows why. Put another way, if you try to run before you can walk, you risk falling falling on your face. For these reasons, it seems to me that that most attempts at system biology have been disappointing (please correct me if I'm wrong) Systems biology for Chinese medicine If systems biology suffers from trying to run before it can walk in regular biology, where at least something is known about the functions of cells, how much more true that must be of Chinese medicine. In Chinese medicine almost all the treatments have never been tested properly in man. The odds are that most don't work at all, and some are very poisonous (not to mention the cruelty and destruction of endangered species that is involved in making some of their more bizarre medicines). The idea that you can explain it with systems biology, is ludicrous in the extreme. One can't imagine any vaguely competent biologist who'd want to touch a project as bizarre as this with a bargepole. Eastmedicine This advertisement stems presumably from [EASTmedicine](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/research/research-groups/eastmedicine#Summary) is the University of Westminster's research centre for East Asian Sciences and Traditions in Medicine. The proclaimed aims are to focus on \"understanding, development and evaluation of East Asian medicines as living traditions\". The director of EASTmedicine, [Volker Scheid](http://www.volkerscheid.co.uk/index.php), is a herbalist and acupuncturist and, as such, a firm believer in alternative medicine. When he isn't at the University he has a private practice, the [Traditional Acupuncture Centre](http://www.acupuncturecentre.org.uk/), in London. The website of his private practice makes some [astonishing claims](http://www.acupuncturecentre.org.uk/page1.html) \"Acupuncture is effective in the treatment of numerous conditions including headache, migraine, digestive problems, menstrual disorders, indeterminate aches and pains, asthma, hayfever, stress, tiredness, depression and anxiety. Also commonly treated are chronic conditions such as arthritis, back pain, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, eczema, sinusitis, high blood pressure and repetitive strain injuries.\" These claims simply cannot be justified by any worthwhile evidence. It will be interesting to see what Trading Standards make of them. Dr Scheid [describes himself](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/staff/chinese-medicine-and-complementary-therapies/volker-scheid) as a \"scholar physician\". Physician seems a rather pretentious description for someone whose qualifications are [stated to be](http://www.byregion.net/chinese%20medicine/HealerPages/8/cp/.) PhD, MBAcC, FRCHM. But in similar vein he describes himself thus \"I am one of the West's leading experts on Chinese medical formulas and treatment strategies\". Although Scheid sells acupuncture treatments to patients, he seems ro be more anthropologist than medical. In a discussion of two acupuncture papers \"From the Perspective of the Anthropologist - Volker Scheid, London, UK From a perspective anchored in the cultural studies of science, technology and medicine my main interest in these papers is their status as cultural artifacts that provide access to the lifeworlds of a particular research community. If any, life-world debate and argument marks sites of contestation.\" [Forsch Komplement\u00e4rmed 2007;14:371-375] Scheid shows not the slightest interest in whether acupuncture works other than as a placebo. Since he is selling acupuncture, he presumably starts from the premise that it works. Volker Scheid has had a \u00a3205,000 Wellcome Trust for the History of Medicine Project Grant: 2009 2012; Treating the Liver: Towards a Transnational History of East Asian Medicine; There's nothing wrong with writing the history of long-outdated systems of medicine, though one could hardly imagine that the history would be very impartial, when it is written by a true believer. Another taste of his style can be found in his paper on [Globalising Chinese Medical Understandings of Menopause](http://www.volkerscheid.co.uk/downloads/EASTS_Menopaus_Article.pdf). There is lots of rather pretentious stuff about culture, but very little about what actually works, Towards the end of the paper we come to the usual feeble excuse. \" . . once traditional medicines allow themselves to be evaluated by biomedical research methods, the odds against receiving fair treatment are heavily stacked against them.\" The translation of that into plain English is something like 'when we test our treatments properly we find they don't work, so we blame the methods and carry on with selling them anyway'. Judging from its web site, [EASTmedicine](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/research/research-groups/eastmedicine#Summary) does not to do any serious clinical trials to test whether the treaments work in man, They just know that they do. But they are hoping to add some spurious scientific background to their dubious claims by hiring someone to do compuations that will cast no light whatsoever on the question that really matters, Do they work or not? The agenda is made clear by [the statement](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/research/research-groups/eastmedicine#Summary) EASTmedicine seeks to describe and analyse the dynamics of these transformations with a specific view of managing their integration into contemporary health care. So it is just yet another group of people pushing to have unproven and disproved treatments accepted by real medicine. The University of Westminster appears to be determined to make itself the laughing stock by persisting in promoting junk science at a time when most other universities have realise that the harm done to their reputations is not worth the income it generates, Plenty of it has been [revealed here](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22). The vice-chancellor of Westminster, Prof Geoffrey Petts, made into the pages of Private Eye (see [Crystal balls. Professor Petts in Private Eye](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1153) when he announced that he wouldn't get rid of the junk, but would make it more 'scientific'. Well, credit where it's due, They have [dropped homeopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329). see [The last BSc (Hons) Homeopathy closes! But look at what they still teach at Westminster University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) For 2010 they still off [ten different \"BSc (Hons)\" degrees](http://courses.westminster.ac.uk/CourseSearch.aspx) in pre-scientific forms of medicine. It will take more than a bit od talk about systems biology to make anyone believe that these courses have anything to do with science. For example, look at some slides from their lectures on \"energy medicine\", the of Westminster. This time it's Naturopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812) , or [Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) The Dean of the School of the Life Sciences, [Jane Lewis](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/staff/dean-of-the-school), is an entirely respectable marine biologist. She has had the thankless task of merging the real science with the alternative medicine in a single school. I phoned her to get a reaction \" outcome of merger of the school and trying to bring various parts of the school together\" \" \"things are much more rigorous than they were\". DC: \"Why don't you just phase it out?\" \"I'm not in a poition to do that. i move things forward as seems best -for the whole school I have to say\". We're retaining those bits thatI think have some good standing -I see NICE has approved the use of acupuncture for lower back pain and some other bits and pieces so I see acupuncture as something that does have some standing, andwe make sure it rigorously taught\" \"DCHave you looked at the stuff on naturopathy?\" \"Are amethysts emit high Yin energy still taught?\" \" i don't think so\". [It seems, as so often in this case, that the senior people don't really know what's being taught under their noses. Prof](http://www.fixingproteomics.org/) Lewis says she has not read about the [background to the (unusually) daft advice from NICE](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593). Neither has she read [Barker Bausell's book](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell)on acupuncture research. If she had done any of these things,I suspect she would not have such a high opinion of it as appears to be the case. Bait and switch. Astonishingly there is a now a whole organisation devoted to the respectabalisation of Traditional Chinese Medicine [Good Practice in Traditional Chinese Medicine Research in the Post-genomic Era](http://www.gp-tcm.org/) It sounds nice and sciencey but, as usual, they are trying to run before they can walk. The first thing has to be to do good clinical trials to find out if there is anything there to be investigated. If, and only if, this is the case, would there be any case for fancy talk about \"proteomics\" and \"the post-genomic era\". I do hope that no funding agency would be fooled into parting with money on the basis of the present vacuous rhetoric. Professor Lewis said that I have I have quoted things like \" [amethysts emit high Yin energy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227)\" out of context. There is a simple solution to that. I have asked Westminster to make available the entire contents of the courses. Then we shall all be able to see the context of what their sudents are being taught. Follow up A brief report of this matter has appeared in [Times Higher Education](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=413176&c=1). In a statement, the University of Westminster says \"its research into Chinese medicine is following the lead of \"top research institutions\". I'm not aware of anyhting quite like this from anywhere else. In any case, Westminster should be able to think for themselves. There is something very offensive about the idea that a 'bachelor of science' degree can be awarded by a university, as a prize for memorising gobbledygook. Once the contents of the 'degrees' has been exposed to public ridicule, many universities have stopped doing it. All (or nearly all) of these pseudo-degrees have closed at the [University of Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885), the [University Central Lancashire](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485), [Robert Gordon the of Buckingham](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881), and even at the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) (the worst offender), one course has closed (with rumours of more to follow). | | I've already written about the course in Traditional Chinese Medicine at the University of Salford ( One place that has yet to come under close scrutiny is | | Michael Driscoll, VC of Middlesex University. The buck stops with him. Their \"Complementary Health\" courses are as follows (April 2010). [Complementary Health Sciences (Ayurveda) Degree, BSc Honours](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/complementary_health/complementary_health_sciences_Ayurveda_bsc.aspx) [Herbal Degree, BSc Honours](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/complementary_health/traditional_chinese_medicine_bsc.aspx) and also two postgraduate courses I asked Middlesex University for samples of their teaching materials under the Freedom of Information Act, and, as usual, the request was refused. As usual, I then asked for the mandatory internal review of the decision, and this time, most unusually, the internal review did not confirm the initial refusal and I was sent a bundle of teaching materials about Chinese Herbal Medicine, It was not all I asked for, but it is quite enough to show the absurd ideas that are still being taught as part of bachelor of Science degree in a UK University. Not only are the ideas absurd, pre-scientific, indeed antiscientific. They are also dangerous. People who have been taught this nonsense are going out and being let loose on sick people. The vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, [Professor Michael Driscoll](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/Executive/index.aspx), is an economist, not a biologist. Surely you don't need to be a scientist to feel a bit suspicious when you read on the Middlesex web site about Traditional Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion including distribution of meridians-collaterals and location of acupoints; needling and moxibustion techniques; Have any of the members of [the Executive](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/Executive/index.aspx) ever thought to ask about what goes on in these courses? Even if it is beyond an economist to see through the nonsense, surely it should be possible for Professor Margaret House, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Academic, whose interests lie in water quality, should be able to, though as Dean of the School of Health and Social Sciences she appears to sponsor the nonsense. And Professor Waqar Ahmad, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research and Enterprise, who has written a s book on Ethnicity, Health and Health Care, should surely be able to distinguish sense from nonsense in health care? In that respect, I'd have less confidence in Katie Bell, Chief Marketing Officer, who joined Middlesex University in 2009 following a career in brand marketing for Nestl\u00e9 UK and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Marketing people seldom have much regard for truth. Have any of the [University's Governors](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/governors/Biographies/index.aspx) ever asked what is going on in their name? It's true that none of the long list of distinguished-sounding governors is a scientist. Surely you don't need to be to question whether or not what follows can be described as 'science'. My guess is that none of these distinguished people has ever bothered to look at the dangerous nonsense that is being taught in their University. It is not in the nature of 'managers' to look far beyond ticked-boxes and profit, They should have done of course, but to make it easier for them, here is a small selection of the slides that I was sent (the copyright for them lies with the university: these few slides come under the heading ' 'fair quotation' and it is undoubtedly in the public interest to show them). Course CMH 1211 e Uhuh, my spleen qi is well and truly knotted already though when I learned physiology it was not thought that the spleen had much to do with emotions. Ah so at least the problem of heavy breathers is solved. But high temperature, abdominal pain and abnormal pulse can be signs of serious illness. If your only explanation for them is \"preponderant evil Qi\", you are a menace to public health. All these symptoms could be the result of a serious disease. It is not only antiquated nonsense to talk about them in terms of Yin, Yang and Qi. It endangers people, Course CMH 2212 Chinese materia medica. Some of the herbs are likely to contain active ingredients (indeed some are very dangerous). It would be quite possible to study the ingredients of these herbs and to investigate how they work in the light of what has been learned about physiology and pharmacology in the last 200 years. Pharmacology has a long history of doing that, But is seems to play no part in this course. Herbs are \"cold\" or \"hot\" and may \"check the exuberance of yang\". and so on, just preposterous, made-up nonsense from another era. If it were taught as cultural history, it might be interesting. But it is being taught as though it were true, and an appropriate way to treat sick people. Course CMH 3214 Would you trust your child to someone who'd been taught that \"causes of paediatric diseases are relatively simple\", and \"children are pure yang\"? Now some Chinese recipes Course CMH 3100 This may or may not taste good, but to recommend it for diabetes is seriously irresponsible. The programme specification for the \"BSc (Hons) Traditonal Chinese medicine\" can be [found here](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/Assets/BSc%20_Hons_%20Traditional%20Chinese%20Medicine%C2%A0%2018.pdf). [local copy [download](/mdx-tcm.pdf)] It is written with all the official trappings, just as though the degree was about science. It isn't. It is a danger to public health. I have asked the vice-chancellor, Michael Driscoll, to express his view of these comments Follow-up A rather unexpected comment from [a London acupuncturist](http://acupuncture.blog.co.uk/2010/04/12/dc-s-improbable-science-blog-dangerous-chinese-medicine-taught-at-university-8352795/). \"At least,I knew that Professor David Colquhoun is very skeptical about Chinese medicine. he comment Chinese medicine study\"not only are the ideas absurd, pre-scientific, indeed antiscientific. They are also dangerous. People who have been taught this nonsense are going out and being let loose on sick people.\" \" \"But,I still like to read his blog as His article very is respectable. I think. Look this...\" The skeptic blog featured this post in its [weekly roundup](http://skeptic.org.uk/news/2010/2545). 27 May 2010. [Times Higher Education reported](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411780) the decision of Middlesex University to close its philosophy department. This department seems to have a [remarkable reputation](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411482), not least for a post-1992 university. Three academics and four students have been suspended and gagged in classical bullying style. This has happened while they continue to teach dangerous rubbish like that described above. I left [a comment at Times Higher](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411780), as follows. It is a reflection on the quality of university management that Middlesex has chosen to shut its philosophy department while continuing to run degrees in quackery. These courses not only offer an Hons BSc for memorising chunks of anti-scientific nonsense. They also pose a real danger to patients. See http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923 I can think of no better illustration than this of the crass nature of the judgements made by Middlesex's management. They are either ignorant of what constitutes science, or they are corrupt. I see no other possibilities. In either case they should not be running a university. I think Prof Michael Driscoll owes the world an explanation. Snow on December 18th Roaring fire Lindy contributes acute comments regularly here. She is also an accomplished musician.
