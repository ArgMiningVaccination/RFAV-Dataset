After performing a needs assessment of some of the most economically disadva ntaged communities in Chicago, they chose to focus on the Pilsen and Little Village communities. These areas were the most densely populated and least formally educated neighborhoods in the city with over 10,000 high sc hool age adolescents and limited access to educational opportunity. The Jesuits identified education as the greatest way to help this struggling community and, in 1996, Cristo Rey Jesuit High Sc hool opened for 79 local students who would not otherwise have the financial means to pursue a challenging, private, college preparatory education. To make the school affordable and sustainable, Cristo Rey pioneered the Corporate Work Study Program (CWSP) model for inner-city education that has since inspired a national network of 30 schools serv ing low-income urban communities across the country. The CWSP enables all students to earn a majority of their annual tuition by working one day a week at an entry-level position for a corporation or nonprofit agency in the Chicago area. Today, there are over 1,600 Cristo Rey Jesuit High Sc hool alumni. In the class of 2015, 100% of seniors were accepted to at least one college or university.

The first is the actual expense from customer accounts that remain 3 uncollected 90 days after their account has moved to a final status (note that a final status indicates that they are no longer a customer).4 The second component is the reserve for uncollectible accounts. Each month the reserve is calculated to determine the collectability5 of the accounts receivable portfolio. This value is compared to the amount reserved in the previous month and the difference used 6 to adjust the actual account expense. This total is then recorded as the total uncollectible accounts expense. 7 Outside Collection Agency Expenses 8 Expenses for outside collection agencies for the year 2017 are $1,068,581. The jurisdictional portion of the 2017 total Company 9 amount is estimated to be $704,000 Total Company expenses for outside collection agencies were: $1,296,882; $1,583,007; and $1,964,075 10 for the years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Final bill agencies receive accounts that 3 have not paid their final bills from ComEd at Day 35 in the collection process stream. These agencies are given 120 days to work the accounts through their4 processes to attempt collection. If the agency is successful in retrieving money owed, they are paid a commission. If unsuccessful, the account is retrieved 5 by ComEd and charged off (written off). Charge-off agencies receive the charged-off accounts the day after they are written off. Currently these agencies work 6 the written-off accounts until ComEd retrieves them for some other type of treatment such as debt sale. These agencies differ from final bill agencies in the 7 time frame in which they are allowed to work the accounts and their overall commission incentives. In an effort to increase recoveries, both tiers have the 8 ability to report delinquent customers to credit bureaus, after following the FDPPA (Federal Debt Protection Practices Act) guidelines. 9 Collection Agency Results: 10 In 2017, 155,014 accounts with a total value of $64.6 million was sent to final bill agencies.

For item (i) above, \"any service that has been declared to be competitive pursuant to Section 16-113 of this Act\", ComEd notes that service for customers with peak demand of 100 kilowatts and above was declared competitive in accordan ce with the Illinois Commerce Commission's Or der in Docket No. 07-0478 issued pursuant to Section 16-113 of the Act, as amended by P ublic Act 095-481 which was enacted August 28, 2007. With respect to item (ii) above, \"contract service\", Section 16-102 of the Act provides that \"contract service\" means (1) services, in cluding the provision of electric power and energy or other services, that are provided by mutual agreement between an electric utility and a retail customer that is located in the electric utility's service area, provided that, delivery services shall no t be a contract service until such services are declared competitive pursuant to Section 16-113; and also means (2) the provision of electric power and energy by an electric utility to reta il customers outside th e electric utility's service area pursuant to Section 16-116. Provided, however, contract service does not include electric utility services provided pursuant to (i) contracts that retail customers are required to execute as a condition of receiving tariffed services, or (ii) special or negotiated rate contracts for electric utility se rvices that were entered into between an electric utility and a retail customer prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1997 and filed with the Commission. Thus, ComEd states that no customers took \"contract service\" as defined above. For item (iii) above, \"services, other than tariffed services, that are related to, but not necessary for, the provision of electric power and energy or delivery services\", ComEd states that no such services were provid ed. ComEd also notes that other non-utility services are listed in Schedule C-32.
