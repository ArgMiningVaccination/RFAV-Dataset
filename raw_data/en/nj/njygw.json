We aimed to determine whether vitamin D supplements might boost the immunogenicity and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination by conducting three sub-studies nested within the CORONAVIT randomised controlled trial, which investigated the effects of offering vitamin D supplements at a dose of 800 IU/day or 3200 IU/day vs. no offer on risk of acute respiratory infections in UK adults with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <75 nmol/L. Sub-study 1 (n = 2808) investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection following two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Sub-study 2 (n = 1853) investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on titres of combined IgG, IgA and IgM (IgGAM) anti-Spike antibodies in eluates of dried blood spots collected after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Sub-study 3 (n = 100) investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on neutralising antibody and cellular responses in venous blood samples collected after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In total, 1945/2808 (69.3%) sub-study 1 participants received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca); the remainder received two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer). Mean follow-up 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly elevated in the 800 IU/day vs. no-offer group (82.5 vs. 53.6 nmol/L; mean difference 28.8 nmol/L, 95% CI 22.8-34.8) and in the 3200 IU/day vs. no offer group (105.4 vs. 53.6 nmol/L; mean difference 51.7 nmol/L, 45.1-58.4). Vitamin D supplementation did not influence the risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated participants (800 IU/day vs. no offer: adjusted hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.84; 3200 IU/day vs. no offer: 1.17, 0.81 to 1.70). Neither did it influence IgGAM anti-Spike titres, neutralising antibody titres or IFN- concentrations in the supernatants of S peptide-stimulated whole blood. In conclusion, vitamin D replacement at a dose of 800 or 3200 IU/day effectively elevated 25(OH)D concentrations, but it did not influence the protective efficacy or immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination when given to adults who had a sub-optimal vitamin D status at baseline.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-09-16", "cleaned_text": "Vitamin D Supplementation Does Not Influence SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Efficacy or Immunogenicity: Sub-Studies Nested within the CORONAVIT Randomised Controlled Trial [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14183821](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14183821) of Vitamin Respiratory Disease]( Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-nutrients-14-03821)]. Identification of with the potential to augment SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity is therefore a research priority [ [2](#B2-nutrients-14-03821)]. Sub-optimal responses to vaccination against other pathogens in older adults are causally associated with increased systemic inflammation, termed 'inflammaging' [ [3](#B3-nutrients-14-03821)]. Increased production of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes and macrophages is a key driver of this process [ [4](#B4-nutrients-14-03821)], and the pharmacological inhibition of these pathways by blocking p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase or the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been shown to augment antigen-specific immunity [ [5](#B5-nutrients-14-03821), [6](#B6-nutrients-14-03821), [7](#B7-nutrients-14-03821)]. [8](#B8-nutrients-14-03821)]. The active vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D) has been shown to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes and macrophages by targeting MAP kinase phosphatase 1 [ [9](#B9-nutrients-14-03821)], to regulate the mTOR pathway [ [10](#B10-nutrients-14-03821)] and to support classical T cell receptor signalling and T cell activation by inducing phospholipase C-gamma 1 in na\u00efve T cells [ [11](#B11-nutrients-14-03821)]. Sub-optimal vitamin D status, as indicated by low circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D, the major circulating vitamin D metabolite) is common among older adults, and this associates with increased systemic inflammation [ [12](#B12-nutrients-14-03821), [13](#B13-nutrients-14-03821)]. An experimental study has demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation significantly increased the response to the cutaneous varicella zoster virus (VZV) antigen challenge in older adults with circulating 25(OH)D concentrations less than 75 nmol/L [ [14](#B14-nutrients-14-03821)]. This enhancement was associated with a reduction in early inflammatory monocyte infiltration with a concomitant enhancement of T cell recruitment to the site of the antigen challenge. [15](#B15-nutrients-14-03821), [16](#B16-nutrients-14-03821)]. Several observational studies have investigated associations between vitamin D status and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity, but these have yielded conflicting results: some report higher post-vaccination titres of anti-Spike antibodies in individuals using vitamin D supplements or having higher circulating 25(OH)D concentrations [ [17](#B17-nutrients-14-03821), [18](#B18-nutrients-14-03821)], but others have yielded null findings [ [19](#B19-nutrients-14-03821), [20](#B20-nutrients-14-03821)]. An opportunity to investigate this question using an interventional study design arose when we conducted a phase 3 randomised controlled trial of vitamin D supplements for prevention of acute respiratory infection in UK adults (CORONAVIT) [ [21](#B21-nutrients-14-03821)]. The intervention period for this study coincided with the rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination over Winter-Spring 2020-21; a period when sub-optimal vitamin D status was highly prevalent in the UK [ [22](#B22-nutrients-14-03821)]. We therefore nested three sub-studies within the trial to investigate the effects of vitamin D replacement on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy, post-vaccination titres of anti-Spike antibodies in dried spot eluates and post-vaccination neutralising antibody titres and antigen-specific cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 in venous blood. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design [21](#B21-nutrients-14-03821)]. Sub-study 1 (vaccine efficacy analysis) investigated the influence of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompetent trial participants who received two doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine during follow-up. Sub-study 2 (dried blood spot analysis) investigated the effects of vitamin D supplements on combined IgG, IgA and IgM (IgGAM) antibody responses to the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 measured in dried blood spot eluates. Sub-study 3 (venous blood analysis) investigated the effects of vitamin D supplements on neutralising antibody and cellular responses. [17](#B17-nutrients-14-03821), [21](#B21-nutrients-14-03821)]. Briefly, 6200 UK residents aged 16 years or older and participating in the COVIDENCE UK study [ [23](#B23-nutrients-14-03821)] were individually randomised to receive an offer of a postal vitamin D test, followed by higher-dose (3200 IU/day; n = 1550) or lower-dose (800 IU/day; n = 1550) vitamin D supplementation if their blood 25(OH)D concentration was found to be less than 75 nmol/L, or to receive no offer of vitamin D testing or supplementation (n = 3100), with a 1:1:2 allocation ratio. Treatment allocation was not concealed, and randomisation was not stratified. All participants who received at least two doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were invited to provide a postal dried blood spot sample for the determination of combined IgGAM antibody responses to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, as described below. A subset of 101 trial participants also provided a venous blood sample for the determination of neutralising antibody and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. The trial was sponsored by Queen Mary University of London, approved by the Queens Square Research Ethics Committee, London, UK (ref 20/HRA/5095) and registered with [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://ClinicalTrials.gov)(NCT04579640) on 8 October 2020, before enrolment of the first participant on 28 October 2020. 2.2. Participants 2.3. Randomisation [21](#B21-nutrients-14-03821)]. 2.4. Intervention [24](#B24-nutrients-14-03821)]. Those found to have a 25(OH)D concentration below 75 nmol/L were then posted a 6-month supply of capsules containing either 800 IU or 3200 IU vitamin D3, according to their allocation. Participants were supplied with D-Pearls capsules of either strength, manufactured by Pharma Nord Ltd. (Vejle, Denmark), unless they expressed a preference for a vegetarian or vegan supplement, in which case they were supplied with Pro D3 vegan capsules manufactured by Synergy Biologics Ltd. (Walsall, UK). Participants with 25(OH)D concentrations of 75 nmol/L or more at initial testing were offered a second postal vitamin D test 2 months after the first test: those whose second 25(OH)D concentration was found to be less than 75 nmol/L were offered a postal supply of supplements as above. Participants receiving study supplements were instructed to take one capsule per day until their supply was exhausted. The administration of study supplements was not supervised. 2.5. Follow-Up Assessments [21](#B21-nutrients-14-03821)]. Every monthly questionnaire contained the following advice to encourage participants with COVID-19 symptoms to engage with testing services: \"If you currently have symptoms of coronavirus (a high temperature, a new, continuous cough or loss of or altered sense of smell or taste), call NHS111 or visit [https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/)(accessed on 17 August 2022) for more information.\" This wording was identical for questionnaires sent to participants randomised to intervention or no-offer groups. In addition to monthly questionnaires, an online adherence questionnaire was sent to all participants randomised to either offer on 31 March 2021. This questionnaire captured information regarding the frequency of study supplement use. End-trial postal vitamin D testing was offered to a randomly selected subset of 1600 participants who received study supplements (800 participants from each intervention group) and 400 who were randomised to no offer. Participants randomised to no offer who were found to have end-trial total 25(OH)D concentrations below 50 nmol/L were posted a 60-day supply of capsules, each containing 2500 IU vitamin D3 (Cytoplan Ltd. Worcestershire, England). 2.6. Laboratory Assays 25(OH)D Testing [24](#B24-nutrients-14-03821)] and summed to give total 25(OH)D concentrations. Very good overall agreement between blood spot and plasma 25(OH)D concentrations in paired capillary and venous samples using this blood spot method has been observed [ [24](#B24-nutrients-14-03821)], demonstrating a minimal overall bias of 0.2% with a bias range of 16.9% to 26.7%. Total 25(OH)D concentrations lower than 75 nmol/L were defined as sub-optimal: this threshold is widely considered to discriminate between those with lower vs. higher vitamin D status [ [25](#B25-nutrients-14-03821), [26](#B26-nutrients-14-03821), [27](#B27-nutrients-14-03821)]. The between-day coefficients 127.3 nmol/L for 25(OH)D2. The mean bias of dried blood spot vs. serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations over the period 2018 to 2021 was 4.0% and the limits of quantitation were 7.5 for RT-PCR-confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19 [ [28](#B28-nutrients-14-03821)], and has been validated as a correlate of protection against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection in two populations [ [29](#B29-nutrients-14-03821), [30](#B30-nutrients-14-03821)]. A cut-off ratio relative to the TBS cut-off calibrators was determined by plotting 624 pre-2019 negatives in a frequency histogram. A cut-off coefficient was then established for IgGAM (1.31), with ratio values classed as positive (1) or negative (<1). Dried blood spot eluates were pre-diluted 1:40 microplate reader (Dynex Technologies; Chantilly, VA, USA). Plates were developed after 10 min using 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine core, and orthophosphoric acid used as a stop solution (both TBS). Optical densities at 450 nm were measured using the Dynex Revelation. 2.6.3. PBMC Stimulation Assay 2.6.8. Flow Cytometric Analysis 2.7. Outcomes 2.8.

[17](#B17-nutrients-14-03821)]: age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, days from second vaccine dose to DBS sample, pre-vaccination serostatus, general health, inter-dose interval and primary vaccination course. For ease of interpretation, estimated GMRs were expressed as adjusted percentage differences. For immunological outcomes, correction for multiple comparisons was performed on families of pairwise p-values using the Benjamini and Hochberg method with a false discovery rate of 5% [ [33](#B33-nutrients-14-03821)]. 3. Results 3.1. Participants [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-03821-f001)). [Table 1](#nutrients-14-03821-t001)shows the baseline characteristics of participants included in the vaccine efficacy analysis (sub-study 1) by allocation. The median age was 61.9 years, 65.8% were female and 96.4% were of White ethnic origin. Among the participants whose baseline vitamin D status was tested, the mean 25(OH)D concentration was 39.9 nmol/L, and all had 25(OH)D concentrations below 75 nmol/L. Characteristics were balanced between the three trial arms, except for the proportions of participants with pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection (4.2 vs. 5.9 vs. 2.9% in no offer vs. 800 IU/day vs. 3200 IU/day arms, respectively). [Tables S1 and S2 of the Supplementary Materials](#app1-nutrients-14-03821), respectively: these were also balanced between trial arms. Among participants for whom end-study measurements of vitamin D status were available, mean follow-up 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly elevated in the lower-dose vs. no-offer group (82.5 (standard deviation 18.9) vs. nmol/L; mean difference 28.8 nmol/L, 95% CI 22.8-34.8) and in the higher-dose vs. no offer group (105.4 (23.5) vs. Infection [Figure 3](#nutrients-14-03821-f003)A,B). The results were similar when pooling data from both intervention arms (any offer vs. no offer: 153 (106-192) vs. 161 (131-193) days to infection, aHR 1.24, 0.89-1.71, p = 0.20; [Figure 3](#nutrients-14-03821-f003)C). Consistent with these findings, the proportions of participants experiencing a breakthrough infection did not differ by allocation ( [Table S3, Supplementary Materials](#app1-nutrients-14-03821)). Five cases of COVID-19 (three in the 3200 vitamin D group and two controls) precipitated hospitalization, and none were fatal. 3.3. Immunological Outcomes [Table 2](#nutrients-14-03821-t002), [Figure 2](#nutrients-14-03821-f002)B) or when pooled data from both intervention arms were compared to the no-offer arm ( [Table S4, Supplementary Materials](#app1-nutrients-14-03821)). Neither was there any inter-arm difference in the proportions of participants with detectable post-vaccination anti-S IgGAM antibodies ( [Table S3, Supplementary Materials](#app1-nutrients-14-03821)). In the subset of participants who provided a venous blood sample for analysis, we found no significant inter-arm differences in mean neutralising antibody titres or in any antigen-specific cellular response investigated after correction for multiple testing, either when lower-dose or higher-dose arms were compared separately to the no-offer arm ( [Table 2](#nutrients-14-03821-t002), [Figure 2](#nutrients-14-03821-f002)C,D) or when pooled data from both intervention arms were compared to the no-offer arm ( [Table S4, Supplementary Materials](#app1-nutrients-14-03821)). 4. Discussion [19](#B19-nutrients-14-03821), [20](#B20-nutrients-14-03821)], but contrast with findings from two others that report positive results [ [17](#B17-nutrients-14-03821), [18](#B18-nutrients-14-03821)]. Of these, one reported an association between higher post-vaccination anti-S titres and circulating 25(OH)D concentrations of more than 50 nmol/L in a cohort of health care workers [ [18](#B18-nutrients-14-03821)]. The other, a population-based study conducted in UK adults, found an independent association between vitamin D supplement use and the reduced risk of anti-S seronegativity following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination [ [17](#B17-nutrients-14-03821)]. These positive associations may have arisen as a result of unmeasured or residual confounding, or type 1 error. The fact that no inter-arm difference in anti-S titres was seen in the current study supports the interpretation that the null result from the current analysis is valid, since it is biologically implausible that vitamin D would affect the proportion of seronegative participants but not the mean anti-S titre. The null findings presented here also contrast with the results of our previous intervention study [ [14](#B14-nutrients-14-03821)], in which we showed that vitamin D replacement in older adults with baseline 25(OH)D levels below 75 nmol/L boosted antigen-specific immunity and reduced inflammatory responses to a cutaneous VZV antigen challenge. Divergent findings between these two intervention studies may reflect differences in the compartment studied (peripheral blood vs. skin), immunological stimulus (SARS-CoV-2 vaccination vs. VZV antigen challenge) or the regimen of vitamin D administered (800 or 3200 IU/day for at least 1 month vs. 6400 IU/day for 14 weeks before stimulation).
