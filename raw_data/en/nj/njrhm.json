During my training, I developed a strong interest in pulmonology and sleep physiology, which drew me to these two specialty areas. As a pediatric pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist, I believe that healthy sleep is essential to overall wellness and that caring for a sick child means caring for their whole family. To provide holistic care, it's essential not only to treat the child's illness but to care for the child's support system as well. Lung disease during childhood impacts lung growth and long-term lung function. As a pediatric pulmonologist, my role is to treat lung disease during childhood and prevent decline in lung function during adulthood. In my practice, I focus on the following: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have funded my research for the last 15 years, and I have multiple awards from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Through my work, I want to understand the mechanisms of breathing disorders during sleep and the maturation of ventilatory control during childhood. I speak English, Arabic, French and Italian. In my free time, I enjoy reading French literature and listening to classical music. I also have a passion for photography, especially nature photos. MD: Aim Shams University, Cairo Egypt, 1978.
