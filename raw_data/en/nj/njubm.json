To investigate the roleof nnAbs on HIV-1 infection in vivo, we devised a replication-competent HIV-1 reporter virus that expresses a heterologous HA-tag on the surfaceof infected cells and virions. Anti-HA antibodiesbind to, but do not neutralize, the reporter virusin vitro. However, anti-HA protects against infectionin humanized mice and strongly selects for nnAb-resistant viruses in an entirely Fc-dependent manner.Similar results were also obtained with tier 2 HIV-1 viruses using a human anti-gp41 nnAb, 246D. While nnAbs are demonstrably less effective than broadlyneutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 in vitroand in vivo, the data show that nnAbs can protectagainst and alter the course of HIV-1 infection in vivo. INTRODUCTION The HIV-1 virus encodes a single surface protein, gp160. The spike is a trimer of furin-cleaved gp160s, each of which is composed of two non-covalently associated subunits, gp41 and gp120. The cellular receptor CD4 binds to gp120, leading to disso-ciation of the trimer and exposing epitopes commonly targeted by non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) against HIV-1 Env. Nearly all HIV-1-infected individuals develop nnAbs early in the course of infection. The initial response is typically directed against gp41 and later evolves to include gp120 ( Tomaraset al., 2008 ). After a variable period, usually measured in years, a fraction of infected individuals goes on to develop potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which have been shownto target a number of epitopes on the trimer ( Klein et al., 2013b ). The unusual delay between infection and bNAb development, and the difculty in eliciting them by immunization, is explainedin large part by their extraordinary levels of somatic mutations (Andris et al., 1991; Escolano et al., 2017; Klein et al., 2013a; Moran et al., 1993; Scheid et al., 2009 ). bNAbs neutralize a diverse collection of HIV-1 strains in vitro and can confer protection against infection in mice and ma- caques ( Balazs et al., 2016; ; reviewed in Pegu et al., 2017 ). Moreover, they can suppress established viremia in experimental animals and in humans ( Caskey et al., 2015, 2017; Horwitz et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2012; Scheid et al., 2016 ; reviewed in Margolis et al., 2017 ). In contrast, nnAbs do not neutralize HIV-1 in vitro and have variable activity in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity(ADCC) assays in vitro ( Bruel et 2014; Holl al., 2006; Kramski et al., 2013; ). In the RV144 trial, induction of nnAbs capable of mediatingADCC in vitro was associated with decreased transmission risk(Haynes et al., 2012; Liao et al., 2013 ). However, there is little direct evidence that nnAbs exert selective pressure on HIV-1 during infection in vivo ( Burton et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2011; Santra et al., 2015 ). Vaccination studies in non-human primates (NHP) have suggested a role for non-neutralizing immune re- sponses in protection against SIV or SHIV infection, but a causallink has not been proven experimentally (reviewed in Lewis et al., 2017 ). In these NHP studies, different vaccination strategies induced nnAb responses that correlated with protection frominfection ( Elsevier Inc. 637Hidajat et al., 2009 ). However, these studies did not characterize the mechanisms of protection, and virus resistance to nnAbs was not investigated. Finally, passive-transfer studies with high doses of potent monoclonal nnAbs failed to demonstrate protec-tion ( Burton et al., 2011; Santra et al., 2015 ). Thus, although nnAbs remain the only correlate of the modest level of protection against infection observed in the RV144 vaccine trial conducted in Thailand ( Bonsignori et al., Haynes et al., 2013; Zolla-Pazner et al., 2014 ), how nnAbs might have contributed to protection remains unclear. Here, we report on experiments that explore whether nnAbs can influence the course of HIV-1 infection in vivo, and we dene the mechanisms by which they do so.RESULTS Replication-Competent Indicator Virus To examine the effects of nnAbs on HIV-1 infection, we engi-neered a recombinant HIV-1 reporter virus (HIVivoHA) express-ing a heterologous surface marker, mCD24/heat-stable antigen (HSA) bearing a hemagglutinin tag (HA-tag), and adapted it to replicate in humanized mice (hu-mice) ( Figures 1 A and S1). The HA-tag is anchored to the membrane of HIVivoHA virions and infected cells by the transmembrane domain of HSA and it is entirely independent of HIV-1 Env. Accordingly, a humanizedIgG1 anti-HA-tag antibody (anti-HA) ( Churchill et 1994 ) that stains HIVivoHA-infected cells ( Figure S1 C) exhibited no A C B DEF Figure 1.

Each horizontal gray bar repres ents the sequence of a single sequence aligned to HIVivoHA; black tick marks indicate nucleotide changes relative to HIVivoHA. Numbering at the bottom corres ponds to the nucleotide position in Cell170, activity against the virus in TZM-bl assays in vitro, even at concentrations as high as 50 mg/mL ( Figure 1 B). Finally, hu-mice infected with HIVivoHA sustain infection with the indi- cator virus at high viral loads for periods of at least 39 days(Figure S1 H). nnAbs Clear Infected Cells and Protect against Infection in Hu-MiceTo determine whether anti-HA enhances clearance of HIVivoHA- infected cells in vivo, we performed adoptive transfer experi- ments ( Lu et al., 2016 ) of cells infected with the indicator virus in the presence or absence of anti-HA antibody. Anti-HA anti- body directed near-complete clearance of HIVivoHA-infected cells from the mice within 5 hr ( Figure 1 C), as would be expected for antibody-driven, Fc-dependent clearance of cells bearing a highly expressed surface antigen ( Smith et al., 2012 ). By contrast, a modied anti-HA that carries mutations that abrogatebinding to activating Fc receptors (anti-HA:GRLR) ( Pietzsch et al., 2012 ) failed to clear HIVivoHA-infected cells, and the percentage of HA +Gag+cells was comparable to the percentage seen in untreated mice. Thus, anti-HA, which is a nnAb, can clearHIV-1-infected cells in vivo in an Fc receptor-dependent manner (Figure 1 C). To determine whether a nnAb can affect the course of viral infection in vivo, we established HIVivoHA infection in hu-mice and then treated with anti-HA or anti-HA:GRLR. Effects on viral load after anti-HA administration were modest ( Figure 1 D). How- ever, flow cytometry showed that infected cells from anti-HA-treated animals were devoid of surface HA expression, while anti-HA:GRLR-treated animals retained HA ( Figure 1 E). Single- genome sequencing of plasma viruses revealed that loss ofHA expression in anti-HA-treated mice was due to mutation or deletion of the HSA-HA cassette. In contrast, the HA cassette remained intact in most viruses isolated from anti-HA:GRLR-treated animals, indicating an Fc-dependent mechanism of selection ( Figure 1 F). Thus, anti-HA imposes selective pressureon HIV-1 by an Fc-dependent mechanism that leads to predom- inance of anti-HA-resistant viruses. To determine whether nnAbs can also prevent HIV-1 infection in hu-mice, we administered anti-HA or anti-HA:GRLR tohu-mice 1 day before and 1 day after challenge with HIVivoHA.Whereas all mice receiving no treatment or anti-HA:GRLR became viremic, a majority (55%) of animals treated with anti-HA were protected from HIVivoHA infection ( Figure 2 ). The 45% of anti-HA-treated mice that did become viremic did so with delayed onset, after the serum antibody concentrations had waned, and the emerging viruses had lost the HA expressioncassette ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Thus, anti-HA protected against HIVivoHA infection and blocked the outgrowth of HA-expressing viruses in hu-mice. We conclude that nnAbs can prevent infec-tion when they target a highly expressed surface epitope, albeitto a lesser extent than bNAbs ( Balazs et Burton et al., 2016; Halper-Stromberg et al., 2014; Shingai et al., 2014 ), and do so entirely an Fc receptor-medi- ated mechanism. A Patient-Derived nnAb HIV-1 YU2 Infection in Hu-Mice nnAbs are among the rst antibodies to arise and are also the most prevalent antibodies found in infected individuals(Xu et al., 1991 ). Whether these antibodies influence the course of infection in vivo, and by which mechanism(s) they might do so, has not been studied directly. To determine whether apatient-derived nnAb can exert selective pressure on HIV-1infection, we screened for nnAbs that bind to HIV-1 YU2-infected CD4+T cells ( Figure 3 A). Monoclonal Ab 246D ( Xu et al., 1991 ), which is directed against a linear peptide in the immunodomi-nant cluster I region of gp41, exhibited the strongest binding (Figure 3 A). Antibodies to this region are known to be highly cross-clade reactive, binding to the surface of infected cellsand virus particles ( Nyambi et al., 2000; Zolla-Pazner et al., 1995 ). However, these antibodies do not bind to intact trimersAB C Figure 2.

Instead, they recognize gp41 stumps that are found on the surfaceof infected cells and viruses due to shed gp120 ( Moore et al., 2006 ). Although monoclonal Ab 246D does not neutralize HIV-1 YU2 in TZM-bl assays in vitro, even at concentrations of 50 mg/mL (Figure S2 A), it can block macrophage infection in vitro in an Fc receptor-dependent manner ( Holl et al., 2004, 2006 ). When tested in adoptive transfer experiments for its ability toaccelerate the clearance of infected cells in vivo, nnAb 246D exhibited modest, but signicant activity against HIV-1 YU2-infected cells ( Figure 3 B). To determine whether this nnAb can alter the course of HIV-1 infection, we rst administered246D or 246D:GRLR control antibodies to hu-mice with estab-lished HIV-1 YU2-infection. We found no detectable effects of either antibody on viral load ( Figure S2 C and S2D). However, single genome sequence analysis revealed a recurring mutationin the CD4 binding site of gp120 ( Kwong et al., 1998 ), R456K, in 246D-treated animals, but not in 246D:GRLR-treated or untreated animals ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Thus, antibody therapy with the nnAb 246D selects for a recurring mutation in HIV-1 YU2 in an Fc-dependent manner.A BC D Figure 3.

The numbers in the center denote the total number of R456K positive sequences over the number of August 10, 2017To determine whether 246D can also mediate selection during infection with primary isolates, we tested it against viruses carrying patient-derived transmitted-founder Envs(HIV-1 9004SS [Gnanakaran et al., 2010 ] and HIV-1 DU156 [ Li et al., 2006 ]) (Figure 4 ). 246D bound to cells infected with HIV-1 9004SS , but not to HIV-1 DU156 (Figure 4 A). We therefore tested whether 246D treatment would have an effect on HIV- 19004SS infection, but not on HIV-1 DU156 infection, in hu-mice. Similar to HIV-1 YU2infection, 246D had no impact on plasma viral load in mice infected with HIV-1 9004SS or HIV-1 DU156 (Fig- ure 4 B). However, single genome sequencing revealed that 246D selected for recurring mutations in HIV-1 9004SS , but not in the control virus, HIV-1 DU156 . Similar to 246D treatment in HIV-1 YU2-infection, HIV-1 9004SS -infected mice developed recur- ring mutations in gp120 at residue G366, which is also in the CD4 binding site ( Kwong et al., 1998 )(Figures 4 C and 4D). The observation that a nnAb to gp41 selected for mutations in the CD4bs in gp120 in both HIV-1 YU2and HIV-1 9004SS sug- gested a common mode of viral escape and prompted us toinvestigate the mechanisms by which such mutations might confer resistance to 246D.CD4bs Mutation Broadly Alters nnAb and bNAb Binding To determine if the recurring 246D-induced mutation in HIV- 1 YU2, R456K, alters virus recognition by the 246D antibody, we R456 to lysine in HIV-1 YU2 (HIV-1 YU2(R456K) ). The R456K mutant had reduced binding to 246D and all other anti- gp41 antibodies tested, as well as to nnAbs targeting the V3crown ( Figures 5 A, 5B, 5E and 5F). By contrast, binding to bNAbs PG16 and 3BNC117, which target the V1/V2 apex and the CD4 binding site, respectively, was increased for HIV-1 YU2(R456K) compared with HIV-1 YU2(Figures 5 C and 5D). To determine whether the R456K mutation also alters virus sensitivity to neutralization by bNAbs, we compared the neutralizing activityof a panel of antibodies against HIV-1 YU2(R456K) and HIV-1 YU2in TZM-bl assays ( Figure 5 G). The R456K mutation increased the neutralizing activity of several bNAbs, most notably antibodies targeting the V1/V2 apex and the glycan patch in the vicinity ofthe base of the V3 loop, while neutralization by bNAbs that target the gp41-gp120 interface and the gp41 membrane-proximal external region was reduced. Thus, the R456K mutation thatarises in vivo as a result of pressure by gp41-specic nnAb 246D appears to produce signicant alterations in antibody A BC D Figure 4. 246D Treatment Selects CD4bs Mutations in a Transmitted/Founder Env (A) Flow cytometry staining with anti-Gag antibody and 246D antibody of CD4+T cells infected with HIV-1 9004SS (left) or HIV-1 DU156 .

Numbers and vertical black lines at left indicate the animal from which the corresponding sequences were obtained; at right, treatment group is indicated. Numbering at the bottom of each sequence alignment corresponds to th e amino acid position in YU2 gp120 (HXB2 numbering).(D) Pie charts show the proportion of all sequences from 246D-treated animals infected with the indicated virus that carry the G366R mutation (red), t he G366E mutation (orange), or are not mutated at position 366 (white). The numbers in the center of the pies denote the number of G366R/E sequences gp41 and gp120 epitopes on the surface of infected cells and viruses. 246D Selects for Mutations that Prevent CD4-induced gp120 Shedding R456 and G366 are residues that contacts with CD4 ( Kwong et the 246D nnAb epitope in gp41 ( Figure 6 A). The backbone carbonyl of R456 forms a hydrogen bond with theK35 residue of CD4 and its guanidino group hydrogen-bonds to the backbone carbonyl side gp120 CD4bs resi-dues F277 and Q466, respectively ( Figure 6 B) (Kwong et al., 1998 ). One explanation for the decreased susceptibility of the HIV-1 YU2R456K mutant to binding by nnAb 246D is that this mutation may reduce gp120 shedding and therefore limit the number of gp41 stumps available for binding by 246D. Decreased shedding could be due to intrinsic stabilization of the trimer by the R456K mutation directly, or, alternatively, the mutation could indirectly reduce shedding by altering the ability of CD4 expressed on the surface of infected cells to interact withgp120 ( Moore et al., 1990 ). To determine whether the R456K mutation directly stabilizes the trimer, we produced YU2 and A B C D EF G Figure 5. R456K Mutation with HIV-1 YU2or HIV-1 YU2(R456K) . Cells were stained with anti-Gag antibody and nnAbs that target gp41 (A and B), bNAbs that target gp120 (C and D), or nnAbs that target the gp120 V3 crown (E and F).

We found no difference in the proportion of aggre- gated trimers and monomers and an equal amount of disorderin both preparations. Thus, the R456K mutation does not appear to stabilize the YU2 trimer directly. To determine whether gp120 binding to CD4 is impaired by the R456K mutation, we measured HIV-1 YU2 or HIV-1 YU2(R456K) neutralization by soluble CD4 (sCD4) in TZM-bl assays. HIV-1 YU2(R456K) was far more difcult to neutralize with sCD4 than HIV-1 YU2, indicating that R456K reduces gp120 binding to CD4 (Figure 6 C). We then measured CD4 binding to envelope trimers directly using biolayer interferometry ( Figure 6 D). The R456K mutation increased the dissociation constant (K D)b y/C242-fold, which was the result of a 2-fold reduction in the on-rate of CD4. The off-rate was unchanged, suggesting that the mutation may have partially occluded the CD4bs, thereby limiting CD4accessibility. This effect may be due to destabilization of the V5- and D-loop regions within the CD4bs of Env and/or to aloss of a potential H-bond partner with K35 of CD4 ( Figure 6 B). We speculate that mutation of the glycine at position 366 to argi- nine or glutamate in HIV-1 9004SS likely confers resistance to 246D by a related mechanism, as the large side-chain substitutionswould occlude the CD4-binding pocket to limit CD4 accessibility in a manner similar to R456K for HIV-1 YU2. We conclude that the R456K mutation indirectly enhances the integrity of Env trimerson infected cells and virions by reducing gp120:CD4 interactions that cause gp120 shedding. Increased Trimer Integrity by Decreased Interaction with CD4 on Infected Cells To measure the effects of R456K on trimer integrity directly, we assayed the amount of shed gp120 bound to uninfected cellsin HIV-1-infected cultures ( Richard et al., 2015 ). CD4 +T cells were infected with HIV-1 YU2or and stained with the nnAb A32 ( Wyatt et al., 1995 ), which binds to gp120 that has been shed from infected cells and is bound to cell surface CD4 ( Bruel et al., 2017; Richard et al., 2015 ) and theC A A G366 200 400 60001234 Time (s)YU2(R456K).SOSIP.664 100020406080100 Antibody concentration (ug/ml)% R456K Binding to CD4 (A) Gp120 (light gray) and gp41 (dark gray) from the BG505.SOSIP.664 structure (RCSB: 5TZ3) are shown in ribbons.

(D) Binding of the monomeric phases of YU2.SOSIP.664 and YU2(R456K).SOSIP.664 at the indicated concentrations to immobilized soluble 2-domain CD4(2dCD4) was assayed by biolayer interferometry. Colored curves give the arithmetic mean signal from three independent experiments at the indicated con- centrations of SOSIP protein.See also al., 2011 ). As expected, uninfected bystander p24/C0CD4+T cells in cultures infected with HIV-1 YU2showed high levels of A32 and 10-188 staining. In contrast, staining of p24/C0CD4+bystander T cells was markedly lower in cultures infected with HIV-1 YU2(R456K) (Fig- ure 7 A). To conrm this result biochemically, we produced recombinant versions of HIV-1 YU2and HIV-1 YU2(R456K) bearing a surface-expressed HA-tag (HIV-1 YU2HA and HIV-1 YU2(R456K) HA, respectively) to facilitate purication of intact infected cells and virions based on HA expression. We then puried infected and uninfected bystander cells from HIV-1 YU2HA- and HIV- 1YU2(R456K) HA-infected cultures by sorting HA+CD4lowor HA/C0CD4highcells, respectively, and performed western blotting for gp120 ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S4). In accordance with cell- staining experiments ( Figure 7 A), we observed more gp120 associated with uninfected bystander cells cultured in the pres- ence of HIV-1 YU2HA relative to HIV-1 YU2(R456K) HA ( Figure 7 C), and we observed slightly higher levels of gp120 on HIV-1 YU2(R456K) HA-infected infected cells.To conrm the requirement for CD4 on the effects of R456K on gp120 shedding, we co-transfected HEK293T cells (ATCC) with expression YU2or HIV-1 YU2(R456K) (Fig- ure S5 ). Uninfected bystander cell staining by anti-V3 antibody 10-188 was detectable mainly on CD4-expressing 293T cells markedly reduced in CD4-negative cells ( S5 ). Finally, to conrm the of Env-CD4 interactions on the gp41 and V3 anti- body evasion seen in Figure 5 , we measured A32 and 246D bind- ing to CD4 +T cells infected with HIV-1 YU2or with HIV-1 YU2(R456K) in the presence or absence of ibalizumab ( Song et al., 2010 ), which binds to CD4 and interferes with trimer-receptor interactions.Ibalizumab reduced A32 and 246D binding to cells infected witheither virus ( Figures 7 D and 7E), reinforcing the hypothesis that limiting CD4:gp120 interactions enhances trimer integrity and reduces accessibility of 246D to its epitope in gp41. We nnAb for in accessibility to bNAbs on the surface of infectedcells and viruses and that decrease CD4-induced gp120 shed- ding to limit the accessibility of nnAbs including 246D. AB C DE Figure 7.

To do so, we produced an HA indicator virusthat is replication-competent in vivo and conrmed the results with HIV-1 viruses bearing tier 2 Envs. The data indicate that nnAbs can alter the course of HIV-1 infection, apply immunepressure on the infecting virus, and even achieve modest levelsof protection by a mechanism that is entirely Fc receptor- dependent. The role of nnAbs in HIV-1 infection in vivo has been the sub- ject of extensive debate. In vitro studies with laboratory-adapt- ed, tier 1 HIV-1 strains showed that Env-specic nnAbs can direct ADCC/ADCVI (reviewed in Ferrari et al., 2017 ). However, little evidence exists to demonstrate Fc-mediated nnAb activity against primary HIV-1 isolates and transmitted/founder viruses (Bruel et al., 2017 ). Passive transfer experiments in macaques have associated nnAbs with reduced numbers of transmitted/founder variants and, in some cases, with lower acute viremia, but not with protection from infection ( Burton et al., 2011; Mascola et al., 1999; Moog et al., 2014; Santra et al., 2015 ). In these experiments, there was no evidence of nnAb-specic viral escape mutations, and the role of Fc receptors in nnAb activity in vivo was not evaluated. To specically interrogate how nnAbsmight affect HIV-1 infection in vivo, we screened for nnAbs that bind to cells infected with tier 2 viruses. Despite binding to surface-expressed Env on infected cells and virions, theselected antibodies do not neutralize HIV-1 in TZM-bl assays in vitro. Nevertheless, we show that such nnAbs mediate in- fected cell clearance and alter the course of HIV-1 infection inhu-mice. These antibodies do so in an Fc receptor-dependentmanner by selecting for viral escape mutations that confer resis- tance to nnAb binding. We also show that nnAbs have activity in hu-mice infected with a tier 2 reference strain, HIV-1 YU2and with a transmitted/founder Env, HIV-1 9004SS , demonstrating that such nnAbs are indeed active against clinically relevant viruses. Although anti-HA lowered viremia in HIVivoHA-infected cells,we did not observe these effects in HIV-1 YU2- or HIV-1 9004SS - infected animals treated with the nnAb 246D. Because all anti- body concentrations were near saturating ( Horwitz et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2012 ), this is likely due to the low levels of Env expressed on HIV-1 YU2- or HIV-1 9004SS -infected cells relative to HA expression on HIVivoHA-infected cells. Antibody-specic escape mutations in HIV-1 typically occur within the epitope targeted by the antibody ( Andrus et al., 1998; Diskin et al., 2011; Horwitz et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2012; West et al., 2013 ), although allosteric mutations may also alter antibody binding in some cases ( Bradley et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2003 ). Accordingly, hu-mice infected with HIVivoHA and treated with anti-HA IgG developed viral escape mutations thatinactivated the HA cassette. In contrast, the anti-gp41 cluster I nnAb 246D failed to select for mutations in its target epitope within gp41. Unexpectedly, we found strong selection for muta-tions in gp120 at residues that make contacts with CD4, mostnotably R456K for HIV-1 YU2and G366E/R for HIV-1 9004SS .W e show that the R456K mutation in HIV-1 YU2confers resistance to nnAb 246D by the 246D epitope ongp41 stumps. Similar indirect effects on shedding are mediated by the virus-encoded proteins Nef and Vpu. These two proteins decrease virus susceptibility to nnAbs in vitro by reducing sur- face levels of CD4 and/or antagonizing tetherin, which in turndecreases gp120 shedding from infected cells ( Alvarez et al., 2014; Arias et al., 2014; Pham et al., 2014, 2016 ). We conclude that nnAbs elicit specic viral escape mutations that may bedistal to the target epitope, yet nonetheless confer resistance. Post hoc analyses of the only HIV-1 vaccine trial to show modest efcacy, RV144 ( Rerks-Ngarm et al., 2009 ), associated directed against the V1/V2 loops ofgp120 ( Haynes et 2012; with ADCC responses ( Bonsignori et al., 2012 ). Protection from HIV-1 infection was most evident at early time points after vacci-nation, when antibody levels were highest ( Robb et al., 2012 ). However, the question of whether nnAbs were indeed respon- sible for the observed protection remains unanswered. Ourexperiments using a recombinant HIV-1 virus expressing highlevels of a heterologous surface marker (HA-tag) show that passive infusion of a nnAb can protect against infection in an exclusively Fc receptor-dependent manner. While these experi-ments made use of a recombinant virus, high doses of a mono- clonal nnAb, and a highly expressed heterologous surface marker, Fc-mediated protection was achieved against anextremely high-titer that consistently infects 100% of animals ( Figure S1 G). Our data are consistent with the high titer polyclonal anti-Env nnAb responses couldbe sufcient to afford low levels of protection against HIV-1 infection at the low multiplicity infectious doses characteristic of human transmission. Fc-mediated immune responses contribute to protection and therapy by bNAbs in hu-mice and macaques et al., 2007 ) and correlate with slower disease progression in humans ( Baum et al., 1996; Lambotte et al., 2009 ). In addition, Fc receptor engagement accelerates the clearance of infected cells in humans treated with the bNAb 3BNC117 ( Lu et al., 2016 ). How- ever, whereas potent bNAbs can neutralize virions directly, nnAbs are entirely reliant upon Fc receptor engagement to pro- tect against or alter the course of HIV-1 infection. Our resultsshow that nnAbs can clear HIV-1-infected cells in vivo, and it islikely that they also accelerate the clearance of virions ( Igarashi et al., 1999 ). Thus, the high levels of nnAbs found shortly after vaccination in the RV144 trial may have been protective againstHIV-1, despite their inability to neutralize the virus directly, by accelerating virus and/or infected cell clearance by Fc-mediated mechanisms.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILSHuman Subjects Samples of peripheral blood were obtained as de-identied samples from the New York Blood Center (New York, NY) and wereused for isolation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for virus infection experiments. Samples of human fetal liver tissue were obtained from Advanced Biosciences Resources (Alameda, CA) and were used to generate humanized mice as described below. All human tissue samples were obtained in accordance with protocols approved by the institutional review boardof The Rockefeller University. Humanized Mice NOD Rag 1/C0//C0IL2Rgnull(NOD.Cg-Rag1tm1MomIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, NRG) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and bred and maintained in the AAALAC-certied facility of the Rockefeller University. Mice were maintained under a 12 hr light/dark cycle with amoxicillin-containing chow diet under pathogen-minimizing care conditions. Both male and female mice (8-20 week old) were used for all experiments and were equally distributed within experimental and control groups. Animal protocols were in agreementwith NIH guidelines and approved by the Rockefeller University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Humanized mice were generated as previously described (Klein et al., 2013b). Human fetal livers were homogenized and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were isolated from digested liver using a CD34 +HSC isolation kit (Stem Cell Technologies). NOD Rag1/C0//C0IL2Rgnull(NOD.Cg- Rag1tm1MomIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, NRG) mice, 1-5 days old, were irradiated with 100 cG and were injected intrahepatically with 2 3105 human CD34+HSCs. Injection of HSCs was done 6 hr after irradiation. After eight weeks of age, male and female hu-mice were screened for successful engraftment of human immune cells and enrolled in experiments.

For 246D treatment, experimental mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2mg of 246D or 246D:GRLR starting at 10 days post infection (DPI) followed bythree injections with 1 mg at 14, 17 and 21 DPI. Viral load in mouse plasma was measured 10, 14, 17, 21 and 24 DPI. For single genome sequencing of viruses from infected mice, 600 mL of blood was collected from each mouse by cardiac puncture and all mice were sacriced at 24 DPI. For anti-HA IgG1-treatment experiment mice were infected with HIVivo-HA (510 ng p24) and intra-peritoneally injected with 2mg of anti HA-IgG1starting at 15 DPI followed by three injections with 1 mg at 17,19 and 23DPI. Viral load in mice plasma was measured 14, 18, 21, 25 and 28 DPI. For single genome sequencing of viruses from infected mice, 600 mL blood was collected from each mouse by cardiac puncture and all mice were sacriced at 28DPI. For 246D prophylaxis experiment, 1mg of246D was intraperitoneally injected one day before and one day after infection with HIV-1 YU2(17 ng p24). Viral load in mice plasma was measured 5, 9, 12, 16, 19 and 22 days post infection (DPI). For anti-HA-IgG1 prophylaxis experiment, 1mg of HA-IgG1 was intra- peritoneally injected one day before and one day after infection with 1mg of HA-IgG1 was intraperitoneally injected one day before and one day after infection with HIVivo-HA (510 ng p24). Viral load in mice plasma was measured 3, 6, 10, 13, 17, 20, 24, 37 and50 days post infection (DPI). For single genome sequencing of viruses from infected mice, 600 mL blood was collected from each mouse by cardiac puncture and all mice were sacriced at 37 DPI. Plasma Viral Load Measurements 300-500 mL of whole blood was collected by facial vein bleed. Plasma was separated by centrifugation from whole blood samples at 2000 x gcentrifugation for 5 min. Total RNA was extracted from 100 mL plasma using QIAmp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN) in combination with RNase-free Dnase (QIAGEN) and eluted in a 55 mL AVE elution buffer (QIAGEN). HIV-1 RNA was quantied by qRT-PCR as previously described ( Klein et al., 2012 ). The following forward and reverse primer were used for qRT-PCR: 5 0TAATGG CAGCAATTTCACCA-30(HXB2 4633 4653), respectively. The internal probe had the sequence 50-/5HEX/CCCACCAAC/ZEN/ARGCRGCCTTAACTG/3IABkFQ/-30. The quantitation limit was determined to be 800 copies/ml ( Klein et al., 2012 ). In vivo adoptive cell transfer In vivo adoptive cell transfers were done as previously described ( Lu et al., 2016 ). In brief, each mouse was injected intrasplenically with cultured cells containing 0.5 million Gag+ cells in a total volume of 50 ml. Mice were pre-treated with 1 mg of 246D or 1 mg of anti- HA-IgG1 12 hr before cell transfer. Mice were sacriced ve hours after cell transfer and splenocytes were collected and lteredthrow 40- mm mesh into complete RPMI media (GIBCO) with 6% serum. Enriched human cells were analyzed using the following antibodies: LIVE/DEAD /C226Fixable Aqua Dead Cell HIVivoHA an in vivo-adapted reporter virus derived from HIV-1 YU2that was developed as described in Figure S1 . Briefly, a cassette containing the minimal human IL-16 promoter driving expression of mCD24/heat-stable antigen (HSA) bearing an HA-tag in place ofthe native HSA ectodomain ( Ali and Yang, 2006 ) was inserted between envandnefin HIV-1 YU2. To improve replicative tness of the recombinant, a portion of gp41 from the HIV-1 strain Q23.17 was grafted into the YU-2.DG env, yielding a reporter virus with identical replicative tness HIV-1 YU2in vitro (HIV-1 YU2/Q23 Further replicative adaptation through selective passaging in hu-mice was required to generate a stable recombinant that achieved sufciently high viral loads for experimentation. Virus sequencing revealed ten nucleotide mutations throughout the entire genome, which were introduced into the initiating recombinant to generate the in vivo-adapted infectious molecular clone, HIVivoHA. For biochemistry experiments, the viruses HIV-1 YU2HA and HIV-1 YU2(R456K) HA were generated simply by insertion of the IL16HA cassette between envandnefin HIV-1 YU2. HIV-1 9004SS and HIV-1 DU156 were generated by cloning the 9004SS env gene (kindly provided by Michael Seaman (BIDMC; Boston, MA USA)) and the Du156 env gene (Du156, clone 12 (SVPC3), NIH AIDS Reagent program) into the HIV-1 NL4/3 vector backbone and produced by transfection in 293T cells, as previously described ( Klein et al., 2012 ). HIV-1 virus preparations were quantied by p24 ELISA (Lenti-X p24 Rapid with histidine tag, was expressed using transient transfection of HEK293T cells using linear polyethylenimine (PEI) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. After 5 d of expression, supernatants were claried by centrifugation and loaded onto (QIAGEN) with Buffer A (10mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mMNaCl), washed with Buffer A + 10 mM imidazole, and eluted with Buffer A + 350 mM imidazole. 2dCD4 was then puried by gel ltration chromatography in Buffer A using a superdex 200 analytical column (GE Healthcare). Purication of Env SOSIP proteins The YU2 SOSIP.664 constructs were along with a plasmid encoding the cellular protease furin at a 3:1 Env:furin ratio in 293F cells. The cells were allowed to express soluble SOSIP trimers for 5-7 days. Culture supernatants were collected and cells were removed by centrifugation at 3800 x g for 20 min, and ltered with a 0.2 mm pore size lter. SOSIP proteins were puried The lectin column was washed with 1x PBS, followed by a second wash with 1x PBS and 0.5M NaCl and proteins were eluted with 0.5 M methyl- a-D-mannopyranoside and 0.5 M NaCl. The eluate was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column ( GE Life Sciences ) prequilibrated in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.02% sodium azide, to separate the 0.01 mg/ml of YU2.SOSIP.664 or YU2(R456K).SOSIP.664 protein was applied for 15 s onto a carbon coated 400 Cu mesh grid that had been glow discharged at 20 mA for 30 s, followed by negative staining with 0.7% uranyl formate for 30 s. Samples were imaged using a Philips CM10 microscope operating at 80kV, at a magnication of 59,000x. Images were acquired witha Gatan 2K CCD camera using a nominal defocus of 1500 nm. Biolayer Interferometry Kinetic measurements of soluble 2dCD4 binding to the YU2 SOSIP.664 constructs were carried out using the Octet (ForteBio ); 0.2 mg/mL immobilized onto a Nickel-NTA biosensor until it reached saturation. The SOSIP.664 trimers were tested at concentrations of 0.1 mMt o1 mM. A reference sample of buffer alone was used to account for any signal drift that was observed during the experiment. Association and dissociation were each monitored for 5 min. All experi- ments were conducted in the Octet instrument with agitation at 1,000 rpm. Analyses were performed using nonlinear regression curve tting using the Graphpad Prism software, version 7. CD4+T cell isolation and HIV-1 infection CD4+T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells according to manufacturer's protocol (Miltenyi Biotec). The percentage of CD4+T cells was determined by isolated cells For HIV-1 infection CD4+T cells were cultured at 0.3x106cells per well in a 24-well plate. Cells were centrifuge at 400 g at 4/C14C. Cells media was removed and cells were resuspended with HIV-1 YU2, HIVivo-HA, HIV-1 mg/mL polybrene in a total volume of 200 mL per well. CD4+T cells were then incubated with the virus for 48-72 env HIV-1-RNA was extracted from 200 mL mice plasma using the QIAGEN MinElute Virus Spin Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesis from isolated RNA using SuperScript III Reverse Trans- criptase and a poly-T primer. To remove RNA remains, RNA was digested using RNaseH for 20 min at 37/C14C. cDNA was diluted and was subjected to two-rounds of nested PCR with gp160-specic primers as previously described ( Salazar-Gonzalez et al., 2008 ) using the following the rst lower than 30% were used for library preparation by the Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit as Previouslydescribed ( Caskey et al., 2015 ). Sequencing was performed using the Illumina Miseq Nano 300 cycle kits at a concentration of 15 pM. Env alignments were generated using 2017Flow Cytometry Infected-CD4+T were harvested 48-72 hr post infection and were incubated with the indicated anti-Env antibodies (3-20 mg/ml) for 1.5 hr at 37/C14C. The cells were then washed with FACS medium (1% BSA versus 5% FBS) and HIVivo-HA, HIV-1 YU2HA or HIV-1 YU2(R456K) HA were also stained with anti-HA antibody (Miltenyi # 130-098-404). To detect intracellular p24, cells were washed twice and were resuspended in 200 mL of BD Cytox/Cytoperm solution per well for 20 min at 4/C14C. To detect p24 expression xed cells were washed twice with BD Perm/Wash and incubated with anti-p24 antibody (Coulter, #6604665) for 30 min at 37/C14C. Cells were washed twice with BD Perm/Wash and analyzed with a LSRFortessa (BD) and FlowJo software (Tree Star). For CD4 blocking 2.5 mg/ml Ibalizumab was added to the media of 0.3x106infected CD4+cells cultured in 96 well plate 24, 36 and 48 hr post infection. Western Blotting For detection of gp120 on bystander cells, CD4+T cells infected with HIV-1 YU2HA or HIV-1 YU2(R456K)HA were sorted by FACSorting Uninfected cells were sorted by and gatingon CD4 high HA negative cell population and infected cells were sorted by gating on CD4 medium HA high cell population. Cells were sorted into 96 well plate, centrifuged at 400 g and were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mL/500,000 cells). Cell lysate were sonicated, centri- fuged at 12,000 g and supernatant was collected to a fresh tube with LDS sample buffer and sample reducing agent (Invitrogen).Samples were then incubated at 90 /C14C for 10 min and 40 mL of uninfected cell lysate or 60 mL infected cells lysate were loaded into 4%-12% gel (Invitrogen) in reducing conditions and blotted overnight with anti-GAPDH antibody (Abcam #ab9482), anti #1475) and anti gp120 antibody (Abcam #ab21179). Infected cells were also stain with anti p24 antibody (Abcam#ab9071). Membrane was then stained with Streptavidin-HRP(Abcam). For band detection Chemiluminescent HRP was added to the membrane (Denville Scientic). ImageQuant LAS 4000 and ImageJ were used to analyze band intensity. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0 or 7.0. Statistical tests used are stated in the gure legends where they appear, including the exact values of n and what n signies for each test. The two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was usedto determine statistical signicance in the reduction of gag+ cells between treatment conditions in adoptive transfer experiments (Figures 1 C and 3B). A one-tailed t test was used to determine the condence in reduced levels of staining of Env on infected PBMC in the presence of ibalizumab ( Figure 7 E).

Generation of an In Vivo-Adapted HIV-1 Indicator Virus, Related to Figure 1 (A) Schematic of HIV-1 YU2(Klein et al., 2012 ) genome organization, from which a recombinant genome was constructed, HIV-1 YU2/Q23 IL16HA, carrying a chimeric gp41 gene (YU2.DG and Q23.17) and an HA-tag expression cassette composed of a minimal human IL-16 promoter and the murine CD24/heat-stable antigenwith the HA-tag sequence replacing 9aa Virus kinetics for HIV-1 YU2and HIV-1 YU2/Q23 IL16HA in CEM.NKR.CCR5 cells (NIH AIDS Reagent Programme) in the presence or absence of 5mM indinavir sulfate to inhibit virus spread. Black lines/symbols, HIV-1 YU2; pink lines/ symbols, HIV-1 YU2/Q23 IL16HA; dashed lines/open symbols, indinavir sulfate. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) required to achieve 1%, 0.3% or 0.1% infected cells, and virus was allowed to spread for 9 days. Cells were assayed for Gag-p24 expression by intracellular staining and flow cytomet as in Figure 1 . (C) Flow cytometry staining for HA and Gag-p24 expression in cells collected from the boxed time point in (B). For HIV-1 YU2/Q23 IL16HA, all gag-p24+ cells were also highly HA+, indicating that 9d virus spread in vitro did not result in loss of the heterologous HA marker. (D) Hu-mice were infected with HIV-1 YU2IL16HA and viral loads were monitored by qRT-PCR using the same methods as for HIV-1 YU2. At 13-27 days post-infection, hu-mice were sacriced and splenic CD4+ T cells were isolated by negative magnetic sorting (Miltenyi) for virus outgrowth cultures. For each passage (indicated at top, with arrows), cells f rom virus outgrowth cultures were screened for HA expression and the best culture was selected for re-infection of new hu-mice. When the virus culture from mous e #300 was used to infect mice, viral loads in all animals reached 104-106copies/ml 8 days post-infection, indicating that the virus had adapted to replicate in hu-mice at levels sufcient for further experimentation. (E) Flow cytometry of virus outgrowth cultures (human CD4+ T cells) from the animal selected for each p assage in (D). HA (y axis) and gag-p24 (x axis) staining are shown. (F) Virus sequencing of culture- and plasma-derived viruses at all passages in (D) by reverse-tran scriptase PCR revealed several mutations throughout the genome that became selected during passage in hu-mice. The consensus mutations from mice infected wit h the virus from mouse #300 were introduced into HIV-1 YU2/Q23 IL16HA to generate the in vivo-adapted molecular reporter clone, HIVivoHA. (G) Infection of hu-mice with 293T-derived virus stocks generated from the HIVivoHA molecular clone yielded 100% infection 7 days after infection, and achieved high viral lo ads in a majority of animals. (H) HIVivoHA infection is sustained at high viral loads for at least 39 days.Figure S2.
