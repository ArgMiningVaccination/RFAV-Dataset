A summary of supporters is found in this report (page 8). The strong CPSP partnership between the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) and Health Canada's Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control (CIDPC) allows the program to grow in Canada and to take a leadership role on the international scene. A special thank you T o all who participated in the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program's external evaluation, thank you. With your cooperation and involvement, it was possible to provide the Expert Advisory Group (EAG) with valuableinformation with which to assess the merits of the program. A special thank you is extended to the EAG, chaired by Dr. Robert McMurtry, for evaluating the program to determine its strengths and weaknesses and how well it isachieving its objectives and goals. The Steering Committee is proud of the results of the review, which stated, \"The CPSP represents an important collaborative tool for surveillance, research and policy development. In this role, it was perceived as unique in Canada. In other words, it provides an important activity that would disappear in itsabsence, unless a much larger investment was made to replace it.\" Y ou are encouraged to read the executive summary of the evaluation results on page 14 of this report. A copy of the complete evaluation report is available through the CPSP Senior Coordinator. Congratulations all!Dr. Robert McMurtry \"CPSP , a gem, a light under a bushel\" 3C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Foreword Federal Minister of Health, Health Canada As Minister of Health, I wish to congratulate the Canadian Paediatric Society on the successful completion of the eighth year of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). It is well recognized that Canadian paediatricians play a vital role in the program. The knowledge generated by the CPSP enables paediatricians and the health-care community to educate other health-care professionals, improve the quality of life for children with rare conditions, and increase public awareness, both in Canadaand internationally. Thank you to the 2,300 paediatricians who regularly take the time to return the monthly report. Canadian society values its children. It is important that we foster and nurture their mental and physical well-being. In partnership, Health Canada and the Canadian Paediatric Society will continue to work towards the goal of improving the health and well-being of Canada's children. I wish the Canadian Paediatric Society many years of success with the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program.The Honourable Pierre S. Pettigrew Director General, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control I am pleased to accept the eighth annual report of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). I am heartened by the success of the program, especially CPSP's leadership in strengthening the International Network of PaediatricSurveillance Units where the health of children exemplifies a 'global village'. I would like to reaffirm my commitment to the partnership between the Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control (CIDPC) and the Canadian PaediatricSociety (CPS). An Expert Advisory Group (EAG), convened to oversee the CPSP evaluation, emphasized the importance of the relationship by stating that \"an important collaboration has been established between the CPS and Health Canadawhich is exemplar\". The EAG also concluded that the CPSP is an invaluable tool for future expanded surveillance and/or specific outbreaks because the program's network of over 2,300 paediatricians, coupled with centralized coordination by the CPS,strategically enables it to rapidly respond to public health emergencies. I would like to personally thank the CIDPC staff who have played, and will continue to play, a major role in the success of the program by serving in multiple capacities as program managers, members of the CPSP SteeringCommittee and/or principal investigators. The CIDPC continues to financially support the infrastructure of the program and to coordinate funding for several Health Canada studies. Departmental studies undertaken in 2003 include monitoring of acute flaccid paralysis, congenital rubella syndrome, neonatal herpes simplex virus infection,and eating disorders. Future and proposed departmental studies include paediatric serious and life- threatening adverse drug reactions and severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome. My gratitude would not be complete without attributing the success of the program to the paediatricians of Canada who diligently complete the monthly check-off form and who provide detailed information for each reported case.Dr. Frank A. Plummer 4C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S President of the Canadian Paediatric Society Congratulations to us: They asked - We answered If there was any doubt that Canadian paediatricians care and are interested in all matters that affect children and youth, look no further than our response to theCPSP . On a regular basis, I get the monthly forms in my office from the CPSP . I must admit that some of the conditions I remember only vaguely from my medical school days,long, long ago. Yet, every month I fill out the form and send it back, knowing it isimportant to learn more about these conditions and, in some cases, to find out thatthey are not in fact so rare. And so it appears do many, many of my colleagues fromall over the country because the response rate in 2003 was an astounding 83%. Thevoluntary questionnaire completion rate was an unbelievable 96%, and 67 new studysuggestions were forthcoming for further evaluation. These are truly remarkable rates, as anyone who has ever doneany surveying can tell you. In fact, that is just what the Expert Advisory Group, led by Dr. Robert McMurtry, notedin their external evaluation when they praised the program. The surveillance project has raised awareness of thework of the Canadian Paediatric Society and paediatricians within our own government circles and internationally. Congratulations to those who run the program, and to us. Well done! Dr. Diane Sacks CPSP Chairman What a great year! Not only did the CPSP continue to reinforce the national collaborative network of active surveillance to provide reliable data on high-impact,low-frequency conditions, but at the same time, the program also underwent a very thorough external evaluation. In the previous report, I mentioned that this formal program evaluation was being undertaken to answer important questions concerning the program's strengths, weaknesses and future course of action. T o this end, an international Expert AdvisoryGroup was formed to review the program's policies, objectives, targets, strategies, action plans, performance and output. I am pleased to report that after an extensive review, the program passed with flying colours. The group was unanimous in their opinion thatthe CPSP \"represents excellent value for money; the achievement in this respect was seen as excellent and unsurpassed by any comparable program known to the Expert Advisory Group\". As Steering Committee Chair, I am deeply grateful to Dr. Robert McMurtry and the members of the advisory group for their insight into the strengths of the CPSP as an active surveillance tool, their guidance in areas of futureexpansion and their vision of the CPSP's worth in the paediatric and public health research communities. I encourage you to read their report on page 14. W e are proud of the CPSP's achievements to date and are committed to enhancing its activities to continue making a major contribution to the health of Canadian children, by influencing paediatric practice and public health policy.Dr. Gilles Delage 5C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S CPSP Steering Committee Dr. Gilles Delage (Chair) Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Garth Bruce Canadian Paediatric SocietyDr. Rick Cooper Paediatric Chairs of CanadaMs. Marie Ad\u00e8le Davis Canadian Paediatric SocietyMs. Jo-Anne Doherty Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Health CanadaDr. Danielle Grenier Canadian Paediatric SocietyDr. Richard Haber Canadian Paediatric SocietyDr. Susan King Canadian Paediatric SocietyDr. Simon Levin Canadian Association of Child Neurology (Liaison)Dr. Catherine McCourt Centre for Healthy Human Development, Andrea Medaglia Canadian Paediatric SocietyMr. Paul Muirhead ConsultantDr. Jeff Scott Council of Chief Medical Officers of HealthDr. Anne Summers Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (Liaison)Dr. Paul Varughese Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Health CanadaDr. Wendy Vaudry IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program Lonnie Andrea Medaglia SocietyMs. Marie Ad\u00e8le Davis Canadian Paediatric SocietyMs. Jo-Anne Doherty Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Health CanadaDr. Danielle Grenier Canadian Paediatric Society6C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Presentations in 2003 (See http://www.cps.ca/english/cpsp for a complete list of presentations with hotlinks.)

Presented at the 63 rd Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association,New Orleans, June 2003.9C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Surveillance at Work Overview Surveillance is an important part of the practice of medicine allowing for the tracking and studying of conditions. Not only can the burden of disease be determined and interventions to prevent theoccurrence of a disorder be assessed, but information collected can also allow development of future health policies to address the needs of patients with theseconditions. The CPSP is designed to study uncommon disorders with high morbidity and mortality in childhood or rare complications of morecommon diseases of such low frequency that data collection nationally is required to generate a sufficient number of cases to derive meaningfulresults. When the CPSP Steering Committee reviews new study proposals, preference is given to studies that have strong public health importance or couldnot be undertaken any other way. All studies must conform to high standards of scientific rigour and practicality. Upon initiation of a new study, program participants receive a summary of the protocol, including the case definition and a brief description of the condition. Inaddition to providing a uniform basis for reporting, this approach serves to educate and increase awareness of low-frequency conditions with highmorbidity and/or mortality. The CPSP uses a two-tiered reporting process to ascertain and investigate cases: an initial 'check-off' form and a detailed reporting form. The full process is summarized in Figure 1. Reporting The initial reporting form, listing the conditionscurrently under surveillance, is mailed monthly to practising Canadian paediatricians and relevant paediatric subspecialists and health-care providers.Respondents are asked to indicate, against each condition, the number of new cases seen in the last month, including 'nil' reports. A 'nil' report is veryimportant in active surveillance, as the CPSP cannot simply assume that no reply means no cases. Participants report all cases meeting the case definitions, including suspect or probable cases wherethere is some doubt about reporting. This sometimes leads to duplicate reports but avoids missed cases. Case ascertainment is monitored and verified byinvestigating duplicate reports and comparing data with relative programs or centres. The CPSP assures the confidentiality of all information provided to the program. Only non- nominal patient information, such as the dateof birth, sex of the child and comments on theFIGURE 1 Reporting process summary10C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S to, and support of, the CPSP , 1,664 personal certificates were sent to acknowledge participation in2003, and 360 letters of thanks went to participantswho reported a case in 2003.

This anonymous information is used to identify duplicates and is entered, as a reminder, on a detailed reportingform, which is sent to the original respondent to request case-specific information. Once the detailed reportis returned to the CPSP , it is forwarded to the investigator for analysis. The investigator is responsible for contactingthe respondent if further information is required. The CPSP is encouraged by the 96% response rate for completionof detailed questionnaires (see T able 1 for study breakdown). Respondents who do not reply every month receive quarterly reminders. As well, information, including the monthlycompliance rates and the number of cases reported, is mailed quarterly to all participants to keep them informed of progress.

Bryan Magwood (MB) and ClaudioFregonas (ON). Lucky winners in the year-end drawfor one of two prizes to attend the June 2004 CPSAnnual Conference in Montreal were Dr. Esias VanRensburg (BC) who responded for all months in2003, and Dr. Philip Mantynen (ON) who completedand returned a questionnaire for a reported case. Participant workload Program evaluation respondents indicated thatthe monthly reporting system is simple and 80% feltthat the follow-up study questionnaires were easy tocomplete. As non-nominal, non-identifiabledata is collected through the CPSP , 90% of thosewho reported a case did not hesitate to provideclinical information. Even with a total of 583reported cases in 2003, the majority of participants(1,975 of 2,335, 84.6%) had 'nil' cases to report.The importance of zero reporting must howeverbe re-emphasized. As studies come and go, theworkload shifts to different subspecialties. Thenumber of reported cases was higher this year dueto the neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and vitamin Ddeficiency rickets studies and the inclusion of theearly-onset eating disorders study to the program. Figure 3 illustrates the number of cases reported by respondents in 2003. It shows that mostparticipants (84.6%) had no cases to report andchecked off the 'nothing to report' box each month.In fact, 11.1% of participants reported one caseand 3.2% reported two or three cases. Only25 participants (1.1%) completed four or morequestionnaires. It is interesting to note that 125 ofthe 583 reported cases were duplicates, validatingCPSP ascertainment. The CPSP is extremely gratefulthat the majority of participants faithfully complete the detailed questionnaires subsequent to reportingcases. This demonstrates that they appreciate theenormous value of the scientific data collected.On their part, the Steering Committee continuesto insist on short, precise and pertinent detailedquestionnaires. One-time survey questions The CPSP is available as an inexpensive tool to survey participants on a one-time-basis in order to identify the prevalence of a problem or to answera specific question. Once approved by the CPSP Steering Committee, the one-time survey question is sent to all participants with a monthly initial FIGURE 3 Number of cases reported by respondents in 200312C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S units worldwide and a chance to make a difference in the health and well-being of Canadian children andyouth.

Investigators' corner The CPSP can offer investigators the use of a timely, active surveillance system to increase awareness of childhood disorders that are high in disability, morbidity, mortality and economic coststo society, despite their low frequency. The CPSP provides an innovative means of identifying and obtaining data on low-frequency diseases andconditions from approximately 2,335 participants. The program is committed to a case ascertainment rate of over 90% and boasts a high response rate of96% on detailed reports (T able 1), due to follow-up reminders to participants who have not responded. The CPSP offers an opportunity for internationalcollaboration with other paediatric surveillanceCriteria considered for inclusion of studiesTABLE 2 Rarity Disorders of such low incidence or prevalence that national ascertainment of cases is needed (less than 1,000 cases a year).

Quality of proposal Proposal must state clear and achievable objectives, practicability, patient confidentiality, adequate resources, clear questionnaire and method ofevaluation. Workload of paediatricians Steering Committee must be convinced that reporting will not make excessive additional demands on the workload of paediatricians. Priority will be given to diseases that are not currently notifiable or, if notifiable, have sufficient indication of under-not ification. Investigators are expected to demonstrate that potential funding is available.13C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S the C riteria considered for inclusion of studies (T able 2) and the Format for submission (T able 3). The Steering Committee reviews submissions at its spring and fall meetings, giving preference to studies thathave either strong public health importance or could not be undertaken any other way. Studies must receive ethical approval and have funding in placebefore final acceptance to the program.The CPSP is pleased to see established faculty members mentoring young researchers with their study proposals. As previously mentioned in the Overview section, the CPSP is available to investigators as a cost-effective tool to survey participants on a one-time basis in order to identify the prevalence of a problem or to answer aspecific question.

Individual members were selected based ontheir experience and expertise in the fields of publichealth, paediatrics, epidemiology, surveillance andadministration. The CPSP Evaluation WorkingGroup held a preparatory meeting in May with thechair and circulated extensive background materialsto all EAG members prior to a face-to-face meetingin September, followed by in-camera deliberations.The chair of the EAG presented the followingfinal report to the CPSP Steering Committee inNovember 2003. Members of the Expert Advisory Group Dr. Robert McMurtry (Chair), Former Dean of Medicine, The University of Western Ontario; Former Assistant Deputy Minister of Health Dr. Margaret Berry, Neonatologist, The Montreal Children's Hospital Dr. Jeffrey Davis, Chief Medical Officer, Wisconsin Division of Public Health Dr. Philippe Duclos, Project Leader, Immunization Safety, World Health Organization Dr. Monika Naus, Epidemiologist, BC Centre for Disease Control; Chair, National Advisory Committee on ImmunizationOverall comments The EAG was unanimous in their opinion that the CPSP represents excellent value for money. The achievement in this respect was seen asexcellent and unsurpassed by any comparable program known to the EAG. The CPSP was seen as representing an important collaborativetool for surveillance, research and policy development. In this role, it was perceived as unique in Canada. In other words, it providesan important activity that would disappear in its absence, unless a much larger investment is made to replace it. The core activity of surveillance of low-frequency, high-impact conditions affecting children has created a network that reaches into all partsof Canada. This not only generates crucial information of these conditions (\"they are on target\"), but it has also established a mechanismto provide important public health information quickly and inexpensively on a national basis. Examples include the work on hemorrhagicdisease of the newborn, confirming the Canadian recommendation of vitamin K as the gold standard for prevention, and on baby walkerinjuries, confirming the need for a commercial product safety ban on these devices. The EAG was impressed by the survey of clinicians (paediatricians) that affirmed a change in practice pattern by some, and a high degree of recognition by all. The publications generated bythe program also received accolades. The CPSP is encouraged to increase its reach to include nurse practitioners and northern communities andterritories. Finally, the EAG underlined the importance of providing more evidence of impact on publichealth policy and clinical practice. Annualevaluation of the effectiveness of the SteeringCommittee was also recommended.15C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Program objectives The CPSP has done well in regards to its current objectives. It has initiated programs of nationalscientific significance and developed an effectivesurveillance system to monitor the health ofCanadian children in relationship to low-frequency,high-impact conditions. Nonetheless, there may bean advantage to rewording the program objectivesto reflect emerging priorities and new realities(e.g., changes in federal leadership, positive changesin federal/provincial/territorial relations). Some specific wording for the program objectives was suggested as follows: to identify important disease conditions for surveillance to support paediatricians and publichealth officials in their role of contributing to the health and well-being of Canadian children; to ensure a strong infrastructure and maintain and improve a national and collaborative population-based surveillance system to monitorhealth in Canadian children; to facilitate research into low-frequency, high- impact childhood disorders for the advancementof knowledge, the enhancement of understanding and the improvement of treatment, prevention and health-care planning. The EAG commended the CPSP on performing its core function so well and emphasized that importantadditional roles, such as responding to public healthemergencies and international collaboration, mayrequire additional resources. Evaluation objectives The evaluation process was seen as exemplary, andthe EAG was impressed with the surveys of thefour stakeholder groups and the CDC (Centers forDisease Control and Prevention) framework. Theprovided integrated background material was welldone and contained both quantitative and qualitative information of value. The logicframeworks provided an interesting context.However, the program goals were not seen as serving CPSP well and could be deleted withoutill consequence. The case in support of the excellent value for money represented by the CPSP might bestrengthened, especially in view of the newfederal fiscal reality that will likely be similarto the Program Review of 1994-95. The EAGis convinced that the case can be made and,furthermore, an effort to duplicate the essentialwork of the program by another means would beconsiderably more expensive. Strategic issues and conclusion The events of 2003 have been characterized by large-scale change and high impacts. All provinces east of Alberta held elections this year with new governments being elected in Ontario,Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Most observers feel that together with the change in federal leadership, a more collaborative approachat federal/provincial/territorial forums can be anticipated. In addition, a significantly negative economic impact was felt from SARS and thecase of one animal with BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy). Both were low-frequency, high- impact events and, accordingly, both of theselatter developments underscore the importance of public health and the crucial importance of surveillance. In the reviewers' opinion, the asset that the CPSP represents is relevant to these realities. It is anational program and an important mechanismfor surveillance of human health as observed inthe health and well-being of one of the mostvulnerable populations in Canada, our children.16C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S CPSP Principal Investigators Surveillance studies in 2003 Dr. H.

The number of AFP cases reported for 2003 and 2002 was lower than in previous years;however, duplicate reporting remains high. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome accounts for at least 74% of confirmed AFP cases. Polio viral stool cultures are still essential. Background The elimination of indigenous wild poliovirus transmission in Canada, and the rest of the American region, was certified in September 1994. However, until global polio eradication is attained, thereremains an ongoing risk of wild poliovirus importation from polio-endemic regions to Canada. Consequently, active surveillance of acute flaccidparalysis (AFP) in children less than 15 years old is used to monitor potential cases of paralytic poliomyelitis. Based on World Health Organization(WHO) criteria for AFP surveillance (T able 5), the estimated minimum number of cases in Canada is 58 per year. AFP surveillance in Canada was initiatedin 1991 through the IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) network of paediatric tertiary-care centres and, since 1996, has beenimplemented through the CPSP . This report presents the results of AFP surveillance in 2003 and compares them to those from previous years. Objective The objective of AFP surveillance is to identify AFP cases (including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [GBS]) inchildren less than 15 years of age to rule out paralytic poliomyelitis and thereby monitor the polio-free status of Canada. Case definition Acute onset of focal weakness or paralysis characterized as flaccid (reduced tone) without other obvious cause (e.g., trauma) in children lessthan 15 years of age. Transient weakness (e.g., post- ictal weakness) should not be reported. Results and discussion In 2003, the CPSP received 84 initial AFP reports, of which 42 (50%) were confirmed cases. The otherhalf were split between 35 duplicate reports and seven cases that did not meet the AFP surveillance case definition or have adequate information. Forty-two confirmed cases represents a rate of 0.72% per 100,000 which is below the minimum estimated background rate of one case per 100,000 childrenless than 15 years of age, or 58 cases. With the anticipated 'late reports' for the current year, the final number is likely to be slightly higher, but below theWHO targeted rate. Cases ranged in age from two months to 15 years (median 5.9 years, mean 7.3 years) in 2003. T able 6 shows the age distribution ofAFP cases reported in 2003 compared with cases reported from 1996 to 2002. Overall, the age distribution is similar throughout the reportingperiod. More than two-thirds (69%) of cases were males.World Health Organization quality assurance criteria for acute flaccid paralysis surveillanceTABLE 5 1) one case per 100,000 in a population less than 15 years of age 2) adequate polio virus stool culture in 80% of cases18C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Age distribution of AFP cases reported to the CPSP , 1996-2003TABLE 6 Age group (years) 2 (6.7) 11 (36.7) 9 (30.0)8 (26.6) 30 (100)\u2014 13 (37.1) 12 (34.3)10 (28.6) 35 (100) * Includes four delayed reports not included in the CPSP 2002 Results.Number of cases (%) 2 (4.6) 15 (34.1) 18 (40.9) 9 (20.4) 44 (100)0 - 1 2 - 5 6 - 10 11 - <15Total3 (4.9) 18 (29.5) 23 (37.7)17 (27.9) 61 (100)2 (3.3) 24 (39.3) 22 (36.1) 13 (21.3)61 (100)8 (14.8) 18 (33.3) 14 (25.9) 14 (25.9)54 (100)1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 10 (23.3) 16 (37.2) 11 (25.6) 6 (13.9) 43 (100)2002 *Although most Canadian children today are vaccinated against polio, only 29 of the 42 cases (69%) had documentation of routine childhood immunization, and all had received age-appropriatepolio immunization. For the remaining 13 cases, no polio vaccine-specific information was available on the detailed case report forms. Virological investigation for polio or other enterovirusesA total of 20 cases (48%) had stool examination; virology was not done or the status was unknown for 22 cases (52%). However, adequate stoolinvestigation for the isolation of poliovirus or non- polio enteroviruses (i.e., stool specimen collected within two weeks of the onset of paralysis) wasreported for only 17 of 42 cases (40%). For three additional cases, although stool specimens were collected, it was after two weeks of onset of paralysis.None were positive for polioviruses; one was characterized as 'adenovirus' and another as 'echovirus'. None of the nine throat and/or 23cerebrospinal fluid specimens collected for viral isolation was positive for poliovirus. For 17 of the 42 cases (40%), stool specimens were also tested forCampylobacter organisms; but all were negative. Neurological investigations consisted of at least one or more of the following: CSF abnormalities (protein, glucose, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and RBC), nerveconduction studies, electromyography, MRI or CT scan; abnormal findings compatible with theneurological diagnosis were reported for one or moreof the tests done. T wenty-six (72%) of the 36 CSFspecimens indicated some abnormal findings. MRIor CT scanning was done for 37 cases (88%); forMRI, or 67% showed some abnormality.Electromyography done for 33 cases; 26 (79%) of which hadabnormal findings.

Forty-one of the 42 required hospitalization for periods ranging from one to 105 days (mean of 17 days); seven cases were hospitalised for 30 days orlonger. Of the 42 cases, two (4.8%) recovered fully, 29 (69%) recovered partially with residual weakness, and 11 (26. 2%) had an unknown recovery status at60 days after the onset of paralysis. None of the clinical specimens tested, i.e., stool, nasopharyngeal or cerebrospinal fluids, were positivefor poliovirus infection. 5 (11.9) 17 (40.5) 7 (16.7) 13 (30.9)42 (100)200319C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Conclusions The 42 AFP cases identified to date for 2003 are below the expected rate in Canada, according tothe World Health Organization criteria. For thecorresponding period for 2002, a total of 39 caseswere initially reported, although the final numberhas since increased to 43 with the inclusion of fouradditional 'late' reports. The decline in the number of AFP cases documented by the CPSP over the past threeyears might be due to under-reporting of casesor epidemiological peculiarities: both need to befurther investigated. However, the high numberof duplicate case reports, and the continuedinvolvement of IMPACT , may in fact indicatethis to be a true reflection of the changing trend. It is still encouraging to note that the AFP reporting rate has improved since the introductionof paediatrician-based reporting through the CPSPfrom 0.5 per 100,000 children less than 15 years ofage in 1996 (30 cases) to 1.04 per 100,000 in 2000 (61 cases). For unknown reasons, the rate hasdecreased since then. Undoubtedly, the expansionof AFP surveillance to the CPSP has improvedthe completeness of surveillance by ensuring thatAFP cases seen at non-tertiary hospitals arereported in addition to those cases admitted topaediatric tertiary care hospitals that are reportedthrough IMPACT . A major area in which the AFP surveillance could be improved is the performance of polio-specific investigations and timely reporting of results. Theproportion of cases where polio-specific laboratory investigations were reported remained low in 2003, with only 48% of cases having had anadequate stool investigation during this period. This compares with the 33% to 51% reported for the period 1996-2002. These rates of adequatestool investigation remain significantly lower than the WHO target of 80%.

Negative resultsof appropriate polio-specific investigations are as important as a positive result would be in AFP case evaluations. The single most important laboratoryinvestigation, recommended by the National W orking Group on Polio Eradication, to confirm or to rule out a diagnosis of paralytic poliomyelitis, is astool specimen collected within two weeks of onset of paralysis for isolation of wild or vaccine strain poliovirus. Specimens may be collected up to sixweeks after the onset of paralysis, although after two weeks, the sensitivity of virus isolation decreases. The examination of paired serumsamples for evidence of a fourfold or greater rise in poliovirus antibody titre in paired sera and/or the presence of poliovirus-specific IgM antibody in asingle serological specimen further enhance the evaluation of cases.

Significant causes of morbidity and presumed mortality were severe feeding difficulties (often requiring surgical interventions), cardiovascular and CNS anomalies. Preliminary cohort data (13 individuals) suggest evidence of autism spectrum disorder in the majority. Background CHARGE association/syndrome (CHARGE A/S) is a constellation of a number of congenital anomalies that was first given the acronym CHARGE( Coloboma, Heart Defect, Choanal Atresia, Retarded Growth and Development, Genital Hypoplasia, Ear Anomalies/Deafness) in 1981. Over the past 15 years, the specificity of this pattern of malformations has reached the level thatmany clinicians now consider it to be a discreterecognizable syndrome (Graham JM. Am J Med Gen 2001;99:120-3). With increasing expertise, it becameclear that the criteria originally proposed neededfurther refinement. The revised consensus diagnosticcriteria by Blake et al. incorporated both major andminor features for CHARGE A/S and have beendocumented to enhance clinical diagnosis andfacilitate research efforts. These criteria consist offour major characteristics: coloboma, choanalatresia, characteristic ear anomalies, cranial nervedysfunction palsy, andswallowing difficulties) and seven minor criteria:heart defect, orofacial cleft, genital hypoplasia,21C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S growth deficiency, developmental delay, tracheoesophageal fistula and a distinctive facialappearance. The diagnosis is firmly establishedwhen all four major or three major and three minorcriteria are present. Some of the criteria are difficultto detect in infants, and as the major characteristicsare rare in other conditions, the CHARGE A/Sdiagnosis needs to be considered in any individualwho has one or two major criteria and several minorcharacteristics. T o define CHARGE A/S in theseindividuals, a cranial CT or MRI scan may showhypoplasia of semicircular canals and/orcochlea and/or choanal atresia or stenosis. Highresolution chromosome studies, situ hybridization (FISH) for 22q11 deletion and thesubtelomeric deletion FISH testing help to rule outany chromosomal abnormalities accounting for themultiple congenital anomalies. An increase inpaternal age of CHARGE A/S children has beenrecognized as a risk factor and needs to be confirmed. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence and prevalence of CHARGE A/S inCanada, as the true incidence is unknown. AsCHARGE A/S presents with a wide spectrum ofclinical severity, mildly affected patients may alsobe diagnosed and can be followed prospectively.The review article, entitled \"CHARGE association:An update and review for the primary paediatrician\"(Clin Pediatr 1998;37:159-74), summarizes current understanding of the management of this complexand chronic multiple congenital anomaly,giving physicians a guide to the managementof CHARGE A/S. Objectives 1) T o determine the incidence and prevalence of CHARGE A/S in Canada by ascertaining all identified cases of CHARGE A/S (old and new). 2) T o obtain demographic and medical information on patients with CHARGE A/S, and assemble a database to answer research questions.3) T o follow developmentally and behaviourally an identified group of CHARGE A/S infants whohave been diagnosed at an early age and have obtained early intervention services. Will early recognition and treatment of these infantsimprove their clinical and behavioural well being? Case definitions Infant/child/adult with four major criteria or three major and three minor criteria. Major inclusion criteria: coloboma, choanal atresia, characteristic ear abnormalities, cranialnerve dysfunction. Minor genital hypoplasia, developmental delay, cardiovascularmalformations, growth deficiencies, orofacialcleft, tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula, characteristicface. Exclusion criteria Exclude other conditions such as velocardiofacial syndrome and DiGeorge Sequence using FISH test(fluorescent in situ hybridization) to exclude 22q11 deletion. Results Incidence In 28 months of surveillance, 90 confirmedindividuals, 48 males and 42 females, werereported with CHARGE A/S. Forty-three percentof the families agreed to be contacted for furtherfollow-up studies. T able 8 not only provides currentand cumulative data on case reports, but alsodemonstrates the high rate of duplicate reportingof CHARGE A/S cases. Calculations of the estimated regional incidence for CHARGE A/S continued to demonstrate aprovincial variation. The highest incidence was fromprovinces where the awareness of CHARGE A/S isparticularly high, the Atlantic Provinces, Manitobaand Saskatchewan; averaging 1:9,300 live births with22C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S CHARGE A/S. The global Canadian incidence is estimated at 1:23,000 live births. Figure 4 demonstrates that a higher proportion of individuals with CHARGE A/S were identified within the younger population. There is still a paucity of adolescents being identified through thesurveillance. Morbidity and mortality Feeding problems were present in 83% (75/90) of cases; reflux (GER) was present in 100% (6/6) of individuals older than onemonth at the time of death. See T able 9 for furthermortality details. Major cardiovascular anomalieswere present in 70% of the deceased populationcompared to 35% of the surviving cohort, withconotruncal anomalies and atrioventricular septaldefects (AVSD) being significantly more common inthe deceased compared to the surviving CHARGEA/S population. Structural anomalies of the central nervous system, as diagnosed by computed tomography or magneticresonance imaging, were more prevalent in thedeceased compared to the surviving population(70% vs. 51%). Behaviour and development Results of standardized parent questionnaires ondevelopment/behaviour and a structured telephoneinterview are reported on the first 13 individuals(eight males, five females). This population hasrelatively low adaptive behaviour skills, motorimpairment being particularly significant (T able 10).CHARGE association/syndrome casesTABLE 12 51Duplicates 11 31Discards Deceased patients with CHARGE association/syndromeTABLE 9 Age at time of death <1 week 7 weeks 6.5 months 8 months 1 week 4.5 months 2.5 months 1 week 9 years 2 weeks A: atresia BPCA \u2014 BPCA \u2014 BPCA CS CS BPCA CA \u20141 23 4 56 7 89 10Sex F M F F FF M F M MFeeding difficulties GER, G-tube GER, G-tubeGER, G-tube GER, vomiting \u2014 aspiration, H, N \u2014 TEF , R F F CP, R, R CL, F, N2 2Pending *In the 28 months of surveillance, the Canadian estimated incidence of CHARGE A/S is 1:26,700.23C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales standard scores of CHARGE A/S individualsTABLE 88 18-0 55.4 (19.8)Case # 1 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 13 Mean \u00a7 SDCommunication 60 82 7948 68 5357 43 26 16-6 59.8 (27.3)Socialization 61.2 <20 56 15-8 50-5 (14.7) * Motor skills administered only for children less than 8 years of age.

Nine or tencases per year yields an incidence of 1:30,000. Conclusions Ninety individuals represent the largest CHARGEA/S cohort in the literature. In several provinceswhere the awareness of CHARGE A/S is particularlywell developed, an estimated incidence approaches1:9,000 live births. As this study has identified ahigh prevalence of feeding difficulties that contributesignificantly to the mortality and morbidity issuesfor CHARGE A/S individuals, investigation andintervention for GER and associated feedingdifficulties are recommended. It will be importantto compare both rates and presentation of autism spectrum disorder in individuals with CHARGE A/Sto those seen in other congenital anomaly syndromes,as well as in persons with sensory impairments.

From 1996 to 2003, zero to two newborns with CRS per year were identified through thesurveillance systems in Canada (0 to 0.5 per 100,000 births). Canada's very low incidence of rubella and CRS is a reflection of the impact of rubella elimination strategies. This study reinforces the need for all children to receive their rubella vaccine at the recommended ages. Standing orders for vaccination of all rubella susceptible women in the immediate postpartum period are essential. Background In Canada, rubella immunization programs were introduced in the 1970s. However, the programstrategies varied; some provinces initially opted forselective immunization of pre-adolescent females andothers opted for immunization of all infants. By 1983,all provinces and territories across Canada hadimplemented routine measles-mumps-rubellacombined vaccine (MMR) at 12 months. During1996 and 1997, all provinces and territoriesintroduced a routine second dose MMR or measles-rubella combined vaccine (MR) given at 18 monthsor four to six years. Some jurisdictions used MRvaccine for their second dose catch-up campaigns. Since 1970 the incidence of rubella in Canada has declined markedly; fewer than 30 cases were reportedannually in the past three years. During a nationalconsensus conference in 1994, a goal of eliminatingindigenous rubella infection during pregnancy by theyear 2000 was established. In November 2001, aNational Expert Working Group on Rubellarecommended that all rubella infections be includedfor enhanced surveillance.In Canada, passive reporting of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) to the Notifiable Diseases ReportingSystem (NDRS) began in 1979. Active surveillance of CRS began in 1992 through a network of tertiary- care paediatric hospitals (now representing morethan 90% of paediatric tertiary-care beds in Canada) participating in IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) and through the CPSP since 1996. Objectives 1) T o estimate the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome. 2) T o obtain detailed epidemiological data, including maternal histories, on reported cases of congenital rubella syndrome and infection. Case definitions Confirmed case Live birth T wo clinically compatible manifestations (anycombination from T able 13, columns A and B) with laboratory confirmation of infection: isolation of rubella virus from an appropriate clinical specimen; or detection of rubella-specific IgM in the absence of recent immunization with rubella-containingvaccine; or rubella-specific IgG persisting at elevated levels for longer than would be expected from passive transfer of maternal antibody, or in the absence of recent immunization. Stillbirth T wo clinically compatible manifestations with isolation of rubella virus from an appropriate clinicalspecimen. Note: The following cannot be classified as a CRS case: rubella antibody titre absent in the infant;or absent in the mother;or rubella antibody titre declining in the infant consistent with the normal decline after birthof passively transferred maternal antibody.26C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Congenital rubella infection Confirmed case A case with laboratory confirmation of infectionbut with no clinically compatible manifestations: isolation of rubella virus from an appropriate clinical specimen; or detection of rubella-specific IgM in the absence of recent immunization with rubella-containingvaccine; or persistence of rubella-specific IgG at elevated levels for longer than would be expected from passive transfer of maternal antibody, or in the absence of recent immunization. Rubella in clinical illness Confirmed case Laboratory confirmation of infection in the absence of recent immunization with rubella containingvaccine: isolation of rubella virus from an appropriate clinical specimen; or significant rise in serum rubella IgG antibody levels by any standard serological assay; or positive serologic test for rubella-specific IgM;or clinical illness * in a person who is epidemiologically linked to a laboratory confirmed case. * Clinical illness is characterized by fever and rash, and at least one of the following: arthralgia/arthritis, lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis. Up to 50% of rubella infections are reported to be subclinical. Results and discussion In 2003, there were two reports of the same 20-month-old adopted child from Asia, who had the following clinical conditions: congenital cataract,patent ductus arteriosus, and microcephaly. No information was available on the mother. This case did not meet the Canadian CRS case definition asthe diagnosis was confirmed beyond infancy. The very low incidence of CRS and rubella infection suggests that Canada is getting closer to achievingthe goal of eliminating indigenous rubella infection during pregnancy. From January 1996 to December 2003, with active surveillance in place, nine new reports of newborns with CRS were reported in Canada (T able 14). Of those whose status was recorded, four were born toimmigrant women, one to an aboriginal woman, and two to non-aboriginal women.

Conclusions and recommendations The very low incidence of CRS and rubella infections suggest that Canada is getting closer to achievingthe goal of eliminating indigenous rubella infection during pregnancy. Health-care providers are requested to ensure that: (1) all patients receive their rubella vaccinations at the recommended age and (2) all women without documented proof of rubella immunization receivethe vaccine. Special attention should be given to the immunization status of women from regions with poor vaccination coverage, including women inimmigrant populations. Routine rubella antibody screening antenatally by a reliable method is central to the congenital rubella prevention strategy, and allwomen found to be susceptible should be vaccinated in the immediate postpartum period. Standing orders for vaccination of susceptible women beforedischarge from hospital are the most effective way to ensure that the opportunity is not missed. The degree of under-diagnosis and under-reporting for congenital rubella infection (CRI), CRS with lesssevere manifestations and CRS with delayed-onsetmanifestations is unknown. Physicians are remindedthat it is important to investigate all infants born tomothers who have confirmed or suspected rubellainfection during pregnancy, even if the infants haveno obvious abnormalities on examination. Prenatalrubella screening and postpartum vaccination willcontinue to be essential in the quest to eliminaterubella infection during pregnancy.

Female to male ratio is 5 to 1 in 5- to 12-year- olds compared to 10 to 1 in older age groups. The predominant clinical feature (100%) was food avoidance. A substantial weight loss was documented during these important growing years. Background Over the last 50 years, the prevalence of anorexia nervosa in children and young adolescents appearsto have been increasing while the age of onset of eating disorders has become even younger. However, there is ongoing debate in the literatureabout how to apply the current diagnostic criteria for eating disorders to children and younger adolescents. What is known though is thatsignificant medical and psychological complications arise from starvation, weight loss or lack of appropriate weight gain during childhood andadolescence, making this group of conditions important to recognize and treat appropriately. This study will document the incidence of early- onset eating disorders (EOED) in Canadian children and provide descriptive data on theabnormal cognitions, behaviours and severity of weight loss and/or other medical sequelae. This data will allow for a better understanding andrecognition of this condition in younger children where currently the diagnosis may be delayed or missed. It will also aid in resource allocation andultimately promote the creation of developmentally appropriate management guidelines to provide improved outcomes.28C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Objectives 1) T o describe the minimum estimated incidence of early-onset eating disorders in children and young adolescents aged five to 12 years inCanada. 2) T o describe the range of medical and psychiatric clinical features at presentation. 3) T o compare the clinical features in children and young adolescents with existing diagnostic criteria for eating disorders in older patients. 4) T o describe current therapeutic interventions used in management.

The female to male ratio for the diagnosis of an eating disorder in young children between the ages of five and 12 years is 5:1 compared to 10:1 in(6%) (89%) (4%) (1%) (100%)29C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S the older adolescent and adult population. Boys are more likely to be affected in the younger age group. This is the first data set on Canadian children to support the work of three previously publishedEuropean studies. Although the majority were Caucasian, Asian and mixed race children were also identified. The group's mean weight loss of6.8 kg (\u00b1 4.7) is a substantial weight loss in children between the ages of five and 12 years who should be gaining weight during these importantgrowing years. Almost half (48%) required an inpatient admission for treatment. The average weight loss was 6.82 kg (\u00b14.8) and 6.75 kg (\u00b14.2)in girls and boys, respectively. While the greatest weight loss was found in older children aged 11 to 12 years of age, girls in this age group lostan average of 8.15 kg (+4.9) with a range of oneto 21 kg. This was approximately 18% of their total body weight. Boys aged 11 and 12 years old lost an average of 7.57 kg (+4.6) with a range of two to 15 kg. This was approximately 17.5% oftheir total body weight. Ninety-four percent of cases were identified in children over the age of eight years old. In that group, all of the boys(10/10), but only 76% (37/49) of the girls, had lost weight as part of their symptomatology. Food avoidance was a predominant clinical feature in all confirmed cases. Many children also displayed a preoccupation with food and weight, and a fear of gaining weight. However, like theirolder adolescent counterpart, over half of these children denied their symptoms. Finally, one of the criteria for diagnosing anorexia nervosa in femalesis amenorrhea. Children under 12 years old would not necessarily be at an age where menstruation would be expected and, therefore, the criteria ofamenorrhea for three consecutive months may not be useful for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa in children and younger adolescents. Consequently,the majority of the children did not meet the full criteria for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa as outlined in the DSM-IV . This data suggests that it may be difficult to apply these diagnostic criteria to the younger age group.There may also be problems in matching clinical populations to the existing classification systems that are based on adults with eating disorders.Children have limited ability for insight that would be required to endorse the full spectrum of symptoms. Furthermore, children and youngerPhysical effects of disorderTABLE 18 Physical symptom Hypothermia HypotensionBradycardia Admitted to hospital Nasogastric tube usedPatient aliveYes No Don't know 51 5144 33 44 04 11 0 14 38 11 18 30 5 60 Health-care providers involvedTABLE 19 Providers PaediatricianPsychiatrist Dietitian PsychologistSocial worker Nurse workerFamily No Don't 1 19 7 1716 57 57621 10 7 121161 34 4934 36 66 1Percent of children with weight loss by age and sexTABLE 20 Sex Boys Girls5 to 8 years old 9 to 10 years old 11 to 12 years S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S adolescents may present with other types of clinical eating disturbances that are different from the classiceating disorders of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa with respect to core psychopathology. Nonetheless, the presenting symptoms are asmedically and psychologically problematic. Interestingly, some children do endorse the symptoms of vomiting (11%) and fear of gaining weight (86%)that have been thought to be only observed or reported in adolescents. Therefore, since these symptoms are unexpectedly higher than wasoriginally hypothesized, further analysis is required. The majority of children did not have a history of a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis or a positive psychiatric family history. However, 40% had changes in their social situation. Bradycardia (28%) was themost common medical complication identified, and over 52% of the children were admitted to hospital. This study is based on a similar data collection undertaken by the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU). After 21 months of surveillance, 45 cases of early-onset eating disorder in Australianchildren aged five to 13 years (inclusively) have been confirmed. Of the reported cases, 71% are female and 16% are younger than 11 years of age.A decrease in weight in the six months prior to diagnosis was observed in 89% of cases, with a median weight loss of 6 kg. The profile of clinical features for these identified cases at the time of diagnosis is consistent with those being reported in Canada. However, abnormal FIGURE 5 Average weight loss in kilograms by age and sex FIGURE 6 Weight loss compared to current weight in kilograms by age for girls and boys31C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Lap-belt syndrome (September 2003 to August 2005) Highlights Seat belts were designed to save lives, but worn incorrectly they can cause importantabdominal and lumbar spine injuries. Three cases of lap-belt syndrome were reported in the first four months, including one childwith spinal cord injury. Media, public health and general interest in the study has been high. Background The use of seat belts has clearly reduced fatalities andseverity of injuries in motor vehicle crashes. With the increasing use of seat belts over the last decades, a new association of injuries has emerged among adultsand children involved in motor vehicle crashes. The 'seat-belt syndrome' was first described by Garrett and Braunstein in 1962 and refers to injuries to theintestinal viscera and to the lumbar spine associated with seat-belt restraints. Children are especially vulnerable to these injuries as their intra-abdominalorgans are less protected by the thorax and pelvis, they have a lower centre of gravity and their iliac crests are less developed than those of adults allowingthe belt to ride up over the abdomen. T o date, there have been very few paediatric studies on the incidence of seat-belt syndrome. In fact, most currentknowledge comes from case reports or studies done in limited regional areas. In these studies the number of cases was relatively low, ranging from ten to 50 casesover years. Objectives 1) Obtain epidemiologic data on the incidence and pattern of injuries encountered in the seat-beltsyndrome. 2) Identify at risk age groups.medical findings are being reported in a higher proportion of Australian children with temperature less than 35.5 o C reported in 40%, and bradycardia (minimum 36 beats/minute) reported in 53% ofchildren. Concurrent depression is also being reported in a higher proportion of Australian children (40%). Some international variation in management practices may be emerging, with 60% of theAustralian sample receiving nasogastric (NG)feeding. This may be a consequence of a slightvariation in reporting criteria during the first yearof the APSU study which required only reportingchildren who were hospitalized. This might explain,in part, why there is a greater proportion of NGfeeding reported by the APSU compared to theCPSP study. Surveillance through the APSU willcontinue until at least 2005. International comparisons of the data from the EOED studies will enhance our knowledge ofthis global problem and will contribute to ourunderstanding of early-onset eating disordersthroughout the world.

Case definition Any child up to and including 18 years of agerestrained in a motor vehicle at the time of a crash,with either an abdominal injury, as determined byoperation or CT-scan, or thoraco-lumbar spineinjuries with or without spinal cord injuries. Results and discussion The study on lap-belt associated injuries started inSeptember 2003. In the first four months of the study,Canadian paediatricians reported eight cases of lap-belt syndrome. Of these, three were confirmed, twowere duplicates, one was a discard, and two hadinjuries probably related to their seat belts, but whichdid not meet the case definition (one child was in abooster seat and had a cervical spine fracture, whilethe other presented with a brachial plexus injury).Of the three confirmed cases, one presented withabdominal abrasions and a splenic contusion, anotheralso had an abdominal abrasion and a jejunal infarctthat needed small bowel resection, while the lastpresented with the full spectrum of seat-beltassociated injuries, including an intestinal perforationthat needed resection and an L2-L3 lumbar spinefracture with spinal cord injury. Lap-belt syndrome is an important health problem in the Canadian paediatric population. It is associatedwith improper use of the lap belt only. Mostencouragingly, even though cases have just started tobe reported, interest from different media and publichealth organizations has been high. Issues pertainingto child safety in motor vehicles and the use ofbooster seats have been discussed not only with radioand newspaper journalists but also with the OntarioMinistry of Transport. The general public is alreadybeing informed and some provinces are taking legislative measures to ensure that children areadequately protected in motor vehicles. Clearly themost important issue of this study is to demonstratethe need to review restraints in motor vehicles. It ismost satisfying to see that this objective is alreadybeing fulfilled. Principal investigator Claude Cyr, MD, Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke33C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Results Thirty-seven cases of NF were reported (26 group A streptococcus [GAS] related) across Canada with a mean age of 6.3 \u00b1 4.9 years. Cases were reportedfrom all areas of Canada west of the Maritimes. The annual incidence per million population peaked during the first year of life: age less than one year,8 cases; 1-9 years, 3.4 cases; and 10-18 years, 1.1 cases, (P<0.001). Males under the age of one had the highest burden of disease with 12 cases permillion population versus 3.2 cases per million for females (P<0.0001). In contrast, rates were similar between males and females for older age groups,(1-9 years: males, 3.2 cases, and females, 3.7 cases; 10-18 years: males, 1.0, and females, 1.25 cases, P=NS). Seventeen (46%) of all cases occurredwithin one month of the child developing varicella. Sixteen (61%) of the GAS related type II NF cases were varicella-associated versus one (9.1%) of thenon-GAS type I related cases (P<0.002). Eight (21.6%) patients had an underlying chronic medical condition (2/26 type II related versus 6/11 type Irelated cases, P<0.01). For the 26 cases of type II related NF , the most common presenting symptoms were: localized pain (25, 96.2%), fever (10, 38.5%),vomiting (9, 34.6%) and chills (8, 30.8%). Localized pain was also reported uniformly in type I cases (11, 100%) along with chills (6, 54.5%) and fever(3, 27.1%). Eleven (42%) of the type II patients gave a history of having taken non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) within a week ofadmission. One type II patient had been in contact with another patient with invasive GAS disease. T wo (18.2%) of the type I cases and none of thetype II cases were nosocomial. Eighteen (48.6%) cases involved the lower extremities and/or groin area; nine (24.3%) the upper extremities (no type Icases involved upper extremities); nine (24.3%) the head, neck and chest areas; and two (5.4%) involved the abdomen (some patients had more than one siteinvolved). All patients received at least one surgical procedure including fasciotomy/fasciectomy, debridement, amputation or skin graft. All type IINecrotizing fasciitis (September 2001 to August 2003) Final report Highlights Sixteen of the 26 (61%) GAS-related necrotizing fasciitis cases were varicella- associated. Implementation of universal varicella immunization would decrease NF incidence. Excruciating local pain out of proportion to skin presentation warrants urgent attention. Mortality was low but morbidity was high. All cases required surgery. Background In 1999, the Canadian Paediatric Society issued a statement on the state of knowledge and management of children and close contacts ofpersons with all-invasive group A \u00df-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections. In that statement, it was noted that there was no nationaldata for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) in Canada. The current study started in September 2001 and concluded in August 2003 using the CanadianPaediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) to establish actual national rates and epidemiology of NF . Objectives T o define the epidemiology, management and outcome of NF in Canadian children. Case definitions NF is a deep-seated infection of the subcutaneous tissue that results in progressive destruction of fascia and fat. In general, NF is classified into two types. 1) T ype I NF refers to mixed infections involving anaerobes (most commonly Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcis spp ) more facultative such streptococci (non-GABHS), and Klebsiella, Proteus ). 2) T ype II NF refers to that caused by invasive GABHS.34C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Neonatal herpes simplex virusinfection (October 2000 to September 2003) Final report Highlights Nine children died, resulting in a case fatality rate of 15.5%. Eight of 20 (40%) women were unaware of a history of HSV infection prior to delivery. The majority of typed cases (62.5%) were HSV-1, which has implications for vaccineand drug development. Background Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections pose a public health concern especially since a high proportion of these infections are unrecognized. The most seriousdirect consequence of genital HSV infection is the perinatal transmission from mother to infant. With only limited data available, it is not possible toaccurately determine the prevalence, incidence and trends of neonatal herpes infection in Canada. Data collection is essential to better understand theepidemiology of neonatal herpes and to monitor the trends in Canada. Canadian data on morbidity, mortality and on mother and infant risk determinantswill allow comparison of neonatal herpes infection rates with other countries. The pre-vaccine baseline data that will be collected through this CPSP studybefore an HSV vaccine becomes available will be used to promote prevention and control program strategies, to further research, and to estimate theburden of illness in Canada. Objectives 1) T o estimate the incidence rate of neonatal herpes infections (HSV-1 and HSV-2) for the years 2000to 2003 per 100,000 live births in Canada. 2) T o determine the proportion of HSV-infected infants with localized and disseminated disease.patients received clindamycin in combination with either penicillin (20 patients) or other beta-lactam antibiotic (6 patients). Overall, seven of the 37 patients (5/26 type II and 2/7 type I) were notedto have received IVIG, while another 14 (10/26, 38.5% type II and 4/11, 36.4% type I) patients received unspecified blood products. The meanlength of stay was 16.8 \u00b1 15.8 days. T wo patients died (0/26 type II and 2/11, 18.2% type I). Discussion NF occurred throughout Canada, with the peak incidence among males younger than one year of age. The majority of type II NF cases were associated withrecent varicella infection, whereas type I cases were more likely to be associated with underlying disease or be nosocomial. The lower extremities and groinareas were the most commonly involved parts of the body. Although outcomes with regard to mortality were excellent, there was substantial morbidity in theform of surgical procedures and prolonged hospital stay. This improved mortality may be related to one or more of the following: universal surgicalintervention, early use of antibiotics and use of IVIG. Conclusions Surveillance through the CPSP has led to a betterunderstanding of the epidemiology of paediatric NF in Canada. Pain out of keeping with clinical findings is an early symptom for clinicians. T ype Iand type II NF differ in terms of predisposing risk factors, relationship to varicella and possibly prognosis. This morbidity associated with type IINF supports the need for a universal varicella immunization program in Canada. Even though the largest at-risk population is under one year of age,\"herd immunity\" would be expected to reduce NF rates in this population. Principal investigator H.

The majority ofcases were reported from Central Canada (60.4%),with the remainder from Western Canada (6.9%),the Prairies (25.8%) and Atlantic Canada (6.9%).No cases were reported from Northern Canada. Forreporting purposes, the year of diagnoses of a positivelaboratory test for HSV was used. The high numberof duplicate reports of individual cases (44/122) isindicative of physicians' buy-in to this comprehensivevoluntary mechanism of case ascertainment. The overall demographic and health profile of the 58 confirmed neonatal HSV cases is summarizedin T ables 22 and 23, for mothers and infantsrespectively. T able 22 outlines that the majority ofmothers were Caucasian, with a mean age of 27, andthat most deliveries were vaginal (75.9%) versusCaesarian (24.1%). Importantly, of the 20 womenwith available information, 12 had a history of HSVinfection. Out of 58 cases, only one mother hadintrapartum genital HSV lesions. Approximately half of the neonatal cases were diagnosed by 11 days old, and 51.7% of these caseswere female (T able 23). Of the 48 neonates withknown HSV type, 18 (37.5%) had HSV-2 and infected with HSV-1. Over a quarter ofcases (27.6%) were delivered prematurely, althoughthe median Apgar score was nine. The majority ofinfections were localized (63.8%), with almost 90%of these cases localized to the skin.3) T o identify risk determinants in mothers and their maternal HSV status prior to delivery. 4) T o analyze trends of cases reported over a minimum period of three years, by age, sex andprovince. 5) T o document the morbidity/mortality of neonatal infections for the years 2001 to 2006 through acohort study of infants identified in each of the first three years of the neonatal herpes surveillance project. Case definition For the purpose of this study, the neonatal period wasextended to 60 days of life so that late diagnoses werenot missed, thereby optimizing the capacity to identify the maximum number of cases. All cases were laboratory-confirmed by at least one of the followingtests: 1) Culture 2) HSV IgM3) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in an infant equal to or less than two months (60 days), born between October 1, 2000 and September 30,2003, who demonstrates one of the following: localized infection involving the skin, eyes or mouth, disseminated infection: a) to central nervous system (CNS) b) to organs other than CNS.

For the 47 infants with known virus type and type of infection, localized infections were more likely to be caused by HSV-1,while disseminated infections were more likely to be caused by HSV-2 (p=0.017). For the 46 infants with known virus type and age of diagnosis, 19 of 28 HSV-1infections (67.9%) were diagnosed after the first week of life, while eight of 18 HSV-2 infections (44.4%) were diagnosed in this time frame (p=0.116). Of the 56 neonates with known treatment information, 98.2% received treatment, all with acyclovir. In the first two months of life, 14 cases (24.1%) displayedobvious sequelae of infection, including seizures (9), encephalitis (10), microcephaly (2), and blindness (1). The overall case fatality rate was 15.5%, with deathmore likely to occur among disseminated than localized cases (36.8% vs. 2.8%, p<0.001). Of the nine fatal cases, deaths occurred in infants with the following:known disseminated HSV infection (7), localized infection only, negative CSF results on PCR, and respiratory failure secondary to severe CNS insult listedas cause of death (1), and no information on the nature of the infant's infection available with an autopsy pending (1). All nine infants died within 24 days ofbirth, with seven cases having dissemination to the CNS, four with dissemination to the liver, and three with dissemination to the lungs. For the eight fatalcases with known virus type, six were typed HSV-2 while only two were typed HSV-1 (p=0.016).

No etiology was reported in over 70% of cases. At presentation, it is essential to perform all laboratory investigations to confirm the etiology. Background Even though the occurrence of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy is very rare, it can be associated with significant morbidity. Bilirubin encephalopathy is a condition thatis unfamiliar to most paediatricians practicing today. In the 1940s and 1950s, bilirubin encephalopathy was a common complication of hyperbilirubinemiaassociated with Rhesus (Rh) disease and occasionally with ABO hemolytic disease. With the introduction of exchange transfusions and Rh immunoglobulin,a reduction in the occurrence of bilirubin encephalopathy was noted. Also, better antenatal monitoring and availability of intrauterine bloodtransfusion has eliminated most cases of erythroblastosis fetalis secondary to Rh disease. Phototherapy has drastically reduced the need forexchange transfusions. Despite this, in the last several years, reports of bilirubin encephalopathy associated with extremely high serum bilirubin levels haveincreased (Penn et al., 1994, MacDonald et al., 1995, Maisels et al., 1995). In most cases, term infants appeared to be healthy and breast-fed with noevidence of obvious hemolytic disease (Rh disease or other antibody-related hemolysis). Based on epidemiological studies, a number of risk factors have been found to be associated with severelive births. This represents a rate that is closer to that reported by the United Kingdom (two per 100,000 live births) than by the United States (20-50 per 100,000live births). Over a third of these infections were disseminated cases, with an overall case fatality rate of 15.5%. The results of this surveillance project have a number of public health implications. Not only is the predominance of neonatal herpes cases attributed to HSV-1 consistent with findings from a growing body ofresearch that indicates an increase in the proportion of genital herpes cases attributed to HSV-1, but the data also shows that herpes vaccine and drug developmentresearch for genital herpes needs to account for HSV-1 and HSV-2 genital infections, and demonstrate the effectiveness against both. In addition, study resultsoutline the challenge of preventing neonatal HSV infection and implications for prenatal screening, given that eight out of 20 mothers were unaware of theirherpes infection prior to delivery, and obvious genital lesions were present in only one out of 58 cases during the intrapartum period. As per the project's fifth objective, surviving cases will continue to be followed annually for three years inorder to evaluate the overall health and developmental consequences of neonatal HSV infection.

Results Of the 178 cases of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia that were reported in 2003, 143 met the criteria for inclusion, eight are still pending review, 19 were duplicates and a further eight cases were discarded.The cause of severe hyperbilirubinemia was identified in less than a third of the cases (42/143). The etiologies included: ABO incompatibility (28), G6PDdeficiency (7), other blood group incompatibility (2), urinary tract infections (2), spherocytosis (1), pyuvate kinase deficiency (1) and congenital hypothyroidism(1). The average peak bilirubin reported was 477 \u00b5mol/L with a range of 137-773 \u00b5mol/L. The infant with a bilirubin level of 137 \u00b5mol/L required an early exchange transfusion. Of the 143 confirmed cases, 126 neonates required phototherapy, 33 had an exchange transfusion while seven had transfusions ofpacked RBC's. Non-standard treatments included IVIG, albumin and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia continues tooccur in term neonates. In a significant proportion ofhyperbilirubinemia in the newborn. These include jaundice presenting in the first 24 hours, jaundice noted at discharge from the hospital, previous sibling with jaundice, gestational age between 35 and38 weeks, breast-feeding and infant bruising and cephalhematoma (Dennery et al., 2001, Newman et al., 2000). Additional risk factors identified bylaboratory investigations include Rh and ABO incompatibility and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The frequency of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia during the current era has not been well documented.Attempts to better quantify its frequency, etiologies and associated risk factors in Canada would be of value prior to identifying strategies for risk reduction.Information obtained from a screening program for the detection of G6PD deficiency or routine determination of blood group and Coombs' analysis on cord bloodmay help to achieve risk reduction. Objectives The main study objective is to obtain epidemiological data on the incidence of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy, the burden of illness with regard to medical treatment(phototherapy, transfusions and exchange transfusions), and the neurodevelopmental outcome. Attempts will be made to identify the timing ofpresentation of jaundice, as well as the etiology and associated triggering or risk factors. This information will help in the development of prevention strategies(G6PD deficiency screening program, cord blood group and Coombs' test and educational programs).

This is partly attributable to incomplete evaluation of these infants at the time of admission. This finding highlights theimportance of a complete hematological workup at the time of presentation, including a CBC, peripheral smear, screen for maternal and infant blood group, Coombs' testing and a G6PD screen. ABO incompatibility and G6PD deficiency were identified as important etiological agents inscreened infants. These findings suggest not only that consideration should be given to implementing routine neonatal screening, but alsothat increased awareness and appropriate feedback to practicing physicians responsible for care of such neonates are needed. Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and its associated long-term neurological sequelae is a potentially preventable disorder. Several of thecases in this study were neurologically abnormal at the time of presentation. Although this study wasn't designed to assess the incidence of long-term neurological disease, such as kernicterus, a subsequent study addressing questions pertaining to the prevalence of kernicterus and its associatedmorbidity would be invaluable.

Campbell, MSc, MD, University of T oronto, Department of Paediatrics, Saint Michael's HospitalPrader-Willi syndrome (January 2003 to December 2004) Highlights Preliminary data results suggest a prevalence of 1:6,700 to 1:10,000. As a result of increased awareness in the paediatric community, older PWS patients are being confirmed. Diagnosis is now confirmed more often by improved genetic testing than by clinical evaluation. Background Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), an abnormality of chromosome 15, is the most common monogeneticcause of obesity (estimated at 1:10,000 to 1:15,000)with hypothalamic dysfunction leading tohyperphagia and consequent obesity with secondarysequelae of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, sleepapnea, and potential death. Prevalence data inPWS is not well known in Canada, but is drawnfrom estimates on other geographical locales, orsmall population studies. Knowing the trueCanadian PWS incidence and clinical status ondiagnosis will allow for a better understanding ofthe challenge to be faced and will help with futurehealth-care planning, both on an individual level(intervention strategies) and on a population basis(resource planning), regarding socio-economicsupport, design and obesity prevention strategyprogramming. Objectives 1) T o determine the incidence and the mean age of PWS diagnosis in Canada.40C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S 2) T o ascertain the method of PWS diagnosis: clinical and/or genetic. 3) T o create an awareness in the scientific community of PWS. Case definition Any child up to and including 18 years of age with newly diagnosed PWS confirmed clinically (PWSclinical score), and/or genetically (methylation and/or FISH [fluorescent in situ hybridisation] test). A clinical diagnosis * of PWS relies on a score derived from major and minor criteria: < 3 years: 5 points (4 from major criteria) > 3 years: 8 points (5 from major criteria) *See www.cps.ca/english/cpsp/studies/prader.htm for complete clinical scoring Discussion The PWS incidence is predicted at 22 cases per year. Preliminary data results suggest that so fartwo-thirds of this predicted number are being identified. Interestingly, the study also identified 17 PWS cases from previous years, providingimportant comparative data needing further analysis. Additionally, two of the patients confirmed genetically in 2003 were 14 and 39 years of age. Asa result, the average age of diagnosis (5.4 years) is high for the 2003 cohort, compared to 2.33 years for confirmed cases diagnosed prior to the initiationof the study. Now the trend in the paediatric community is toward a genetic diagnosis (54.5% in 2003 vs. 42.8% in previous years), which isreducing the age of confirmation of PWS diagnosis to 1.4 years compared to 2.33 years previously. In subsequent years, this average age of diagnosis willundoubtedly go down even further, as more and more children will be diagnosed genetically. With new genetic testing, confirmation is now more readily available, allowing for earlier diagnosis andtreatment. Early establishment of environmental control and behavioural management will make great strides in improving the health and well-being ofchildren and youth affected with Prader-Willi syndrome.

The vast majority of confirmed cases were infants and toddlers with intermediate and dark skin, who had been exclusively breast- fed without vitamin D supplementation. These results indicate that despite the current Canadian Paediatric Society recommendation that exclusively breast-fedinfants receive vitamin D supplementation (400 IU/day; 800 IU/day for infants living north of the 55 th latitude), rickets remains a major public health problem in Canada. Background Vitamin D is necessary for calcium homeostasis and for mineralization of the growing skeleton. A deficiency in vitamin D during childhood isassociated with potentially significant clinical consequences, as it leads to a mineralization defect of the growth plates (rickets) and of bone tissue(osteomalacia). Poor linear growth and skeletal deformity are hallmarks of vitamin D deficiency during childhood, in addition to hypocalcemicseizures, abnormal dentition, and delayed developmental milestones. The disease is entirely preventable through such simple measures asensuring adequate dietary intake of vitamin D or administration of a daily supplement. Recent literature has proposed that the incidence of vitamin D deficiency rickets is rising in manycountries worldwide, and clinical experiences suggest that Canada may be no exception. This isdespite the regulated, Canadian public health policy that all fluid dairy products (excluding yogurt drinks) are fortified with vitamin D, as infants and childrenliving in Canada cannot depend upon adequate skin exposure to sunlight for vitamin D synthesis. Furthermore, the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS)has recommended that all exclusively breast-fed infants receive a daily supplement of oral vitamin D, since breast milk is not a rich source of this nutrient.Despite these preventive measures, vitamin D deficiency rickets appears all too frequently in Canada, with certain geo-ethnic groups continuingto be at heightened risk for developing the disease. The main purpose of this study has been to determine the incidence of vitamin D deficiencyrickets among children living in Canada by seeking reports of all newly diagnosed cases between July 2002 and June 2004. Objectives 1) T o ascertain the incidence of simple vitamin D deficiency (nutritional rickets) among childrenliving in Canada by identifying all newlydiagnosed cases over a two-year period. 2) T o obtain demographic and medical information to facilitate the identification of children at riskfor developing the disease. 3) T o evaluate the efficacy of current strategies to prevent the development of the disease in Canada. 4) T o supply data that will assist with the development of novel public health policies to prevent nutritional rickets among children living in Canada. Case definition Children up to and including 18 years of age withcalcipenic rickets secondary to simple vitamin D deficiency (also known as nutritional rickets).42C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Inclusion criteria 1) Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD)2) Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase Exclusion criteria 1) Vitamin D deficiency rickets associated with underlying disease, such as fat malabsorption, liver disease and renal insufficiency, and with illnesses necessitating total parenteral nutrition. 2) Vitamin D deficiency secondary to heritable disorders of vitamin D metabolism, including: 1-hydroxylase deficiency (pseudo-vitamin D deficiency rickets, PDDR) vitamin D receptor defects (hypocalcemic vitamin D resistant rickets, HVDRR). 3) Phosphopenic rickets of any etiology (where hypophosphatemia is the primary cause of the rickets, and not due to calcipenic rickets withsecondary hyperparathyroidism). Results Between July 2002 and December 2003, there were 111 reports of vitamin D deficiency rickets amongchildren living in Canada, of which 69 were confirmed cases, 21 were duplicates, ten were discarded because of failure to meet the inclusioncriteria and 11 are still under review. Summaries of the results for 2003 and the cumulative data are presented in T ables 27 and 28. Demographic data The majority of confirmed vitamin D deficiency cases (49%, 34/69) were from Ontario, with an additional 16% from Alberta, 13% from Quebec, and the remaining 22% divided among British Columbia,Manitoba, Northwest T erritories, Nunavut, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia. There were no reported cases of rickets from the Yukon, NewBrunswick or Prince Edward Island. The gender was indicated for 97% of the cases, with 45% being female and 52% male. The mean age at diagnosiswas 1.46 years (0.95 standard deviations, SD; range 0.10-6.34). Sixteen percent (16%) of the cases had immigrated to Canada in the months preceding diagnosis. Thirty-three percent (33%)of the confirmed cases were Black, 14% were First Nations, 13% were Middle Eastern, 10% were Inuit, 9% were Caucasian, and 1% were Asian,while the ancestry was not indicated in the remaining 20% of cases. The mean maternal age at the time of delivery was 29 years (SD 6.3;range 18-39). Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency Eighty-six percent (86%) of the confirmed cases were classified as intermediate or dark-skinned.However, fair-skinned children living in Canadawere not exempt from developing the disease, asthey comprised 12% (8/69) of the confirmed cases.Skin colour was not indicated for 3% of the cases.Fourteen of 71 mothers were veiled during, andfollowing, pregnancy. Physicians reported that85% of the cases had been breast-fed, while thefeeding status was not indicated in the remainingconfirmed cases. As expected, the vast majorityof the cases (86%, 59/69) had not receivedvitamin D supplementation prior to thedevelopment of the disease. In the remaining14% of cases, supplementation with vitamin Dwas either not indicated on the case report form orwas unreliably administered by caregivers prior todiagnosis. Only 16% of mothers were documentedas having received vitamin D supplementationduring pregnancy. Following delivery, this numberfell to 6%, and the majority of mothers did notdrink milk in the post-natal period. Milk allergiesand sunscreen use did not appear to be significantrisk factors for vitamin D deficiency amongchildren in Canada, as only three of the confirmedcases manifested a milk allergy, while frequentsunscreen use was documented in only two of thecases.43C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Clinical and biochemical features at diagnosis The most frequent signs and symptoms at diagnosis included: skeletal deformity (46%), seizures (15%), failure to (10%) and delayedmilestones (3%). The remaining 12% of cases presented with an incidental discovery of rickets (i.e., identification of a rachitic thoracic cage at the timeof x-ray for a respiratory infection). T wenty-nine percent (29%) of patients presented with a combination of these signs and symptoms. Analysisof the serum biochemical parameters of bone and mineral metabolism prior to initiation of vitamin D therapy revealed a mean alkaline phosphataselevel of 1,306 U/L (range 296 to 4,969). A 25- hydroxyvitamin D level prior to treatment was available in 48 of the 69 confirmed cases, giving amean value of 21.0 nmol/L (SD 14.4; range 1-58). Conclusions Over 18 months of this two-year surveillance study, 69 cases of nutritional rickets were confirmed among children, predominantly infants and toddlers, residingin Canada. Intermediate- and dark-skinned children who were breast-fed without vitamin Dsupplementation were at greatest risk for developing the disease, although cases of rickets amongfair-skinned children were also documented. A proportion of the mothers were veiled, and most did not receive vitamin D supplementation followingdelivery, nor did they ingest milk (thus eliminating a potential dietary source of vitamin D). Significant morbidity was present at diagnosis in all confirmedcases, including limb deformity, seizures, failure to thrive, fractures and delayed developmental milestones. While breast milk should continue to be advocated as the ideal nutritional source for infants and children, it must be recognized that breast milk is not a rich source of vitamin D. This becomes particularlyrelevant for infants living in northern countries. In view of our northern latitude, the CPSP has recommended since 1998 that all exclusivelybreast-fed infants receive supplementation with vitamin D (400 IU/day; 800 IU/day for infants living north of the 55 th latitude). However, these results suggest that the CPS position statement regarding vitamin D supplementation has not reached all of the general public and has not beenuniversally implemented by health-care providers. Though it is not surprising that children with the greatest number of risk factors for vitamin Ddeficiency were the most frequently diagnosed, it is surprising that this condition is being detected in a country with ready access to vitamin Dsupplementation and a clear recommendation from the country's national paediatric organization for prevention of the disease. Evidently, there is anurgent need for heightened awareness of rickets prevention among health-care providers, and education of the general public is warranted. Studiesto evaluate the success of educational interventions are a reasonable next step.

Advancing our understanding of acute CNS demyelination inchildren is of utmost importance given that these children may suffer significant acute and long-term morbidity, and are at risk for the subsequentdevelopment of the chronic autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). The study proposes to use the CPSP to gather case-specific data to document the clinical features,epidemiological characteristics, familial autoimmune profile, and the current medical care practices provided to children with acquired demyelinatingsyndromes. This initiative will provide a measure of the impact of CNS demyelination on Canadian children and aims to enhance care of affectedchildren by increasing awareness among Canadian paediatricians of CNS demyelination, and of MS in particular, facilitating prompt and specialized care forchildren with this disease.Principal investigator Brenda Banwell*, MD, Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Clinic, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of T oronto, 555 University (22 paediatric care facilities across Canada) Acute rheumatic fever (April 2004 to March 2007) \"In the current era of evidence-based, judicious use of antibiotics, ongoing surveillance of this now rare butserious condition is crucial.\" Acute rheumatic fever is a post-infectious collagen vascular disease affecting the heart, joints andcentral nervous system. It follows untreated group Astreptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis after a latent periodof approximately three weeks, but does not occurafter other GAS infections, such as skin infection(impetigo). Worldwide, acute rheumatic feverremains the commonest cause of acquired heartdisease in children, yet the incidence varies widelyfrom region to region, with the vast majority of casesnow occurring in developing countries. The incidence of acute rheumatic fever in developed countries has decreased dramatically since its lastpeak in the 1970s, but it has not disappeared andremains an important public health issue. The reasonfor its decrease is not fully understood. The decline inincidence in the early 20 th century had already begun prior to the introduction of effective antimicrobialagents, but common use of penicillin to treatsymptomatic sore throat, may have contributedsomewhat to the decline. Socioeconomic factors,New Studies in 200446C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S such as overcrowding and low income are known to be significant risk factors. The majority of cases ofrheumatic fever follow cases of pharyngitis due tospecific M serotypes of GAS, most commonly 1, 3,5, 6, 18, 19 and 24, and spontaneous fluctuation ofthe prevalence of these serotypes is known to occur. Rheumatic fever is not a reportable condition in Canada, and in the current era of evidence-based, judicious use of antibiotics, ongoing surveillanceof this now rare but serious condition is crucial. Rheumatic heart disease is a lifelong complication of the condition, which can lead to ongoingmedical and surgical needs and can interfere with employment, causing significant socioeconomic impact. However, the risk of developing rheumaticfever must be balanced against the risk of encouraging microbial antibiotic resistance, which is a growing problem in all developed nations andcarries its own impact. The study will gather Canadian data on the incidence of first-onset rheumatic fever in childhood and on currenttreatment practices from coast to coast. Principal investigator Christina G.

Alarmingly, less than 5% are ever reported to regulators.\" Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are increasingly recognized in North America and Europe as animportant cause of childhood morbidity and mortality,yet the true incidence of this problem is poorly defineddue to the lack of reporting. In the past, health-caresystems have relied steadfastly on the idea of voluntarysurveillance systems for the identification and reportingof ADRs. The success of these voluntary systems hasbeen poor, with an estimated 95% of all adverse drugreactions never being reported. In January 2004, theCPSP began active surveillance of ADRs with a goal ofgenerating sufficient numbers of case reports to derivemeaningful data for the study of serious and life-threatening ADRs in children. For this project, a serious and life-threatening ADR to the use of prescription, non-prescription, biological(immunoglobulins) products, complementary medicine (including herbals), and radiopharmaceutical products has been defined as a noxious and unintended responseto a drug which occurs at any dose and results in (1) patient hospitalization, (2) emergency department visit, (3) prolonged hospitalization, (4) persistent orsignificant disability or (5) death.

Four different types (OI types I-IV) arecommonly distinguished on the basis of clinicalfeatures and disease severity, and are frequently dueto mutations in type I collagen. Recently, three novelforms of OI with distinct clinical features have beenidentified and named OI types V-VII. The geneticbasis of the novel OI forms has not been elucidated.In the past, OI has been associated with significantmorbidity as patients frequently suffered tremendousphysical limitations due to recurrent fractures.However, with the advent of bisphosphonate therapyfor the treatment of children with OI, the prognosisfor young OI patients has improved dramatically. The current incidence of OI, including the novel OI forms, is presently unknown. The primary aim of this study is to identify the number of new cases of OI diagnosed over a one-year period throughthe Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program. Additional study goals are to: (1) identify patients in Canada with novel OI forms in order to obtainclinical and genetic information that may ultimately lead to mutation identification, (2) determinewhether a geographic distribution of OI in Canada exists, so that regions in need of a local OI intervention program can be identified, and (3) raisephysician awareness about OI in general, and the novel forms in particular, so that diagnoses of OI can be made in a timely fashion, and appropriate therapycan be initiated during the critical years of bone growth and development. Education of paediatricians regarding OI may also assist with the differentiationof an abused child from the child with bone fragility due to OI. Principal investigator Leanne M.

Infants with SCID usually present in the48C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S first few months of life with a history of infections that are persistent, recurrent, difficult to treat, or caused by unusual infectious agents. Early diagnosis of SCID is critical because the chances for successfultreatment by immune reconstitution are highest for infants who have not yet experienced severe opportunistic infections. Without prompt treatment,nearly all will die within the first year of life. While no Canadian data on the incidence of SCID is available, it would appear that the rate is higher in the Aboriginal population. Information on the incidence of SCID is required to make an evidence-based decision about the risks (notably disseminated BCG infection) vs. the benefits of offering BCG vaccine to First Nations and Inuit children onreserves with endemic tuberculosis. The objectives of this study are to estimate the incidence of SCID in the general population and in the Aboriginal population of Canada, and to describe the basic demographics, clinical featuresand outcomes of the Canadian SCID cases. The CPSP is the best way to achieve these objectives for two main reasons. First, most cases of SCID in Canada will be captured through this active surveillance mechanism, as the majority will bereferred to a paediatrician due to the severity of the disease, and second, because it is a prospective program, information such as Aboriginal ancestry,which is often not available through retrospective chart review, can be collected. Moreover, the study will raise the awareness of Canadian physiciansregarding the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment of SCID cases.

Results of the 648 responses (29%)confirmed that 150 (22%) paediatricians cared for achild involved in a motor vehicle crash while wearinga lap belt or a lap/shoulder belt. When asked howmany, they reported from one to 50, with a mean of2.2. Forty-seven (7%) paediatricians reported thatthe child was lap-belt syndromeincluding abdominal injuries (42), lumbar spineinjuries (23) and spinal cord involvement (9). When asked which physicians these children would encounter during their hospital stay, 89% believedthey would see an emergentologist, 87% of them believed thesechildren would be seen either by a paediatrician or a paediatric intensivist. Respondents indicated that patients affected with lap-belt syndrome would either receive care within their institution (62%) or be transferred to a paediatric trauma centre (38%). While only 29% of the surveys were returned, it is noteworthy that 47 paediatricians reported havingtaken care of children with lap-belt syndrome in thepast year and, in fact, may have taken care of morethan one child with these kinds of injuries. It isalso very encouraging to see that up to 87% of thechildren would encounter a paediatrician at somepoint during their hospitalization.As a result of these encouraging survey results, the CPSP Steering Committee approved a full two-yearstudy on lap-belt syndrome that began in September2003.

INoPSU provides a unique opportunity for simultaneous cross-sectional studies of rare diseases in populations with diversegeographic and ethnic characteristics. Currently worldwide, there are 13 national paediatric surveillance units that are full members of INoPSU:Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Switzerland, and Wales. TheCyprus/Greece surveillance unit is an affiliate member until such time as it fulfills the requirements of full membership. As well, the British OphthalmologicalSurveillance Unit is an associate member. Argentinaand Trinidad and T obago are currently developing surveillance units. The first formal INoPSU meeting was held in Ottawa in June 2000 followed by a second meeting in York,England, in April 2002. As a result of these successes, a third INoPSU meeting is planned for Portugal in the spring of 2004.

Threepsychosocial disorders have recently been monitored:Munchausen by proxy syndrome, conversiondisorder and early-onset eating disorder (in children5-13 years of age). The Munchausen by proxy syndrome study (2000-2003) has enabled documentation of thepresenting features and consequences for a sampleof 61 children. The study has also yielded someremarkable information on the impact diagnosingthis particular form of child abuse had on theclinician. Conversion disorder has been described in over 150 children during surveillance through the APSU(2002-2003). Of these children, 74% were femaleand the mean age was 11.8 years (range=3.0-15.9years). The clinical picture for most children wascomplex. Children presented with an average ofthree symptoms/signs, the most common were motorweakness/paralysis (40%), (25%). Many (55%) and/or fatigue (30%). The study hasdemonstrated that health and support needs ofaffected children can be very high. The ongoing study of early-onset eating disorder has confirmed 41 children (73% female) with determinedfood avoidance to date. Clinical features includeweight loss in 88% (mean loss of 6.7 kg), fear ofweight gain (76%) and excessive exercise (49%). Thisstudy is also currently being conducted through theCPSP , presenting an excellent opportunity for international comparison in the future. Britain This past year has seen several new studies come onto our orange card. Of particular importanceis the study into childhood tuberculosis (TB). TB notification rates are increasing in the UK, particularly in cities such as London where aquadrupling of notification has occurred over the last ten years. Several factors have contributed to this, including immigration from high prevalencecountries and HIV infection. This 13-month study will assess current incidence rates, how children are being managed, what services exist for children withTB, and importantly validate the current national TB surveillance scheme. In-house, 2003 saw the introduction of the Sir Peter Tizard Research Bursary. This bursary aims toencourage junior doctors to undertake research intorare paediatric disorders and is presented in the nameof one of the founders of the BPSU. The successfulapplicant this year will be examining theepidemiology on thyrotoxicosis. Cyprus/Greece The Cyprus/Greece Paediatric Surveillance Unitwas established in May 2001 with research projectsconducted from April 2002 to December 2003. Caseswere reported on West syndrome, Kawasaki disease,rickets, pertussis and pancytopenia. The unit is nowapplying for full membership at the 2004 INoPSUmeeting in Portugal. Germany Cerebral venous thrombosis in children was studiedto assess the association of risk factorsand underlying conditions malformations, and use of53C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S prothrombotic drugs) with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in children. Results were published in Circulation 2003;108: 1362-7 (Cerebral venous thrombosis in children - A multifactorial origin). From 1995 to 2002, 149 paediatric patients aged newborn to <18 years (median six years) with CVT were consecutivelyenrolled. In patients, and in 149 age- and gender- matched children with similar underlying clinical conditions but without CVT , the factor V G1691Amutation, the factor II G20210A variant, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and antiphospholipid antibodies,as well as associated clinical conditions, were investigated. Eighty-four (56.4%) of the patients had at least one prothrombotic risk factor compared with31 control children (20.8%; P<0.0001). In addition, 105 (70.5%) of 149 patients with CVT presented with an underlying predisposing condition. Onunivariate analysis, factor V , protein C, protein S, and elevated Lp(a) were found to be significantly associated with CVT . However, in multivariateanalysis, only the combination of a prothrombotic risk factor with an underlying condition (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.6), increased Lp(a) (OR 4.1, 95% CI2.0 to 8.7), and protein C deficiency (OR 11.1, 95% CI 1.2 to 104.4) had independent associations with CVT in the children investigated. CVT in children is a multifactorial disease that, in the majority of cases, results from a combination of prothrombotic risk factors and/or underlying clinicalcondition. Ireland The type I diabetes study is going into its second year and will compare current insulin figures to theprevious survey in 1997. A large number of reportshave been seen; the impression prior to analysis isthat there is a continuing increase in new onsettype I diabetes in children as in other countries. The last survey put the Republic of Ireland and NorthernIreland into the moderate to high group of countriesconcerning diabetes mellitus, and the results of the2003-2004 study are awaited with interest. The study on alcohol and children concluded that acute, severe alcohol ingestion by children resulted in hospital admissions and, of concern, produced a high number of adolescents, particularly girls, presentingto children's units in an intoxicated state. The results of this study will be presented at the spring meeting of the Irish Paediatric Association and have alreadygenerated some media interest. Knowing that a similar study is ongoing in the British unit, the IPSU put congenital toxoplasmosis on their card, in order to ascertain as completely as possible the frequency of this condition in Ireland . Latvia Latvia continues active surveillance in the following areas: hematology/oncology, endocrinology, nephrology and HIV/AIDS. Netherlands Of note in 2003 was the rise in the incidence of hemoglobinopathies compared to the surveillancenumbers in 1993. A national screening program for sickle cell disease and thalassemia will be set up. Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencysurveillance shows that the incidence is as expected and no children are missed by the tandem mass spectrometry screening in the northern part of theNetherlands where a pilot screening is conducted. New Zealand The continuation of a very high response rate,consistently 94 to 96%, demonstrates the interestexpressed by paediatricians in using the scheme for their research. It has also helped to secure a further54C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S three years of funding from the New Zealand Ministry of Health. Portugal The Portuguese Paediatric Surveillance Unit (PPSU) is a scientific branch of the Portuguese Paediatric Society, with no state institutional links. Based onthe British Paediatric Surveillance Unit, the PPSU was created in June 2000 and began active surveillance in April 2001. The population undernational surveillance is estimated to be 1,673,600 children and adolescents less than 15 years of age. The PPSU includes on its mailing list all registeredpaediatricians, paediatric surgeons, neurologists and cardiologists, as well as the residents of these specialties for a total of 1,506 participants.Notification is individual, not institutional. Both postal and electronic notification is available for the return of the postal card and the case inquiry. During the year 2003, the return rate of notifying cards oscillated between 20 and 25%, amountingto circa 300 cards returned monthly. Of the 3,340 cards returned in 2003, 145 (4.34%) participants reported cases. More than one hundred cardsare returned electronically each month. The confirmation of notified cases is not yet closed, as circa 50% of the case inquiries have not yet beenreturned. So far, the PPSU has been able to confirm the national dimension of the surveillance system. Data confirm the utility of including non-hospital-based physicians on the mailing list, particularly for someconditions under surveillance such as diabetes. The large mailing list includes every paediatrician (or related specialist) in the country, both active andretired, as well as residents. The PPSU knows that this decision has had a negative effect on the return rates, but feels that it has elements to suggest thatreporting has not been negatively affected. This factsupports the decision of keeping every member of the Portuguese Paediatric Society on the mailing list,despite low return rates, at least for the time being. Switzerland In July 2002, shaken baby syndrome was included inthe SPSU program (under the scientific directionof Dr Ulrich Lips, paediatric university hospital, Zurich). The goal of the study was to ascertain the incidence of children presenting with typicalsymptoms or \"forme-fruste\" of shaken baby syndrome and to sensitize the medical profession to this special type of infantile abuse. Unfortunately, in Switzerland,incidence data relating to this syndrome is not available. The public ministry of the Zurich district is the only one (approximately 17% of the Swisspopulation) that inventoried about ten cases in the years 1999-2001. During this same time frame, the paediatric hospital of Zurich had three children withsevere shaken baby syndrome. The number of clinical findings should be higher as the syndrome is not well known. The case definition bases itself on thefollowing points: 1) clinical symptoms (bulging fontanel, convulsions, disturbances, impaired conscience); 2) eye examination signs (unilateralor bilateral retinal and/or vitreous hemorrhages); 3) medical imagery signs tomodensitometry/sub-dural or sub-arachnoidal hematomas parenchymatouslesions (differentiation of gray/white/MRI matter, contusions, shearing injuries, etc.); 4) clinical history (child shaken in the sagittal direction). Depending onthe situation, a child deceased as a result of a shaking trauma is not transferred to a clinic but rather directly to a medical legal institution where datacollection is carried out simultaneously with these institutions. From July to December 2002, seven shaken baby syndrome cases were reported inchildren six months old or less, the average age being 5.3 months. T wo children succumbed very quickly, another did not present any clinical or radiologicalsequelae at the time of hospital discharge, and four55C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S had neurological sequelae. In 2003, only five cases were declared. Long-term follow-up is undertakenthrough a second questionnaire that is sent nine months after the initial trauma. Wales The incidence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis based on reporting to the WPSU in the first six monthssuggests an incidence of five per 100,000 population under the age of 16 years. This is lower than expected and approximately half the incidence rate seen inthe previous UK study of hospital referred juvenile arthritis. It is likely that there is under-reporting, but it is also possible that these six months may beunrepresentative and that the incidence may be different when looked at over the intended two years of the survey period. The number of children referredfor physiotherapy, occupational therapy and orthotics is lower than expected (ideally all patients with a diagnosis of juvenile arthritis should receive specialistadvice from a paediatric physiotherapist experienced in dealing with juvenile arthritis). The numbers of patients receiving disease-modifying drugs and anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor) treatment is appropriate for a newly diagnosed population.56C P S P 2 0 0 3 R E S U L T S Call for New Studies Research opportunities Wanted Investigators to initiate new CPSP studies on childhood disorders that are high in disability, morbidity, mortality and economic costs to society, despite their low frequency. The paediatric community to take up the challenge of proposing a wide range of research studies. Interested individuals prepared to assume a leadership role in developing protocols and analyzing study data. The tool The CPSP is: A well-established, timely, cost-effective surveillance infrastructure. A multi-faceted surveillance tool capable of collecting reliable data in a variety of different fields. An effective means of monitoring low-frequency, high-impact diseases and conditions. Track record An 83% overall initial response from more than 2,300 paediatricians. An impressive 96% data completion rate for the 583 cases reported in 2003. High duplicate reporting rate (21.3%) assuring case ascertainment and participant commitment. International flavour Be part of INoPSU (International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units), a growing network of national paediatric surveillance units that exists in 13 countries around the world. T ake advantage of international collaboration, as INoPSU studies provide a remarkable opportunity to compare similar data and learn more about rare diseases worldwide. Looking for ideas? Here are a few examples of studies suggested through the program evaluation survey: Abdominal wall defects - gastroschisis Biliary atresia Brachial plexus Circumcision Laryngeal papillomatosis Neonatal Listeria infections Kawasaki disease Severe hypernatremia Severe iron deficiency in preschoolers Sudden death in asthma T ype 1 diabetes The potential for new studies in different paediatric subspecialties is endless.
