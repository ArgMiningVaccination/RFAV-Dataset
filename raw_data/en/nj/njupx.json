For some time I have worked as a legal assitant to Gregory Batcheller, General Council to DeNovaStella AB, with medicina l legal issues, with particular focus on natural remedies. His mentorship inspired me to write this paper. I am very grateful for his guidance. My academic tutor, Professor Kjell-\u00c5ke M od\u00e9er, helped me transubstansiate my legal interest in the subject area into a hist orical one. He has supervised and lead me through my work with interes ting historical perspectives and ideas. I thank him for his patience and inspiration. I have recieved advice and ideas from the personnel of th e Swedish Medical Agency at seminars on natural remedies held in Stockholm in October of 2004. In particular, I wish to aknowledge Maria Sz rimai for an interest ing lecture at the seminar and for takning time to answer my questions, as well as the Farm Dr Jan G Bruhn whom I hade the privilege to speak to at said seminar and who provided me with interesting insights into the subject. Gunnel Wallin and Karin Dutina of the Committee for Alternative Medicine allowed me to attend a meeting with repres entatives of the Indus try, and for this I am very grateful. I was witness to so me very interesting discussions which stimulated my further research into certain subject areas. Though I have not had the opportunity to meet with her in person, I wish to mention Motzi Ekl\u00f6f as a spec ial source of inspiration. He r thougths and insights in the subject of complementary medicine ha ve been an important foundation to my own legal views in this paper.

Lund in October 2005 Hedda Lidgard 2 Summary Swedish consumers are increasingly intere sted in Complementary medicines, yet the Swedish legal attitude appears reluctant to these traditional methods. This thesis examines the historical roots of the al leged Swedish attitude and investigates whether Swedish law and practice is in line with EU requirements. Focus is on the Caregivers and restrictions surrounding their practice and also on the restrictions regarding Complementary medicines used by the actors. The historical exposition shows a parallel development in the field of medicine in most countries during many centuries in ancient times. However, a major deviation occurred in Sweden compared to other European countries in that the Swedish licensed practitioners were given state monopoly at a very early stage. In 1663, a private medical guild, Collegium Medicum, was set up, which changed into a public and official institution only twenty odd years la ter. The Swedish Medical enactments of 1688 constituted a complete monopoly for the Licensed practitioners in the field of medicine. The reason was not an urge to protect the public from harm, but rather to safeguard groups of qualified professionals and their ability to earn a living. The 1688 legislation was not replaced un til 1915 - more than 225 years later. The 1915 Quackery Law eliminated th e medicinal monopoly, legalizing professional health care practice by Pa ramedical practitione rs, yet introduced restrictions for them in dealing with severe health conditions. In parallel, requirements on Science and Verified Expe rience have in reality prevented the Licensed practitioner from working outside Conventional medicines. History presents an explanation for the lack of acceptance and respect for Paramedicinal practitioners and Compleme ntary medicines in Sweden. In other European countries Complementary medici nes have been tole rated and accepted since long. The methods have been - and con tinue to be - taught at universities and practiced by licensed professionals. The historical events give a persp ective when investigating the Swedish contemporary legal situation. Swedish national law has been forced to bow to the more tolerant attitude found within the Eur opean legislation. Yet, in many situations Swedish law presents narrow interpretations: There is a lack of fiscal neutrality for Complementary medicines compared to C onventional medicines. Restrictions on Licenced practitioners use of Complementar y medicine also cl early distinguishes Sweden from the rest of Europe, whereas the exclusion of certain treatments and certain groups of patients for Paramedicinal practitioners appears to be in line with EU law. The overall conclusion is that Swedish law is in line with EU standards, but that certain attitudes and practices must be revised. Whether the Licensed medical practitioners like it or not, it seems that Complementary medicine is becoming more and more incorporated in the consci ousness of the public and gaining the acceptance of society at large. 3Table of Contents 1.

Background QUACK , one who fraudulently misrepresents his ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers.1 A growing number of people, who are incr easingly disenchanted with the sterile world of modern Conventiona l medicine are turning to (natural) alternatives. The reasons for this may include the increasi ng difficulty in getting the traditional professional help at hospitals and care centr es which is due to lack of practitioners. The care that is available is often impe rsonal and the time available for individual patients limited. Studies show that the use of Complement ary medicines has continuously increased since at least 19752. This growing interest is also reflected in legislation in most European countrie s which purports to protect consumers from quacks and their \"wonder drugs\". The question arises, however, whether ce rtain European countries do not have too restrictive an attitude towards all medications and practitioners not falling under the strict contemporary definitions of Conventional medicine and licensed medical practitioner. Should everything falling outside these categories be considered quackery? One can divide medicinal remedies in to three categories: those that are respected, those that are tolerated and those that are not tolerated. This paper is interested only in those falling into the second and third categories - that is, those which are not completely respected. In order to understand the status of these, it is often necessary to examine first category and see what falls outside of this. The same type of categorization can be made regarding the Caregivers tied to these remedies. There are those that are respected, the licensed medical practitioners; those that are tolerated; the therapists; and finally those that are not tolerated at all in today's medicinal world. 1.1.2. Purpose The general purpose of this thesis is to examine whether the Swedish attitude towards Complementary medicines is defe ndable within a European perspective. This can be further divi ded into three parts: To research the historical aspects of the development of Complementary medicines and to understand why the legal situation is what it is today; To explore the legal situation a nd current Swedish law regarding complementary remedies, and the at titudes towards it; and finally 1 Dorland, W., Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary , Edition 28, WB Saunders Company, Philadelphia 1994. 2 SOU 2004:123, Ett nationellt register \u00f6ver yrkesut\u00f6vare av alternativ eller komplement\u00e4rmedicin, page 39. 6 To compare the Swedish position to th e EU legislation and other Memeber States' national legislations in use today. The connecting thought that will run thr ough all three sections will be the expression quackery as it has been used through the centuries. I will implicitly be investigating which types of remedies have been seen as quackery through the ages and whether these attitudes have changed or will have to change because of the general cultural impact from neighbouring countries and the Swedish entry into the European Union. 1.1.3. Method The method used in the initial chapter will be the historical method . This means putting the legal situation and the ju dicial enactments of today in a context, without which the law becomes a merely technical phenomenon.3 I will mainly refer to literary and legislative sources and try to categorize views concerning Complementary medicines in terms of ge nerally accepted historical periodisation. I will briefly summarise the historical facts and events occurring between ancient times and today's Post-modern situation a nd try to explain developments regarding Complementary remedies in the light of these facts and in a diachronic manner. I will then move on to a traditional legal method as I explore the Swedish and European legal situation as it is today. This will be done synchronically, by examining law, cases and doctrine appli cable to the purpose of the thesis. I will conclude by using a comparative method , meaning that I will be comparing Swedish legislation and attit udes towards Complementary remedies to those of other European count ries and exploring the reas ons for the differences, if any. 1.1.4. Material / Research situation The main source of information for the first part of my thesis will be historical publications, both in the sense of those written at different historical times and contemporary historical literature. Examples of the latter are \"Medicinens \u00f6ga\" by Karin Upsala Univesity, and The greatest benefit to mankind; a medical history of humanity fr om antiquity to the present , by historian Roy Porter5. I will be examining historical legislation and case-law when available and applicable. It should be noted that legal doctrine on the subject is scarce. In the second part, rules and regulations in force in Sweden and directives and legal acts of the European Union will be the primary sources, as well as case-law and doctrine discussing these enactments. Al so with respect to recent development it is difficult to find legal writing on the su bject. I have to some extent relied on the Swedish Government Official Report SOU 2004:123, Ett nationellt Johannisson, K., Medicinens \u00d6ga, ePan, Stockholm 1990. 5 Porter, R., The greatest benefit to mankind, a medical history of humanity from antiquity to the present, HarperCollins Publishers, London 1997. 71.1.5. Delimitations Bearing in mind the limited length of this thesis, not all Complementary medicinal products or methods can be disc ussed; the focus will therefore be on two of them: Natural remedies and Homeopathic products and methods. I shall try to follow the development of attitudes toward s these products and towards the main figures tied to them in the course of history, though I will also touch on other products throughout the paper. Events occurring before modern times will be discussed with the utmost brevity in the historical part of the paper. This thesis will not be concerned with e xploring in any great detail the history of Complementary medicines in countries othe r than Sweden. However, a comparative section regarding the current s ituation in other count ries is of interest in helping me to reflect in my Analysis on the defe nsibility of the situation in Sweden. 1.1.6. Definitions Products and methods Medicinal products: products which are intended for administration to human beings or animals in order to prevent, dete ct, palliate or cure disease or symptoms of disease or to be used for a similar purpose.6 Conventional medicine: the science and the medicina l methods taught in Sweden in State colleges and university, whic h is based on Science and Verified Experience.7 Complementary medicines: method falling outside of Conventional medicine, a medicine, which, unlike the Conventional medicine is not based on Science and Verified Experience. In this thesis, I will not make a distinction between alternative and Complementary medicines, unless specified, but instea d I wish to use the term simply as a contrast to Conventional medicine. With regards to the term Complementary medicines, these consist of an extremely large number of different medicinal methods, and the expression is very dynamic. It can change to include or exclude any methods depending on the time period in question. Acupuncture: (from Latin acus: a point + pungere: to prick8) the Chinese practice of insertion of need les into specific exterior body locations to relieve pain, to induce surgical anaesthesia, and for therapeutic purposes.9 Naprapathy: (from Czech napravit: to corre ct + Greek pathos: suffering10) a system of therapy employing manipulati on of connective tissues (ligaments, muscles, and joints) and dietary measures; said to facilitate the recuperative and regenerative processes of the body.11 6 http://www.mpa.se/eng/medical_products/natural_remedies/index.shtml , (February 2005). 7 http://www.smarta.nu/ ordbok/default.asp , (February 2005).

W., Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary , supra 1. 10 Fakta och r\u00f6ster alternativ medicin , supra 8, W., Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, supra 1. 8Zonetherapy: (also known as reflexology) the treatment of a zone system (a limited part of the body, for ex ample feet, ears, teeth) whic h are believed to reflect the entire body. The method is used to locate problem areas as well as for treatment of disorders.12 Natural remedy : Medicinal product in which the active ingredient or ingredients derive from natural sources, have not been processed too highly and consist of part of a plant or animal, bacterial culture, mineral, salt or salt solution. Natural remedies (in Sweden) are products which are suitable for self-medication in accordance with tested nationa l tradition or th e tradition in countries close to Sweden with respect to drug usage. 13 Homeopathic product: Medicinal product prepared fr om homoeopathic stocks in accordance with a homoeopathic manu facturing procedure described by the European Pharmacopoeia or, in the absence thereof, by the pharmacopoeias currently used officially in the individual countries. 14 Homoeopathic products may contain single stocks or a number of stocks. The latte r are called complexes. Non-tolerable remedies: remedies falling outside of the tolerated complementary methods in any given county; remedies which are not accepted in a given society. Actors Licensed practitioner: those that are licensed a nd use one of the protected professional titles listed in LYHS's third chapter, health care providers not falling under any of the previously mentioned categories; thos e who commercially examine another's' health situation or treat another for illne ss by measures taken or prescribed with the purpose of preventing, curing or alleviating illness.15 Protected Professional Title: titles of the professi ons listed in LYHS 3:216. The professional titles may be used only by those who have a licence or have gone through the prescribed practical duties.17 Health Care Personnel: professionals that are li censed or use a protected professional title and those who take part in the care of patients in hospitals and other care facilities, or w ho assist licensed professionals , as well as apothecaries, emergency line personnel, groups of profe ssionals included by specific instructions and foreign Licensed practitioners. 12 SOU 1989:60, Huvudbet\u00e4nkande fr\u00e5n alternativemedicinkommitt\u00e9n , Stockholm 1989, page 185. 13 http://www.mpa.se/eng/medical_products/natural_remedies/index.shtml , (February 2005). 14 Directive 2004/27/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 amending Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use.

Science and Verified Experience: key term used to enable one to distinguish between Conventional medicine and Comp lementary medicine in Swedish law. Medical care: must have as its purpose the dia gnosis, treatment, and, as far as possible, cure of diseases or health disorders.18 The term \"medical care\" does not call for an especially narrow interpretation,19 and covers all provision of medical care including services provided by persons who are not doctors, but who provide paramedical services. Quack: one who fraudulently misrepresents his ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of di sease or the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers.20 1.1.7. Outline This thesis is divided into three main sections and a conclusion. The first section will deal with the historical aspects of Complementary medicines. I will explore what was considered quackery and Conventi onal medicine respectively in different eras. The historical examination will span a long time period, that between ancient times and today, but with a particular focus on the recent past. This section will provide a general understanding of the historical background to the legal situation. The second section will scrutinize the use and legal control of these remedies in both Sweden and the European Union. I will compare and contrast the European legal enactments with the Swedish. In se ction three, my earlier findings will be analyzed and discussed. I will conclude with my personal reflections and suggestions. 18 Case C-45/01, below note 202, paragraph 48. 19 Id., paragraph 49. 20 Dorland, W., Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary , supra 1. 102. The History of Medicines Our contemporary view of chronology can be said to see it as having a structure built on three successive knowledge paradigms: pre-modern times, the modernist 20th century and the post-modernist 21st century, though these eras overlap and certainly do not change with the change of the centuries. In fact all three can be seen in the 20th century. The three knowledge paradigms can be seen in the great German 19th century philosopher Hegel's cons truction, which would regard the Idealistic 19th century structure as the thesis and the pragmatic, modern 20th century as the antithesis.21 For a few decades we have been in a creative and dynamic time period which can only be described as the sy nthesis, where we are returning to the past to create the future. In order for one era to understand another, it must be admitted that the passing of time has changed both living conditions and human mentality. 22 2.1. Pre-modernism - a European perspective on medicinal tradition Pre-modernism, more than anything, is a term used to contrast with events occurring in the modernist times. It can be seen as a way to define more clearly what modernism implies. It is therefore difficult to define pre-modern times as a certain time span. It is instead useful to look at those events occurring before the rise of modernism that are characteristically different fr om typically modern events. All events occurring before modernism can be treated in the pre-modernism section, though it is important to keep in mind that this division is overbroad, as it spans many centuries, going all the way back to ancient times. These will be treated summarily, due to both limited historical sources and limited size format of this paper. It can be of interest, since as long as there has been illness, man has been trying to cure it. The pre-modernist section will then be further divided up into sections, in order to make it more accessible. As the sources are limited, part of this section will have a more international character in order to establish general atti tudes towards medicine and its actors in the different eras. Also, all aspects of medi cine and all Caregivers will be explored, as the division of medicine into scientific/complementary is a recent one. 2.1.1. Ancient times Man first sought to find cures to illness in nature, mostly in the plant/floral kingdom. The medicine man was the doctor, the priest and the magician of the tribe. His cures included natural remedies and ritu als to drive away demons and please the Gods, since these were thought to have cau sed the disease in the first place. Many plants used in different parts of the world for thousands of years are still used today. 21 Mod\u00e9er, K.\u00c5., Det n\u00e4ra metod , Studentlitteratur, Lund 1994, page 23. 11The Sumerians, inhabitants of the areas around the rivers E uphrates and Tigris around 4000 B.C. are known to have used opium and thyme as medication. Cuneiform writing on clay tablets describes these and other drugs.23 The Sumerian culture and their knowledge of medicine was passed on to the Babylonians and Assyrians and the Babylonian king Hammu rabi instituted laws which included medical regulations. The code of Hammurabi applied th e principles of compensation and retribution in kind: if a slave died while under medical treatment, the practitioner had to provide a replacemen t, whereas if the deceased were not a slave, the doctor was to lose a hand.24 In addition to the drugs used by the Sumerians, coriander, cinnamon, garlic and saffron were used, and were prepared as decoctions, medicinal wine s, liniments and creams. 25 Medicine was not presumed to be connected to religion only, but also to astronomy. Our understanding of Egyptian medici ne and pharmacology is based on inscriptions on monuments a nd graves and papyrus rolls, the most important one being Papyrus Ebers26. It is thought to have been written around 1550 B.C. and includes some 800 recipes a nd lists 700 native and fore ign drugs, including aloe, wormwood and peppermint. These were prepared as decoctions , pills, creams and patches. Recipes for incense for temples, cosmetics and perfumes can also be found. It is, however, difficult to identify the drugs described in Papyrus Ebers, since these have been given code names in order not to disclose the priests' secrets. Medicine was practiced by priests who concocted dr ugs in special rooms in the temples.27 The Egyptians exported many medicinal plan ts that they cultivated, and they had some trade with foreign countries. Most importantly, it was the maritime Phoenicians that conducted tr ade in the products of the east and the south, and in their port Tyre, a flow of drugs from Me sopotamia, Arabia, China, India and the Mediterranean countries fl ourished. Another important commerce route was by land between China and India, and then through to Arabia. 2.1.1.1. The Greek and Roman medicinal evolution In Greek culture, medicine was also practi ced by priests. Offerings were made to Asklepios, who was the God of Medicine , and temples were built in his honour to which ill people came to be cured. Doct ors provided expert opinions in trial proceedings, although such evidence was not required by law.28 Greek medicine prospered around 500 BC, its most prominent representative being Hippocrates ( c. 460-377 BC), the founding father of medicinal science. All we know of Hippocrates is legend. The met hods used by Hippocra tes are preserved in a group of medical trea tises known collectively as the Hippocratic Corpus, 23 Olsson, S. (red.), \u00d6rtmedicin och v\u00e4xtmagi , Readers Digest AB, Stockholm 2001, page 13. 24 Crawford, C., Medicine and the law, Chapter 69 in volume 2 of Companion Encyclopaedia of the History of Medicine, Edited by Bynum, W.F., and Porter, R., Routledge, London & New York 1993, page 1620. 25 Olsson, S.

It is a compilation of 70 documents put together about 100 years after his death. He held the belief that illness had a physical and a rational explanation, thereby rejecting the views of his time that considered illness to be caused by possession of evil spirits or th e disfavour of the gods. His greatest contribution was that he regard ed medicine as scientific. 29 The principle idea of his work is Primum est non nocere , that is to say The most important is not to harm.30 Grounded on the Empedoclean principle of the four supposed elements: earth, air, fire and wa ter, the four constituent elements - or humours - in man were identified anal ogously as phlegm, bl ood, yellow bile and black bile, all of which had to be in corre ct proportion to one another. The elaborate general doctrine of the Four Humours endured through many centuries and is central to the tenets of the Hippocrati c Corpus. Though virtually worthless as a theory, it remained the fundamental prop of European medicine for over two millennia. 31 Theriaca Adromachi , a compounded pharmaceutical cr eated by the medical practitioner Andromachus of Crete in the first century AD, played an important role in Europe for more than 1500 years as an unrivalled universal drug.32 It contained many medicinal plants, oriental spices and balms, but also medicina l animal parts - snake flesh for example. The addition of this was typical of the way of thought of the era: it was supposedly an excellent cure against snake bites, but also, it had a symbolic meaning tied to Asklepios, God of Medicine, who used a snake in his remedies. The need for snake flesh for Theriaca was great, and the hunt for vipers was undertaken by special snake hunters. In the Middle Ages, these hunters belonged to specific guilds with their own decrees/ordinances in certain areas! A recipe for Theriaca can be found in Swed en's first pharmacopoeia of 1686. It is a composition of 66 ingredients, including cinnamon, saffron, pepper, Venetian turpentine, ginger, opium and drugs originating from fauna such as Italian snakes and glandular secretion from beavers. However, through the new Medicinal enactment (giftstadga) of 1876, which prohibited the use of opium in Theriaca concoctions, its use decreased in Sweden and came to an end at the turn of the century. 33 In 146 BC, Greece came under Roman supremacy. The Romans themselves had little interest in medicine, and this conti nued to be dominated by the Greek scholars. The Roman warriors treated illness with simple met hods relying on the Gods through prayer and offerings. Of course, the doctors accompanying the Roman legions on their crusades were given importa nt practical experience with surgical operations. It became the norm to have a Greek slave, knowledgeable in medicine in the rich patrician households, a \"servus medicus\". In the second century AD in Rome lived Claudios Galenos, a doctor whose teachings would mark medicinal science for more than a millennia. He further elaborated Hippocrates' teach ings on humoral pathology and the restoration of their balance with the use of medication. His ideas and the recepies for the concoctions were spread across the known world and it was thought that this was the goal of human medicinal art fulfilled. Through Arabic and Hebrew translations, his work survived the migrations. During the Medieval era, his teachings were the source of all medicinal knowledge. 34 29 Porter, R., The greatest benefit to mankind supra 5, page 55. 30 Olsson, S.

Medieval Europe Medical knowledge developed slowly in the Middle Ages. While the Ancient Romans , Greeks and Egyptians had pushed forward medical knowledge, after the demise of these civilisa tions, the momentum starte d by these people tended to stagnate and it did not develop at the same pace until the seventeenth/eighteenth centuries. However, the growth of towns in medieval Europe was accompanied by an increase in both the regulation of medicine and the policing of crime.35 The idea was to suppress private vengeance and to facilitate redress through law instead. From the Middle Ages, medical pract itioners organized themselves professionally in a pyramid with physic ians at the top and surgeons and apothecaries nearer the base, with other healers marginalized or seen as quacks.36 By the 14th Century, universities that could be classed as medical schools had developed in Western Europe; there students could study unde r a master physician. The University of Montpelier was one such university. Dissections of human bodies were carried out in these universities so anyone wanting to study medicine in the Middle Ages was not totally ignorant of facts about the human body. Public debates were also encouraged about medical issu es and it is known that some medical schools encouraged students actually to challenge the ideas of Galen os and Hippocrates .37 As a result of this refusal to ta ke what Galenos and Hippocrates had stated at face value some progress was made in the medical world. However, medicine became steeped in superstition and the Roman Catholic Church effectively dominated the direction the medical world took.38 Any views different from the established Roman Cat holic Church view could veer towards heresy with the punishments that entaile d. Therefore, when the Roman Catholic Church stated that illnesses were punishm ents from God and that those who were ill were so because they were sinners, few argued otherwise. The Monasteries In early medieval times, the monast ery system spread throughout Europe through different monastic orders. The monks copied medical authors from antiquity and translated Arabic documents into Latin.39 They practiced healthcare influenced both by Graeco-Roman medici ne and Arabic treatments. Even popular medicine was used and the monks had c onsiderable practical experience. Many monasteries had specific buildings used for caring for the ill and the novices were taught medicinal subjects in the mona stery schools. Medici nal plants were cultivated in the garden s of the monasteries. 40 Witchcraft41 Few crimes have been given as much attention by legal-historic al or historical research as the witch hunts in Europe. From the early 1400s to the early 1700s, men and - primarily - women were judged a nd executed for crimes, which we today 35 Crawford, C., Medicine and the law, supra 24, page 22. 36 Porter, R., The greatest benefit to mankind , supra 5, page 11. 37 Olsson, S.

In many cases, the defendants were guilty only of concocting medications - what we would call prac ticing Complementary medicine today. Witches and sorcerers were thought to be close to a natural magic, and in an agrarian society, their special knowledge was ofte n used. Around 1500, a handbook of witch hunting - Malleus Maleficarum - was written by two monks. This led to spectacular executions, with the alleged criminals being burnt at the stake or drowned in public. All the Swedish medieval laws, Lanskapslagarna and Landslagen, treated the subject of witchery. The punishment was death.42 Witchery was a serious crime, a religious crime. In the 16th and 17th century, activities such as gathering healing herbs in the moonlight were very likely to lead to the death penalty. In Sweden, the first known witchery processes occurred again around 1500.43 Witch hunting had almost completely ended before the coming into force of the new Swedish Law of 1734, though it was st ill a punishable crime in the law.44 The then king (Gustav III), however, proposed its removal in 1778, and Parliament supported the motion. 45 2.1.1.3. The Antique Art of Medicine is Challenged The first man - after 14 centuries! - to ch allenge the theories of Hippocrates and Galenos, was the doctor and philosopher Philippus Aurelius Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim. 46 He was critical of classical medicine's representatives and provoked an enormous academic debate with his colleagues. Paracelsus burned Hippocrates' and Galenos ' works and lectured in German instead of academic Latin. In his struggle to ame liorate the art of medicine he gained knowledge from medieval alchemy and in troduced chemical medicines, whose \"quintessence\" was to give them medicinal value. 47 After Paracelsus' death, the battle between the followers of Galenos' medicinal views and the advocates for the new ideas that Paracelsus brought forth continued. The signature doctrine developed and held that nature itself always gave mankind a clue as to how her gifts should be used. The world was a pharmacy and God its apothecary. Paracelsus was amongst the most ardent supporters of this theory. Herbs with spherical flowers cu red head aches, and those with kidney shaped leaves cured kidney diseases. Flowers shaped as eyes cured ophthalmic diseases and winding, serpentine plants snake bites. The idea was Simila similibus curantur , i.e. likes cure likes. 48 This idea has been inherited by the homeopathic movement. 42 See for example \u00d6stg\u00f6talagen, V\u00e5dam\u00e5lsbalk en stena ihj\u00e4l. Roughly translated: If a woman is caught practicing witchery and this is confirmed by witnesses, she has forfeited her right to live and is to be stoned to death. 43 H\u00e4th\u00e9n, C., Stat och straff, supra 41, page 109. 44 132. 45 H\u00e4th\u00e9n, C., Stat och straff, supra 41, page 167. 46 Born in 1493, he took the na me Paracelsus after graduating as a doctor from the university of Ferrara, according to Porter, R., The greatest benefit to mankind supra 5, page 201. 47 Id., page 25. 48 www.homeopathic.org , (August 2005). 152.1.2. From Reformation to Revolution 2.1.2.1. Reformation It is here, in the 16th century, that we begin to see a dichotomy between Conventional medicine and Complementary medicine. Before this time they had been effectively the same, and during this period and for a long time thereafter they continued to evolve in parallel.49 Before the Swedish Reformation, which o ccurred in the 1520s , Swedish society was by and large agrarian50 making the distance betw een doctors considerable. Healthcare was tradit ionally a family affair, and shoul d anyone else be involved, it was the church. It was not until the 17th century that there was any attempt in Sweden to organize medicine on a nati onal level and it would not be until the second half of the 18th century before the family physic ian started to appear in the cities.51With the reformation and the change of the church's role, the Crown's interest in healthcare did expand.52 Religion strongly influenced de velopments duri ng this period.53 When Sweden abandoned Catholicism in the 16th century and became Lutheran, the monasteries were shut down and so was the monks ' medical work. There was a demand for freedom from the priests' supremacy, and from the tyranny of the Catholic church.54 During the next few centuries, it wa s instead the Lutheran priests who came to act as medical practitioners and who improved public health in Sweden.55 When the peasantry fell ill, they consu lted the traditional \"wise\" men and women, and when these didn't have solution, priest s were asked for help; thus not only with spiritual but also bodily problems.56 The church and its representatives existed throughout the country. The priests worked in a very close relation with the public, and knew all the members of their congregation/parish.57 Often, the priest was the only one in the district with any higher education. It wa s therefore understandable that the priests' medical effort/contributio n was tolerated and even encouraged by the public authorities. Peasantry also put their trust in other healers. Foreign frauds marketed their wonder drugs and miracle remedies to a gullible and distressed general public. These universal drugs sold by these quacks could be used for anything ranging from plague to cholera.58 49 Johannisson, K., Medicinens \u00f6ga 51 Johannisson, K., Medicinens \u00f6ga , supra 4, 53 H\u00e4th\u00e9n, C., Stat och straff, supra 41, page 53. 54 Id., page 59.

The Great Power Era During the 1600s, Sweden came to play a more active and dominant role in Europe than at any time before or afte r. Sweden became a Great Power in many senses. In foreign politics and in military aspects, economically and administratively, Sweden was equal to - if not superior to - other European countries.59 The personal royal power was given a large span of interpretation, and the nobility had expanded privileges in th e form of a preferential right to higher offices, and economical reliefs.60 However, Sweden was at the time going through some internal difficulties, especially with regard to the Crown's financial situation, and centralised bureaucracy greatly expande d during this time in order to control the problems.61 In 1663, four licensed pract itioners created the Collegium Medicum , a private society - a guild set up by the physicians themselves. Their mission was to organise the whole medical system. 62 Education in internal medi cine had been organised in the mid-century, but was so unsatisfactory th at it was necessary to have a foreign diploma in order to be accepted as a licensed medical practitioner.63 As a result of the medicinal ordinances of 1688, the formerly private society became public and official. With the increase in mercantilist64 thinking, the interest of the state in population questions increased, and with this, an interest in medicine as well. The strength of the state was defined as the access to capital, and manpower was the most important capital producing resource. 65 Therefore, medicine had to ensure the greatest number of healthy workers possible. The Collegium Medicum had the responsibility for supervision of doctors, pharmacists, midwives and barbers, and for preventing quackery - defined in accordance with the monopoly given in the medicinal ordinanc es, that is to say that a nyone acting outside of this monopoly was regarded as a quack. However, Collegium Medicum lacked real power. 66 The 1688 Medicinal enactments67 regulated the Collegium Medicum's activities and authorities. It also contained prohibitions on pharmacists practicing as doctors and spice dealers 68 selling pharmaceuticals. It thus constituted a complete monopoly in the field of medicine, though this , as we will see, was not followed in reality. This law was not re placed officially until 1915, more than 225 years later. 59 Behre, G., et al., Sveriges historia 1521 - 1809, supra 50 , page 74. 60 Id., page 86. 61 Id., page 87. 62 Nelson, M.C., En historia om v\u00e5rd f\u00f6rr , supra 52, page 37. 63 Id., page 37. 64 Mercantilism: the dominating economical system during the 18th century, which held that exports should exceed imports, domestic production should be encouraged, believed in economical regulations and protectionism and stressed what was important and useful for the State, according to Behre, G., et al., Sveriges historia 1521 - 1809, K., Medicinens \u00f6ga , supra 4, page 45. 66 Sver ige under den epidemiol - Medicinalf\u00f6rordningar av den 30 oktober 1688. 68 Kryddkr\u00e4mare, translation found on www.ddss.nu/ordbok (August 2005). Spice dealers were only allowed to sell dry goods such as coffee, flour, sugar and also things such as china, buttons and newspapers. 17In 1686, Sweden's first pharmacopoeia was published - \"Pharmacopoeja Holmiensis galeno-chymica\", which included a chapter describing chemical medicines.69 Though first intended as a pharmac opoeia only for apothecaries in Stockholm, Karl XI gave it a national status.70 The pharmacopoeia was the result of work done by the Collegium Medicum. At the end of the Great Power era, th ere were four Swedish Universities; Uppsala, Lund, \u00c5bo and Greifswald. Thes e were originally what can only be characterised as seminaries, but as a result of Enlightenment ideals, a secularisation process took place.71 Science became increasingly important, and with this, the science of medicine as well. Medical f aculties were inaugurated between 1640 and 1666 at each of the four Universities.72 The eighteenth century was a century of enormous change. European thought became overwhelmingly mechanistic as the natural philosophy of Isaac Newton was applied to individual, soci al, political, and economic life.73 The century saw the development of the philosophe movement,74 which articulated the full values of the European Enlightenment, including deism, religious tolerance, and political and economic theories that would dramatically change the face of European society. Europe itself changed from a household economy to an industrial economy. 75 This change, perhaps one of the most earth-s hattering transitions in human history, permanently altered the face of European society and family life. Finally, the century ended in revolution. The ideas of the philosophes were translated into new governments - one in France and one in America. 2.1.2.3. Enlightenment As a historical category, the term \"Enlight enment\" refers to a series of changes in European thought. It is one of the few hist orical categories that was coined by the people who lived through the era (most historical categories, such as \"Renaissance\", \"Early Modern,\" \"Reformation,\" etc., ar e made up by historians after the fact). 76 When contemporary people referred to their activities as \"Enli ghtened\", they meant that they were breaking fr om the past and replacing the darkness a nd ignorance of European thought with the light of truth. The period was filled with optimism and a strong belief in rationally changing society, to get rid of the old and replace it with the new (Voltaire). It is important to point out that it is duri ng the Enlightenment that re ligion's dominating role was phased out. As a result, purely religions cr imes, such as witchcraft, were removed from the penal code. 77 Mercantilism78 continued to be an important economic political theory for a large part of the century. 69 Olsson, S.

The scientific, utilita rian and empirical ideas so developing were steadily exported to the human sciences. In theories of personality, human development, and social mechanics, 17th century thinkers moved away from religious and moral explanations of human behaviour and towards an empirical analysis and mechanistic explanation of th e laws of human behaviour.82 However, Enlightenment medicinal scienc e suffered from the apparent paradox of great expectations, but disappointing results. Medi cine failed to match the achievements of experimental physics or chemistry, even though numerous medical authors sought to set their di scipline on scientific rails.83 In the public's opinion, the doctors were not regarded as having a monopoly on the knowledge of medicine until after 1870.84 The fact that the Medicinal Act of 1688 had supported and favoured doctors ove r other Caregivers' expense was a Swedish deviation from the European develo pment, but it is questionable to what degree it had really been put into practice. The legal framework controlled unauthorised healers and gave preceden ce to licensed, university educated physicians. The Medical Act confirmed the physicians' exclusive right to practice internal medicine. The royal decrees were not motivated by an urge to protect the public from harm, but to safeguard groups of qualified professionals and their ability to earn a living. 85 Well into 18th century Sweden, Conventional medicinal remedies were dominated by drastic methods of treatment such as blood-letting, emetics, strong laxatives and such. This was a reminiscence of the humour pathology's theories of the bodily fluids.86 In parallel, unlicensed healers combined superstition and a real knowledge of herbal remedies. One of the most commonly hired healers in the mid 1700s was Sven in Bragnum, who not only cured people and animals in his own area but from neighbouring provinces and even Norway and Denmark. Ill people from all social classes sought his help. Carl von Linn\u00e9 met him on his well documented trip to V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland. He found him to lack self-insight, but he was to be commended for not relying on superstitions and being accommodating with payment. 87 Maria Jansson, known under the name of Kisa-mor, is one of the best known natural medicinal practitioners of the first half of the 1800s. Her remedies were simple herbal preparations. The reputation of her wonder-working spread and in 1824 she was called to Stockholm to try curing an important person, in which she succeeded. Soon all of Society's 79 It is important to bear in mind that the in using the word \"science\" we are committing the sin of anachronism, since the word was not invented until the 1830s. 80 http://www.wsu.edu/%7Ede e/ENLIGHT/ENLIGHT.HTM (August 2005). 81 Outram, D. , The Enlightenment, supra 75, page 3. 82 Id., page 15. 83 Porter, R., The greatest benefit to mankind supra 5, page 248. 84 Engman, S., L\u00e4kekonst och Medicinens \u00f6ga , supra 4, page S.

In 1825 she was rewarded an official permission by Sundhetskollegium to practice medicine - a unique reward.88 The relationship between Licensed and unlicensed practitioners was characterised by extensive antagonism, and th e doctors argued forcefully against the unlicensed practitione rs, seen as quacks. The doctors in the Collegium Medicum sought to thwart quackery, as illustrate d by their actions in Stockholm in 1776. A survey was made of those practicing medicine and whet her they were licensed or not. The Collegium wanted executive power to fine contraventions of the law. Yet these attempts to expand their powers were met with resistance, and it was found that matters of this kind were to be settle d in an impartial court with the possibility of appeal. In 1797, the Collegium Medicum's aut hority as the organ to supervise health care increased, and it was ti ed to the public administration. 89 In the best of societies, it was thought, the State would not be needed, but until this was the reality, the best was a strong, centralised Stat e. It should be lead by an enlightened monarch and by sc ientists -Enlightened despotism. The Enlightenment demanded rational laws, where all citizens were to be treated equally. Voltaire's view was that prejudices should not be a llowed to govern what was criminal and he therefore acted forcefully for the secularisation of the law.90 In comparison to other European countries, it is important to bear in mind that larger structural changes came relatively late in Sweden. Industrialisation did not commence until the mid 1800s and Sweden conti nued to be an agrarian society with a sparse population. The availability of public health care, and its design, was naturally influenced by this. 2.1.2.4. The French Medicinal Revolution The Licensed practitioner of the 1700s was often portrayed by his contemporaries as a pompous, avaricious, uninformed person, paralyzed by prestige, but without the ability to cure. 91 Professional and monopolising actions during the 1780s made the Licensed practitio ners appear like an incarnation of everything that made the old regime odious.92 Criticism was not merciful. Voltaire maintained that diet was far more effective than the impotent Conventional medicine , and Rousseau believed that society needed neither doctors nor hospitals.93 There was a notion that the cause of disease was in society as such. Rousseau's thesis that civilization as such was ruining mankind's health was cogent: if the cau se was in society, then it could be eliminated. If disease had societal cause s, and freedom was the best societal condition, then mankind's health would be best under freedom, according to Rousseau's conception of the ideal state of things. This period was also politically tense and - in France - economically catastrophic. There was an underlying feverish mentality, bubbling under the 88 Id., page 39. 89 Ling, S., K\u00e4rringmedicin och vetenskap, Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis, Uppsala H\u00e4th\u00e9n, Stat och straff, supra 41, page 121. 91 Johannisson, K., Medicinens \u00f6ga , supra 4, page 75. 92 Id., page 76. 93 Porter, R., The greatest benefit to mankind supra 5, page 76. 20surface. Everything breathed of things to come. The Enlightenment's political and intellectual rationalism changed to an impatient irrationality and restlessness. The French medicinal revolution of 1790 can be said to have been a micro cosmos corresponding to the political revolution's macro cosmos. There was unlimited optimism and desperate attempts to make the visions reality. There was a wish to break away from the old medici ne. \"Medicine - magnificent and sublime in its aim - is empty, wooden and practically worthless, focuses on the wrong things, is unfair, uneven, and corrupted\"94 according to Georges Romme speaking at the National Convention of 1793. What instead ? This was formulated by Condorcet: the medicine that would be the revoluti on's contribution to mankind would be built on two principles. It would make health a human right. And it would be preventive rather than treatment-oriented. 95 As a typical stage in any revolution, ther e was aggressive, destructive criticism, in this case against the medical institutions, that is to say: the hospitals; all doctoral privileges, whic h were wiped out in 1791; medical education - all public medi cal education at universities and academies ceased in August 1792. Medicine belonged to citizens, not the doctors. From now on and for an entire decade to come, anyone who wished was free to buy a medical license.96 \"Officier de Sant\u00e9\" included anyone. This may primar ily have been because of Article 6 of the French declaration of hu man rights, still valid today. Law is the expression of the general will; all citizens have the right to concur personally, or through their representatives in its formation; it must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens being equal before it, are equally admissible to all public offices, positions, and employments, according to their capacity, and without other distinction than that of virtues and talents. 97 Not at any other time in the modern hist ory of Europe has th e border between the professionals and amateurs of medicine been as wide open. In accordance with revolutionary logic, all priv ileged unions and associations were dissolved, including universities, medical school s and academies. Needless to say, the situ ation was soon chaotic. Charlatans and quacks showed up everywhere. The dream of extending equality to the field of medicine was a failure. In 1803 a French law made all caregiving without an exam illegal.98 However, medically speaking, the revolution was a succ ess in many ways. It established that medicine was a social science and that all illness must be construed in large social contexts. Medical care's being seen as a human right was another important aspect. 2.1.3. A century of Political and Industrial influences Overall, the end of the 18th century was characterised by a slow development from an \"estate society\" to one which took greater interest in \"social class\" - of 94 Freely translated fr om Johannisson, K., Medicinens \u00f6ga , supra 4, page 72. 95 Porter, R., The greatest benefit to mankind supra 5, page 245. 96 Johannisson, K., Medicinens \u00f6ga , supra 4, page K., Medicinens \u00f6ga , supra 4, page 90. 21course, things moved faster in France and in the Napoleonic Empire. It was a time where the guild system no longer prevaile d and where a new middle class began to take form. The breakthrough of secularisatio n and the success of a capitalist society characterised this era. 2.1.3.1. Romanticism Many changes had come about in post-revol utionary Europe. However, not all of them were progressive. The age of Enli ghtenment in general and the French Revolution in particular gave rise to a contrasting ideal - Romanticism. It was a conservative reaction against the Great Enlightenment project. 99 This reaction helps identify the 1800s two political forces: Liberalism and Conservatism. Both movements sought to preserve the \"ruins\", meaning they advocated evolution over revolution.100 2.1.3.2. Liberalism The liberal idea was coined around 1820 a nd gathered those who supported the thoughts of Enlightenment. The movement was not revolutionary, but rather favourably inclined towards reform.101 The ideal of this movement was freedom - freedom for the individual from state control. In medicine this came to mean an advocacy of non-treatment.102 The idea of the principle of natural order was the base of the liberal laissez-faire progra mme, which meant that any encroachment from the state was seen as an interference in the natural proce ss and the individual's personal freedom.103. The state was relieved of its responsibility for the health of its citizens. Illness was seen as the result of a biological determinism, and so society could not have caused it. Th ese thoughts fit well into th e needs of Industrialism, since the illness of the workers was then the result of self-inf liction and an indolent lifestyle, rather than the exploitation of them in miserable working and living conditions. However, Liberalism called attention to many important positive arguments as to why society should not interfere. The idea of personal freedom, which was a fundamental principle, included a respons ibility for ones own health. Patriarchal responsibility was to be replaced by individual responsibil ity. Self-help was the key word. 2.1.3.3. Conservatism Conservatism reacted to the individua lism of the Enlightenment. The idea was that Man always belonged to different communities and the State was the overall, comprehensive community. The individual ha d duties, but no righ ts vis-\u00e0-vis the State.104 Conservatism put tradition and veri fied experience first, whereas the Enlightenment had put first.105 99 Mod\u00e9er, K.\u00c5., Det n\u00e4ra f\u00f6rflutna, supra 3, page 9. 100 page 30. 101 H\u00e4th\u00e9n, C., Stat och straff, supra 41, page 175. 102 Johannisson, K., Medicinens \u00f6ga , supra 4, page 62. 103 Id., page 62. 104 H\u00e4th\u00e9n, C., Stat och straff, supra 41, page 175. 105 Id., page 175. 22The liberal idea of self -help and non-interference of society caught on in countries such as the United Kingdom and th e United States, where the influence of the idea can still be seen.106 In conservative Sweden, health care politics were still decided with mainly patriarchal motives and far-reaching interference from the State.107 In 1813 the \"Sundhets kollegium\" replaced the Collegium Medicum and becomes a public authority. From the e nd of the 1850s the Sundhetskollegium was responsible for the Swedish health care organization. 2.1.3.4. Industrialism108 The age of industrialism meant th e modernisation of Europe. The ruling powers abandoned the idea of th e individual as subordinated to the state at the end of the 1700s. The central idea is rather an expanding capitalist system in accordance with th e ideas of industrialism. In th is context, the individual was seen only as a basic production power. Bodies were exchangeable, and the ill were not profitable workers. The political and social development and the structure of the industrial system made it possible to maintain old medicinal control mechanisms, where the focus was loyalty to the State. There were some private initiatives. An entire system of privately financed hospitals arose in England during the 18t h century, funded by a financially strong bourgeoisie of merchant s and factory owners.109 These bourgeois health care contributions were a natural part of the i ndustrialism, as the en lightenment idea of equality was changed into the bourgeoisie's social conscience. Humanitarian efforts became virtues and private initiative co mpensated for society's innate and unavoidable injustices, which can be seen as a manifestation of the pre-modernist thought of man's given position in society. However, these contributions were not enough to meet the problems related to industrialism. These grew, and the breach between the workers and the medicinal Establishment expanded. The average life expectancy for the middle and upper class was 36, but only 26 among the workers. The situation was a source of political unease, and anarchistic ideas formed. Frie drich Engels wrote of the proletariat's miserable conditions and demanded radical social change. This misery and illness was political dynamite - and power paid attention. A number of health care, hygienic and social medicinal reforms we re made in most western European countries in the mid 19 th century. 2.2. Modernism - a new attitude developing in Sweden Modernism is a key word for unde rstanding the even ts of the 20th century. It can be said that modernism identifies the m odern technically advanced and functional society.110 It is by definition critical towards traditions and a reaction against the 19th century's agricultural, rural society. One can see Modernism as the Antithesis of the Pre-modernism. 106 Johannisson, K., Medicinens \u00f6ga , supra 4, page 63. 107 Id., page 64. 108 This section is based on Johannisson, K., Medicinens \u00f6ga, supra 4, page 59 - 62. 109 Serafimerlasarettet, a hospital in Stockholm, opened in 1752. Engman, S., L\u00e4kekonst och socio-political deve lopment during the pre-modern period, different theories regarding medicina l treatment developed and expanded. 2.2.1. Pluralism bordering to chaos Around the year 1800, there was a plura lism on the medicinal market which bordered on chaos.111 Traditional medicine was being replaced by science, yet the patients were unsure of which was which. 2.2.1.1. Traditional medicine The progressive development of medicina l science took plac e without changing traditional medicinal remedies. In a decreasing manner, folk medicine continued to hold a place next to the so called scholarly medicine. Folk medicine is a freer concept and included cures with herbs, not completely accepted as it was associated with magic.112 Homeopathy was, and still is, of ten seen as folk medicine by scholarly medical practitioners, as it was not considered to be scientific. The practitioners of homeopathy, however, would not agree, and in fact would argue that their science is superior to that of Conventional medicine. Over time, what is seen as traditional medicine is altered. When the English physician William Withering 1785 published hi s thesis on digitalis, it was about a plant considered folk medicine at the time. It is today one of our most important heart medications, though now it is made out of purified substances.113 In the early 19th century, FWA Sert\u00fcrner isolated a spec ific chemical subject in the opium poppy - Morphine. Chemistry kept evolving and in the end of the 19th century synthetic medications could be produced.114 The science which came to specialize in the understanding of the herbal remedies came to be known as pharmacognosia. It evolved during the 19th century when the advanced chemical analysis instruments that we have today did not exist.115 Since the mid 1800s, the ideal of Govern ment officials as a higher order had sprouted, and at the turn of the centur y, the Doctors - along with the judge, the bishop and the mayor, represented a higher order116. However, their therapeutic abilities had hardly increased. The ability to cure is what was most important in the medicinal field, not a title. This led to an enormous increase in Complementary therapies available to the public. 117 2.2.1.2. Homeopathy One of the traditional medicines to turn to was homeopathy, founded by the German doctor Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843). He adopted the traditional idea of Signature Doctrine (see above). He had in his youth been infected with malaria and cured with China bark from the Cinchona tr ee. At a mature age he had reason to experiment on himself and again take a dosage of China bark and then displayed 111Johannisson, K., Medicinens \u00f6ga , supra 4, page, page 30. 112 Loux, F., Folk medicine in Companion encyclopaedia of the History of Medicine, Volume 1, edited by Bynum, WF., and Porter, R., Routledge London & New York 1993. 113 Olsson, S. (red.), \u00d6rtmedicin och v\u00e4xtmagi , supra 23, page 42 114 Id., page 42. 115 Id., pagee 42. 116 Johannisson, K., Medicinens \u00f6ga , supra 4, page 38. 117 Id., page 40. 24symptoms similar to that of malaria. He thought himself thereby to have proven that a drug which produces symptoms which resemb le a certain disease also cures that disease - similia similibus cantur.118 This became one of the cornerstones in his doctrine, which he called homeopathy. Between 1811 and 1821, Hahnemann was activ e in Leipzig, where he published his \"Medicinal doctrine\" and lectured about it. His reputation as a medical practitioner spread far beyond the boundari es of his home country. Hahnemann became the personal doctor of duke Ferdinand of Anhalt - K\u00f6then and it was in K\u00f6then that he formulated a new theory within homeopathy about the \"potent\" medicines.119 Practically this theory meant that soluble drugs were thinned out gradually with alcohol in a ratio of 1:100 and each thinning out was done under severe shaking. The theory was that th e medicines dynamic inherent power would be released through these dilutions and tran sfer to the dilution agent whose power would further increase with increased dilu tion. A dilution in the ratio of 1:100 was called the first centesimal potency, C 1. Hahnemann himself used the thirtieth centesimal potency C30, which means that th e original drug is diluted in enormous volumes. 2.2.1.3. Scientific medicine In the 19th century, medicine developed in a scientific direction. Science became an ideal worth striving for, and the base for anything to be taken seriously. The term Science and Verified Experience120 can be seen early on in Swedish ethics codes121, but is predominantly a manifestation of typical modern thoughts and norms. Within anatomy and surgery, important achievements had been made. The Dutch physician Andreas Vesalius' book on the hum an body \"De humani corporis fabrica\" was presented as early as the 16th century and disproved all the medieval practitioners' conceptions of the structure of the inner or gans, which, before this, in large part had relied on dissection of animals.122 A couple of decades into the 19th century, botanists found that plants were built up of cells. This cell theory was then transferred to the animal kingdom and the understanding of the cell's importance as a car rier of the organisms' manifestations of life had great importance for medicina l science. In 1858, the German physician Rudolf Virchow published his pioneering wo rk on cells' malign cancerous changes. Through this the existing conception of hu man health being dependent on the four humours was replaced by the theory of cellular pathology.123 Research improved in laboratories a nd with more delicate technique and improved aids, medicine became a true science. From the mid 19th century until our day, great progress has been made. Loui s Pasteur and Robert Koch made key contributions in bacteriology. Joseph Lister fought wound infections, making surgery possible. Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen disc overs the X-ray in 1895. The endocrine 118 www.homeopathic.org (August 2005) 119 Olsson, S. (red.), \u00d6rtmedicin och v\u00e4xtmagi , supra 23, page 40. 120 3.2.1.4.

Today, many of the diseases that killed millions are virtually wiped out. With modernism came not only a revolution in scientific knowledge, but also the welfare states' vision of actively crea ting a better society. Realism was more important than idealism and there was less consideration for events of the past. There was hostility towards religion, and secularisation took place due to this scientific paradigm. Religion was replaced by science, superstition by medication and priests by medical practi tioners. Regulatory actions in the form of creating laws were taken to control many aspects of ev eryday life, and cert ainly concerning the practice of medicine, the Caregivers and their remedies. 2.2.1.4. Creating order out of chaos Modernism was fundamentally about order and rationalization, creating order out of chaos. The assumption was that the mo re ordered a society was, the better it would function and because of this, modern ism meant the pursuit of ever-increasing levels of order. Society was constantly on guard against anyt hing and everything labelled as \"disorder,\" which might disrupt order. Thus modern societies relied on continually establishing a binary oppos ition between \"order\" and \"disorder\", to assert the superiority of \"order.\" But to do this, they had to have things that represented \"disorder\" and in western cultu re, this disorder became \"the other\" - defined in relation to other binary oppositions. Thus anything non-scientific, such as Complementary medicine, became part of \"dis order\", and had to be eliminated from the ordered, rational modern society. 125 Though modernism is a 20th century phenomenon, it can be said to have its start at the end of the First Worl d War, that is to say around 1918. After the first World War, there was a need for new role-models within art, literature, music, philosophy, economy, science and within medicine as well. Secularisation took place in the law, but also in medicine. There was to be no superstition or religion in the healing of patients, but rather science and experience were the only recognized values. It was in connection to scientific progress and parallel to the development of medicine as a scientific subject that licensed doctors were given increasing powe r, status and authority. 126 The development of a more professional approach in medicinal pract ice took place, finally resulting in the monopoly of Licensed practitioners for cer tain types of treatments. During modernism, it is fair to say that the professional actors' position in society was decisively strengthened. 2.2.2. Modernism affects the Caregivers An exceptional number of things happene d during the modern period concerning the practice of medicine in Sweden. The number of doctors pe r capita in Sweden 124Porter, R., The greatest benefit to mankind , page 11. 125 This idea is based on an essay by Dr. Mary Klages, Associate Professo r, English Department, University of Colorado, found on http://www.colorado.edu/English/ENGL2012Klages/pomo.html (August 2005). 126 Tegern, G., Lund 2004, page 83. 26just before modern times was very low compared to other European countries - there were six times as many doctors in England and three times as many in Germany as there were Sweden in 1850. The number of Licensed practitioners increased dramatically in the next ha lf century, as can be seen below. Doctors Pharmacists 1850 1900 1850 1900 Sweden 7 522 3 845 6 948 4 249 England 1 176 1 433 1 277 1 137 Germany 2 665 2 059 10 928 10 367 Number of inhabitants per doctor/pharmacist in Sweden, England and Germany in 1850 and 1900.127 The licensed doctors captured a privileged position during this time, unique in comparison to other era's and cultures' medicinal professionals.128 During Swedish modernism, the profession of medicine is more or less monopolized by them, and non-licensed medical practitioners are for ced out of the medical market, not so much by legislation, but by the influencing of public opinion. Medical practitioners had to organize themselves internally, because in their view, politicians and legislators needed to be c onvinced of the dangers of le tting \"quacks\" continue to work, and the public needed to be warned and mobilized to act against anyone not licensed. 2.2.2.1. Influencing Public Opinion The public was reached, amongst other things, through popular medicine magazines meant to educate and inform. An example of this type of magazine was Hygienisk Revy which was to be an informative medicinal journal and a counterbalance to the al ternative medicinal humbug.129 It was published from 1912 by Torsten Thunberg who was a very st rong opponent of quackery. The articles were dominated by the fight against \"false\" medicine and the authorities' lack of action against the practitione rs of such medicine. It is clear that Licensed practitioners mobilized ag ainst quackery in the 1910s, Articles surrounding this theme are predominant in both Hygienisk Revy and the Swedish Medical Revi ew around this time130. Motions regarding st ricter legislation on these matters were put forth in Sweden's medical associations and there was an intense lobbying of politicians. Members of parliament were given subscriptions to Hygienisk Revy , often paid by doctors themselves 131. 2.2.2.2. The Quackery debate in Parliament The quackery debate in Parliament was heated around the turn of the century. The earliest attempts to bring the question of unlicensed medical practice to the agenda of the parliament were met w ith resistance. In 1895 a motion was laid 127 Nelson, M.C., En historia om v\u00e5rd f\u00f6rr , supra 52, page Sanningens L\u00e4kartidningen 1910 nr 1-14, Sanningens gr\u00e4nser, supra 129, page 70. 27forward in the first chamber132, but it was rejected because it was too much in favour of the Licensed practitioners. Th e debate centred not only on unlicensed practitioners, but also on the relationship between Licensed practitioners; to organize and clarify the relationships of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, dental technicians. In 1896, the question was brought up in the second chamber, where certain members of parliament were opposed to what they assumed to be the Licensed practitioners' attempt to m onopolize the art of medicine.133 This was a threat to the laity and all the good they were doing in regions with few medical practitioners. One had to take into consideration public opinion and not overesti mate their faith in Licensed practitioners or underestimate th eir faith in unlicensed practitioners. Again, the proposal was rejected. A third motion was laid in 1907134, but yet again no legi slation was passed due to the fact that it could not be decided how to regulate quackery without bringing harm to valuable unlicensed practitioners. It was decided to examine the question of de-licensing Licensed practitioners, and it is through this examination that the question of quackery was ultimately brought up in the political arena. On a political level, there was much hesitation regarding special legislation within an area - medicine - favouring one group of professionals - the medical practitioners. It was thought that if this was done fo r one group of professionals, others would be lining up to get the same advantages and benefits.135 Allm\u00e4nna Svenska L\u00e4karef\u00f6rbundet (Swedish Public Medical Association, later the Swedish Medical Association) asked for drastic measures to be taken regarding quackery. \"Something must be done.\" 136 Quackery had now become a social problem of such large dimensions that society had to take action. 2.2.2.3. The new laws The \"Quackery law\" was passed in 1915137, and it was the first law to regulate the profession since 1688.138 It was a result of the demand of the medicinal board and the Licensed practitioners. Accordin g to the law, anyone could practice medicine, with precise exceptions: venereal disease, TBC, cancer and contagious diseases were not to be treated prof essionally by non licensed practitioners. The same was said for hypnosis and anaesthetics139. Contraventions were punishable by fines or prison for up to one year.140 132 129, page 31. 136 Proposition Nr 85 (Stockholm 1915), page 8. Bihang till riksdagens protokoll 1915. 1 samlingen. Maj:ts Medicinalf\u00f6rordningar av den 30 att ut\u00f6va l\u00e4karkonsten, supra 2 mom. 140 Id. 6\u00a7, 2 mom, 2st 28The passing of the new law in 1915 did not calm the m obilization of the Licensed practitioners. It was thought that the new law was too vague, and needed complementary amendments as soon as possible. It was seen by the Swedish Medical Association as a half measure which actually protected the unlicensed practice of medicine. Some even argue d that the new legislation was more favourable for quacks than the old medi cinal ordinances had been, since the absolute monopoly on health care was now gone. 141 A reaction to the Licensed professionals' campaigns against Complementary medicines and unlicensed practitioners was the creation of an organisation defending the interests of Complementary medicines, F\u00f6rbundet f\u00f6r folkh\u00e4lsans v\u00e4nner142. Created in 1924, nine years after th e new legislation came into force; it campaigned for freedom of choice in the method with which to be treated. It opposed the idea that every non-academically educated medical practitioner was to be seen as a quack. The association ar gued that a monopoly for any occupational group was a risk, since this might produce a lust for profits and overconfidence in ones own capacity.143 The Law of 1915 was replaced in 1960 by a Law Prohibiting Certain Activity in Health Care144, also known as the Quackery Law. In this the prohibitions became more extensive than in the Law of 1915. Society, it was thought, should take up a more pronounced negative attitude to wards what was then called quackery. 145 If quackery had been tolerated because of a la ck of doctors or difficulties in reaching a doctor, these reasons were found to be of less importance now. The law reserved the treatment of a number of diseases and disorder to li censed doctors, and stipulated severe sanctions for those who broke the quackery law. There was a regulation against itinerant activity and treatment by foreigners. This prohibition was abolished by an amendment in 1993. 146 Both these laws - the law of 1915 and the law of 1960 - are expressions of a critical attitude towards traditional me thods of treatment, which is typical of modern ideas and ideals. The demand of professionalisati on of Caregivers, scientific methods of treatment and the wi sh to create order in an area filled with disorder - that is to say the activity of the \"quacks\". 2.2.3. Modernism and Medicinal Products With modernism came new Medicinal products, some wanted and accepted, many not. Apart from the folk medical practitioners, new actors entered the market and gave the Complementary medicine sect or a much larger spread than before. 147 The licensed medical practitioners' contempt for unorthodox medicine at the turn of the century probably increased because of the amount of medi cations and methods that flooded the market around this time. 141 Almer, Riksdagsdebatten om kvacksalverilagen, in L\u00e4kartidningen Palmblad, E., Sanningens gr\u00e4nser, supra 129, page 49. 143 Id., page 50. 144 Lagen (1960:409) om f\u00f6rbud page 55. 146 SOU 2004:123, supra 2, page 58. 147 Id., page 60. 292.2.3.1. Universal medications, patent medicines and Elixirs It was the golden age of patent medici ne. Patent medicines were Medicinal products that were given speci al authorizations to be us ed on the basis that they were allegedly patented abroad.148 One plausible reason for this was the lack of confidence that scholarly medicine was suffering from during the period in question. Medical pract itioners had very little power over the in fectious diseases that devastated the population. The market for products offered as an alternative to Conventional medicines expanded, and especially attractive were th e elixirs and \"universal\" me dications, which claimed to cure almost every disease known to ma nkind including preparations against alcoholism and drug abuse. As it turned out , many of these preparations contained the drugs against which they were said to act.149 The temptation to believe in these miracle cures is unders tandable in the light of the wide panorama of diseases over wh ich Conventional medicine and Licensed practitioners were powerless. The trade in th is type of patent medicine is perhaps what truly caused a mobilisation against quackery, a battle which now intensified. A demand for legislation concerning the tr ade of medicine was included in this battle.150 2.2.3.2. The Pharmacy monopoly Ever since the early medicinal decrees , there had existed tensions between pharmacists and representatives of free trade, such as spice dealers,151 concerning the sale of medical drugs. The Collegium Medicum, the Sundhetskollegium and later the Medicinalstyrelsen (The Medicinal Board) had all tried repeatedly to cope with the illegal sales of drugs. Various decrees had regulations on what was reserved for pharmacists to sell. According to the Trade Regulations of 1846 152, the sale of medical drugs was reserved for pharmacies. The trouble was that there was no definition of medical drugs.153 Modern advertisements made it possible for anyone to promote their products. Patent medication had become a huge industr y. The opinion that the sale of drugs should be a state monopoly was represente d by Torsten Tunberg, a physiologist at the University of Lund.154 His opinion was that private enterprise meant not only a decrease in quality but an excessive overa ll use of drugs. The fight had to be not only against this entrepreneurial activity but also against the individuals' tendency towards self-care. 148 Ling, S., K\u00e4rringmedicin och vetenskap, supra 89, page 59. 149 Id., page 59. 150 An interesting technical product around this time was the electrical belt, which was said to cure everything from deafness to paralysis. Electricity was in its childhood around the turn of the century and seen as a miracle cure , a powerful healer. Nelson, M.C., En historia 1963). 154 Id., page 59. 30Tensions continued throughout the years around 1900, and pharmacists demanded measures be taken effectively to protect their trade. A proposal was made in 1909, which caused massive protests, and a new statute was enacted in 1913.155 The new medicinal drug ordinance of 1913156 gave pharmacies alone the right to sell medicinal drugs. This state monopoly has remained until contemporary times. 2.3. Post-modernism affec ts health care thinking 2.3.1. Defining post-modernism If modernism was the anti-thesis to pre-modernism, then the post-modern time period can be seen as the synthesi s of pre-modernism and modernism.157 The post- modern period can be seen as a reaction to modernism. It represents a transition from a homogenous, monolithic culture to a heterogeneous, multicultural and pluralistic one.158 Post modernism is marked by th e absence of a single dominant style or mode of thought.159 It can be discussed whether \"post\"-modernism is the most suitable denomination, since this may imply a rupture with modernism, rather than a successive change of it. Does the term post-modernism imply a decisive break with the past - or an extensio n and development of modernist programs?160 In certain subject areas, the term late-mode rnism may be more appropriate, but in the discussion of quackery, th e change is significant enough, and abrupt enough to allow the use of the term post-modernism. The point at which post-modernism should be considered to begin is not easily decided, and as we are in the middle of it, we have no historical distance to the period. It is therefore difficult to define what exactly the post-modernistic era entails, yet certain tendencies and trends can be seen. It can be seen as a reaction to modernism. It is the late 20th century' s polarising power. The time period brings into light a number of new key-words, including internationalism, individualism, pluralism, commercialis ation, and privatization.161 All of these are terms which are relevant when looking at the development on the medicinal market during the late 20th century until now. The impact these tendencies have had on the professional actors' situation - whether licensed or not - and on the consumers' choice of method of treatment, and choice of products, is distinct. This section will not deal with the speci fic regulations in a legal manner, but rather as historical phenome na. The legal discussion will be carried out in the next chapter. 2.3.2. The Caregivers With regard to the Caregivers, many cha nges have been made that are typically post-modern. If the modernist period strengthened the Licensed practitioners' 155 Palmblad, E., Sanningens f\u00f6rflutna, supra 3, page 189. 159 Morris, D., Illness and Culture in the Postmodern Age, University of California Press Ltd., London 1998, page 136. 160 K.\u00c5., Det n\u00e4ra f\u00f6rflutna, supra 3, page 24. 161 Id., Page 189. 31position, post-modernism has succeeded in strengthening the patients' position. This does not necessarily mean that the Licensed practitioners' power has decreased, just that there ha s been a shift in values. 2.3.2.1. The Committees In 1984, an Alternative Medicine Comm ittee (AMK) was set up by the Swedish state in order to analyse the need for legi slative change and the public's attitude in general towards alternative therapies and therapists. This exposition resulted in four positive Government Official Reports (SOU) 162. These reports ne ver resulted in legislative changes, but they show a te ndency towards a more positive view of Complementary medicines. This can be s een as an acceptance of pluralism - of many different professional actors on the market. The propositions were an attempt to ocularise all the existing Caregivers, and ev idence of the acceptance of heterogeneity within the medical prof ession. In the post-modern era, the melting-pot metaphor of modernism - that is to say the atte mpt to incorporate all things into one homogenous compilation - is replaced by the salad bowl metaphor. 163 This metaphor aims to capture the ideal of hete rogeneity - of showing off the different parts of the salad, not crea ting a single, plain stew. The same year, another committee - Th e Committee on Alternative Medicine (KAM) - was founded. KAM is a professional associa tion of societies and schools in the complementary and alternative medicine sector.164 The association was founded on the basis of the AMK report, and the societies which form KAM decided to produce an accreditation of their own: the final structure of this was established in 1993. When, in 1994, Sweden voted to join the European Union, this was an indication of the idea that post-modernism includes an internationalist trend. Swedish membership of the Union gives insight into other health care systems, which are often much more accepting of Compleme ntary remedies, and where competition between Licensed professionals and unlicen sed professionals is encouraged. There is a liberal tendency in that choices are more plentiful for the patients. Health is an increasingly coveted product area and thereby a profita ble arena for many actors. The treatment of illnesses, or perhaps more correctly, the improvement of health, is becoming commercialised and privatized. 2.3.2.2. De-professionalisation There is discussion of the tendencie s towards de-professionalisation and proletarisation in the medical guild in post-modern times. De-professionalisation means that the power and influence of th e licensed care givers in the healthcare politics of the western world, has decr eased, if not vanished completely. 165 It is now an international, if not global affair, and is often regulated by way of international 162 1. SOU 1989:60, supra 12, 2. en kartl\u00e4ggning 1989:63, V\u00e4rdering av alternativmedicinska teknologier , Stockholm 1989. 163 The expression is taken from a lecture with Kj ell \u00c5ke Mod\u00e9er at the Faculty of Law at Lund University in November 2004. 164 www.kam.se (August 2005). 165 Tegern, G., Medborgarna och den medicinska m\u00e5ngfalden, supra 126, page 90. 32agreements.166 An increasing number of actors on the medical market has certainly had an impact on the tendencies towards de-professionalisation. According to the proletarisation theory, Caregivers - including those that are licensed - have been subordinated by a ruling class of capitalists and business executives.167 This can be seen as an indication of the commercialisation and privatization, which are all a part of post-modern times. Legal changes in Sweden, as well as othe r western countries, have given patients a stronger position in the health care cont ext. This is interpreted by many as a diminution of doctoral power and influence, a de-professionalisation.168 2.3.3. The Products 2.3.3.1. A holistic view of health Post-modernism in medicine is characteri sed amongst other things by an interest in holistic health movements.169 The approach to health has become more inclusive, and now does not only include avoiding illness, but also maximizing well-being. Products and methods of treatment, which are thought to improve our comfort are as important as those thought to he al our diseases and discomforts. Complementary therapies include bot h pharmacological (such as Natural remedies) and non-pharmacological treatme nts (such as manual treatments and Acupuncture).170 There is a new spirituality which comes hand in hand with post- modernism, a nostalgic idea that things were better before, and one can see a re- traditionalisation in the return to trad itional products and methods of healing171. It is acceptable once again to be spiritual and there is a de-secularisation taking place within the therapies available and to lerated in our post-modern society. These changes in value are clear, as is a focus on our bodies in our choices as consumers of medicinal remedies. There is pluralism, tolerance and a wish for self- realization.172 The pluralism on the market can be seen clearly in the fact that there are more than 200 different complementary therapy forms being used in Sweden today, differing greatly in the theories and philosophies on which they are founded.173 In addition, an indicator might be the some 296 Natural reme dies registered with the Swedish MPA, presently available on the market.174 166 WHO Policy Perspectives on Medicines, No 2 May 2002, Traditional Medicine - Growing Needs and Potential, http://www.who.int/m edicines/library/trm/trm_polpers_eng.pdf , (August 2005). 167 Tegern, G., Medborgarna och den medicinska m\u00e5ngfalden, supra 126, page 89. 168 Id., page 90 169 Id., page 89. 170 Falkenberg, T., and H\u00f6k, M., Studentlitteratur, Lund 2004, page 68. 172 Id., page 67. 173 SOU 2004:123, supra 2, page 34. 174 F\u00e4rnl\u00f6f, \u00c5. & 2000 page 12http://www.mpa.se/ 332.3.3.2. The Grand Narratives In a study carried out in Sweden in 1996 called \"Beliefs and Values in Sweden of the 90's\"175 the attempt was made to find Sw edish peoples views on what was worth striving for. The study showed a loss of our faith in the Grand Narratives in our post-modern society. A Grand Narrative is a narrative that expl ains (or perhaps contains) all others. For example, there are various narratives al l over the world that explain the creation of the universe and everything in it; if a particular story is claimed to be the ultimate one that explains everything properly or accurately, it could be characterised as a Grand Narrative 176. Postmodernism is sceptical to wards the idea of finding one story that explains the world. Postmodernis m, in rejecting Grand narratives, favours \"mini-narratives,\" stories that explain small practices, local events, rather than large-scale universal or global concepts. Postmodernism then is the critique of Grand Narratives, the awareness that such narratives serve to mask the contradictions and instabilities that are inherent in any social organization or practice. 177 The Grand Narrative that the Swedish society should be built on Christian faith or that society should be built on a scientif ic basis was ranked lowest in the study, whereas good health was ranked as the most important value.178 One interpretation could be that people believed \"scientifi c\" Conventional medicine was not the best remedy for providing good health. This could be seen as a reje ction of the Grand Narrative of science and an explanati on as to why Comple mentary medicine's popularity is increasing, perhaps. In our contemporary society, with regard s to medicine, the post-modern desire effectively to return to the pre-modern er a tends to get associated with the use of Complementary therapies rather than Conve ntional medicines and the return to a more comprehensive view of health. 2.4. Historical Summary Before 1688 the competency of Caregi vers in Sweden was completely unregulated. After 1688 the opposite was true and licensed doctors in Sweden were given a monopoly on the treatment of diseases.179 The monopoly was, however, not in fact real, since there did not exist enough Licensed practitioners to fulfil the public's need. In addition, the differences in treatment available from the two groups were miniscule, making th e regulation rather unnecessary. Alongside scientific progress, and due to the Licensed practitioners own demands, a trend towards professionalisati on of the medical profession can be seen. There was much discussion on how to le gislate on the matter, but finally, the Government's proposition to the Riksda g (the Parliament) did not include a complete penalization of professional quackery. 175 Kallenberg, K., Br\u00e5kenhielm, C.R., and , August 2005. 177 Id. 178 Kallenberg, K., et al., Tro och v\u00e4rderingar i 90-talets Sverige, oktober 1688. 34Instead, the law which came into force on January 1st 1916 only imposed restrictions on the \"quacks\", and thus legalized their prac tice, much to the doctoral guilds' dismay. This law, however, was still a reflection of modern ideas, since it was an attempt to restrict unlicensed pr actitioners actions in order to more specifically professionalize doctors. In 1960, the law was replaced by two new laws, one of which regulated the competency of licensed doctors, and the other was the Quackery law . Not until this period had the doctoral title been protected - this protection being yet another reflection of modern ideas in that it draws an even clearer line between the accep ted and the tolerated. In 1975, the first articles on \"Alternative medicines\" - as opposed to \"quackery\" - were published in the Swedish Medical Review, showing that even the group of professionals historically most inclined to be negative, were being forced to come to terms with the idea that they no longer had a monopoly on the successful treatment of diseases. When the Committee on Alte rnative Medicine was installed in 1984, the post-modern tendencies were clear. Diversity is now accepted and since the proposition of 1989, Complementary me dicine has evolved and demanded recognition. The medicinal market is a heterogeneous one, and a re- traditionalisation has occurred. We find ourselves in the pre-modern acceptance of traditional healing methods, and a de-professionalisation of the doctoral guild can be seen. 353. The contemporary situation Having now an understanding of the historical events leading up to the present, it is of interest to see how these events ha ve affected the Swedish legal system. Being a member of the European Union, the Swedish law is now to a large extent determined by European legislation. In 1958, whe the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty (hereinafter \"the Treaty\")180, was signed, Health Care issues were not a part of the European agenda. During the initial years, the Community rather relied on general trade provisions in the Treaty to harmonize certain health related issues. The adoption of Council Directive 65/65/EEC 181, securing trade in medicinal products is a good example of how health aspects could still be important . Health only became a fully integrated part of the European development with th e adoption of Article 129 of the Treaty of Maastricht182 in 1992. For the first time it was established that \"the community shall contribute towards ensuring a high level of human health protection by encouraging co-operation between the Member States(...)\". Sweden only became bound by the health development through the EES- Agreement183 in 1993. With the Swedish membership to the European Union, the EU legislation (the Acquis Communautaire) became binding also to Sweden. In accordance with fundamental Commun ity principles, Community law has supremacy over national provisions. In the same manner, interpretations made by the European Court of Justice on EU legisl ation is binding to Sw edish legislators. It is therefore a natural starting point to look at the European legal situation. 3.1. The European legal situation This section will clarify how European legislation and case-law deal with Paramedicinal practitioners and their activi ties in relation to Licensed practitioners. Furthermore, the handling of complement ary Medicinal products in relation to Conventional medicine will be judged from an EU-law perspective. It is therefore necessary to examine th e rules applicable for licensed medical practitioners and Conventional medicine so as to investigate if and how they restrict the Complementary medicine activities. Le gislation and case-law is limited with regard to Paramedicinal pr actitioners and Complementar y medicines, but through analogy and e contrario conclusions of the rules app licable for the Conventional medicine and Licensed practitioners, we can understand their relation to Complementary medicines. 180 Consolidated version of the Treaty establishing the European Community, OJ 2002 C 325. 181 Directive 65/65/EEC of the Council of 26 January 1965 on the approximation of provisions laid down by Law, Regulation or Administrativ e Action relating to proprietary me dicinal products, OJ L 022, 09/02/1965 P. 0369 - 0373 182 The Maastricht Treaty, Provisions amending the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community with a view to establishing the European Community, OJ C 224,, 31/08/1992 P. 078 183 94/1/EC, ECSC: Decision of the Council and the Commission of 13 December 1993 on the conclusion of the Agreement on the European Economic Area between the European Communities, their Member States and the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland, the Republic of Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Swiss Confederation, OJ L 001 , 03/01/1994 P. 0001 36The Treaty provides that the activities of the Community shall include a contribution to the attainment of a high level of health protection.184 On the grounds of, amongst other things, the pr otection of health and life of humans, prohibitions or restrictions on imports and exports may still be made.185 In these fields the Community has comp etence to enact legislation. Over the years, much legislation has been issued with respect to products circulating on the European market, whereas the regulati on of the health care policy and the Caregivers has tended to rema in a national prerogative. Relevant legislation and case-law is desc ribed below, and will be discussed in the following analytic section. 3.1.1. The Caregivers The European Council encourages the Memb er States to develop their health care systems so that Conventional medicine and Complementary medicine can exist side by side and complement each other.186 Still, the main responsibility in the field of public health lies with the Member States187, and the licensing of medical practitioners is regarded as a national matter. Being an internal affair, the subject is therefore largely not regulated by Community law. There are certain guidelines, but Member States are free, in the absence of harmonisation, to legislate as they wish. 3.1.1.1. Mutual recognition of diplomas Mutual recognition of competency is re quired in order to fulfil the demand for a free market for services provided for in the Treaty: all discriminatory treatment based on nationality with rega rd to establishment and provision of services is prohibited.188 All Member States are committed to ensuring that national education fulfils the requirements which are the prerequisites for a mutual recognition. Directive 89/48/EEC189 contains a general principl e that a pers on allowed to practice a certain profession in his home country according to that country's rules, should also be allowed to practice a co rresponding profession in another Member State. If the applicant holds the diploma required in his own Member State for the taking up or pursuit of the profession in question, the host Member State may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to allow him to pursue that profession on the same conditions as apply to its own nationals. The rules apply to professions requiring higher education as well as other professional activities dependent on the completion of a cert ain level of education and training. 190 184 The EC Treaty, supra 180, Article 3. 185 The EC Treaty, supra 180, Article 30. 186 Falkenberg, T., et al., Komplement\u00e4rmedicin, supra 170, page 58. 187 Opinion of Advocate General Mischo, Case C-108/96 Grandvision, paragraph 58. 188 Article 49, the Treaty, supra 180. 189 Council Directive 89/48/EEC of 21 December 1988 on a general system for the recognition of higher-education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration, OJ L 019, 24/01/1989 P. 0016 - 0023, Article 3. 190 Council Directive 92/51/EEC of 18 June 1992 on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC OJ L 209 , 24/07/1992 P. (4). onal group there is a recogn ition directiv e and a co- ordination directive. The purpose of the r ecognition directives is the recognition of competency - of diplomas, cer tificates and other evidence of formal qualifications. The directives include measures to facilita te the effective exercise of the right of establishment, and of the freedom to provide services in the different Member States. The co-ordination directives aim to co-ordinate the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of vocational education.191 The directives are applicable both for the in a self-employed and for those working in an employed capacity.192 They stipulate the minimum training requirements for the recognition of diplomas, certificates an d other national evidence of formal qualification needed for the pr inciple of mutual recognition.193 3.1.1.2. Medical Doctors The rules regarding the profession of doctor - a licensed medical practitioner - have been transcribed into a single Di rective, namely Directive 93/16/EEC.194 For licensed medical practitioners, the Directive requires a complete period of medical training comprising at least a six-year course or 5,500 hours of theoretical and practical instruction given in a unive rsity or under the supervision of a university195.196 The Community rules do not affect the provisions laid dow n by law, regulation or administrative action in the Member St ates, which prohibit companies or firms from practicing medicine or impose on them certain conditions for such practice.197 3.1.1.3. Discrepancies in demands of education Difficulties may arise when the Member States have different requirements for education for paramedical services within their territories. This became obvious in Case C-61/89, \"Bouchoucha\" .198 Mr Bouchoucha held a diploma in oste opathy issued in Gr eat Britain. He was charged with having illegall y practiced medicine in Nice by practicing as an osteopath though not qualified as a doctor, as required by French national law. Question arose whether it was contrary to Article 52 (now 43) of the Treaty on freedom of establishment to prohibit him from practicing osteopathy in France. The Directives applicable to the case 199 related only to the profession of \"doctor\" and contained no Community defini tion of what activities were to be regarded as those of a doctor. 191 ECJ, C-371/97, Gozza v ECR I- 07881. 192 Council Directive 93/16/EEC, of 5 April 1993 to facilitate the free movement of doctors and the mutual recognition of their di plomas, certificates and other evid ence of formal qualifications. OJ L 165, 07/07/1993 P. 0001-0024, Article 1. 193 Article 196 The Directive has been implemented in the Swed ish Health Care Act, where it is stipulated that those fulfilling the demands of education for a general medical practitioner in the Directive 93/16/EEC are denominated \"European doctors\", ( Europal\u00e4kare , according to LYHS, below note 256, 3:8.) and are given competency to act as medical doctors in Sweden. 197 SOU 1996:138, supra 193. 198 Dir 93/16/EEC 38The Court observed that in so far as there is no Community definition of medical acts, the definition of acts restricted to the medical profession is a matter for the Member States. Each Me mber State is free to regulate the exercise of that activity within its terri tory provided only that there must be no discrimination between its own nationals and those of other Member States. The court ruled that \"in the absence of harmonization at Community level regarding activities which fall solely within the sc ope of the practice of medicine, Article 52 (now 43) of the Treaty does not preclud e a Member State from restricting an activity ancillary to medicine (...) exclusively to persons holding the qualification of doctor of medicine.\" 200 The Bouchoucha case specifically answered the question with regards to osteopathy, but it is likely that any activity ancillary to medicine is affected by the outcome of the case. Hypotheticall y, a licensed homeopath from Germany could not come to Sweden and claim to be allowed to treat can cer - in violation of the Swedish Medical Act's 4th chapter - on the basis that he may do just that in Germany. Bouchoucha performed a medical servic e within the scope of Conventional medicine as stipulated in French national law. Paramedical services have also been addressed in relation to tax treatment. According to Article 2(1) of the Sixth Council Directive201 (hereinafter the Sixth Direct ive) VAT is chargeable on the supply of goods or services. Art 13A(1) of the Sixth Directive prescribes that Member States shall exempt (b) hospita l and medical care and closely related activities, (c) the provision of medical ca re in the exercise of the medical and paramedical professions and (g) the supply of services of goods closely linked to welfare. Case C-45/01, \"Klinische Psychologie\"202 concerns the tax-exemption of specific services of a charitable foundation in accordance with the Sixth Directive. The question was whether the services of qualified, licensed psychotherapists, who were not registered as doctors, were qualified as services closely related to hospital and medical care within the meaning of the Sixth Directive. The Court found that in order to be considered as \"medical care\", the care must have as its purpose the diagnosis, treatment, and, as far as possible, cure of diseases or health disorders. 203 The term \"medical care\" in 13 A does not call for a especially narrow interpretation.204 According to the Court the no tion \"must be interpreted as covering all provision of medical care (...) including services provided by persons who are not doctors, but who pr ovide paramedical services\"205. In Case C-108/96, \"Grandvision\"206, national Belgian legislation prohibited opticians from carrying out certain optical examinations and the question arose whether this legislation was compatible with Art 28, 43 and 49 of the EC Treaty. 200 Case C-61/89, supra 198, paragraph 16. 201 Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment, OJ 1977 L 145, paragraph 1. 202 ECJ C-45/01, Klinische 12911. 203 Case C-45/01, supra 202, paragraph 48. 204 Id., paragraph 49. 205 Id., paragraph 50. 206 ECJ C-108/96, Grandvision Belgium v ECR I-837. 39Under the rules on freedom to provide services, could opt icians who are established in one Member State, be prohibited by th e national rules of another Member State from carrying out examinations in the latter State? The Commission stated that in the absenc e of specific Community rules, each Member State is free to regulate the prac tice of a profession on its territory. As stated in the Bouchoucha judgement (see above), this freedom includes the power to determine which acts may exclusively be car ried out by doctors, since there is no Community definition of medical activities. However, the Member States may not discriminate between its own nationals and those of other Member States.207 The Court found that Belgium could reserve certain optical examinations to a category of professionals holding speci fic qualifications, for reasons relating to the protection of public health. 3.1.2. The products Since medicinal remedies are products, these are carefully and specifically regulated so as to align national laws and administrative provisions in order to promote the functioning of the internal ma rket as well as guaranteeing high quality and safe products. Medicinal products are regulated in Directive 2001/83/EC 208 hereinafter referred to as the Community Code. In order to be qualified as a Medicinal product according to the Community Code, a product must include substances \"prese nted as having the ability to treat or prevent diseases\"209 or \"which may be administered to human beings with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restor ing, correcting or modifying physiological functions in human beings\"210. The directive thus provides two definitions of Medicinal product: one defi nition \"by presentation\" a nd another definition \"by function\".211 A product is a Medicinal product if it comes within one or the other of those two definitions. This then, includes products such as homeopathic and Natural remedies. They are, however, further de fined in other directives amending the Community Code. 3.1.2.1. A single Community system The Community code entered into force in November 2001, however it consolidates legisla tion dating back to 1965.212 Its essential aim is to safeguard public health, but this objective must be attained by means which will not hinder the development of the pharmaceutical industry or trade in Medicinal products within the Community. 213 Hindrances of the functioning of the internal market in the form of disparities between nationa l provisions must be removed.214 The Directive 207 Case C-61/89, supra 198, paragraph 23. 208 Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use OJ L 311, 28/11/2001 P. 0067 - 0128 Dir 2004/27/EC, supra 14, Article 1 (2) 2). 212 Dir 65/65/EEC had the same basic definition of medicinal product. 213 Dir 2001/83/EC, supra 208, preamble (2) and (3). 214 Id., preamble (5). 40represents an important step towards ach ieving the objective of the free movement of Medicinal products, though it is understood that furthe r measures will be needed to abolish remaining barriers.215 The systems for marketing authorisations involve three proce dures: centralised, decentralised (mutual rec ognition) and national. Before being placed on the market of a Member State, any Medicinal product must have been given a mark eting authorization by the comp etent authorities of that Member State. The exact procedure for th is can be found in Articles 8-12 of the Community Code. Only applicants established in the Community can be granted marketing authorization.216 The authorization awarded is valid for fi ve years, though the authorization holder must take into account scientific and tech nical progress, and must follow generally accepted scientific methods.217 The Community code objective, to safegua rd public health by means which will not hinder the development of the pharmaceu tical industry or trade in Medicinal products within the Community218, is implemented mainly in the fourth chapter, concerning the mutual recognition of au thorizations. A pharmaceutical company wishing to market a Medicinal product in more than one Member State must use either the centralised procedure or the mutual recognition procedure. The mutual recognition can be achieved by asking anot her Member State to mutually recognise, within 90 days, the marketing authorisation granted by the Reference Member State. 219 Thus, rapid access to a single market, with the necessary safeguards for the protection of public health, can be obt ained using the principle of mutual recognition. In order to facilitate the mutual rec ognition of authorizations, a Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products is set up in Article 27 of the Community code. This Committee is in charge of granting, va riation, suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorization. This Committee ha s its own procedural code, but the main mode of procedure is found in Articles 28-38. However, Homeopathic products are explicitly excluded fr om this procedure. In order to manufacture Medicina l products within the Community, a manufacturing authorization from a Member State is needed. This manufacturing authorization is required even if the Medicinal produc ts manufactured are intended for export. 220 The Community Code requires all Medicinal products for human use manufactured or imported into the Co mmunity, including Medicinal products intended for export, to be manufactured in accordance with the principles and guidelines of good manu facturing practice.221 215 Id., preamble (14). 216 Dir 2001/83/EC, supra 208, Article 8 (2). 217 Id., Articles 23 and 24. 218 Id., preamble (2) and (3). 219 Notice to applicants, Volume 2A, Procedures for marketing authorisation, Chapter 2 Mutual recognition, November 2002, European Commission, The rules governing medicinal products in the European Union, page 1. 220 Dir 2001/83/EC, supra 208, Article 40. 221 \"Good manufacturing practice\" means the part of quality assurance which ensures that products are consistently produced and contro lled in accordance with the quality standards appropriate to their intended use, according to Article 2(6) of Commission Directive 2003/94/EC of 8 October 2003 laying down the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice in respect 413.1.2.2. Natural remedies Natural remedies are Medicinal products. As long as a substance or combination of substances are presented for treating or preventing disease in human beings, the product is regarded as a Medicinal produc t unless otherwise specified. However, Directive 2004/24/EC222, which came into force in March 2004, amends the Community Code. Herbal medicinal products are now described as \"any medicinal product, exclusively containing as active ingr edients one or more herbal substances or one or more herbal prep arations, or one or more su ch herbal substances in combination with one or more such herbals preparations\"223 The advent of the pan-European market ing authorisation system has raised a number of questions about Natural remedies and their possible transfer to other European markets. In order to obtain a market ing authorisation, manufacturers of medicinal herbal remedies are required to demonstrate that their products meet acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy. The efficacy re quirement, however, is not as strict as for other Medicinal products, the most important factor being that the manufacturers can show that it is not harm ful in any way, by use of literature rather than by the normal clinical trials. Case C-405/95, \"Bioforce\"224, which is a customs classification case, demonstrated that the important factor for determining the classification of a Natural remedy is not that it is effective. In the case, the Principal Revenue Office stated that the preparations in ques tion - Echinacea based Medicinal products - could not be classified as medicaments, since \"the active substances in Echinacea have not as yet found general recognition\"225. This view was, however, rejected by the Court. \"The description of a product as a medicament in Community legislation or in the national legislation of the Memb er States, or in any pharmacopoeia is not the deciding factor in so far as its classification (...) is concerned\"226. Instead it should be considered whethe r the products have the objec tive characteristics and properties defined in the Common Custom Ta riff, which must be interpreted in the light of medical developments. A further amendment was made in Di rective 2004/24/EC concerning herbal Medicinal products in distinguis hing those considered to be traditional.227 The Directive allows for Medicinal products with a long traditi on, to be put on the market even if they do not fulfil the requi rements of a well-established medicinal use with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety within the meaning of the Community Code. The Directive provide s a simplified registration procedure for these products. This procedure should, however, only be used where no of medicinal products for human use and investigational medicinal products for human use, OJ L 262, 14/10/2003 P. 0022 - 0026. 222 Council Directive 2004/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 amending, as regards traditional herbal medicinal products, Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use. OJ L136, 30/04/2004 P. 0085 - 0090. 225 Case C-405/95, supra 224, paragraph 5. paragraph 11. 227 Dir 2004/24/EC, supra 222. 42marketing authorisation can be obtained pursuant to the Community Code.228 Traditional herbal Medicinal products must be shown by bibliogr aphical or expert evidence to have been in medicinal use throughout a pe riod of at least 30 years preceding the date of the application, in cluding at least 15 years within the Community in accordance with Community Code.229 If this can be shown, along with certain other specified requirement s, the product can be registered in a traditional-use registration. 3.1.2.3. Homeopathic products Homeopathic products are prepared from substances called homeopathic stocks in accordance with a homeopathic manuf acturing procedure described by the European Pharmacopoeia.230 Until the beginning of the 1990's, homeopathy was officially recognised in certain Member States, while it was not tolerated in ot hers, even though homeopathic drugs were prescribed and used in all Member States. Directive 92/73/EC, replaced now by the Community C ode, was the first official recognition of homeopathic drugs in all Member States. It gave rise to the establishment of a special simplified registration procedure for homeopathic drugs in the Community. This registration procedure is available only to products satisfying these conditions: administered orally or externally; without specific therapeutic indicatio n on the labelling of the Medicinal product; and there is a sufficient degree of dilution to guarantee its safety.231 The pharmaceutical quality and the batch-to-batch homogeneity of the Homeopathic products are to be demonstrat ed by the inclusion of certain listed documents in the application for the simplified registration.232 If the Homeopathic product does not fulfil the criteria in Ar ticle 14, they are to be authorized in accordance with the registration procedure of Medicinal products as described in Articles 8, 10 and 11 of the Community Code. Homeopathic products cannot benefit from the traditional medicinal produc ts directive, irresp ective of the amount of time they have been on the market.233 Case C-444/03, \"Meta Fackler KG\"234 concerned the registration of a new Medicinal product composed of a new combination of known homeopathic substances. The German Federal Health Au thority refused the registration since the general awareness of its use as a Home opathic product had not been proved. The question to be answered was whether only \"traditional\" Homeopathic products were subject to the special simplified regist ration procedure and whether a Medicinal product could be seen as \"traditional\" even if it had not been in actual homeopathic use in that combination. 228 Id., preamble (4). 229 Dir 2001/83/EC, supra 208, Article 16c(1)(c). 230 1, (5). 208, Article 14. ECR n.y.p. 43The ruled that as long as the home opathic \"ingredients\" fulfil the criteria listed in Article 14 of the Community Code and are prepared from products, substances or combinations called home opathic stocks in accordance with a homeopathic manufacturing procedure desc ribed by the European Pharmacopoeia, then the special simplified registration pr ocedure should be permitted and a national rule contrary to th is cannot be accepted. The Court developed its position with regard to import/expor t between Member States of Homeopathic products, in Case C-212/03, \"Commission v France\"235. One of the questions refe rred to the Court was whet her France could require prior authorisation for personal imports of Homeopathic products. The products had been prescribed in France and registered in another Member State in accordance with Community law. The Court found that, where a Homeopathic product is registered in a Member State, it does not, a priori, present any health risk , given that only Homeopathic products with a sufficient degree of dilution to guarantee their safety may be registered, and that, in a ddition, the rules relating to the manufacture and control of Homeopathic pr oducts have been harmonised. 236 In demanding prior authorisation for the importation of Homeopathic products , France was in breach of the prohibition on quantitative restriction on imports and free movement of goods between Member States.237 The French Government had not shown that a prior authorisation procedure was necessary, on grounds of health protection.238 3.1.2.4. Products falling under multiple categories Difficulties arise when products fall within the category of Medicinal products in accordance with the Community Code, but also fall into another category, for example food preparations. In the Bioforce case239 the question was if an Echinacea-based product should be classi fied as a medicament, a food supplement or a spirituous beverage. The court estab lished that a product \"does not have to possess any objective qualities making it su itable for therapeutic or prophylactic uses, but that just the overall presentation of the preparation (i nformation on its use, and its packaging, dispensation and marketing), that is to say its subjective purpose, is sufficient for such a classification.\" This position was maintained in Case C-328/97, \"Glob-Sped\"240, which concerned the tariff classifi cation of products as medicam ents, food preparations or provitamins and vitamins. Glob-Sped wanted to classify vitamin C preparations as medicaments for fiscal reasons, but the German Customs Office claimed that the products were to be classified as food preparations. The Court referred to the Bioforce case and found that the subjective qua lities were enough fo r the Court to rule that the vitamin preparations we re to be classified as medicaments. Joined Cases C-211/03, C-299/03 235 ECJ, C-212/03, Commission of the European Communities v French Republic, 26 May 2005, [2005] ECR n.y.p. 236 Case C-212/03, supra 235, paragraph 20. 237 EC Treaty, supra 180, Article 28. 238 Case C-212/03, supra 235, paragraph 28. 239 Case C-405/95, C-328/97, to C-318/03, supra 211. 44falling into a certain classification category in the Member State of importation and into another category in the Member State of exportation. For the purposes of determining whether a product should be classified as a Medicinal product or as a foodstuff within the meaning of the Community regulations, the competent national authority must decide on a case-by-case basis, taking into acc ount all of the characteri stics of the product (...). 242 The Court found that only the provisions of Community law specific to Medicinal products apply to a product, wh ich satisfies equally well the conditions for classification as a foodstuff and the cond itions for classification as a Medicinal product.243 This ruling has been reduced to law in the new Directive 2004/27/EC, which introduces a new Article 2 into th e Community Code, paragraph 2 of which is worded as follows: In cases of doubt, where, ta king into account all its characteristics, a product may fa ll within the definition of a \"medicinal product\" and within the definition of a product covered by other Community le gislation, the provisions of this Directive shall apply. 3.1.2.5. Free movement requirement Member States are not allowed to re nder difficult the movement of products across boarders within the Union. In the above-mentioned case Commission v France244, the French Republic had applied pr ior authorisation procedures for personal imports, not effected by personal tr ansports, of certain Medicinal products, including Medicinal products which were authorized in both the country of import and the country of export. The Court found th ese procedures to be in breach of the obligations under Article 28 of the Treaty. 245 In many other cases, the Court has judged the same to be true. Case C-221/00, \"Commission v Republic of Austria\"246 deals with Austrian national le gislation going beyond EU requirements with regards to labelling of food stuffs. Austria forbade any health related statements on food stuffs even if the in formation was not liable to mislead the consumer. The principle of proportionality di d not justify a system as restrictive of the free movement of goods. Prior authorisatio n for all health-re lated information on the labelling of foodstuffs, including t hose which are manufactured lawfully in other Member States, exceeded the acceptable.247 The only allowed restrictions on the impor t/export of medicinal products are, in accordance with Art 30 of the Treaty, those justified with respect to the need to protect human life. However, Member States should be able to justify any obstacle on a sound technical or scientific basis, by pr oving that it is abso lutely necessary, to demonstrate that a measure giving rise to an obstacle is in proportion to the public interest objective.248 242 Id., paragraph 30. 243 Id., paragraph 45. 244 Case C -212/03, supra 235. 245 Id. 246 EJC, C-221/00, Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Austria, 23 January 2003, [2003] ECR I-01007. 247 Case C-221/00, supra 246, paragraph 48. 248 www.europa.eu.int , Commission Communication on mutual recognition and the free movement of goods - frequently asked questions (MEMO/03/212), (January 2004). 45Case C-322/01 , \"Deutscher Apothekerverband\"249 concerned mail order importation of Medicinal products from one Member State to another and whether national legislation prohibiting such impor tation was a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative restrictio n for the purposes of Article 28 EC. The Court found that \"a national prohibition on the sale by mail order of medicinal products, the sale of which is restricted to pharmacies in the Member State concerned, (...) is a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction for the purposes of Article 28 of the Treaty\".250 Also, it was stated that Article 30 of th e Treaty may be relied on to justify a national prohibition on the sale by mail or der of Medicinal products which may be sold only in pharmacies in the Member Stat e concerned in so far as the prohibition covers Medicinal products subject to prescription . However, the Article cannot be relied on to justify an absolute prohibiti on on the sale by mail order of Medicinal products which are not subject to prescription in the Member State concerned.251 Sale by mail order of complementary Medicinal products, must then be considered to be acceptable. The Community Code precludes a national pr ohibition on advertis ing the sale by mail order of Medicinal products which may be supplied only in pharmacies in the Member State concerned,(...) in so far as the prohibition covers Medicinal products which are not subject to prescription .252 3.1.3. Summary Caregivers within the Union are allowed to practice medicine in all Member States, provided that they have the requi red medical training, regardless of whether this is Conventional medicinal activities or Paramedicinal activities. However, Member States may restrict activities anci llary to medicine exclusively to persons holding the qualification of licen sed medical practitioner. Products : Natural remedies and Homeopathic products are both regarded as Medicinal products in accordance with the Community code, since they are \"presented as having the ability to treat or prevent diseases\". Natural remedies contain one or more herbal substances as their active ingredients. In order to obtain marketing authorisations, manufacturers of Natural remedies must show that their products meet acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy. Medicinal products with a l ong tradition (at least 30 years, including at least 15 within the community) can be put on the market as traditional herbal medicines. Homeopathic products are also covered by the medici nal legislation, even if special rules apply. Once given a marketing authorization by th e competent authorities of a Member State, this is to be recognized by the ot her Member States.

Member states may not introduce arbitrary rules wh ich prevent this free flow of goods, nor may they introduce rules that provide mo re burdensome restrictions on Natural remedies and Homeopathic products than required by Community law. Products falling under multiple classification categor ies may be classified as Medicinal products if they are likely to be perceived as such. 47 3.2. The Swedish legal situation On the whole, Swedish national legislati on must be adapted to European rules, though there is margin for some self-det ermination. Community law, for example, regulates different professionals. Once the rules on education and vocational training have been harmonised, the actor s are free to provide their services throughout the Community. However, nationa l law decides the limits within which such actors may perform their duties as long as the rules are the same for all and not discriminatory against foreign nationals. 3.2.1. The Caregivers As discussed previously, hi storically Sweden has had a small number of licensed medical practitioners vis-\u00e0-vis the populat ion figures. Doctors were few and far between, and turning to alternative therapists has always been - if not encouraged - at least accepted by Swedish law. Polit icians have not found any reason to completely forbid these \"others\" to work, which has ensured that the licensed medical practitioners - much to their dismay - have not achieved a monopoly on health care in Sweden. The Licensed practitioners have, however, distanced themselves from what they refer to as \"quacks\", even though this medicinal practic e has been en tirely legal. This negative attitude towards Paramedicinal services can be seen in the Swedish Medical Review (L\u00e4kartidningen), by and for licensed doctors, where Complementary medicine is many times explicitly referred to as quackery. 253 Around 750 Articles were published in the Review on the subject quackery/Complementary medi cine in the period 1904-2003. 254 The Licensed practitioners' activity has b een defined as scientific and thereby legitimate, making other activity unscientific and illegitimate. This viewpoint will be discussed. 3.2.1.1. The Health Care Acts Two Acts concern the Caregivers and their rights and dutie s in Sweden. The Health Care Act255 (hereinafter HSL) and the Health Care Act regarding the Professional Actors acting within Health Care256 (hereinafter LYHS). In common to all groups practicing medicinal care is HSL's, Health Care Personnel and Paramedicinal practitioners - Caregivers, in general - are obliged to promote good health and good care on equal terms for the entire population.257 Good care is To be of good quality, ensuring the patie nts feel secure in their care and treatment 253 See for example L\u00e4kartidningen Volym 95, Nr 255. 48 Easily accessible To be founded on respect for the pati ent's self decisi on and integrity To promote good contact between Caregiver and caretaker258 These criteria are to be met without dis tinguishing between the Caregivers as is later done in LYHS. Good care is to be given by anyone taking action to medically prevent, examine and treat disease and injuries.259 The following table illustrates the organisa tion of Health Care professionals in Sweden. Health Care Personnel Caregivers Anyone who commercially treats another, irrespective of education and license Paramedicinal Practitioners Licensed Medical Practitioner LYHS, 3:2 Other Health Care Personnel Includes those that take part in the care of patients in hospitals and other care facilities, and those assisting licensed professionals, as well as pharmacists, emergency hotline personnel, groups of professionals included by specific directions and foreign licensed practitioners. Registered Paramedicinal Practitioners Government Official Report puts forth the idea of registering those complementary and alternative therapists who have a certain medicinal education and are members of a registered organisation. Unregistered Paramedicinal Practitioners Those who are not allowed to be registered according to the Government official repor t 3.2.1.2. The Licensed professionals LYHS defines Health Care Personnel and the scope of their rights and duties. It is stated that Health Care Personnel includes those that are licensed and use one of the protected professional titles listed in the Act's third chapter. There are presently 258 HSL, 2a\u00a7, supra 255. 259 HSL, 1\u00a7, supra 255. 49seventeen licensed professions260 with protected titles261. Personnel who take part in the care of patients in hospitals and other care facilities, and those assisting licensed professionals are also considered to be Health Care Personnel as defined by LYHS, as well as pharmacists, emergency hotline personnel, groups of professionals included by specific directiv es and foreign Licensed practitioners - the so called \"European doctors\". 262 It is important to point out that this list is exhaustive, leaving out all and any other fo rm of care or Caregivers from the Act's advantages for Health Care Personnel, such as their sole right to the actions listed in the fourth chapter of LYHS. The license has different legal conseque nces for different professional groups. Doctors, dentists and midwives, for example, benefit from the exclusive right to practice the profession, to the professional title and to the professional term - that is to say the respective professional title in combination with the term \"licensed\". Psychologists are given the right to the prof essional title and the professional term, whilst other licensed professional groups ar e given protection for the professional term 263. The most important significance of the li censes is, however, that it gives society a possibility of reacting - in a noticeable and distinct way - when a Licensed professional seriously neglects his undertakings, by simply revoking it.264 3.2.1.3. The Paramedicinal practitioners The other Caregivers - that is, the Paramedicinal practitioners - can be defined a contrario by the same paragraph, as health care providers not falling under any of these categories. They are then further defined as those who commercially examine another's' health situation or treats another for illness by measures taken or prescribed with the pur pose of preventing, curing or alleviating illness. 265 It is specifically pointed out that the work of Health Care Personnel falling under the scope of the earlier definition is excluded from the limitations stated in the fourth chapter 266, commonly referred to as the Quackery Law . The quackery law was first introduced as such in the Quackery Law of 1961. It has since then undergone many changes, though the general gist of it remains the same.267 In fact, even today the term \"quackery\" can be found in the re gister of the Swedish Civil Law Book, referring to this fourth chapter of the Health Care Act. In order to ensure the pub lic's safety, there has been a Government Official Report (SOU) which suggested the introduc tion of a national register of the Paramedicinal practitioners and a new law to regulate this register: \"The law on a national register over persons practic ing alternative or Complementary 260 supra 256. 261 Three professional titles of these 17 professions are omitted from being protected; chiropractor, naprapath, and optician, supra 193. supra 193, 4:1, 4:1, 1996:138, supra 193, page 47. 50medicine\".268 The idea is that this register would increase patient safety through ensuring that those register ed have a basic medicinal education (cor responding to 20 weeks of full-time studies), that the professional organisations within the alternative- and Complementary medici nal sphere collaborate, and that only members of these professional organisations may register - meaning that they are tied to the objectives and ethical rule s stipulated by the organisations.269 Registration is to be voluntary, and not a prerequisi te for being allowed to professionally practice Complementary medicine270. If this suggestion goes through, it would divide up the Paramedicinal practitioners into two subcategories: the registered Paramedicinal practitioners and the unregistered Paramedicinal practitioners. Some specific restrictions apply con cerning the two groups of Caregivers respectively. Those providing Paramedicinal services may not treat certain groups of patients nor certain conditions. The c onditions include illnesses such as cancer, contagious diseases, diabetes, epilepsy, and illnesses occurring in association with pregnancy or birth. The Paramedicinal practitioners may not use general anaesthetics or local anaesthetics by injection, hypnos is or treatment using radiological methods. They are explicitly prohibited from giving advice or directions without meeting with the patient personally. In addition, unlicensed Caregivers may not try out or supply contact lenses.271 The amendment related to c ontact lenses came about in a legislative addition in 1983 and was motiv ated by concern for patient's need for medicinal security.272 Children under the age of eight may never be examined or treated by the group of Caregivers not defined as Health Care Personnel.273 3.2.1.4. Science and Verified Experience Though not easily noticeable, Health Care Personnel are also s ubject to certain restrictions. In addition to their prof essional secrecy, Licensed practitioners must perform their work in accordance with Science and Verified Experience . Though this may not at a first glance seem much of a restriction, it is of central importance in understanding the term \"quackery\". Being in accordance with science has b een a criterion for le gitimate medicinal activity for many centuries. It has been an ideal, a norm and a way of drawing boundaries in medicine and healthcare. The interpretation of the term is negotiable, shifting its meaning in time and space depending on general developments in society and in accordance with foreign influences. In Sweden, the Sundhetskollegium demande d that all medical practitioners and surgeons after exams should swear an oath before the kollegium. In accordance with the Doctoral Oath of 1829, the doctor to-be swore to use only remedies which 268 SOU 2004:123, supra 2, page 13. 269 SOU 2004:123, supra 2, page 12. 270 SOU 2, page 13. 271 LYHS, 4:2, 1-6p, LYHS, 4:3, supra 256. 51had been proven to work through experience and science.274 Through major political and social changes, this conti nued until the Swedish Medical Association in 1951 adopted the ethics code Codex Ethicus Medicorum Svecorum . It was stipulated in this Codex that the practitioner should always seek to expand his knowledge275 - a much less conservative standpo int than the olde r version. In the Doctoral Code of Ethics of 2002, it is stated that the medica l practitioner, to the best of his abilities, should contribute to scientific progress. This, then, implies that medical practitioners are not tied to exis ting scientific knowle dge, contrary to the word of the law, where it is an imperative and binding rule for all Health Care Personnel. The term \"Science and Verified Experien ce\" is very vague and it is difficult to find any definitive explanation of it. There is no preparatory work that can be found to the 1829 Doctoral Code of Conduct ,whe re the term was first mentioned, which can be of guidance. The term was not an alysed nor described in any preparatory documents to the laws surrounding it. Closest is an answer in the form of a letter written to an individual medical practi tioner in 1976 who questioned the term, in which the National Board of Health and Welf are stated that it is necessary that a treatment fulfils the criteria of both being scientific and re ferable to verified experience - not one or the other.276 According to The National Board of H ealth and Welfare, the meaning of Science and Verified Experience is determined at a given point in time by documented research. The National Board of Health and Welfare, and, if necessary, an administrative court, decide whether a treatment is scientific and in accordance with verified experience. 277 It is understood by many that, on account of the way the law is written, licensed Health Care Personnel are not permitted to be engaged in Complementary medicine. This has also been expr essed in rulings of the courts. In one case from the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court278, a licensed physiotherapist (one of the 17 protected pr ofessional titles) had a sign outside her practice which read \"licensed physio therapy, reflexology and Zonetherapy279\". She no longer practiced physiotherapy, but stat ed she wished to show that she had \"genuine medical proficiencies\". The National Board of Health and Welfare maintained that one cannot be a Licensed professional and thus work in accordance with the demands of conscientious car e according to Science and Verified Experience and simultaneously devote one self to Complementary treatment methods. The physiotherapist was gi ven a disciplinary warning. The same attitude can be found in another case from the same year regarding a licensed nurse280, working with Zonetherapy, Acu puncture and natu page 42. 278 R\u00c51998 ref 41 I. 279 See Definitions, supra page 8. 280 R\u00c5 1998 ref 41 II. 52She gave herself the professional title \"nature therapist\". The National Board of Health and Welfare reported her, since they found this to stand in contrast to Science and Verified Experience, it was unacce ptable for her to keep her license as a nurse when she was working with alternative remedies, and that she should have her license revoked. The license is societ y's mark of qualit y and she was using unscientific and uncontrolled methods. She replied that she found herself to be acting in accordance with Sc ience and Verified Experience and that either way, her patients came to her as a nature therapis t and not as a nurse. The Administrative Appeals Court 281 found her to be \"obviously unsuita ble to exercise a career within the Health Care system\". Her license wa s revoked. She appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court282 where it was stated that the legal situation regarding Licensed practitioner's right to practice alternative met hods was unclear. Since the coming into force of the Health Care Act, there is reason to believe, however, that the legal space for this kind of practice has diminished, as the Health Care Act expresses a more rigid demand for quality. It was repeatedly stated by the court that the legal situation is uncertain and that a ruling is difficult to make. In this particular case, the court found that th e defendant could not be s een as obviously unsuitable and the ruling of the lowe r court was reversed. A decision taken by the National Board of Health and Welfare in 1975, concerning a doctor using the Natural remedy Iscador, is el ucidatory with regard to what Licensed practitioners are authorized to do. The Board found that it cannot be judged to be wrong or negligent when a doctor uses Natural remedies in addition to acceptable treatment, provided always that they have no side-effects.283 Some therapeutic methods are not to be regarded as alterna tive since they are used solely by Health Care Personnel, whilst other methods arose in the alternative area. In some cases, a method is used in different manners within the established and alternative care sectors. The text book example is Acupuncture, where, since 1982 it is acceptable for Licensed practitioners to use Acupuncture in alleviation of pain. The Acupuncture used in establishe d Health Care is founded on Conventional medicines' physiology and diagnostics. A lternative Acupuncture , on the other hand, rests upon the traditional Chinese medical explanation systems including concepts such as life energy (qi) and yin/yang. This type of Acupuncture not only attempts to relieve the symptoms, but also aims to balance the genera l energy in the body. 284 The point of having this demand for science is that every Licensed practitioner should use the proficiencies and way of thinking taught him during his education.285 Sweden does not, unlike Norway and Denmark, for example, have a national research institute dealing with alternativ e and Complementary medicines. There is a restricted amount of research done on the subject at the national universities. The Karolinska Institute, and the Universiti es of Link\u00f6ping and \u00d6rebro have shown some interest in starti ng comprehensive courses. 286 The existing courses are, however, limited. 281 The Swedish Administrative Court of Appeal, Kammarr\u00e4tten. 282 The Supreme Administrative Court, Regerings r\u00e4tten. 283 SOU 1989:60, supra12, page 60. 284 Id., page 66. 285 SOU 2004:123, supra 2, page 77. 286 SOU 2004:123, supra 145, page 45. 53The insistence on Science and Verified Experience is to di stinguish medical methods which are tolerated from those whic h are respected. However, what is seen as science is not clearly defined. 3.2.2. The products On July 1st, 1993 a new Medicinal Products Act287 came into force, as a result of adjustment to the EC regulations in th e Medicinal products area. The act includes regulations regarding Natural remedies a nd Homeopathic products, though the latter are not regarded as \"medicinal products\", but rather as \"other products\" in Sweden.288 The notion \"Natural remedy\"289 was introduced in Sweden at the same time, replacing the older nomenclature of \"natural product\"290 and indicating the stricter demands placed on Natural remedies . In spite of the new Act having come into force, the older \"natural products\" continue to be available on the market during a transitional period, until the MPA has completed the review of them. 3.2.2.1. Natural remedies Natural remedies must be suitable fo r self-medication in accordance with national tradition or with trad ition in countries close to Sweden with respect to drug usage, meaning that they are to be used for common symptoms not calling for a medical practitioner's atte ntion. The demands on the act ive ingredients and the suitability for self-care must be fulfille d for approval as a Natural remedy to be granted. The question of suitability for self-care is discussed in Swedish Bioforce v the Medical Products Agency .291 In this case, the Medica l Products Agency sought to remove the Natural remedy \"Crataegimin\" from the Swedish market on public health grounds. The preparation was not s een as suitable for self-care, and it was therefore the viewpoint of the MPA that it should be classified as a Medicinal product. Bioforce argued that cr ataegus preparations have a tradition of more than 35 years of well documented use in both Swed en and countries with traditions close to Sweden, and that as yet there are no reports on harmful or negative effects. According to Bioforce, the restrictive measures taken by the Medicinal Products Agency were in breach of the general pr inciple of mutual recognition, and an infringement of Art 28 EC of the Treaty. W ithin the EU there was at the time work to facilitate approvals and complete the harmonisation with regards to Natural remedies, and it was Bioforce's view that the MPA was acting in direct opposition to this work. The court found that the a pproval of Crataegimi n was an internal matter to be resolved through national re gulations. According to the Code of Statutes of the MPA, only products suitable for self-care can be approved as Natural remedies. 292 The product in question was, accordi ng to Bioforce, \"traditionally nature product. 291 Case nr Agency's Code of Statutes) 1995:18, Published on 2 November 1995, Medical Products Agency's guidelines on au thorization to place natural remedies on the market 54for a nervous heart as established by a doctor\"293. The judgement made by the MPA that the product might mask the symptoms of a non-diagnosed cardiac insufficiency was found to be within reason and the complaint was denied. The case has been appealed, Bioforce being of the opinion that this is in breach of the notion traditional herbal medicinal product294 as well as of Article 28 of the Treaty. A Natural remedy is a Medicinal product in which the active ingredient or ingredients derive from natural sources, have not been processed too highly and consist of part of a plant or animal, bacterial culture, mineral, salt or salt solution. 295 Good manufacturing practice is required, that is to say good manufacturing quality and safety. In addi tion, research or documentation that supports the claim that the Natural remedy has the intended effect is required. The demands for efficacy are, however, substant ially lower than those for conventional Medicinal products, this because of the idea th at Natural remedies are part of a well established tradition.296 Efficacy and safety can be substantiated in two ways: Either , and most commonly, reference can be made to medical literature documenting a well established/traditional use in Sweden or in countries with similar medical traditions (assuming th at the products' manufacturing, extract production, composition, dosage, and usage is comparable to the product described in the literature) Or it can be substantiated by scientific studies, as for conv entional Medicinal products. The total number and severity of reported side effects are considered when assessing the safety of the product.297 Thus, it is possible to make a genera l efficacy and safety judgement with reference to scientific literature. This is done through cr itically evaluating reports on the number of treated cases, used dosage a nd reported side-effects. If this type of data does not exist, the manu facturer must show that th e product is safe through the same type of scientific studies as conventional products: pharmacological, toxicological and clinical studies. If the manufacturer in any way has deviated from the traditional use of the Natural remedy by using, for example, a new dosage or some form of improvement, modern product specific documentation is needed in order for an authorisation to be given. 298 An authorisation is valid for five ye ars, and can be renewed for five year periods.299 This ensures that the manufacturer is forced to see that the product is always in conformity with the latest medicinal discoveries. With regard to the marketing of Natural remedies in Sweden, the information that follows the marketing must be current (up to date), objective and balanced, and it may not be misleading.300 293 Case 55In contrast to conventional Medicinal pr oducts, which are only sold in Apoteket, the trade of Natural remedies is open. Th ey are sold via health food stores, in general sales, through therapists, and by mail order, as well as at Apoteket. 3.2.2.2. Homeopathic products The Medicinal Products Act is only to a limited extent applicable to Homeopathic products.301 It defines the fundamental criteria, which must be fulfilled for registration of a Ho meopathic product to be allowed302: a product prepared according to a recogni sed homeopathic method which makes no therapeutic claims; is for oral or external use; is sufficiently diluted to guarantee its safety; Homeopathic products which fulfil these cr iteria must be registered with the Swedish Medical Products Agency (L\u00e4kemedel sverket) in order to be sold on the Swedish market.303 The Medical Products Agency assesses the products' quality, safety and labelling. Howe ver, no valuation on the efficacy of the product is made, and no indication of effect is allowed on the marking of the products or in the package insert.304 Products for internal use cannot be regi stered as Homeopath ic products unless they are to be administered orally. According to Swedish tradition, products administered through the skin, mucous membrane, and nostrils (amongst many other listed manners of administration) ar e considered to be products for internal use and can not therefore be regi stered as Homeopathic products.305 The homeopathic registration scheme, im plemented under European Directive 92/73 EEC, is a simplified regulatory proce dure, whereby products are assessed for their quality and safety and can then be marketed without specific medical claims. The simplified registration scheme thus enables a rapid introduction of new Homeopathic products onto the Swedish market. Registration under the scheme is compulsory only in respect of homoeopathic products new to the Swedish market. Homeopathic products that were on the ma rket before 1 July 1993 continue to be available by virtue of a specific regulat ion, provided that they have applied for registration with the Me dical Products Agency.306 3.2.2.3. Distribution of Medicinal products According to Swedish national legislati on, retail trade in n on-prescription and prescription medicinal preparations can be engaged in only by th e State or by legal persons over which the State has a dominant influence.307 Medicinal products include all products defined by the Medici nal Products Act. The company entrusted 301 Id., 2\u00a7, 3st. 302 Id., 2\u00a7 4st. 303 LVFS (Medical Products Agency's Code of Statutes) 2003:2, Instructions regarding amendments to the Medical Products Agency's provisions and guidelines (LVFS 1997:9) on the registration of certain homeopathic products, 2:1. 304 Id., 3:2. 305 Id., General advice on chapter 1 , page 2. 306 LVFS (Medical Products Agency's Code of Statutes) 1997:9, The Medical Products Agency's provisions and guidelines on the registration of certain homeopathic products, Transitional stipulations. 307 Lag (1996:1152) om handel med l\u00e4kemedel m.m., 4\u00a7. 56to cover the retail trade is Apoteket, where the Swedish State has a majority holding of two thirds of its capital.308 Apoteket is required under the \"1996 agreement\" to, amongst other things, organise a nationwide system for th e distribution of medicinal preparations and to suppl y all prescription and non- prescription medicinal preparations. The sale of Natural remedies is done bot h through Apoteket and other channels, whereas Homeopathic products were no longer sold via the State pharmacies after 1974.309 Homeopathic products are instead sold through health food stores, in general sales, by therapists and via mail order. Wholesale trade in Homeopathic products may only be pursued by those given perm ission by the Medical Products Agency. This includes all and a ny activity regarding acquis ition, possession, export or delivery of Homeopathic products - excep t retail trade, that is to say sale/distribution to the public.310 Only Homeopathic products registered in Sweden may be sold in Sweden.311 It is interesting to note that Norw ay does not have a State monopoly, but demands that homeopathic remedies must be sold through pharmacies.312 In the recent Case C-438/02 \"Hanner\"313, where judgment was given on 31 May 2005, the question arose whether Krister Hanner, in marketing non- prescription Medicinal products, had been in breach of the Swedish rules reserving retail sales of medicinal pr eparations. In his defence, Mr Hanner contended that those rules establish a State monopoly c ontrary to Articles 28, 31 and 43 of the Treaty. The Court found that the \"1996 Agr eement\" does not ensure the exclusion of any discrimination against medicinal preparations from other Member States314 and that Article 31(1) of the Treaty precludes a sales regime which grants an exclusive retail right and is arranged as was the sales regime of Apoteket. 315 The court's judgement only answers the matte r put to the question; that is if the present State monopoly is discriminatory. Apoteket has consented to the former organisation of the company having been in breach of European law, but contends that, having now undergone organizational changes; it is once again in line with European demands and the Swedish State monopoly is lawful under EU law. The question remains open. It is interesting to note that Mr Hanner was acquitted in the criminal proceedings in the District Court, but that the prosecutor has now appealed the case.316 3.2.3. Summary Caregivers in Sweden can be divided into two categories; Health Care Personnel and Paramedicinal practitioners. The legal rights and duties of these two 308 ECJ, C-438/02, Krister 2003:2, supra 303, General advice on chapter 5 , page 9. 311 Id., page 9. 312 www.homeopati.no , August 2005 313 Case C - 438/02, supra 308. 314 Id., paragraph 48. 315 \"Dom om Apotekets monopol to a large extent. Only H ealth Care Personnel may treat certain illnesses and conditions including cancer, contagious diseases, diabetes, and epilepsy amongst others. Health Care Personnel must work in accordance with Science and Verified Experience, the defin ition of which is rather uncertain. There has been discussion as to the possibility of introducing a register for Paramedicinal practitioners, though this has not yet been implemented. Products: The Medicinal Products Act of 1993 came into force as a result of adjusting to EC regulations in the Me dicinal products area. The Act regulates Natural remedies but only concerns Ho meopathic products to a limited extent. Natural remedies must be suitable for self-medication in accordance with national tradition or tradition in countries close to Sweden with respect to drug usage, meaning that they are to be used for common symptoms not calling for a medical practitioner's atten tion. The requirements regardin g the active ingredients and the suitability for self-care must be fulfilled in order for approval as a Natural remedy to be granted. Homeopathic products are products prepared according to a recognised homeopathic method which make no therapeutic claims, are for oral or external use and are sufficiently diluted to guarantee th eir safety. The Medical Products Agency assesses the products' quality, safety and labelling. However, no evaluation of the efficacy of the product is made. Conventional Medicinal products , whether on prescription or traded over the counter, are reserved for Apoteket - the Swedish monopoly, whereas Natural remedies and Homeopathic products may be sold more freely. 584. Analysis As stated in the introductory chapter, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether the Swedish attitude towards Comp lementary medicines is defendable in a European perspective. The presentation has demonstrated that quackery or non- tolerated activities have ne ver been accurately defined in the past. In order to discover the non-tolerated activities, it ha s been necessary to investigate the respected and tolerated activities. What does not fall under these categories can be regarded as non-tolerated. In fact, the le gislation is precise with respect to respected, but allows a fairly wide discretion with respect to what can be regarded as tolerated. Only very few practices, bordering on fraud and deception, come clearly within the non-to lerated quackery notion. History as an explanation for the present situation An exposition of the historical events leading up to the present offers a background understanding of the medicinal situation in Europe today. Medicine used to be atomized, a jumble of patient -doctor transactions. Practitioners were mainly self-employed. Today, medicine ha s turned into the proverbial Leviathan, comparable to the military machine, and in many cases no less business oriented than the large corporations. 317 History presents itself as an explanation for the Swedish legal situation and most importan t, peoples attitudes, as they are today. Licensed medicinal practitioners have ha d the backing of the State since early times, and their view on anything outside of their profession has tended to have been very condescending. The acceptance of Paramedicinal practitioners has never truly existed in Sweden, primarily as a result of State monopolies on the treatment of disease. During more th an 220 years the law - even though perhaps not adhered to - forbade the practice of medicine by a nyone not licensed. Even with the coming into force of the law of 1915, which allo wed for Paramedicina l practitioners to operate, the attitude towards Compleme ntary medicines was clear. The law was dubbed the Quackery Law. The Medicinal Review raged over the incompetence of \"quacks\", and the doctoral guild in large ne ver came to accept - or even tolerate - the others, even though the demand for their services has grown continually. The situation in other European countr ies was often different. Complementary medicine was taught in universities a nd licensed Health Care Personnel often practiced Natural remedies and Homeopathic ideas. This has remained the case. The result is that the general attit ude towards Paramedi cal practitioners, alternative and Complementary medicine in Sweden today differs from that of many of the other Member States of the European Union. Respecting, tolerating and non tolerating societies Inclusive healthcare systems, such as the German, acknowledge certain Complementary medicines, but may not have integrated them completely in all aspects. There may, for example, lack a nationally accepted education system or control of the products.318 According to a study from 2002, 73% of all adult Germans have experience with Natural remedies, and there is presently a 317 Porter, R., The greatest benefit to mankind supra 5, page 628. 318 Falkenberg, T., et al., Komplement\u00e4rmedicin, supra 170, page 53. 59Government programme encouraging comp arative studies of therapies in the treatment of conditions where Comple mentary medicines are normally used. 319 Great Britain is the only European country which has public hospitals with Complementary medicines, for example the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital.320 These are indications of health care systems where Complementary medicine is respected. Sweden is, on the other hand, an exampl e of a healthcare system, where only Conventional medicine is accepted and re spected, and Complementary medicines have at times not been tolerated a nd are still not officially acknowledged.321 We have seen that the Swedish lic ensed medical practitioners have a condescending view on anything not practiced \"in accordance with Science and Verified Experience\" - an interesting term in itself. This attitude is plain to see in the Medicinal Review where demands to end \"quackery\" can be heard throughout the century. European unity requires changing attitudes The disparate views in the different Eur opean States, of course, cause problems when trying to legislate in the Union. Ev en within the Community, attitudes differ largely. EU legislation tends to be in fa vour of complementary treatment. Natural remedies are basically treated as Conve ntional medicines and homeopathics come under similar regulation. The European Court of Justice has s hown a very lenient attitude towards Complementary medicine and its profe ssional actors and the interpretation of medicinal service has been broadened to include Paramedicinal practitioners and their activities.322 The focus in Europe is on the purpose of the activities of the Caregivers. Swedish negativity has been forced to bow to Europe and incorporate more tolerant legislation into its national rules gove rning Complementary medicines, yet it is obvious that the attitude held by the Li censed practitioners is not one that will change easily. The attitude is continually given support323. The Swedish public is, none the less, increasingly turning to Paramedicinal practitioners. Non-discrimination and the prin ciple of fiscal neutrality While it is true that the Member States themselves may decide in national legislation restriction of the perf ormance of certain medicinal tasks324, it must be done in a non-discriminatory manner. Furthermore, it has been judged that when Paramedicinal practitioners are entitled to perform these tasks, they are entitled to the same conditions as Health Care Personnel. For example, the same tax exemptions, under the principle of fiscal 319 Ekl\u00f6f, M., & Kullberg, A., Komplement\u00e4r medicin, supra 297, page 64. 320 Id., page 61. 321 Falkenberg, T., et al., Komplement\u00e4rmedicin, supra 170, page 53. 322 Case C-45/01, supra 202. 323 See for example article in the Lancet, below note 338. 324 Case C-61/89, supra 198, and Case C-108/96, supra 206. 60neutrality, should apply for all persons pr acticing medical care, including persons who are not doctors but who pr ovide paramedical services.325 Question now arises why the principle of fi scal neutrality as defined in law and set in case-law is applicable to Health Care Personnel but not health care products. Medical products in Sweden must be re gistered, production c onditions are subject to inspection, but are exempt from tax. Foodstuffs are not subject to registration or inspection, but must on the other hand pay 12,5% value added tax, 50% less than normal VAT. Homeopathic products must be registered, are subject to inspection and, since they fall outside the scope of both foodstuffs and medical products, they are subjected to a 25% value added tax.. Ho meopathic products in Sweden are thus under a heavy burden. As a consequence, producers of homeopathics are today choosing to market their products as f oodstuffs to avoid falling under medical legislation. This way, they avoid the regist ration costs while simultaneously cutting their VAT costs in half. Whet her this consequence is in tended is questionable. The principle of fiscal neutrality rather supports no value added tax on Homeopathic products. Homeopathic products and their administration The criterion in Swedish national law th at Homeopathic products must be for oral or external administration has its co rrespondence in EU law. The interpretation of this criterion as set out in the Commun ity Code, however, greatly differs between the Member States. Swedish practice allows a very limited type of administration manners. This is in line with EU law, sin ce in the absence of a clear definition, each Member State is free to regulate as they wish.326 On the other hand, Germany, for example, has chosen to interpret the cr iterion differently. A larger number of methods of administration are accepted which do not fall in under the literal wording of the EU criterion, yet also Germa ny may interpret as they see fit. There might be reasons for the authorities to consider the reasons behind limiting the administration forms for the Homeopathic products. In addition, it is illegal in Sweden to ha ve any form of indi cation or description of usage on the labelling or inserts of homeopathics. The question is how far this prohibition reaches. The Swedish interpretati on is strict. No claims, which has full support in EU law. But does this prohibiti on extent to any information - for example that a certain type of product is traditionally used for certain conditions? Where should the line be drawn? Question arises as to what impact these different interpretations may have on the EU market. If the Swedish interpretation is stricter than other Member States, such could be regarded as a measure having an equivalent effect of a quantitative restriction in breach of Artic le 28 of the Treaty. It should be reminded that as long as the information on the products are not liable to mislead a reasonably well-informed consumer, it should not present a problem. 327 A more narrow interpretation of a rule is not necessarily an incorrect one. The fact that one Member State imposes less strict rules than anothe r does not mean that the latter's rules are disproportionate and hence incompatible with Community law. \"The mere fact that a Member State has chosen a system of protection different 325 Case C-45/01, supra 202. 326 Case C-108/96, supra 206. 327 Case C-221/00, supra 246. 61from that adopted by another Member State cannot affect the appraisal as to the need for and proportionality of the provisions adopted\".328 The outcome of a ruling regarding these di screpancies is uncertain, but certainly is necessary in order to ensure the functioning of the internal market. Science and Verified Experience The existing contradictions are not only on a cross-national level, but on a purely internal, national level as well. In Sw edish law, the expression \"Science and Verified Experience\" is a key expression in defining Health Care Personnel. The term has its roots in documents dating al most 200 years back. The notion behind the term is typical of modernism, with the idealisation of science and new thought. The wording of the term as such is not op timal. How can experience be anything other than verified? The essence of experience is that it has be en verified. Though this is only semantics, it calls into question the rationality behind the expression. There is no clear definition of \"Science and Verified Experience\", as explained above329. The National Board of Health and Welf are has in an unofficial attempt to define the expression stated th at it is necessary that a treatment fulfils the criteria of both being scientific and referable to verified experience - not one or the other.330 This is, however, difficult to comply w ith, since new methods of treatment never comprehend experience, just as certain met hods have prolonged clinical experience of the method without a scien tific explanation as to why th e results are as they are. This makes for an arbitrary and changeab le term, which creates insecurity in Licensed practitioners as to what is accep table and not. They therefore choose not to use anything other than Conventional me dicine. In fact, Health Care Personnel are not allowed to use Complementary methods, though one cannot point to any specific stipulation which prescribes this result. This attitude stems from Swedish case-law. Even if medical care is to be given in accordance with Science and Verified Experience by Health Care Personnel, it stands to reason that it would be impossible to make the same demands on everybody active within the health care system. Different education and experience make for modulated demands on individuals. The individual care giver's actions in a given case must be judged in the light of education, co mpetence and experience. 331 What is also interesting to note is the fact that Swedish Health Care Personnel get very little, if any, education on Comp lementary products, even though they are approved as Medicinal products. In demandi ng that the Swedish professionals only work with therapies and products on which they have experien ce, the legislator ensures that the products are not used by th e Health Care Personne l. This appears to be an indirect obstacle in breach of Article 28 of the Treaty. The Paramedicinal practitioners The other Caregivers in Sweden, the Paramedicinal practitioners, may not, as we have seen, treat certain groups of patie nts nor certain conditions. The conditions 328 Case C-108/96, supra 206, paragraph 34. 329 See 3.2.1.4. 330 Prop 1993/94:149, page 65. 331 SOU 1989:60, supra 12, page 50. 62omitted from their care in the fourth chapter of LYHS, the Quackery law, include illnesses such as cancer, contagious diseases, diabetes, epilepsy, and illnesses occurring in association with pregnancy or birth. These are all potentially fatal conditions, and the demand for Licensed pract itioners and Health Care Personnel's monopoly on the treatment of these cond itions are understandable. These patients may be in a desperate and dejected state and willing to try almost anything to cure their condition. The attempt to retain them in conventional care is understandable, even if there is a risk of excluding services which might be helpful. The Paramedicinal practitioners may not use general anaesthetics or local anaesthetics by injection, hypnos is or treatment using ra diological methods. It is explicitly prohibited to give advice or di rections without mee ting with the patient personally. In addition, unli censed caregivers may not try out or supply contact lenses.332 The treatment of children under the age of eight is forbidden. The Grandvision-case333 prohibited opticians from car rying out certain optical examinations which were restricted to doctors. In absence of specific Community rules, the Court found that each Member Stat e is free to regulate the practice of a profession on its territory for reasons re lating to the protectio n of public health. The exclusion of the treatments in chapte r 4 of LYHS is therefore compatible with European law. In addition, the case s hows that the exception of contact lenses in the 2nd paragraph is an acceptable derogation in the light of the public health protection provided in Art 152 of the Treaty. The main responsibility in the field of public health lies, as stated ear lier, with the Member States.334 Defining the medical actors A 2004 Government's Official Report335 suggests the registration of practitioners of Complementary medicine with the objective of increasing patient safety. Registered practitioners would have to have a basic medicinal education, and only members of the professional organisations within the alternative and Complementary medicinal sphere would be allowed to register. The registration would, however, not be a prerequisite for being allowed to practice Complementary medicine. Consequently, Paramedicinal pr actitioners will be divided into two subcategories; 1. the Registered Paramedicinal practitioners, and 2. the Unregistered Paramedicinal practitioners. Such a division may have a larger impact than thought. Not only would it ensure the public's safety in genera l, but perhaps play the role of a semi-license, showing society's acceptance of Paramedicinal serv ices. The division might also shift the condescending view found among Health Care Personnel towards all Paramedicinal practitioners, to focus on the unregistered Paramedicinal practitioners. \"Quackery\" and monopoly There are many definitions of quackery, in cluding the prevalent one defining it as the unauthorized practice of the prof ession of doctor. The more condescending 332 LYHS, supra 256, 4:2, 1-6p. 333 Case of Advocate General Mischo, Case C-108/96, supra 187, paragraph 58. 335 SOU 2004:123, supra 145. 63meaning: to consciously and fraudulently give oneself out as being able to treat and cure without that being the case, is not the official - but very often explicit - meaning.336 Quackery is often associated with harm. The term has not remained fixated in meaning; it has fluctuated in just the same way as the reasons given for the superiority of medical science have va ried, in step with the changes undergone in society at large. This being true, one mi ght ask oneself if it is not time to remove the reference in the civ il law book register to the Quackery law with a cross- reference to chapter 4 of LYHS. At the time of writing, the effects of the ruling of the Court with regards to the Swedish national monopoly on the retail of medicinal preparations ( Hanner ) have not been finally decided. Will the judgement have an impact on the Swedish attitudes towards Complementary medicine s if private pharmacies advertise and bring forth the products in a different ma nner than the State has done? In addition, the mail-order sales of Medicinal products via virtual pharmacies will, it can be assumed, continue to increase, jeopardisi ng the continued existence of traditional pharmacies not living up the de mands of the consumers. An interesting view point on the di fficulties regarding the Complementary products is, according to the former Ch airwoman of the Swedish Committee on Alternative Medicine (KAM), Susanne No rdling, the fact that the Health Care Personnel do not wish to use the Comple mentary medicinal products since they have not been proven to work. As soon as Homeopathic products, Natural remedies and food stuffs are proven to work they are classified as Me dicinal products and disappear from the Complementary ther apists' table - a Catch-22 situation.337 Forskning och Framsteg, Nr 7 2002, page 15. 645. Conclusions Whether a therapeutic method is viewed as Conventional or Complementary depends on what historic al, geographical and cultural perspective one has. A method considered Complementary in Sw eden may be officially accepted and established as Conventional in other pa rts of the world. The boundary between the two has varied throughout history. For cen turies, there was no difference between Licensed practitioners' and Paramedicina l practitioners' methods of treatment. Parallel to medicinal science's evolution and thanks to increased regulation in the health care arena during the 1900s, the boundary has become sharper. In a recent issue of the Lancet338, a world leading medical journal, Homeopathy is written off as being effective only as a result of the placebo effect. Is this the beginning of the demise of Homeopathy - or is this yet another manifestation of the negative attitude towards co mplementary remedies for wh ich Licensed practitioners are known? History has shown us the repeat ed attempts of Li censed practitioners and society to stifle the activities of Parame dicinal practitioners. It is likely that this now effort will lead to dramatic results be cause it seems that Licensed practitioners are often misinterpreting the interests of their patients. The Paramedicinal practitioner is skilled in meeting the pa tient, giving the patient time and hope. The Homeopathic products prescribed are at least not harmful and the placebo effect is not to be neglected. The Complementary methods often emphasize the subjective feeling of the patient, rather than scie ntifically proven physical changes. Such subjective effects are not measured by the Li censed practitioner, but may be just as important to the patients. Complement ary medicines have throughout history showed remarkable results. The question of registration of Paramedicinal practitione rs has been investigated in the Government Official Report (SOU) 2004:123339, a proposal which might be seen as society's legitimatization of these actors and their therapies. In my mind, registration will ensure the patient's need for protection. Registration might even correspond to a license, which will ensu re a certain degree of quality and effectiveness of the care given by the re gistered Paramedicinal practitioners. I would, however, recommend a few changes in the proposed legislation. Firstly, the report refers to professional practitioners of alternative or Complementary medicine. I agree with the Swedish Co mmittee on Alternative Medicine's (KAM) objection 340 that the wording \"or\" should be replaced by \"and/or\", since many Paramedicinal practitioners' therapies can be used both as an alternative to Conventional medicine and as a compleme nt to it. Also, the report proposes the Board of education as the author ity responsible for the register 341, which seems unreasonable. The Board of Education has no experience with Complementary medicines, and it stands to reason that the Committee on Alternative Medicine is the most suitable organ for this task, with their more than 20 years of experience of the questions involved in the registra tion of Paramedicinal practitioners. 338 The Lancet, Volume 366, Number 9487, 27 August 2005, found on http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673605671772/abstract 2, page163. 65In my opinion, Sweden must take a sta nd on the question and stick to it. Are Complementary medicines accepte d or just tolerated? When discussing the question of acceptance and tolerance with regard to Complementary medicines, it is interesti ng to bring forth the German sociologist Ulrich Becks' theory on reflexive modernism .342 According to this theory - and in contrast to modernism wh ich advocated a logic of either-or - our contemorary times' reflexive modernistic view is founded on an as well as - principle . Presently, the patients either get Conventional medicinal help or have to turn to actors outside of State Health Care. In accordance with the reflexive modernism theory, we can no longer allow ourselves to see the medici nal market as homogenous. The time has come where we must develop and as well as attitude. Conventional medicine as well as Complementary medicines should be av ailable to patients. Sweden can no longer act as a sovereign power vis-\u00e0- vis the patients, since European law as well as Swedish national legisla tion governs Health Care. In accepting these practitioners and their methods in national legislation through registration, society's mark of approval is given, and Swedish society's overall attitude will have changed into an accepting one. If this is the case, then society should perhaps act against the negativity surrounding Complementary medicine exhibited by licensed medical practitione rs, through official recognition of their methods, grants for research, and educati on. A tenable development of health care systems within the Union with regard s to Complementary medicines requires research of high quality but also ade quate education of both complementary therapists and of Li censed practitioners.343. Co-operation between the two sectors can only be achieved if there is an increased understanding. There are many explanations for the in creasing interest in Complementary medicine in Sweden. Some argue that Co mplementary medicine owes its popularity to the fact that it is effective. Conve ntional medicine has made it possible to successfully treat diseases earlier thought incurable. However, it is also a known fact that Conventional medications can have side effects. Natural remedies have always existed next to Conventional medicine s, and one of the reasons that interest has grown in Paramedicinal remedies in t oday's society is the unwanted side effects of Conventional medicine. The long waiting periods in the State care system is another reason often given - th e growing discontent with th e organisation of modern health care. Hospitals are large and impe rsonal, and licensed medical practitioners do not have enough time for each patient. There has been an increase in specialisation and the individual doctor specia lizes in one part of the human to be repaired, giving him a lesser knowledge of the social and personal reality which may have caused the illness in the firs t place. Where Licensed practitioners may focus on the disease at hand, the compleme ntary methods focus on the patient as a whole. A first examination with a ther apist practicing Complementary medicine usually takes no less than an hour. This is then to be compared with the 15 minutes or less that most licensed medical pr actitioners have at their disposal. 344 The patient leaves with a prescription which may in fact not even be necessary. 342 Referred to in Mod\u00e9er. K.\u00c5., Religionernas et supra 170, page 58. 344 Forskning och Framsteg, Nr 7 2002, page 15. 66Whether the licensed medical practiti oners like it or not, it seems that Complementary medicine is becoming mo re and more incorporated in the consciousness of the public and gaining the acceptance of society at large. 676.
