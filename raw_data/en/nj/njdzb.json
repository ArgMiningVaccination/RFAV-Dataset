Born in Hong Kong, Leung moved to the suburbs of Los Angeles at age 2 with her family before they moved back to Hong Kong when she was 12. She spent a year at Bates College, in Maine, and then decided to transfer to Bristol University in the U.K. to pursue drama. \"I thought I was going to be an actress until I had a realization that I didn't want to kiss anyone,\" says Leung of her decision to pursue fashion instead. \"My friends all said 'Tina, didn't you realize this?!' but I didn't really think about it.\" After spending a year studying styling at F.I.T. and assisting various stylists in New York City, Leung returned to Hong Kong where, while getting her hair done, she showed her stylist her portfolio and he began to suggest her for jobs. This led to gigs doing runway-show styling, choreography, writing articles, styling Hong Kong celebrities, and hosting in-store events and trunk shows. Leung has also collaborated with brands Valentino, Loewe, and Georg Jensen within Hong Kong and has recently signed on to be the fashion and beauty blogger at HK Tatler. She also manages her personal blog, [Tina Loves](http://www.tinaloves.com), which chronicles her fashion week adventures, outfits, and backstage snaps. Despite living in a very brand-conscious city, Leung doesn't rely only on designers and can be spotted in a mix of high-street labels like Zara and J.Crew along with luxury pieces from Givenchy and Carven. She also supports local Hong Kong labels like Season 4, Blues Heroes, and S. Nine. \"I dress the same whether it's in Hong Kong or elsewhere, [and] I really believe that anything goes and I find there are no rules,\" she explains. Unlike her peers, Leung also doesn't plan her outfits in advance for fashion month, choosing to pack her favorite pieces into two suitcases and deciding on her look each day.

Paris Fashion Week FW12 \"I had just gotten off the plane and I was headed to the Dior show, which is why I'm wearing the Miss Dior bag.

Paris Fashion Week SS13 \"I'm wearing a dress by Acne; it's a one-shoulder piece that I've also worn to cocktail events but I chose to add a big sweater because it was chilly.

I first saw it on Alice Dellal maybe six years ago but I didn't do it until three years later. I freaked out at first but then I loved it. It's a nice contrast to my clothes.

Paris FW13 \"I was running late to the Louis Vuitton show, which is why I have no makeup on! The coat is Club Monaco and the green jacket is an inexpensive find from a local Hong Kong store. I thought it matched the panthers' eyes on my Givenchy skirt. Underneath I'm wearing a Victoria's Secret bustier because the skirt is sheer and I couldn't go walking around in my underwear!
