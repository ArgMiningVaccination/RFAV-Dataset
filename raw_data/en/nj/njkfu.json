Contact us to start your treatment. Best Chiropractic Services Welcome to Vida Chiropractic, your trusted chiropractor office serving Ocala and the central Florida area. Our experienced and welcoming team is committed to helping you achieve optimal spinal health and overall wellness. We offer a range of services that can help alleviate back pain, neck pain, headaches, muscular tightness, and tension. Our goal is to help you achieve long-term wellness, so you can live your life to the fullest. At Vida Chiropractic, we believe that true health comes from a balance of physical, mental, and emotional well-being. We take a holistic approach to care and focus on addressing the root cause of your pain or discomfort, rather than just treating the symptoms. If you have suffered from musculoskeletal issues, sports injuries, or car accidents we can help you recover and get back to your normal routine. At your first visit, the doctor will explain how our chiropractic care works and give you a full evaluation to see if our solutions are a good fit to address your concerns. If they are, we can develop a personalized chiropractic plan that meets your unique health needs. You may be searching for pain relief after an accident, experiencing an injury, or if you suffer from a specific condition like chronic back pain or a spinal condition. There are three general phases of chiropractic care offered at our Ocala office: Relief Care: If you are in pain when you come into our office, the first objective is to help you feel better. Depending on the severity of your problem, it is typical to need care 2 to 3 times per week for 4 to 12 weeks. Corrective/Restorative Care: During the corrective care phase, muscles and other tissues are allowed to heal more completely, thereby helping prevent injury. It is typical to need care 4 to 8 times per month for 6 to 24 months, depending on your overall health and the severity of your problem. Wellness Care: Once your body has fully healed, it is important to come in for periodic adjustments to avoid problems in the future. Usually, this only requires a quick visit to the chiropractor 1 to 4 times per month, based on your lifestyle and goals. At Vida Chiropractic, we are dedicated to providing the highest level of care to our patients by using state-of-the-art equipment and techniques to treat these types of injuries, including adjustments, soft tissue therapy, and rehabilitation exercises. We will work with you to improve your overall health, and help you attain your everyday wellness goals!

Service and Techniques At Vida Chiropractic, we take great pride in providing the finest chiropractic wellness care to our patients. Some of the services we offer at our Chiropractor Ocala office are: Chiropractic Adjustment Is a very safe, specific, controlled force applied to a joint to restore proper function and mobility. Accidents, falls, stress or overexertion can negatively impact your spine or other joints. These changes impact tissues, the nervous system and other areas of the body. Left unresolved, this can make you more susceptible to chronic problems. Chiropractic adjustments reduce pain, increase movement and improve performance. (This is directly from Palmer College of Chiropractic). Celluma Therapy Celluma is unique and quite unlike any other low-level light therapy device available today. Based on NASA research, Celluma delivers blue, red and near-infrared light energy simultaneously to safely treat a wide variety of conditions. Each wavelength is absorbed by different molecules that act as a signaling mechanism for different cellular processes. For example, some reduce inflammation and some kill bacteria, while others enhance localized circulation. Laser Therapy It is used to increase the speed, quality and strength of tissue repair, resolve inflammation and give pain relief. Low level laser technology has been found to offer superior healing and pain-relieving effects compared to other electrotherapeutic modalities such as ultrasound, especially in dealing with chronic problems and in the early stages of acute injuries. Low level laser technology is a complete system of treating muscle, tendon, ligament, connective tissue, bone, nerve, and dermal tissues in non-invasive, drug-free modality. Non-Surgical decompression traction therapy is a non-surgical traction therapy for the relief of back and leg pain or neck and arm pain. During this procedure, by cycling through distraction and relaxation phases and by proper positioning, a spinal disc can be isolated and placed under negative pressure, causing a vacuum effect within it. This process can increase disc hydration and open the intervertebral foramina. Electric Muscle Stimulation This type of stimulation is used for: - Relaxation of muscle spasms - Assistance in the management of chronic and intractable pain - Assistance in the attempt to prevent disuse atrophy - Post-traumatic and post-surgical acute pain modulation - Muscle rehabilitation and re-education - Immediate post-surgical stimulation of muscles Complimentary Consultations At Vida Chiropractic,, you will find that your consultation is a conversation and not a commitment.
