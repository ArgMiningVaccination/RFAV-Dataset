As a health practitioner it is my responsibility to offer support tools to every client. With 26 years clinical experience I have developed some very useful support tools to ensure efficient detoxification of any excipients or toxins found in various vaccines, as well as techniques to reduce any side-effects. This article is not written to debate the efficiency of vaccines, rather it is offered as a support protocol to ensure efficient detoxification to maintain long-term health and well-being. Regardless of your position on the use of these, it is important to understand the ingredients found in different vaccines so you can develop an understanding of why it is important to remove these from the body. There is no magic bullet to detoxifying the 'chemicals and toxic adjuvants' found within vaccines, instead it takes some committed lifestyle and nutritional tools. Most vaccines contain an ample amount of aluminium (a heavy metal that when built up can cause memory problems, neuron deterioration, anxiety, disturbed sleep, collagen breakdown and an inability to absorb calcium, phosphorous and silica needed for healthy bones, nerves and healing). Many vaccines also include MSG, formaldehyde (an embalming agent), GMO's, mercury (yes many still contain thermosil), human or monkey DNA, fetal bovine serum, calf serum, 2-phenoxyethoanol (a hazardous substance), fructose, dextrose, artificial colourings, possibly graphene oxide (a molecule 200 times stronger than steel that can excite electrons with 5G frequencies) and many more unwanted elements. The preservatives in vaccines are designed to kill and prevent the growth of micro-organisms and the toxic elements are included in an attempt to preserve the antigens. The antigen and its ingredients are designed to cause 'excitation' so the immune system becomes aroused. When this is repeated over and over, it becomes easy to understand how white blood cells can become confused over time and lose their natural cell-to-cell communication. Some of the potential side-effects of these occurs because of a build up of toxins and heavy metals and some of the side-effects are due to a repetitive over-active immune response. The majority of health problems occur when many of these excipients accumulate in body areas, particularly if they are not removed. Common side-effects listed to vaccines are found on the Australian Government Website and the TGA website. If you suffer from any of the following side-effects it is important to seek medical help or report these to your doctor immediately. Possible short-term side-effects: - Fever - Headache or migraines - Diarrhea or constipation - Generally not feeling well - Coughing - Joint and muscle pain - Blurred vision - Confusion - Seizures - Shortness of breath - Chest pain - Skin bruising - Leg swelling - Severe pain at injection site - Anaphylaxis (an allergic response) to the ingredients in vaccines - Foggy brain - Lymph node swelling - FATIGUE - Hormonal changes - Possible clot risk Possible long-term side-effects: - Guillan-Barre Syndrome (immune disorder affects the nerves) - Pericarditis (inflammation of the muscle around the heart) - Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) - Bell's Palsy - Heart attacks and strokes - Thrombocytemia (ITP - drop in blood platelets) - Possible re-triggering of autoimmunity or immune problems - And many more... The healthier a person is prior to getting a vaccine, the less likely they are to suffer from any long-term side-effects or risks. Ideally, I would begin building up nutrition and health at least two to four weeks before a vaccine and continue for 4 to 8 weeks following. Useful Foods to Encourage Detoxification and Protection It is important to encourage good detoxification of chemicals and excipients found within any medicine. Aim for 8 glasses of pure, alkaline and hydrogen rich water to encourage efficient detoxification via the kidneys, liver and lymphatics. It wouldn't harm to add some 'intermittent' fasting into your protocol to encourage autophagy and stick to primarily a ketogenic diet the rest of the day. Certain foods are rich in powerful antioxidants to help bind to toxins, heavy metals and dangerous elements to make them less harmful. These include: - Cilantro - Avocado - Garlic - Broccoli Blue-green algae - Miso - Turmeric - Beetroot - Green Leafy vegetables - dandelion greens, endive, rocket etc. - Cruciferous vegetables - broccoli, broccolini, radish, kale, brussels sprouts etc. - Avocado oil - Hemp seed oil - Wild caught fish - Bone and vegetable broth - Ginger and galangal - Add lots of herbs like basil oregano, thyme, rosemary and others Chelation Cocktail To Remove Toxin - 3 carrots - rich in shikimic acid - 1 clove of garlic - A handful of fresh wheatgrass - A handful of coriander - 1 lemon, use a little skin - \u00bc fresh beetroot - 1 tablespoon of cracked chlorella powder - 1 tablespoon of a blue-green algae - Alkaline water Only use a cold-pressed juicer to help encourage efficient detoxification.
