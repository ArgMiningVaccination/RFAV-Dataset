The methodological quality of this Bayesian-based network meta-analysis will be performed using the \"Risk of Bias\" tool. Stata 14.0 and WinBUGS 1.4.3 will be used to analyze the data. In addition, assessment of heterogeneity, inconsistency, subgroups, sensitivity, and publication bias will be conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration's tools. Results: The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. Conclusion: This study will help patients recover better, provide clinical evidence for practitioners, and promote the use of TCM in ASD interventions. Copyright \u00a9 2022 the Author(s).
