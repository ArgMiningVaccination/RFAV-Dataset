INTRODUCTION Section 707 of Public Law (P.L.) 102-585, as amended by section 104 of P.L. 105-368 and section 502 of P.L. 111-163, requires that an annual report be submitted to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on the results, status, and priorities of research activities related to the health consequences of military service in the Gulf War (GW) in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; August 2, 1990 -July 31, 1991. The Research Subcommittee of the interagency Deployment Health Working Group (DHWG) prepared the Annual Report to Congress on Federally Sponsored Research on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses for 2012, which is the 19 th report on Federal research and research activities. The DHWG tracks all federally-funded research projects related to GW Veterans' illnesses (GWVI). As in previous annual reports to Congress, the material presented is divided into six sections and three appendices. Section I is an introduction; Section II summarizes the research priorities and organization of the Federal GW research portfolio; Section III highlights and summarizes research progress published since the last annual report to Congress; Section IV summarizes Federal funding trends for GW research during the 10-year period from fiscal year (FY) 2003 through FY 2012; Section V highlights new research projects and initiatives since the last report; Section VI contains literature references; and the Appendices contain listings of federally-funded research projects. II. RESEARCH PRIORITIES The research priorities remain unchanged from last year. The 19 Research Topics (2 of the original 21 topics were eliminated in the 2006 annual report to Congress) are grouped into five major Research Focus Areas. These Research Focus Areas are used to organize Sections III and V, as well as Appendix B (Project Listing by Research Focus Area). In November 2005, at the request of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) developed a set of criteria for inclusion of VA-funded projects in the GW research portfolio and then evaluated the entire VA research portfolio for projects meeting those criteria. The criteria used as the basis for the review are presented in Section II. III. PUBLISHED RESULTS AND STATUS OF THE FIELD IN 2012 Section III provides brief summaries of research articles on the health problems of GW Veterans published during calendar year (CY) 2012 or in CY 2011 after the previous annual report to Congress was submitted. Research results are grouped according to the five Research Focus Areas used to organize the 19 Research Topics (see Section II): Brain and Nervous System Function, Environmental Toxicology, Immune Function, Reproductive Health, and Symptoms and General Health Status. In this section, published research results are described followed by specific study abstracts taken from PubMed. 1 IV. RESEARCH FUNDING TRENDS VA, the Department of Defense (DoD), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funded 412 distinct projects from FY 1992 through FY 2012 related to health problems affecting GW Veterans. The scope of the Federal research portfolio is broad, from small pilot studies to large-scale epidemiology studies involving large populations and major center-based research programs. Federal funding for research on GWVI totaled approximately $230 million for the period from FY 2003 through FY 2012. As of September 30, 2012, 339 projects (85 percent of the 400 projects) were completed, and 61 projects (15 percent) were new or ongoing. V. NEW RESEARCH PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES Eight new projects were funded through the FY 2011 appropriation for the Gulf War Illness Research Program (GWIRP) managed by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) at DoD; these were not initiated until FY 2012. These projects focused on Brain and Nervous System Function (2), Immune Function (1), and Symptoms and General Health (5). VA funded four new projects in FY 2011. Three of these projects focused on Brain and Nervous System Function, and one focused on Symptoms and General Health. 2 I. INTRODUCTION The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required by section 707 of P.L. 102-585, as amended by section 104 of P.L. 105-368 and section 502 of P.L. 111-163, to submit an annual report on the results, status, and priorities of research activities related to the health consequences of military service in the GW to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs. The Research Subcommittee of the interagency DHWG prepared this 2012 annual report to Congress, which is the 19 th report on research and research federally-funded research projects related to GWVI. As in previous annual reports to Congress, the material presented is divided into six sections and three appendices. Section I is an introduction. Section II summarizes the research priorities and organization of the Federal GW research portfolio. Section III highlights and summarizes published research progress since the last report. Section IV summarizes Federal funding trends for GW research during the 10-year period from FY 2003 through FY 2012. Section V highlights new research projects and initiatives since the last annual report to Congress. Section VI contains literature references, and the Appendices contain listings of federally-funded research projects. II. RESEARCH PRIORITIES A. Nineteen Research Topics The Persian Gulf Veterans Coordinating Board (PGVCB) was created in 1994 to coordinate research from VA, DoD, and HHS on GWVI. In 1995, the PGVCB devised a contextual framework for the results of completed and ongoing studies and also to develop an approach for the interpretation of research results. To that end, the PGVCB identified 19 major research questions and subsequently added two additional questions in 1996 (PGVCB, 1996a), to bring the total to 21. The comprehensive GW research portfolio has addressed each of these 21 questions, and relevant results have been published on each one. The Military and Veterans Health Coordinating Board (MVHCB), the successor organization to the PGVCB, conducted a comprehensive assessment of the progress made on each of these 21 questions in the 2000 annual report to Congress. The Research Subcommittee of the DHWG, which was established to address a broader range of deployment health issues, reviewed the 21 questions and replaced them with a corresponding list of 21 Research Topics for the 2004 annual report to Congress (DHWG, 2006a). The original list of 21 questions has been reduced to 19. Based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies review of the scientific literature on infectious diseases (Institute of Medicine, 2006b) and the state of our current scientific knowledge, the conclusion was reached in the 2006 annual report to Congress (DHWG, 2007) that there is no rationale to continue inclusion of infectious diseases as an area of research that 3 will provide answers to the causes or cure for these symptoms. Questions 2 and 19 have, therefore, been removed from the original list of 21 Questions and the third Research Focus Area has been refocused from Immune Function and Infectious Diseases to just Immune Function. Projects originally identified as \" GW research\" under these two questions will continue to be listed in Appendices A and B, but no funding amounts will be shown for FY 2007 or beyond. Similarly, projects related to Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) that were originally included in the Federal GW research portfolio were closed as of FY 2007 (i.e., no funds listed in Appendix C) if they did not directly study a population of ill GW Veterans or were not investigating treatments that may prove beneficial for ill GW Veterans. The IOM report reviewing the available literature on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Veterans (Institute of Medicine, 2006a) concluded there is limited and suggestive evidence of an association between military service and later development of ALS. This strengthens the decision to include ALS as a relevant topic in the Federal portfolio of GW research (DHWG, 2006b). ALS projects included in the GW portfolio are primarily focused on epidemiologic studies in GW Veterans and the development of new methodologies to identify and treat ALS. 4 B. Research Portfolio Descriptors VA maintains a research database of federally sponsored research on GWVI. This includes research conducted by Federal scientists, as well as that by non-Federal scientists supported by Federal research funds through grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements. It is not possible to accurately track research efforts that fall within the private sector or otherwise outside of the purview of the Federal government. Nonetheless, the Research Subcommittee of the DHWG attempts to stay abreast of all research relevant to GWVI. This is accomplished by monitoring peer-reviewed published scientific literature, attending scientific meetings, and even using newspaper reports and personal accounts of researchers. Appendix A lists the projects that VA, DoD, and HHS have funded to date. Research projects are grouped according to the department that is responsible for funding. Dual-funded projects are listed under both departments. Appendix B lists all federally-funded GW research projects regardless of the department providing the funding. Three descriptors are used to categorize each funded project. The first descriptor is the primary Research Focus Area of the project. The five Research Focus Areas are also used to organize the 19 Research Topics (see Section A, above). Brain and Nervous System Function (e.g., studies on neurological or psychological deficits and/or alterations) Organic neuropsychological and neurological deficits (original Question 16) Psychological symptoms and/or diagnoses (original Question 18) Environmental Toxicology (e.g., studies focused on specific environmental exposures such as pesticides, oil well fires, jet fuel, vaccines, medical prophylactic agents, etc.) Petroleum products and combustion products (original Question 3) Occupational/environmental hazards (original Question 4) Organophosphorus nerve agent and/or sulfur mustard from bombing at Muhammadiyat or weapons bunker at Khamisiyah (original Question 5) Chemical agents, other than at Khamisiyah (original Question 6) Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and other medical prophylaxes (e.g., vaccines and anti-malarials) (original Question 7) Psychophysiological stressors (original Question 8) Short-term, low level exposures to PB, N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), or permethrin, alone or in combination as a cause of short-term and/or long-term neurological effects (original Question 17) Immune Function (e.g., studies on alterations in immune function or host defenses) Altered immune function or host defense (original Question 10) Reproductive Health (e.g., studies on sexual and/or reproductive dysfunction) 5 Birth defects in offspring (original Question 11) Lower reproductive success (original Question 12) Sexual dysfunction (original Question 13) Symptoms and General Health (e.g., studies on mortality, pulmonary disease, cancer, chronic multisymptom illnesses, etc.) Increased prevalence or severity of symptoms and/or illnesses (original Question 1) Nonspecific symptoms and symptom complexes (e.g., chronic multisymptom illnesses (CMI)) (original Question 9) Changes in lung function or airway reactivity (original Question 14) Smaller baseline lung function or greater degree of nonspecific airway reactivity (original Question 15) Development of cancers of any type (original Question 20) Mortality rates (original Question 21) Secondary and/or tertiary Research Focus Areas from the above list may also be assigned. Two additional Research Focus Areas may be used for secondary and tertiary assignments. This permits accounting for projects that cover multiple focus areas. Chemical weapons (e.g., sarin, sulfur mustard, etc.) PB and other medical prophylaxes (e.g., vaccines, PB, antimalarials, etc.) The second descriptor is the Project Focus , categorized as follows: Diagnosis: studies that will improve the ability to diagnose previously unexplained conditions or to better refine diagnoses with new tools Exposure: studies that examine individual exposures and/or interactions of exposures (chemical, biological, pharmacological, physiological, etc.) Interactions: interactions of combined exposures (chemical, biological, pharmacological, physiological, etc.) Prevention: studies that will produce knowledge that could lead to disease prevention strategies Symptoms: prevalence and risk factors for symptoms and alterations in general health status Treatment: development or testing of new therapies Each project is assigned up to three Project Focus areas as categorical descriptors. This allows accounting for projects that cover multiple focus areas. For example, a project on the neurophysiological effects of exposure to sarin in animals would have a focus on the brain and nervous system and a focus on chemical weapons. The number of focus areas (between one and three) assigned to a project depends on the project itself. The third descriptor for each project is Research Type . Each research project on GWVI uses a method of approach to test a specific research hypothesis. Although precise categorization of research types can be difficult because of overlapping methodologies, research projects can be divided into the following general types: 6 MECHANISTIC : Research into underlying mechanisms of diseases and illnesses using in vitro and in vivo models. CLINICAL : Application of an intervention, such as in a controlled drug trial, or use of methodologies such as case-control studies to define risk factors for disease. EPIDEMIOLOGY : Study of the distribution and determinants of disease in human populations. It includes population-based studies focused on outcomes such as mortality, symptoms, hospitalizations, etc., using devices such as postal surveys, telephone interviews, and reviews of medical records. DEVELOPMENT : In addition to tracking research on GWVI, the DHWG also tracks development activities. In general, development is the systematic use of the knowledge or understanding gained from research directed toward the production of materials; devices; systems; or methods, including design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes. Within the context of GWVI, the DHWG categorizes activities as development as an activity that satisfies the general definition of development described above and is directed toward new biologically based prevention, intervention, and treatment measures. The research database on GWVI catalogs only research and development activities that either directly involve GW Veterans or answer specific questions about risk factors. An example of the latter is a research project using animal models to determine health effects of low-level chemical warfare agents. The database does not account for the vast accumulated knowledge derived from the Nation' s investment in more generalized biomedical research over the past 50 years. C. Portfolio Criteria In November 2005, at the request of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the VA ORD developed a set of criteria for inclusion of VA-funded projects in the GW research portfolio. The criteria and relevant references from that analysis are presented below. These criteria are now routinely used to identify relevant research projects. New projects selected for funding must meet these criteria and are presented in Section V. 1.

PUBLISHED RESULTS AND STATUS OF THE FIELD IN 2012 Since the last Annual Report to Congress, numerous research studies have provided new and detailed information on the health problems of GW Veterans. A PubMed search retrieved 36 relevant articles published in English in calendar year 2012 or in 2011 after the last report was submitted. These articles include federally and non-federally funded research, as well as international research. This section provides brief highlights of the published research divided into the five Research Focus Areas described in Section II. B., above, followed by the PubMed abstracts. A. Brain and Nervous System Function Studies relevant to Veterans of the1990-1991 GW are presented in this section if they are related to brain and nervous system function. In 2012, most of these studies focused on psychological health and cognitive function. General Brain Function and Exposure Research Mice that were first dosed with PB, insect repellent DEET, and insecticide permethrin then subjected to physical stress were studied with respect to the phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in their brains. These mice had lipid changes relative to control mice, suggesting internal mechanisms that respond to the exposure, and thereby suggesting possible treatment targets (Abdullah et al., 2012). A control group of healthy and ill GW Veterans categorized into three \" syndromes\" were tested for response to innocuous (warm) and noxious (painful) heat while being examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two of the groups of ill Veterans exhibited abnormal processing of sensory stimuli, and this may help explain the chronic 9 pain experienced by some GW Veterans. However, the results are preliminary and a larger study is necessary (Gopinath et al., 2012). Another study compared ill and healthy GW Veterans using a face-name associative memory test during fMRI. The ill Veterans exhibited decreased memory performance relative to the healthy controls, and fMRI data indicated differences between the two groups in the left hippocampus (Odegard et al., 2012). In a third study, a number of objective autonomic tests were used to verify the hypothesis that ill GW Veterans have cholinergic autonomic dysfunction. The autonomic symptom profile scales, sudomotor function, and high-frequency heart rate variability were significantly different from controls and patients categorized in Syndromes 1, 2, and 3 of the Haley case definition for ill GW Veterans (Haley et al., 2013). Neuropsychological Functioning and Stress Response The most common psychological health issue to arise from the GW was PTSD. In a study to monitor trends in treatments for PTSD and other mental disorders, Hermes et al. compared VA workload for the time periods 1997-2005 and 2005-2010. They found that the number of patients treated and the treatment intensity increased over the study' s timeframe (Hermes et al., 2012). In a study of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in GW and Vietnam Veterans, it was found that adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was elevated in the PTSD-positive Veterans of the GW only. These data suggest that dysregulation of the HPA axis in GW Veterans requires additional study (Golier et al., 2012). Amygdala volumes, determined by MRI, in the brains of Vietnam and GW Veterans with and without PTSD were compared. In the groups from both conflicts, the Veterans with PTSD had larger total amygdala volumes than did the non-PTSD Veterans. The conclusions were the same when considering early childhood head trauma or combat trauma (Kuo et al., 2012). A study was designed to evaluate PTSD exposure therapy for Veterans of different wars (total of 112 Veterans from Vietnam, the GW, and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)). After prolonged exposure treatment, the Vietnam and OEF/OIF Veterans were found to respond similarly. GW Veterans did not respond at the same rate or to the same extent. This emphasizes the need for tailored PTSD treatments (Yoder et al., 2012). In a group of 1,381 Australian GW Veterans, those suffering with PTSD were found to be over 7 times more likely to have high blood pressure than those without PTSD (Abouzeid et al., 2012). Hassijia et al. evaluated the effects of combat and personal trauma on women Veterans from the GW and OEF/OIF using PTSD, depression, and alcohol abuse as indicators. Combat exposure was the only parameter which affected the three measures. It was suggested that combat exposure should be part of routine screening for returning Veterans (Hassijia et al., 2012). In one study of hyperarousal, subjects were asked to perform tasks during gunshot and lion roar sounds (Tillman et al., 2012), and in another study, subjects were shown images associated with the 1991 GW (Tillman et al., 2013). Healthy GW Veterans constituted the control group, and ill Veterans were categorized as Syndromes 1, 2, and 3 of the Haley case definition. Both studies found that ill GW Veterans reported hyperarousal significantly 10 more frequently than did the controls, so it was concluded that these are due to damage to the cholinergic, dopaminergic, and white matter systems of the brain. Veterans who served at some time between 1990 and 2007 were studied with respect to the incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS). Incidences were more than 3 times higher for females than for males, regardless of race. When comparing Blacks and Whites, the overall incidence was 1.27 times higher for Blacks. Within the individual U.S. military services, the highest incidence was in the Air Force, the lowest in the Marine Corps. Additional analysis of these data is necessary (Wallin et al., 2012), and additional research into the possible connection of MS to GW service is ongoing. In an unrelated article from the United Kingdom, the authors describe the case of a sea captain who spent several days aboard a burning ship during the Gulf War and was later diagnosed with MS. An autopsy found that the patient also exhibited TDP-43 proteinopathy. The connection between this complicated diagnosis and the possible environmental trigger needs to be studied further (Rosenzweig et al., 2012). B. Environmental Toxicology Environmental agents potentially toxic to GW Veterans in theater were the topics of numerous scientific reports in 2011. These agents can be grouped into three areas: (1) depleted uranium (DU), which is used in armor-piercing munitions; (2) chemical and anti-nerve agents (e.g., mustard gas and PB); and (3) insecticides (e.g., permethrin, chlorpyrifos). DU Urine monitoring and health surveillance of Veterans with embedded metal fragments continues. Of particular concern are those GW Veterans with embedded DU fragments, but no clinically significant health effects have been observed (Squibb et al., 2012). DU has also been measured in semen samples from GW Veterans. Uranium levels range from \" undetectable\" to \" very high\" and correlate with the body burden of uranium in the individuals tested. Some of these Veterans have retained DU fragments (Todorov et al., 2012). Nerve and Chemical Agents It has been proposed that nerve agent plumes in the upper atmosphere traveled south and exposed U.S. troops and set off chemical detectors when Iraqi chemical weapons storage facilities were bombed early in the GW. It has also been suggested that epidemiological studies of GW Veterans need to be reevaluated to include alarms as a surrogate measure of exposure to nerve agents (Tuite and Haley, 2012). As a follow-up study, 8,020 GW-era Veterans were asked about chemical alarms, and they were evaluated for possible exposure to chemical weapons destroyed at Khamisiyah, Iraq. It was concluded that the symptoms in ill GW Veterans were more likely to be associated with the chemical alarms (odds ratio, 4.13) than with the Khamisiyah plume (odds ratio, 1.21) (Haley and Tuite, 11 2012). When mice were exposed to low doses of the nerve agent sarin, they were found to develop chronic heart problems and problems with their autonomic nervous systems. These conditions may be related to GW Veterans' symptoms, and additional work will continue (Shewale et al., 2012). In addition to the possibility that U.S. forces were exposed to nerve agents, it has been suggested that sulfur mustard might be responsible for all GW Veterans' health problems. Recent work suggests that the mechanism involves inhibition of the cytochrome P450 system, and that this warrants further investigation as a possible cause (Brimfield, 2012). Insecticides and Pesticides Individual pesticides and combinations of pesticides and other chemical species have been considered to be important in many of the medical problems exhibited by GW Veterans. After exposing mice to low levels of chlorpyrifos and organophosphate pesticide for five days, it was found that hippocampal synaptic transmission in the brain decreased by 50 percent after three months, thus demonstrating that there was long-term brain damage even though there were no short-term problems (Speed et al., 2012). In a review of the effects of organophosphate exposures, several possible mechanisms of action which do not involve cholinesterase activity are described and discussed. The concern is that the traditional inhibition of cholinesterase by organophosphates cannot account for memory and cognitive problems which can occur after sub-acute exposures. Basic neuronal processes which could be interrupted are discussed along with possible treatments for these exposures (Terry, 2012). C. Immune Dysfunction and Infectious Diseases Broderick, et al. used a multivariate model to compare twelve biomarkers of endocrine and immune system function in three groups of patients. Twenty-six ill GW Veterans, thirteen healthy controls, and nine patients with chronic fatigue syndrome participated, and the GW Veterans could be separated from the other two groups with the sensitivity of 70 percent and specificity of 90 percent (Broderick et al., 2012). In another study, ill and healthy GW Veterans and patients with chronic fatigue syndrome were compared before, during, and after an exercise test. Microarray gene expression profiling, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests, and flow cytometry were used to measure neuroendocrine-immune signaling and inflammatory activity. GW Veterans were determined to exhibit overexpression of exercise response mechanism and neuro - inflammatory response (Broderick, et al., 2013). GWVI have similarities to chronic fatigue syndrome; Moss categorized these as chronic immune system processes that may be caused by reactive oxygen species. It has been further suggested that PB can produce reactive oxygen species and may be linked to the health problems facing GW Veterans (Moss, 2012). Maloney, et al. present a latent viral immune inflammatory response (LVIIR) model to explain CMI. The basis for this model is an inflammatory response to viral antigens that has deleterious effects on the nervous 12 system. The model also suggests that omega-3 fatty acids may decrease inflammation (Maloney et al., 2012). Israeli agreed (Israeli, 2012) with Shoenfeld and Agmon-Levin that siliconosis, GWVI, macrophagic myofasciitis syndrome, and post-vaccination phenomena should be grouped together and referred to as \" autoimmune (or autoinflammatory) syndrome induced by adjuvants\" (ASIA) (Shoenfeld and Agmon-Levin, 2011). Because of the diagnosis in an OIF Veteran, Q fever has been presented as a possible cause for GWVI (Chagaris et al., 2012). The symptom set is similar, and the particular form of Q fever appears to be difficult to identify using standard laboratory tests. Chagaris et al. suggest that Q fever should be considered when treating GW Veterans. D. Reproductive Health Health care data for 178,766 infants born between 1998 and 2004 were reviewed to identify children with birth defects. Overall, deployed GW Veterans were no more likely to have children born with birth defects than were non-deployed Veterans. There was, however, a slight increase in the likelihood of birth defects in children born to men who were deployed for 153 to 200 days compared to those who deployed for significantly shorter times (Bukowinski et al., 2012). Al-Hadithi et al. have reviewed data for birth defects in Iraq since the Gulf War. They neither found objective evidence of increases in birth defects, nor found a connection between birth defects and exposures to depleted uranium or other environmental hazards (Al-Hadithi et al., 2012). E. Symptoms and General Health General Health Delcher and Wang commented on an earlier follow-up study of GW Veterans. In the 10-year follow-up study, it was reported that deployed Veterans were more likely to have worsening health problems than were non-deployed Veterans (Li et al., 2011). It was suggested that the earlier study had not considered whether Veterans had adequate access to health care (insured vs. uninsured) or that the available amount of health care might have changed over time (Delcher and Wang, 2012). Surveys were given to 742 Iraqi Veterans of the GW and 413 Iraqi civilians to determine if there were differences in health status in the two groups. They found that Soldiers who were closer to Kuwait had a higher prevalence of health problems than those who were farther away, and that all Veterans showed a higher prevalence than civilians (Jamil et al., 2011). GWVI, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and Fibromyalgia The prevalence of CMI in deployed GW Veterans appears to be related to a Veteran' s location in the Kuwait theater of operations. For Veterans who were in Iraq and Kuwait, multisymptom illness was most strongly correlated with the use of PB tablets or being within one mile of an exploding SCUD missile. For personnel in support areas, the most 13 significant correlation was with pesticides (Steele et al., 2012). VA amended its regulation regarding compensation for GW Veterans. Veterans will have until December 31, 2016, to report disabilities associated with undiagnosed illnesses or medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (VA, 2011; VA, 2012). A study has been designed to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating ill GW Veterans. Subjective measures of quality of life and biomarkers of inflammation and immune system function will be used in the evaluation. Patients have been recruited, and the study is ongoing (Conboy et al., 2012). F. Abstracts from Published Research Abdullah L, Evans JE, Bishop A, Reed JM, Crynen G, Phillips J, Pelot R, Mullan MA, CM, Mullan G, FC (2012) Lipidomic of Phosphocholine Containing Brain Lipids in Mice with Sensorimotor Deficits and Anxiety-Like Features After Exposure to Gulf War Agents. Neuromolecular Med 14(4):349-361. The central nervous system (CNS)-based symptoms of Gulf War Illness (GWI) include motor dysfunction, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Gulf War (GW) agents, such as pyridostigmine bromide (PB), permethrin (PER), N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), and stress, are among the contributory factors to the pathobiology of GWI. This study characterizes disturbances in phosphocholine-containing lipids that accompany neurobehavioral and neuropathological features associated with GW agent exposure. Exposed mice received PB orally, dermal application of PER and DEET and restraint stress daily for 28 days, while controls received vehicle during this period. Neurobehavioral studies included the rotarod, open field, and Morris water maze tests. Histopathological assessments included glial fibrillary acid protein, source collision-induced dissociation in negative and positive ionization scanning modes was performed to characterize brain phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM). A significant increase in 40:2) was observed in exposed mice compared with controls. Among differentially expressed PCs, levels of those with monounsaturated fatty acids were more affected than those with saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Sensorimotor deficits and anxiety, together with an increase in astrocytosis, were observed in exposed mice compared with controls. These lipid changes suggest that alterations in peroxisomal pathways and stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity accompany neurobehavioral and neuropathological changes after GW agent exposure and represent possible treatment targets for the CNS symptoms of GWI. Abouzeid M, Kelsall HL, Forbes AB, Sim MR, Creamer MC (2012) Posttraumatic stress disorder and hypertension in Australian Veterans of the 1991 Gulf War. J Psychosom Res 72(1):33-38. (Epub 2011 Sep 21.) OBJECTIVE: Military Veterans experience a high prevalence of psychopathologies such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Relationships between physical and 14 psychological health are increasingly recognised. This study investigated associations between PTSD and hypertension in male Australian GW Veterans. METHODS: In 2000-02, 1456 Veterans underwent medical and psychological assessments. Medical practitioners rated self-reported medical conditions as probable diagnoses, possible, unlikely or non-medical. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) assessed psychological symptomatology present in the 12 months preceding evaluation, and lifetime prevalence. Odds of hypertension among those with and without PTSD were calculated for each timeframe using logistic regression. RESULTS: Analysis was restricted to the 1381 Veterans for whom CIDI and medical data were available. Hypertension was considered probable in 100 subjects (7.2 percent). Adjusted odds ratios of hypertension were 2.90 (95 percent CI 1.19-7.09) amongst Veterans with PTSD in the past 12 months and 2.27 (95 percent CI 1.01-5.10) for lifetime prevalence, compared with those without PTSD. Hypertension was over seven times more likely amongst Veterans with PTSD alone than those with no mental illness in the past 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Veterans with a history of PTSD had increased odds of having hypertension. Given the array of disabling psychosocial associations of PTSD, and the numerous potential clinical sequelae of hypertension, co-existence of these conditions may have implications for prevention and management at the individual, clinical, and public health policy and practice level. Early identification of PTSD in military samples may help to ameliorate longer-term adverse physical health outcomes. Al-Hadithi TS, Al-Diwan JK, Saleh AM, Shabila NP (2012) Birth defects in Iraq and the plausibility of environmental exposure: A review. Confl Health 28;6(1):3. An increased prevalence of birth defects was allegedly reported in Iraq in the post 1991 GW period, which was largely attributed to exposure to depleted uranium used in the war. This has encouraged further research on this particular topic. This paper reviews the published literature and provided evidence concerning birth defects in Iraq to elucidate possible environmental exposure. In addition to published research, this review used some direct observation of birth defects data from Al-Ramadi Maternity and Paediatric Hospital in Al-Anbar Governorate in Iraq from1st July 2000 through 30th June 2002. In addition to depleted uranium other war-related environmental factors have been studied and linked directly or indirectly with the increasing prevalence of birth defects. However, the reviewed studies and the available research evidence do not provide a clear increase in birth defects and a clear indication of a possible environmental exposure, including depleted uranium although the country has been facing several environmental challenges since 1980. 15 Brimfield AA (2012) Chemicals of military deployments: revisiting Gulf War Syndrome in light of new information. Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci 112:209-230. Despite the amount of hard work that has gone into elucidating a toxicological basis for GWI, we do not appear to have reached a mechanistic understanding. Investigation of long-term low-level exposure as a basis does not seem to have provided an answer. Nor does the deployment-related toxic soup idea, where exposure to a mixture of toxic chemicals not usually encountered in the same physical vicinity, seems to have explained the symptoms developed by GW Veterans. The idea that an overabundance of CNS acetylcholine leftover from excessive cholinesterase inhibition is at the basis of this syndrome is intellectually appealing and offers a level of neurochemical complexity that may be just beyond the reach of our technical understanding. But no one has yet assembled a coherent mechanism from it either. It seems reasonable that chemical warfare agents were involved. They were not included in early work because it was felt that the toxicant plumes produced during the destruction of stockpiled Iraqi chemical weapons had not been large enough to cause an exposure of US forces and those of our allies. That misconception was disproven, and it is now accepted that people could very well have been exposed to low levels of massive quantities of sarin, cyclosarin, and sulfur mustard. It also seems reasonable that excess acetylcholine or neurological consequences of its presence that we do not fully understand were involved. The combination of nerve agents and the insecticidal anticholinesterases plus the pyridostigmine bromide given prophylactically were probably sufficient to cause the problem. However, the most notable thing is the result of recent work on the toxic mechanism of sulfur mustard showing that it can inhibit the microsomal electron transport chain as a result of sulfonium ion reduction to carbon free radicals by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. This information was not available during the work on GWI. So this provides an opportunity to discuss the effects of the general inhibition of the cytochrome P450 system superimposed on the conditions encountered by the participants in Desert Storm and Desert Shield as an approach to the toxicology of mixtures. Broderick G, Ben-Hamo R, Vashishtha S, Efroni S, Nathanson L, Barnes Z, Fletcher MA, Klimas N (2013) Altered immune pathway activity under exercise challenge in Gulf War Illness: an exploratory analysis. Brain Behav Immun 28:159-169. (Epub 2012 Nov 29.) Though potentially linked to the basic physiology of stress response we still have no clear understanding of GWI, a debilitating illness presenting with a complex constellation of immune, endocrine and neurological symptoms. Here we compared male GWI (n=20) with healthy Veterans (n=22) and subjects with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) (n=7). Blood was drawn during a Graded eXercise Test (GXT) prior to exercise, at peak effort (VO2 max) and 4-h post exercise. Affymetrix HG U133 plus 2.0 microarray gene expression profiling in peripheral blood mon onuclear cells (PBMCs) was used to estimate activation of over 500 documented pathways. This was cast against ELISA-based measurement of 16 cytokines in plasma and flow cytometric assessment of lymphocyte populations and cytotoxicity. A 2-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons (q statistic <0.05) indicated significant increases in neuroendocrine - 16 immune signaling and inflammatory activity in GWI, with decreased apoptotic signaling. Conversely, cell cycle progression and immune signaling were broadly subdued in CFS. Partial correlation networks linking pathways with symptom severity via changes in immune cell abundance, function and signaling were constructed. Central to these were changes in IL-10 and CD2+ cell abundance and their link to two pathway clusters. The first consisted of pathways supporting neuronal development and migration whereas the second was related to androgen-mediated activation of NF-B. These exploratory results suggest an over-expression of known exercise response mechanisms as well as illness-specific changes that may involve an overlapping stress-potentiated neuro-inflammatory response. Broderick G, Fletcher MA, Gallagher M, Barnes Z, Vernon SD, Klimas NG (2012) Exploring the diagnostic potential of immune biomarker coexpression in Gulf War illness. Methods Mol Biol 934:145-164. Complex disorders like GWI often defy diagnosis on the basis of a single biomarker and may only be distinguishable by considering the coexpression of multiple markers measured in response to a challenge. We demonstrate the practical application of such an approach using an example where blood was collected from 26 GWI, thirteen healthy control subjects, and 9 unhealthy controls with Chronic Fatigue at three points during a graded exercise challenge. A 3-way multivariate projection model based on 12 markers of endocrine and immune function was constructed using a training set of n = 10 GWI and n = 11 healthy controls. These groups were separated almost completely on the basis of two coexpression patterns. In a separate test set these same features allowed for discrimination of new GWI subjects (n = 16) from unhealthy (n = 9) and healthy control subjects with a sensitivity of 70 percent and a specificity of 90 percent.

Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol 94(9):721-8. (Epub 2012 Aug 18.) BACKGROUND: Concerns about reproductive health persist among U.S. military members who served in the 1990-1991 Gulf War. This study explores the long-term impact of 1990-1991 GW deployment on the prevalence of birth defects among infants of GW Veterans. METHODS: Health care data from the DOD Birth and Infant Health Registry and demographic and deployment information from the Defense Manpower Data Center were used to identify infants born between 1998 and 2004 to both male and female 1990-1991 GW Veterans. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated the adjusted odds of any birth defect and eight specific birth defects among infants of deployers versus non - deployers. In addition, birth defects were evaluated among infants born to 1990-1991 GW Veterans with deployment-specific exposures. 17 RESULTS: Among 178,766 infants identified for these analyses, 3.4 percent were diagnosed with a birth defect in the first year of life. Compared to infants of non-deployers, infants of deployers were not at increased odds of being diagnosed with a birth defect, or any of eight specific birth defects, in the first year of life. A slightly increased prevalence of birth defects was observed among infants born to men who deployed to the 1990-1991 GW for 153 to 200 days compared to those who deployed for 1 to 92 days. No other deployment-specific exposures were associated with birth defects in these infants. CONCLUSIONS: The 1990-1991 Gulf War deployers, including those with specific exposures of concern, were not found to be at increased risk for having infants with birth defects 7 to 14 years after deployment. Chagaris MJ, Smith RC, Goldstein AL (2012) Immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G seronegative Q fever: a Hypothesis for Veterans' Medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illnesses. J Spec Oper Med 12(1):37-48. We present Q fever as a credible hypothesis for GWVI and as a possible etiology for prevalent symptomologies affecting currently serving servicemembers. Q fever is caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii, which is endemic throughout the Middle East. Q fever may manifest in many forms of widely varying and often inconstant symptoms. Due to false-negative interpretations in current and past diagnostic testing, Q fever has not received appropriate consideration as a possible causative agent for medically unexplained Veterans' illnesses. Review of current literature invites us to consider that a form of Q fever involving an incomplete immune response is a potential cause of these debilitating illnesses. We hypothesize C. burnetii infection coincidental to exposures suppressing antibody-specific immune response results in infection mediated by immunoglobulin D (IgD). Literature indicates that successful treatment for this form of Q fever requires the concurrent administration of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine.

INTRODUCTION: It can be challenging to study complex and novel health states within the parameters of a RCT. This report describes the use of an unblinded Phase II Clinical Trial design to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of GWI. GWI is a complex illness found among Veterans of the first GW, and is characterized by multiple symptoms, including fatigue, sleep and mood disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and musculoskeletal pain. No published trials of acupuncture for the treatment of GWI exist. This trial is designed to both answer questions of the effectiveness of acupuncture for our entire sample, as well as subgroups with of individual presentations of GWI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our primary outcome is quality of life as measured by the SF-36. In an effort to better understand this complex disease and its treatment, our multi - level measurement plan examines psychosocial variables, fatigue, sleep quality, pain, and biomarkers of inflammation and immune status. All of the measurement instruments used in this trial show good validity and reliability. 18 RESULTS: This study is ongoing and clinical results are not available. We have achieved good feasibility of our recruitment, treatment, and data collection procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Low constraint RCT designs are an appropriate choice when investigating conditions in which the causes and mechanisms of disease are poorly understood. This naturalistic RCT includes individualized protocols, a clinically supported length and dose of treatment, a wait list control arm, and the ethical benefit that all subjects receive treatment during the study.

(Epub 2011 Aug 2.) BACKGROUND: Alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity have been observed in GW Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which differ from those observed in other veteran groups, raising the possibility that there is a unique neuroendocrine profile in this group of Veterans. This study seeks to further characterize 19 the effects of PTSD, military cohort (Vietnam, 1991 Gulf War, Operations Enduring Freedom/Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF)), and their interaction on the neuroendocrine response to synthetic corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) stimulation. METHODS: Fifty-one male Veterans were studied consisting of 21 from the Vietnam era, 16 from the Gulf War era, and 14 from the OEF/OIF era. Sixteen of these Veterans were deployed to a war zone and had chronic PTSD (PTSD+), 25 were deployed to a war zone and did not have chronic PTSD (PTSD-), and 10 were not deployed to a war zone and did not have PTSD (non-exposed). The participants underwent the CRF stimulation test in the afternoon (approximately 2:00 p.m.), which measures the integrity and sensitivity of the pituitary-adrenal axis. Plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were measured at baseline and at intervals over a 2h period following intravenous administration of 1 g/kg of ovine CRF (o-CRF, max 100 g). In a small subset of participants, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and cortisol binding globulin (CBG) were also assessed. RESULTS: There was a significant group by era interaction in the response of ACTH to CRF, in addition to a main effect of group (PTSD+, PTSD-, non-exposed). The interaction reflected that group differences were only evident in the GW cohort; among GW era Veterans, the PTSD+ group had higher elevations in ACTH levels following CRF than the PTSD- group and the non-exposed group. Additionally, the peak change in ACTH was associated with a self-reported environmental exposure (pyridostigmine bromide ingestion) which has been found to be linked to the excess morbidity found in GW Veterans. Self-reported childhood trauma was greater in Veterans of the GW than Vietnam or OEF/OIF, but did not account for the observed differences. There was a significant effect of group on the cortisol response to CRF, reflecting greater responsivity in both of the deployed groups (PTSD+ and PTSD-) compared to the non-exposed group which could be accounted for by baseline differences in cortisol levels; unlike the ACTH response, the cortisol response did not differ by era. There were no effects of group, era, or their interaction on the DHEA and CBG response to CRF. CONCLUSIONS: A uniform pattern of PTSD-related alterations in the response to intravenous CRF was not found. Rather, PTSD-related alterations were found only in Veterans of the 1991 Gulf War, and were characterized by an enhanced pituitary response to CRF which may reflect increased sensitivity of pituitary corticotrophs or CRF hyposecretion. Together with previous neuroendocrine findings, the data suggest the HPA axis is dysregulated in GW Veterans in unique ways which may reflect the long-term effects of environmental exposures in addition to disease effects. Further work is needed to characterize these effects and their impact on long-term psychological and medical outcomes. 20 Gopinath K, Gandhi P, Goyal A, Jiang L, Fang Y, Ouyang L, Ganji S, Buhner D, Ringe W, Spence J, Biggs M, Briggs R, Haley R (2012) fMRI reveals abnormal central processing of sensory and pain stimuli in ill GW Veterans. Neurotoxicology 33(3):261-271. (Epub 2012 Feb 4.) Many Veterans, chronically ill from the 1991 Gulf War, exhibit symptoms of altered sensation, including chronic pain. In this study of 55 Veterans of a Construction Battalion previously examined in 1995-1996 and 1997-1998, brain activation to innocuous and noxious heat stimuli was assessed in 2008-2009 with a quantitative sensory testing fMRI protocol in control Veterans and groups representing three syndrome variants. Testing outside the scanner revealed no significant differences in warm detection or heat pain threshold among the four groups. In the fMRI study, Syndrome 1 and Syndrome 2, but not Syndrome 3, exhibited hypo-activation to innocuous heat and hyper-activation to noxious heat stimuli compared to controls. The results indicate abnormal central processing of sensory and painful stimuli in 2 of 3 variants of GWI and call for a more comprehensive study with a larger, representative sample of Veterans.

JAMA Neurol. 70(2):191-200. (Epub 2012 Nov 26.) Abstract: BACKGROUND: The authors of prior small studies raised the hypothesis that symptoms in Veterans of the 1991 Gulf War, such as chronic diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction, are due to cholinergic autonomic dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To perform a confirmatory test of this prestated hypothesis in a larger, representative sample of GW Veterans. DESIGN: Nested case-control study. SETTING: Clinical and Translational Research Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas. PARTICIPANTS: Representative samples of GW Veterans meeting a validated case definition of Gulf War illness with 3 variants (called syndromes 1-3) and a control group, all selected randomly from the US Military Health Survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Validated domain scales from the Autonomic Symptom Profile questionnaire, the Composite Autonomic Severity Score, and high-frequency heart rate variability from a 24-hour electrocardiogram. RESULTS: The Autonomic Symptom Profile scales were significantly elevated in all 3 syndrome groups (P< .001), primarily due to elevation of the orthostatic intolerance, secretomotor, upper gastrointestinal dysmotility, sleep dysfunction, urinary, and autonomic diarrhea symptom domains. The Composite Autonomic Severity Score was also higher in 21 the 3 syndrome groups (P= .045), especially in syndrome 2, primarily due to a significant reduction in sudomotor function as measured by the Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test, most significantly in the foot; the score was intermediate in the ankle and upper leg and was nonsignificant in the arm, indicating a peripheral nerve length-related deficit. The normal increase in high-frequency heart rate variability at night was absent or blunted in all 3 syndrome groups (P< .001). CONCLUSION: Autonomic symptoms are associated with objective, predominantly cholinergic autonomic deficits in the population of GW Veterans. Haley RW, Tuite JJ (2012) Epidemiologic Evidence of Health Effects from Long- Distance Transit of Chemical Weapons Fallout from Bombing Early in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Neuroepidemiology 40(3):178-189. BACKGROUND: Military intelligence data published in a companion paper explain how chemical fallout from U.S. and Coalition bombing of Iraqi chemical weapons facilities early in the air campaign transited long distance, triggering nerve agent alarms and exposing U.S. troops. We report the findings of a population-based survey designed to test competing hypotheses on the impact on chronic GWI of nerve agent from early-war bombing versus post-war demolition. METHODS: The U.S. Military Health Survey performed computer-assisted telephone interviews of a stratified random sample of GW-era Veterans (n = 8,020). Early-war exposure was measured by having heard nerve agent alarms and post-war exposure, by the computer-generated plume from the Khamisiyah demolition. GWI was measured by two widely published case definitions. RESULTS: The OR (95 percent CI) for the association of alarms with the Factor case definition was 4.13 (95 percent CI 2.51-6.80) compared with 1.21 (95 percent CI 0.86-1.69) for the Khamisiyah plume. There was a dose-related trend for the number of alarms (p(trend) < 0.001) but not for the number of days in the Khamisiyah plume (p(trend) = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to low-level sarin nerve agent in fallout from bombing early in the air campaign contributed more to chronic illness than post-war demolition.

J Trauma Stress 25(2):216-219. The present study evaluated the impact of combat and interpersonal trauma exposure in a sample of 115 U.S. women Veterans from Gulf War I and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars on 3 postdeployment trauma-related mental health outcomes: posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PSS), depressive symptom severity (DSS), and alcohol misuse. Patients presenting for health care services at a Veterans Affairs post-deployment health specialty clinic, completed screening questionnaires that assessed combat exposure, 22 lifetime interpersonal trauma history of childhood neglect, physical, or sexual abuse, and adult sexual and physical assault. In a regression model, combat exposure was the only significant independent variable associated with PSS, DSS, and alcohol misuse ( = .42, .27 and B = 1.58, respectively) even after adding lifetime interpersonal assault exposure to the model. Results highlight the negative effects of combat exposure on treatment-seeking women Veterans' postdeployment mental health. Incorporating combat exposure into routine screening procedures for GW and Iraq and Afghanistan war women Veterans can aid in mental health treatment planning. Hermes ED, Rosenheck RA, Desai R, Fontana AF (2012) Recent Trends in the Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Other Mental Disorders in the VHA. Psychiatr Serv 63(5):471-476. OBJECTIVE: This study proposed to evaluate the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) specialty mental health care workload for treating PTSD and other mental disorders between 2005 and 2010 in comparison with results from 1997 to 2005. The 2005-2010 time frame represents a period of increased utilization of services by recently returning Veterans and of program expansion within VHA. METHODS: VHA administrative databases were queried for all Veterans receiving specialty mental health treatment annually between 2005 and 2010. Veterans were categorized by military service era (WWII or Korea, Vietnam, post-Vietnam, Persian Gulf War [including operations in Iraq and Afghanistan], and peacetime or other), diagnosis (PTSD or a non-PTSD mental disorder), and deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. RESULTS: The total number of Veterans served per year increased by 623,326 (117.6 percent) between 1997 and 2010. Veterans with PTSD increased at a greater rate since 2005 compared with Veterans with other mental disorders. Vietnam Veterans constituted a majority of all Veterans treated for PTSD or for other mental disorders, and the number of Vietnam Veterans treated for PTSD continues to grow. The number of visits per Veteran with PTSD increased between 2006 and 2010, reversing previous trends. The rate of increase has been highest for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. CONCLUSIONS: Both the number treated and treatment intensity have increased for Veterans with PTSD who served in current conflicts, which might be expected, and in the Vietnam era, now 30 years past. A reversal of past declines in treatment intensity coincides with an increase in PTSD treatment funding and program expansion since 2005. Israeli E (2012) Gulf War syndrome as a part of the autoimmune (autoinflammatory) syndrome induced by adjuvant (ASIA). Lupus 21(2):190-194. Gulf War syndrome (GWS) is a multi-symptom condition comprising a variety of signs and symptoms described in the literature, which not been fully resolved. The various symptoms of the condition include muscle fatigue and tiredness, malaise, myalgia, impaired cognition, ataxia, diarrhoea, bladder dysfunction, sweating disturbances, headaches, fever, arthralgia, skin rashes, gastrointestinal, and sleep disturbances. In 23 addition, excessive chemical sensitivity and odour intolerance is reported. The aetiology of the condition is unclear, but many reviews and epidemiological analyses suggest association with pyridostigmine bromide (PB), certain vaccination regimes, a variety of possible chemical exposures, including smoke from oil-well fires or depleted uranium from shells, as well as physical and psychological stress. Recently, Shoenfeld et al. suggested that four conditions--siliconosis, macrophagic myofaciitis (MMF), GWS and post-vaccination phenomena--that share clinical and pathogenic resemblances, may be incorporated into common syndrome called \" Autoimmune (Autoinflammatory) Syndrome induced by Adjuvants\" (ASIA). Symptoms and signs of the four conditions described by Shoenfeld et al. show that at least eight out of ten main symptoms are in correlation in all four conditions. Namely, myalgia, arthralgias, chronic fatigue, neurological cognitive impairment, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, skin manifestations and appearance of autoantibodies. Regardless of the aetiology of GWS, be it exposure to environmental factors or chemical drugs, vaccinations or the adjuvants in them, GWS fits well with the definition of ASIA and is included as part of \" Shoenfeld's syndrome.\" Jamil H, Hamdan TA, Grzybowski M, Arnetz BB (2011) Health effects associated with geographical area of residence during the 1991 Gulf War: a comparative health study of Iraqi soldiers and civilians. US Army Med Dep J Jul-Sep:87-96. CONTEXT: Although Iraqis sustained the gravest exposure conditions during the 1991 Gulf War (GW), little is known about the possible relationship between environmental exposures during the GW and long-term health in Iraqis. OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between distance from Kuwait during the GW and somatic health among Iraqi Soldiers vs. civilians. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 742 GW Veterans and 413 civilians in Iraq. The odds ratios were calculated for somatic disorders as a function of distance from Kuwait during the GW, as well as a self-reported environmental exposure index. RESULTS: Soldiers reported a significantly higher prevalence of somatic disorders as compared to civilians. Soldiers closest to Kuwait reported significantly more somatic disorders as compared to Soldiers deployed further away from Kuwait. CONCLUSION: Iraqi GW Veterans are at an increased risk of numerous somatic disorders. Soldiers are at an increased risk compared to civilians, suggesting that war-associated exposures are of etiologic relevance. 24 Kuo JR, Kaloupek DG, Woodward SH (2012) Amygdala Volume in Combat-Exposed Veterans With and Without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Cross-sectional Study. Arch Gen Psychiatry 69(10):1080-1086. CONTEXT: Data from animal models demonstrate a link between stress exposure and hypertrophic changes in the amygdala; however, studies of adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have failed to find analogous structural alterations. OBJECTIVES: To compare amygdala volumes between a sample of combat Veterans with and without PTSD (analysis 1) and examine whether our observation of larger amygdala volume in individuals with PTSD could be accounted for by the presence of trauma exposure in childhood and the severity of combat exposure in adulthood (analysis 2). DESIGN: Cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging. SETTING: Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System Inpatient Trauma Recovery Program and Veterans Affairs New England Health Care System Outpatient PTSD program. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-nine combat-exposed Veterans from the Vietnam Conflict or the Persian Gulf War who had been exposed to substantial military operational stress. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Amygdala volume adjusted for total cerebral volume, Life Events Checklist, and the Combat Exposure Scale. RESULTS: Analysis 1 indicated that combat-exposed individuals with PTSD exhibited larger total amygdala volume compared with their non-PTSD counterparts (99 individuals, P = .047). Analysis 2 indicated that greater severity of combat exposure (87 individuals, P = .02), as well as the interaction between the presence of early life trauma and the severity of combat exposure (87 individuals, P = .008), were significantly associated with smaller total amygdala volume. The PTSD diagnosis continued to explain larger amygdala volume (87 individuals, P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: PTSD is associated with enlarged amygdala volume, above the variance accounted for by a history of early life trauma and severity of adult trauma exposure. The discrepancy between our and prior findings may be explained by variability in these trauma indices in previous investigations. These findings support additional study of amygdala structure in human stress disorders and further delineation of the role of early and adult trauma on associated neurologic changes. 25 Maloney CD, Jensen S, Gil-Rivas V, Goolkasian P (2013) Latent viral immune inflammatory response model for chronic multisymptom illness. Med Hypotheses 80(3):220-229. (Epub 2012 Dec 21.) A latent viral immune inflammatory response (LVIIR) model is presented which integrates factors that contribute to chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) in both the veteran and civilian populations. The LVIIR model for CMI results from an integration of clinical experience with a review of the literature in four distinct areas: (1) studies of idiopathic multisymptom illness in the veteran population including two decades of research on Gulf War I Veterans with CMI; (2) new evidence supporting the existence of chronic inflammatory responses to latent viral antigens and the effect these responses may have on the nervous system; (3) recent discoveries concerning the role of vitamin D in maintaining normal innate and adaptive immunity including suppression of latent viruses and regulation of the immune inflammatory response; and (4) the detrimental effects of extreme chronic repetitive stress (ECRS) on the immune and nervous systems. The LVIIR model describes the pathophysiology of a pathway to CMI and presents a new direction for the clinical assessment of CMI that includes the use of neurological signs from a physical exam, objective laboratory data, and a new proposed latent viral antigen-antibody imaging technique for the peripheral and central nervous system. The LVIIR model predicts that CMI can be treated by a focus on reversal of immune system impairment, suppression of latent viruses and their antigens, and healing of nervous system tissue damaged by chronic inflammation associated with latent viral antigens and by ECRS. In addition, the LVIIR model suggests that maintaining optimal serum 25 OH vitamin D levels will maximize immune system suppression of latent viruses and their antigens and will minimize immune system inflammation. This model also emphasizes the importance of decreasing ECRS to improve immune system function and to minimize nervous system injury from excess serum glucocorticoid levels. The proposed model supports growing evidence that increasing omega 3 essential fatty acid levels in nervous system tissues may decrease inflammation in the nervous system and improve neural plasticity and recovery from neuronal injury. Moss JL (2012) Gulf War illnesses are autoimmune illnesses caused by reactive oxygen species which were caused by nerve agent prophylaxis. Med Hypotheses 79(2):283-284. (Epub 2012 May 24.) GWI share many of the features of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and both CFS and GWI may be the result of chronic immune system processes. The main suspected cause for GWI, the drug pyridostigmine bromide (PB), has been shown to cause neuronal damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS have been associated with IgM mediated autoimmune responses against ROS induced neoepitopes in depressed patients and this may also apply to CFS. It therefore follows that the drug used in the GW caused ROS, the ROS modified native molecules, and that this trigged the autoimmune condition we refer to as Gulf War illnesses. Similar mechanisms may apply to other autoimmune illnesses. 26 Odegard TN, Cooper CM, Farris EA, Arduengo J, Bartlett J, Haley R (2012) Memory impairment exhibited by Veterans with Gulf War Illness. Neurocase (Epub 2012 Apr 23, ahead of print.) Roughly 26-32 percent of U.S. Veterans, who served in the first GW, report suffering from chronic health problems ( Golomb, 2008 , Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, 105, 4295). The present study investigated the memory deficits reported by these ill GW Veterans (GWV) using a face-name associative memory paradigm administered during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The fMRI data confirmed memory performance on the memory task to be related to the amount of activation in the left hippocampus observed during the study. In addition, ill-GWV demonstrated decreased memory performance relative to unaffected GWV on this memory test, providing evidence of memory deficits using an objective measure of memory. Rosenzweig I, Bodi I, Nashef L (2012) Comorbid Multiple Sclerosis and TDP-43 Proteinopathy in a Gulf War 24(1):E41-E42. (Letter.) Shewale EE, Lucot JB, Morris M (2012) Sarin causes autonomic imbalance and cardiomyopathy: an important issue for military and civilian health. J Cardiovasc Pharmacol. 60(1):76-87. Sarin, a lethal chemical nerve agent, may be a causative factor in multifactorial syndrome implicated in the GW and Tokyo terrorist attacks. Although a high dose results in seizure and death, low-dose exposure may lead to autonomic imbalance and chronic cardiac pathologies. In this study, echocardiography and electrocardiography were used to examine the late-onset effects of a low-dose sarin on cardiac structure and function in mice. Adrenal corticosterone and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels were measured. Stress responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis was also tested. Findings demonstrate changes consistent with a dilated cardiomyopathy, including left ventricular dilatation, reduced contractility, and altered electrophysiological and inotropic responses also indicate reduced adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA, corticosterone and altered stress responsiveness indicating autonomic imbalance. The role of low-dose sarin/organophosphate exposure needs to be considered in the military and civilian populations that suffer from autonomic imbalance and/or cardiomyopathies of indeterminate origin. Speed HE, Blaiss CA, Kim A, Haws ME, Melvin NR, Jennings M, Eisch AJ, Powell CM (2012) Delayed reduction of hippocampal synaptic transmission and spines following exposure to repeated subclinical doses of organophosphorus pesticide in adult mice. Toxicol Sci 125(1):196-208. (Epub 2011 Sep 26.) Agricultural and household organophosphorus (OP) pesticides inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AchE), resulting in increased acetylcholine (Ach) in the central nervous system. In adults, acute and prolonged exposure to high doses of AchE inhibitors causes severe, clinically apparent symptoms, followed by lasting memory impairments and cognitive dysfunction. 27 The neurotoxicity of repeated environmental exposure to lower, subclinical doses of OP pesticides in adults is not as well studied. However, repeated exposure to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as chlorpyrifos (CPF), pyridostigmine, and sarin nerve agent, has been epidemiologically linked to delayed onset symptoms in GWI and may be relevant to environmental exposure in farm workers among others. We treated adult mice with a subclinical dose (5 mg/kg) of CPF for 5 consecutive days and investigated hippocampal synaptic transmission and spine density early (2-7 days) and late (3 months) after CPF administration. No signs of cholinergic toxicity were observed at any time during or after treatment. At 2-7 days after the last injection, we found increased synaptic transmission in the CA3-CA1 region of the hippocampus of CPF-treated mice compared with controls. In contrast, at 3 months after CPF administration, we observed a 50 percent reduction in synaptic transmission likely due to a corresponding 50 percent decrease in CA1 pyramidal neuron synaptic spine density. This study is the first to identify a biphasic progression of synaptic abnormalities following repeated OP exposure and suggests that even in the absence of acute cholinergic toxicity, repeated exposure to CPF causes delayed persistent damage to the adult brain in vivo. Squibb KS, Gaitens JM, Engelhardt S, Centeno JA, Xu H, Gray P, McDiarmid MA (2012) Surveillance for Long-Term Health Effects Associated With Depleted Uranium Exposure and Retained Embedded Fragments in US Veterans. J Occup Environ Med 54(6):724-32. OBJECTIVE: To ensure that all Veterans with retained embedded fragments are properly monitored for potential health effects of embedded materials. METHODS: Urine biomonitoring and health surveillance programs were developed to gather information about health risks associated with chemicals released from embedded fragments. RESULTS: Elevated systemic exposure to depleted uranium (DU) that continues to occur in Veterans with DU fragments remains a concern, although no clinically significant DU-related health effects have been observed to date. Other metals and local tissue reactions to embedded fragments are also of concern. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge gained from these programs will help to develop guidelines for surgical removal of tissue-embedded fragments. Steele L, Sastre A, Gerkovich MM, Cook MR (2012) Complex Factors in the Etiology of Gulf War Illness: Wartime Exposures and Risk Factors in Veteran Subgroups. Environ Health Perspect 120(1):112-118. (Epub 2011 Sep 7.) BACKGROUND: At least one-fourth of U.S. Veterans who served in the 1990-1991 Gulf War are affected by the chronic symptomatic illness known as GWI. Clear determination of the causes of GWI has been hindered by many factors, including limitations in how epidemiologic studies have assessed the impact of the complex deployment environment on Veterans' health. 28 OBJECTIVE: We sought to address GWI etiologic questions by evaluating the association of symptomatic illness with characteristics of Veterans' deployment. METHODS: We compared Veteran-reported wartime experiences in a population-based sample of 304 GW Veterans: 144 cases who met pre-established criteria for GWI and 160 controls. Veteran subgroups and confounding among deployment variables were considered in the analyses. RESULTS: Deployment experiences and the prevalence of GWI differed significantly by Veterans' location in theater. Among personnel who were in Iraq or Kuwait, where all battles took place, GWI was most strongly associated with using pyridostigmine bromide pills [odds ratio (OR) = 3.5; 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 1.7, 7.4] and being within 1 mile of an exploding SCUD missile (OR = 3.1; 95 percent CI: 1.5, 6.1). For Veterans who remained in support areas, GWI was significantly associated only with personal pesticide use, with increased prevalence (OR = 12.7; 95 percent CI: 2.6, 61.5) in the relatively small subgroup that wore pesticide-treated uniforms, nearly all of whom also used skin pesticides. Combat service was not significantly associated with GWI. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support a role for a limited number of wartime exposures in the etiology of GWI, which differed in importance with the deployment milieu in which Veterans served. Terry AV Jr (2012) Functional consequences of repeated organophosphate exposure: potential non-cholinergic mechanisms. Pharmacol Ther 134(3):355-65. (Epub 2012 Mar 20.) The class of chemicals known as the \"organophosphates\" (OPs) comprises many of the most common agricultural and commercial pesticides that are used worldwide as well as the highly toxic chemical warfare agents. The mechanism of the acute toxicity of OPs in both target and non-target organisms is primarily attributed to inhibitory actions on various forms of cholinesterase leading to excessive peripheral and central cholinergic activity. However, there is now substantial evidence that this canonical (cholinesterase-based) mechanism cannot alone account for the wide-variety of adverse consequences of OP exposure that have been described, especially those associated with repeated exposures to levels that produce no overt signs of acute toxicity. This type of exposure has been associated with prolonged impairments in attention, memory, and other domains of cognition, as well as chronic illnesses where these symptoms are manifested (e.g., Gulf War Illness, Alzheimer's disease). Due to their highly reactive nature, it is not surprising that OPs might alter the function of a number of enzymes and proteins (in addition to cholinesterase). However, the wide variety of long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms that have been associated with OPs suggests that some basic or fundamental neuronal process was adversely affected during the exposure period. The purpose of this review is to discuss several non-cholinesterase targets of OPs that might affect such fundamental processes and includes cytoskeletal and motor proteins involved in axonal transport, neurotrophins and their receptors, and mitochondria (especially their morphology and 29 movement in axons). Potential therapeutic implications of these OP interactions are also discussed. Tillman GD, Calley CS, Green TA, Briggs RW, Haley RW, Hart J Jr, Kraut MA (2012) Event-related potential patterns associated with hyperarousal in Gulf War illness syndrome groups. Neurotoxicology 33(5):1096 - 1105. An exaggerated response to emotional stimuli is one of the several symptoms widely reported by Veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Many have attributed these symptoms to post-war stress; others have attributed the symptoms to deployment-related exposures and associated damage to cholinergic, dopaminergic, and white matter systems. We collected event-related potential (ERP) data from 20 Veterans meeting Haley criteria for Gulf War Syndromes 1-3 and from 8 matched GW Veteran controls, who were deployed but not symptomatic, while they performed an auditory three-condition oddball task with gunshot and lion roar sounds as the distractor stimuli. Reports of hyperarousal from the ill Veterans were significantly greater than those from the control Veterans; different ERP profiles emerged to account for their hyperarousability. Syndromes 2 and 3, who have previously shown brainstem abnormalities, show significantly stronger auditory P1 amplitudes, purported to indicate compromised cholinergic inhibitory gating in the reticular activating system. Syndromes 1 and 2, who have previously shown basal ganglia dysfunction, show significantly weaker P3a response to distractor stimuli, purported to indicate dysfunction of the dopaminergic contribution to their ability to inhibit distraction by irrelevant stimuli. All three syndrome groups showed an attenuated P3b to target stimuli, which could be secondary to both cholinergic and dopaminergic contributions or disruption of white matter integrity. Tillman GD, Calley CS, Green TA, Briggs RW, Haley RW, Kraut MA, Hart J Jr. (2013) Visual event-related potentials as markers of hyperarousal in Gulf War illness: Evidence against a stress-related etiology. Psychiatry Res 211(3):257-267. (Epub 2012 Nov 11.) An exaggerated response to emotional stimuli is among the many symptoms widely reported by Veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. These symptomologies have been attributed to damage and dysfunction associated with deployment-related exposures. We collected event-related potential data from 22 Veterans meeting Haley criteria for GW Syndromes 1-3 and from 8 matched GW Veteran controls, who were deployed but not symptomatic, while they performed a visual three-condition oddball task where images authenticated to be associated with the 1991 Persian Gulf War were the distractor stimuli. Hyperarousal reported by ill Veterans was significantly greater than that by control Veterans, but this was not paralleled by higher amplitude P3a in their ERP responses to GW-related distractor stimuli. Whereas previous studies of PTSD patients have shown higher amplitude P3b responses to target stimuli that are placed amid trauma-related nontarget stimuli, ill Veterans in this study showed P3b amplitudes to target stimuli-placed amid GW-related nontarget stimuli -that were significantly lower than those of the control group. Hyperarousal scores reliably predicted P3b, but not P3a, amplitudes. Although 30 many factors may contribute to P3b amplitude differences -most notably depression and poor sleep quality, symptoms that are prevalent in the GW syndrome groups -our findings in context of previous studies on this population are consistent with the contention that dysfunction in cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems, and in white matter and basal ganglia may be contributing to impairments in GW Veterans. Todorov TI, Ejnik JW, Guandalini G, Xu H, Hoover D, Anderson L, Squibb K, McDiarmid MA, Centeno JA (2013) Uranium quantification in semen by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. J Trace Elem Med Biol 27(1):2-6. (Epub 2012 Sep 1.) In this study, we report uranium analysis for human semen samples. Uranium quantification was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. No additives, such as chymotrypsin or bovine serum albumin, were used for semen liquefaction, as they showed significant uranium content. For method validation we spiked 2g aliquots of pooled control semen at three different levels of uranium: low at 5 pg/g, medium at 50 pg/g, and high at 1000 pg/g. The detection limit was determined to be 0.8 pg/g uranium in human semen. The data reproduced within 1.4-7 percent RSD and spike recoveries were 97-100 percent. The uranium level of the unspiked, pooled control semen was 2.9 pg/g of semen (n=10). In addition six semen samples from a cohort of Veterans exposed to depleted uranium (DU) in the 1991 Gulf War were analyzed with no knowledge of their exposure history. U ranium levels in the Veterans' semen samples ranged from undetectable (<0.8 pg/g) to 3350 pg/g. This wide concentration range for uranium in semen is consistent with known differences in current DU body burdens in these individuals, some of whom have retained embedded DU fragments. Tuite JJ, Haley RW (2012) Meteorological and Intelligence Evidence of Long- Distance Transit of Chemical Weapons Fallout from Bombing Early in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Neuroepidemiology 40(3):160-177. BACKGROUND: Coalition bombings on the night of January 18-19, 1991, early in the GW, targeted the Iraqi chemical weapons infrastructure. On January 19, 1991, nerve agent alarms sounded within coalition positions hundreds of kilometers to the south, and the trace presence of sarin vapor was identified by multiple technologies. Considering only surface dispersion of plumes from explosions, officials concluded that the absence of casualties around bombed sites precluded long-distance transit of debris to U.S. troop positions to explain the alarms and detections. Consequently, they were discounted as false positives, and low-level nerve agent exposure early in the air war was disregarded in epidemiologic investigations of chronic illnesses. INTELLIGENCE DATA: Newly assembled evidence indicates that plumes from those nighttime bombings of Iraqi chemical facilities would have traversed the stable nocturnal boundary layer and penetrated the residual layer where they would be susceptible to rapid transit by supergeostrophic winds. This explanation is supported by plume height predictions, available weather charts, weather satellite images showing transit of a hot air 31 mass, effects of solar mixing of atmospheric layers, and observations of a stationary weather front and thermal inversion in the region. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports long-distance transit. Epidemiologic studies of chronic postwar illness should be reassessed using Veterans' reports of hearing nerve agent alarms as the measure of exposure. Wallin MT, Culpepper WJ, Coffman P, CM, Haselkorn JK, Kurtzke JF, Veterans Affairs Multiple Sclerosis Centres of Excellence Epidemiology Group (2012) The Gulf War era multiple sclerosis cohort: age and incidence rates by race, sex and service. Brain 135(Pt 6):1778-1785. We characterize here a new nationwide incident cohort of multiple sclerosis from the U.S. military-Veteran population. This cohort provides an update to the only other U.S. nationwide incidence study of multiple sclerosis performed during the 1970s. Medical records and data from the DoD and VA for cases of multiple sclerosis who served in the military between 1990, the start of the GW era, and 2007 and who were service-connected for this disorder by the VA from 1990 forward were reviewed. A total of 2,691 patients were confirmed as having multiple sclerosis: 2,288 definite, 190 possible, 207 clinically isolated syndrome and six neuromyelitis optica. Overall, racial categories were White, Black and Other, which included all Hispanics. There were 1,278 White males and 556 females; 360 Black males and 296 females; and 200 others, 153 (77 percent) of whom were Hispanic. Mean age at onset of 30.7 years did not differ significantly by race or sex. Age at onset was 17-50 years in 99 percent, the same age range as 99 percent of the military. Average annual age specific (age 17-50 years) incidence rates per 100,000 for the entire series were 9.6 with 95 percent confidence interval of 9.3-10.0. Rates for Blacks were highest at 12.1 with confidence interval 11.2-13.1, Whites were 9.3 (interval 8.9-9.8) and others were 6.9 (interval 6.0-7.9). For 83 Hispanics defined for 2000-2007, the rate was 8.2 (interval 6.5-10.1). Much smaller numbers gave rates of 3.3 for Asian/Pacific Islanders and 3.1 for Native Americans. Rates by sex for Whites were 7.3 and 25.8 male and female, respectively, for Blacks 8.4 and 26.3, and for Hispanics 6.6 and 17.0. Rates by service were high for Air Force (10.9) and Army (10.6), medium for Navy (9.1) and Coast Guard (7.9), and low for Marines (5.3). Relative risk of multiple sclerosis was 3.39 female: male and 1.27 Black: White. These new findings indicate that females of all races now have incidence rates for multiple sclerosis some three times those of their male counterparts and that among these groups; Blacks have the highest and others (probably including Hispanics) the lowest incidence rates regardless of sex or service. The low rate for Marines is unexplained. This GW-era multiple sclerosis cohort provides a unique resource for further study. Yoder M, Tuerk PW, Price M, Grubaugh AL, Strachan M, Myrick H, Acierno R (2012) Prolonged exposure therapy for combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder: Comparing outcomes for Veterans of different wars. Psychol Serv 9(1):16-25 . There is significant support for exposure therapy as an effective treatment for PTSD across a variety of populations, including Veterans; however, there is little empirical information regarding how Veterans of different war theaters respond to exposure therapy. 32 Accordingly, questions remain regarding therapy effectiveness for treatment of PTSD for Veterans of different eras. Such questions have important implications for the dissemination of evidence based treatments, treatment development, and policy. The current study compared treatment outcomes across 112 Veterans of the Vietnam War, the first Persian Gulf War, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. All subjects were diagnosed with PTSD and enrolled in prolonged exposure (PE) treatment. Veterans from all three groups showed significant improvement in PTSD symptoms, with Veterans from Vietnam and Afghanistan/Iraq responding similarly to treatment. Persian Gulf Veterans did not respond to treatment at the same rate or to the same degree as Veterans from the other two eras. Questions and issues regarding the effectiveness of evidence based treatment for Veterans from different eras are discussed. IV. RESEARCH FUNDING TRENDS This section provides a quantitative overview of the current research portfolio on GWVI and the evolution of the portfolio since 1999. Topics that are covered include research expenditures by VA, DoD, and HHS from FY 2003-2012, and the number of research projects in which the Federal Government has invested. The appropriated funds for FY 2003 through 2012, centrally obligated to each project, are shown in Appendix C and summarized in Table IV-1. Federal funding for GW research totaled approximately $223 million during this period. Funds obligated for these projects prior to FY 2003 are not shown in either Table IV-1 or Appendix C. Since many projects are multi-year efforts for which funds are obligated at the beginning of the project period, projects that received all of their funds prior to FY 2003 are listed with no associated obligation ($0) in Appendix C. Federal funds for these earlier projects were reported in prior annual reports to Congress. Table IV-1. 10-Year (FY 2003-2012) Funding Trends for GW Research ' 09 FY ' 10 FY ' 11 FY ' 12 Total Costs FY ' 03-' 12 DoD $ 16.4 $ 11.1 $ 10.1 $ 10.1 $ 3.4 $ 11.7 $ 10.4 $ 10.4 $ 10.3 $ 3.7 $ 97.6 HHS $ 1.0 $ 0.5 $ 0.5 $ 0.4 $ 0.4 $ 0.4 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 3.2 VA $ 5.7 $ 7.6 $ 9.5 $ 13.0 $22.1 $21.9 $ 16.6 $ 13.9 $ 5.6 $ 6.7 $ 122.6 Total $ 23.1 $ 19.2 $20.1 $ 23.5 $ 25.9 $ 34.0 $ 27.0 $ 24.3 $ 15.9 $ 10.4 $ 223.4 The funding level for FY 2011 in the table above differs from the value reported in the 2011 annual report to Congress due to the delayed start of eight projects funded through the FY 2011 appropriation for the Gulf War Illness Research (GWIRP) managed by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) at DoD . DoD funding for 33 FY 2012 is $3.7 million for the same reason and will be updated in the 2013 annual report to Congress after the projects have begun. VA, DoD, and HHS sponsored a total of 412 distinct research projects on GWVI during the period of FY 1992 through FY 2012. Appendix A lists all of the research and development projects and programs supported now or in the past by each of the three Federal agencies. Nine projects have been dual-funded by VA and DoD, and each agency has given the project its own unique project prior annual reports to Congress, the total number of funded projects was corrected for the number of dual-funded projects. Starting with the 2005 annual report to Congress, this practice has been discontinued since VA and DoD may start or end funding of their portion of these projects independent of each other. Each dual-funded project is, therefore, treated as two distinct projects. The numbers of new, ongoing, and completed projects for FY 2003 - FY 2012 are shown in Figure IV-1. As of September 30, 2012, 358 projects (87 percent of the 412 projects) were completed, and 58 projects (13 percent) were new or ongoing; the numbers of new, ongoing, and completed projects for each fiscal year are shown in Figure IV-1. The annual distribution of new and ongoing projects within the five major Research Focus Areas is shown in Figure IV-2. From FY 2003 through 2012, new and ongoing research assigned to the Brain and Nervous System Function, Environmental Toxicology, and General Health and Symptoms categories have represented 96.2 \u00b1 1.0 percent of all new and ongoing projects. 34 Figure IV-1. Cumulative Number of Funded Projects (FY 2003 - FY 2012) 35 Figure IV-2. Annual Distribution of Topic Areas for New and Ongoing Projects V. NEW RESEARCH PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES A. New Initiatives Requests for Applications (RFA) were issued by both CDMRP and VA in FY 2012. Proposals received for review in response to these RFAs were reviewed, and projects selected for funding will begin in FY 2013. As more investigators engage in GW research, there has been an increase in applications for funding and increases in the number of newly-approved treatment trials and biomarker studies. DoD has also accepted proposals for two GW research consortia that will concentrate research expertise on specific topics. VA' s Gulf War Research Strategic Plan was completed and submitted for approval. The Strategic Plan outlines the direction of research for the next 5 years with the focus on converting promising research results into clinical treatments. Considerable effort at VA is also focused on increasing the number of investigators involved in Gulf War research. A meeting of VA GW researchers was held in September 2012 to encourage collaborations and mentoring of young investigators. Representatives of DoD were also present to describe their GW research program. 36 VA has also initiated programs to facilitate researchers' access to Veterans who are willing to participate in research studies. In addition to the GW Era Cohort and Biorepository and the Million Veteran Program (described in the 2011 Report) which are designed to collect blood and health information, VA launched the GW Veterans' Illnesses Biorepository in 2012 which will collect post-mortem brain and spinal cord tissue for future research into neurological conditions affecting GW Veterans. Together these three databases will allow researchers to select a study group which enables them to target specific symptoms or conditions as they investigate diagnostic markers or develop treatments. B. Portfolio Review VA and DoD each review their portfolios of GW research on a regular basis in order to determine research gaps and to expand successful research topic areas. The Federal GW research portfolio is increasingly focused on identifying potential new treatments (clinical trials, including complementary medicine approaches) for ill GW Veterans and identifying new diagnostic markers of disease and potential therapeutic targets to develop new therapies. VA and DoD continue to share information regarding funded GW research projects and coordinate activities, whenever possible, to maximize combined program impact. To facilitate this process, the GW research programs will also be integrated into the ongoing Department-wide VA-DoD Joint Program Reviews. C. New Projects This section highlights the new research projects that have been approved since last year' s 2011 annual report to Congress. Projects preceded by an asterisk (*) were either funded using funds appropriated in prior years or approved for funding in prior fiscal years but not identified in previous annual reports to Congress. They are described below and incorporated into the tables in Appendices A, B, and C. These projects include new approaches to treating and diagnosing GW Veterans. In one treatment trial, insulin will be administered as a nasal spray to improve memory and attention, mood, and the overall health of GW Veterans. In another, acupressure will be used to deal with chronic pain and fatigue. To develop diagnostic tools for GWVI, an understanding of some of the fundamental physiological processes in ill GW Veterans is necessary. A magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study will non-invasively monitor important chemical reactions in the brains of GW Veterans, and in another study, magnetoencephalography (MEG) will be evaluated as a means of distinguishing GW Veterans with CMI from Veterans with other conditions. Other studies will investigate biological markers in serum, markers of immune system problems, and the connection of gastrointestinal problems to the nervous system. There will also be surveys of GW Veterans to determine their current health status and the value of clinical treatments they have received. Fundamental studies, using animal models, monitoring the effects of potentially toxic materials like those used in the Kuwait theater of operations (organophosphate pesticides or a combination of PB, insect repellents, and pesticides) will be undertaken as well. To be able to study neurological changes that have occurred in GW Veterans, a repository of post-mortem brain and spinal cord tissue is being initiated. 37 Tissue will be donated by GW Veterans, and these specimens will be used for research in the future. DoD Projects Eight projects were funded through the FY 2011 appropriation for the GWIRP managed by CDMRP but did not start until FY 2012. These projects focused on Brain and Nervous System Function (2), Immune Dysfunction (1), and Symptoms and General Health (5). *DoD-213, \" Effectiveness of Acupressure Treatment for Pain Management and Fatigue Relief in GW Veterans\" will investigate acupressure as a treatment for fatigue and pain in ill GW Veterans and will investigate the relationship between objective measures of electroencephalography (EEG) recording, specifically, the corticomuscular coherence and power spectra in theta band, and subjective measures of well established clinical instruments. *DoD-214, \" Abnormalities in Human Brain Creatine Metabolism in Gulf War Illness Probed with MRS\"will investigate creatine metabolism in brains of ill GW Veterans by estimating amounts of phosphocreatine (PCr) and free creatine (Cr) using 31P and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Secondary goals are to measure 1H T2 relaxation times of the methyl resonances of PCr and Cr and to measure amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and magnesium ion (Mg2+) and to estimate intracellular pH from 31P MRS data. *DoD-215, \" Identifying Immune Drivers of Gulf War Illness Using a Novel Daily Sampling Approach\" will seek to identify a set of immune factors that predict symptoms in ill GW Veterans. Using cross-correlations and linear mixed models, a small set of immune factors to drive day-to-day GW illness (GWI) symptom severity will be identified, considering both same day predictors and time-lagged effects. *DoD-216, \" Intranasal Insulin: A Novel Treatment for Gulf War Multisymptom Illness\" is designed to evaluate the efficacy of two different doses (10 IU BID and 20 IU BID) of daily intranasal insulin for 8 weeks on memory and attention, overall physical health and mood, symptoms characteristic of or associated with CMI, safety, and neuroendocrine changes in GW Veterans. The main hypothesis is that intranasal insulin will improve these characteristics. *DoD-217, \" Efficacy of Treatments Tried: A Survey of GW Veterans\" is designed to learn what the treatment experience has been for GW Veterans and to gain in-depth information on which treatments have been perceived to confer greatest benefit and which were perceived to produce greatest harm. For treatments with high variance in reported effect, the survey is designed to assess whether subject or treatment factors may predict in whom a treatment appears to yield benefit or harm. *DoD-218, \" Establishing a 1991 Veterans Research Network To Improve Characterization of GWI and Provide a National Resource for Veterans and Investigators\" will attempt to 38 systematically characterize the current health status of 1991 GW Veterans in relation to nondeployed era Veterans, to use collected data to optimize a symptom-based case definition of GWI, and to develop an information and recruitment resource for 1991-era Veterans and for investigators conducting research in this population. *DoD-219, \" Organophosphate-Related Alterations in Myelin and Axonal Transport in the Living Mammalian Brain\" is designed to determine if exposure to organophosphates (OP) results in alterations in myelin (as observed in symptomatic GW patients) and axonal transport (as observed ex vivo in animals) in the living rodent brain. The central hypothesis is that OPs compromise the integrity of myelin and impair axonal transport, effects that lead to functional impairment of neuronal pathways supporting cognition and other neurological processes. The research will study two OPs, a representative insecticide that was used in the first GW, chlorpyrifos, and a representative nerve agent, diisopropylfluorophosphate. *DoD-220, \" Biomarker Discovery in GW Veterans: Development of a War Illness Diagnostic Panel\" is designed to develop a diagnostic tool for CMI in GW Veterans based on testing results from multiple serum analytes potentially associated with biological processes that contribute to GW Veterans' symptoms. VA Projects VA initiated funding for four new projects during FY 2011. These four projects focused on Brain and Nervous System Function (3) and Symptoms and General Health (1). VA-174, \" GW Veterans' Illnesses Biorepository (CSP#501B)\" is a pilot study to establish a repository for brain and spinal cord tissue from GW Veterans regardless of whether they receive health care at VA. The tissue will enable VA to provide accurate diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases and potentially develop better diagnostic procedures and treatments. VA-175, \" Memory and Mood Enhancing Therapies for Gulf War Illness\" will use an animal model to determine if antidepressants and antioxidants can improve cognitive function and neurogenesis in the hippocampus after the rats have been exposed to PB, insect repellent (DEET), pesticide (permethrin), and physical stress. This hypothesis is based on the results of preliminary studies. VA-176, \" MEG Synchronous Neural Interactions (SNI) in GW Veterans\" will use SNI, which assess functional interactions among neural populations derived from magnetoencephalographic signals, to distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic GW Veterans. Early results with PTSD patients showed that GW Veterans with PTSD exhibited SNI that were different from those seen in controls and patients with PTSD alone. VA-177, \" Somatic Hypersensitivity in Veterans with IBS\" will extend the study of chronic gastrointestinal problems in deployed Veterans which are related to increased intestinal 39 permeability. If it can be shown that microRNAs modulate the increased permeability, then new treatments for these Veterans can be developed. 40 VI.

All entries for research funding reflect money centrally obligated to researchers (both intramural and extramural) to carry out the specific projects. These funds also cover operational costs for administration, infrastructure, etc. Each department allocates these costs in slightly different ways, making it difficult to completely account for these funds. For example, in VA the research appropriation does not pay for clinician/investigator salaries. By law those funds must come from the patient care appropriation. These salary costs are not included in the obligated costs listed in the table. 2. A \" blank\"funding entry generally reflects years in which a project was not active (e.g., it had not started or it had come to an end). 3. Some multiyear projects receive all of their funding in the fiscal year of the authorization and appropriation. For those, the dollars authorized and obligated are shown for that fiscal year. The remaining funding entries show $0 for the years that the project is active. 4. Although all projects funded from FY 1992-2010 are listed, only the financial data for FY 2003-2012 (a 10-year window) are shown in Appendix C; Totals for FY 2003-2012 do not include funds obligated in FY 1992-2002. Projects that received all of their obligated funds prior to FY 2003 will, therefore, appear in the table as having no funding. 5. Some intramural projects/programs are supported out of operational costs. For those projects, $0 is entered for the funds in the fiscal years that the project is active. 6. Programs consisting of multiple projects are represented in one of two ways depending on how funds are centrally obligated: a. Funds centrally obligated to the program : These programs are shown in the table as a main program indicated by project designation such as DoD-1, and projects within the program as DoD-1A, DoD-1B, etc. All funds are shown under the main program. Blank funding entries are shown for the individual projects. b. Funds centrally obligated to projects within a program : The funds for these programs are only indicated by their projects without a main program identifier, for example, VA-2A and VA-2B. Specific Notes 1. DoD-4 is part of a larger US Army study conducted at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Funding for this project has been combined into project DoD-23. In addition, projects DoD-8A and 8B are part of a larger US Army study in which all funding has been combined and is shown under program DoD-8. 2. HHS-3 was funded from the FY' 91 appropriation, which is not included in this accounting. 3. HHS-4 was funded from the FY' 93 appropriation, which is not included in this accounting. 4. Funds for VA-1 for FY' 94 through FY' 97 represent an aggregate of funds for both the VA Mortality Study and the VA National Survey of Persian Gulf Veterans. Beginning in FY' 98, VA-1 reflects continuation of the VA Mortality Study. Beginning in FY' 98, VA- 2A, 2B, and 2C reflect funding for separate components of the VA National Survey of Persian Gulf Veterans. 5. In nine instances (DoD-115 & VA-062, & VA-88), two different designations represent the same project because both DoD and VA funded them jointly. The total funding appropriated for each of these nine projects is broken down and reported separately by funding agency.
