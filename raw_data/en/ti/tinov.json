But in all of the foregoing, it isunderstood that these terms refer toprograms that offer truly effectivetreatments and to initiatives that en -gage patients in activities that deliverreal benefits. While casual observers can be for- given for assuming that programsbearing the foregoing labels refer tobona fide health measures, not all usesof the terms above refer to programsthat enjoy convincing scientific sup-port. There is growing concern thatprograms promoting unproven thera-pies are being sold to the public, healthauthorities, 1and to academia2under the guise of wellness and preventioninitiatives. The current parlance in des -cribing programs where alternativemedicine is offered along with vary-ing amounts of conventional prac ticesis \"integrative medicine.\" Often avow-ing a commitment to evidence-basedcare, these programs speak the languageof choice, prevention, and empower-ment, and deliver treatments that canfall well beyond the bounds of scien-tific medicine. 3For example, the Ari- zona science,\" 4yet students are in - struct ed in traditional Chinese medi-cine, ayurveda, chiropractic, and hom -eopathy. 5 In his article \"Integrated medicine: Smuggling alternative practices intorational medicine?\" Edzard Ernst, theThe same can be true of programs that purport to enhance health. It ishard to criticize programs that arepackaged in the language Terms like \"patient-centred,\"and \"integrated care\" can all mean dif-ferent things to different people. All of the foregoing labels can be used to describe programs that areobviously beneficial. Medical studentshave long been taught patient-centred\"holistic\" medicine in the sense ofaddressing the social and psychologi-cal needs of patients. Scientific medi-cine is at the forefront of preventionand wellness initiatives and programsthat include vaccines, mental healthprograms, smoking cessation, cleanwater, physical activity, and an innu-merable array of other measures thatgo far beyond the treatment of acutedisease. Doctors \"engage\" and edu-cate their patients every day as activeparticipants in their care. Health au -thorities create \"integrated\" clinics toLloyd Oppel, MD Two years ago, I bought a used car. I don't count myself as anunintelligent man, but my ex - perience gave me, I hope, further wis-dom and insight into the ways that wecan all be inclined to believe what wewant to. Looking back on that purchase, I feel differently about my interactionwith the vendor than I did at the time.I never did get real answers to myquestions about expected repair costs.When I asked about fuel consumption,I heard about saving the planet by con-tinuing to use an already-manufacturedcar. My queries about the safety ofrear-wheel drive in the snow wereanswered with a homily about howthose who wound up in ditches didn'tunderstand performance-car steering.All of the things I was told were true,but they weren't replies to the ques-tions that needed answers. I'll alwayslove the false image I had of that car. In many types of consumer encoun- ters, things can be advertised in waysthat emphasize the most positive as -pects of what the buyer wishes werethere. Sometimes a closer examina-tion shows the reality to be quite dif-ferent from what the advertisingwould portray.point \u0081counterpoint InspireHealth: What's under the hood?

The trend is particularly concern- ing to primary care physicians whoare frequently the targets of claims byother groups that most, if not all, oftheir job could be done by others\u2014including naturopaths. 7Introducing alternative therapies onto the primarycare landscape under the guise ofpatient-centred engagement will notenhance the effectiveness of care pro-vided by medical doctors, nor will itstrengthen their long-term position inthe medical system. Admittedly, we live in a libertari- an society where, within limits, peo-ple have the freedom to make choicesother than the most reasonable ones.This includes health care. But thatdoes not mean that governments donot have a duty to protect other rights,such as truth in advertising, and toensure that health care funds are spentwisely. It is in the spirit of consumer pro- tection and holding the government toaccount for spending tax dollars thatwe ask questions. We need to ask aboutdecisions to direct scarce public re -sources to programs that offer unprov -en therapies and that imply that pa -tients with serious diseases will livelonger as a result. We hope to get forth-right answers that address the scien-tific and ethical questions asked\u2014notlegal threats. Science should never beput under the gun. The InspireHealth website is replete with messaging about empowerment,\"healing journeys,\" engagement, andlifestyle changes. Such packaging isintuitively attractive, but it is what lieswithin the package 8that generates sci- entific concerns. Why, oncology,\" intravenous hydro-gen peroxide, homeopathic remedies,therapeutic touch, and a long list of highly dubious treatments? Moretroubling is the fact that patients incurcharges for the provision of many ofthese modalities. Further questionsworld's foremost authority on (and critic of) alternative medicine refersto the tendency of integrated medicineproponents to use the language of loveas a euphemism for the delivery ofquestionable treatments: \"They therapeutic rela-tionship, patient-centred medicine,EBM) of any type of good health care... \" 6 Physicians have long recognized that the needs of patients go beyondthe boundaries of what randomizedtrials can offer. And while doctors areexpected to deliver evidence-basedcare in a compassionate way, there areopportunities to accommodate pa tients'spiritual, philosophical, and culturalneeds in a manner that does not in -volve making medical claims that can'tbe proved. For example, many hospi-tals have a chaplain service. Often apatient's sense of hope, control, andquality of life is enriched when suchservices are available. A key part ofthe bargain, however, is that we do notplace those figures in charge of med-ical decisions. The ethical boundary isimportant if patients are to receive thebest psychological support possiblewithout compromising medical quali-ty. Arguably this line is crossed in therealm of integrative medicine. In thisrealm, therapies such as homeopathy(long debunked by the scientific com-munity) are offered to patients in acontext defended as patient-centred orholistic. But here, the purveyors areeither making medical claims or gen-erating invoices (or both). The hopegained can come at many prices: finan-cial cost, misinformation, and delay inseeking proper treatment. Compas-sionate care should also be ethicalcare. Wellness has become big business. For physicians who struggle every dayto provide quality care with limitedresources, it can be disheartening to bethe one providing real patient-centredcare and prevention only to see theHal Gunn continued from page 241 Lloyd Oppel continued from page 239counterpoint \u0081 oppel 242 BC MEDICAL JOURNAL VOL. 54 NO. 5, JUNE 2012 www.bcmj.orgare raised by the fact that this occurs in the context of messaging that im -plies that InspireHealth programs ex -tend life. For example, one press releasereads: \"Cancer patients from Vancou-ver Island and the Gulf Islands willnow have immediate access to cancercare that will enable them to do better,live longer, and have an improvedquality-of-life.\" 9It is difficult to be - lieve that this breathtaking claim wouldmake cancer patients less willing topay both the $445 10membership and for the programs at InspireHealth. Tobe sure, miraculous breakthroughs dooccur, but it seems a trifle bold to pre- sume such an outcome and begin ad - vertising prior to actually having proofin hand. Dr Gunn has acknowledgedthat there is no compelling evidencethat InspireHealth's programs reallyextend their patients' lives althoughhis co-workers claim that they do. 11In fact, the information revealed to dateseems more akin to what one wouldexpect to obtain by running a private-pay patient-centred COPD programon the seventh floor of a building withno elevator. Only the hardier and better-off patients would attend, and com-parisons with the COPD would Dr Gunn's data do) essentiallyinvalid. It is somewhat puzzling that Dr Gunn invokes the endorsement of theprivately-funded Samueli Institute asa demonstration of how InspireHealthis a model of patient-centred care.This may not satisfy the scientific orsemantic curiosity of skeptical read- ers who will note that the SamueliInstitute is headed by people trainedin \"mind/body methods, diagnostics,homeopathy, and bioenergy therapy.\" 12 Dr Gunn's lengthy exploration of the link between lifestyle and diseaseis engagingly written, but it does notaddress the concerns expressed aboutthe effectiveness of the alternativemedicine modalities employed atInspireHealth. Similarly, the fact thatInspireHealth may be a nonprofitorganization with salaried physiciansdoes not answer the questions aboutthe appropriateness of governmentfunding for a clinic that is charging forunproven cancer therapies. 13It is also problematic that the government pre-sumably believes the programs trulyhave the life-saving effects adver-tised. If so, how can one defend charg-ing for medically necessary services?One would hope that publicly fundedcancer-treatment facilities would oper-ate in a manner free from any percep-tion of two-tiered access or financialconflict of interest. Perhaps there aregood answers to these questions, butthey have not been provided. Patients with serious illnesses un - derstandably need hope. Doctors havelong worked to accommodate thisneed in compassionate ways that don'tcompromise clinical care. A large partof this is the asking of hard questionsand demanding scientific proof beforepromotion. We need to encouragegovernment to ensure that publicresources go to areas of proven bene-fit. Government needs to look beyondthe packaging and actually check thecontents of programs that appeal forfunding. I'm again in the market for a car. As I pore over the auto websites, I'mdazzled by just about anything thatdoesn't really matter, but I've come torecognize the importance of gettingreal answers, and I'm better at sayingno to highly skilled salesmen. Thistime around, I'll look under the hood.References 1. Ernst E. College of Medicine is a lobby group promoting unproven treatments.The Guardian. 10 January 2012.
