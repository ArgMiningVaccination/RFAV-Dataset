Ayurveda FAQs + Why try Ayurveda? An increasing number of physicians from all over the world are interested in Ayurveda and have adapted this medicinal system to western culture. Ayurvedic treatment techniques have been proven effective in many clinical studies, making it a smart choice in cases of chronic illnesses, which can not be treated in a satisfactory manner by conventional medicine. Ayurveda aims not only to treat illness, but also to prevent it in healthy people, who can get ill due to the stress of modern life. + What are the principles of Ayurveda? The essential principle of Ayurveda is to live in compliance with one's constitution and with the laws of nature. Ayurveda is a holistic science; it concerns the whole human being. It searches for and cures the causes of illness, instead of merely suppressing symptoms. Diet, exercise, and lifestyle are individually recommended according to the constitution, race, and climatic conditions of the patient. The focus on individual distinctness and the individual approach to treatment is one of the unique features of Ayurvedic medicine. + What are the differences between Ayurveda and western medicine? Ayurveda does not stand against western medicine. In acute cases, the role of classical medicine is irreplaceable. In chronic illnesses, combination with Ayurveda can be beneficial, and in many cases, Ayurveda achieves excellent results where even classical medicine has failed. Ayurveda aims at the elimination of the root cause of an illness, not the suppression of symptoms; during the treatment, only natural remedies free of any side effects are used. + What are three doshas? According to Ayurveda, a human being is composed of five elements. Of these five elements - air, space, fire, water, and earth - two elements always form the basis of each of the three doshas. The word \"dosha\" and the names of the three doshas, Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, are Sanskrit words. The Doshas interpenetrate everything in nature. Vatta is the energy of movement, Pitta is the metabolism and Kapha corresponds to the principle of substance and structures. These energies occur in each of us, in differing amounts in each individual. Each of us has a unique structure of energy, and therefore each of us is unique. The combination of those three doshas comprises our constitution. + How is diagnosis done in Ayurveda? There are three main methods mentioned in Ayurveda for diagnosing the dosha imbalance and disease process in a person. - Darsana Pareeksha - Observing the patient's physical signs and symptoms, e.g. the color of skin, hair, eyes, behavior, and body condition. - Prasna Preeksha - Asking detailed questions regarding the imbalance of each dosha - Sparsana Pareeksha - Touching the patient. Pulse diagnosis, palpation, percussion, and auscultation are included in this method. + What are the main treatment techniques? Ayurveda offers a treatment for each of the five senses: herbs and nutrition act on the sense of the taste, the olfactory sense is influenced by aromatherapy, the touch is related to Yoga, precious stones and massages, the hearing is treated by mantra (sound energy with curative effect) and we can affect the sight by colors (color therapy). Ayurveda mostly proves successful in the treatment of chronic illnesses. Ayurveda covers and cures a wide range of illnesses, from the common cold to chronic illnesses, allergy, chronic fatigue, ulcers, and insomnia. The choice of therapy depends on the individual's constitution, the type of imbalance, and the season. The following are the most frequently used treatment techniques: - aromatherapy including the use of aromatic oils and incense sticks - herbal treatment using natural substances without side effects - special breathing exercises carried out before meditation - appropriate exercises that contribute to the whole health - Panchakarma, a detoxification method that cleans the organism and eliminates the settlement of toxic substances - Shirodhara, with its deep calming effect - Alimentation and change of diet - Meditation - Marma therapy, gentle massage that stimulates some points on the body and reflexively affects the respective organs - Yoga - Therapy with colors and stones + How can I get to know my constitution? Your constitution can be roughly determined by filling out the dosha-test on our website. An exact conclusion, on which basis the individual recommendations are made, is possible only after a personal consultation in our center. + What importance do herbs have? Herbs are a gentle and natural treatment. They do not have any side effects, because they are compatible with the body's own chemicals. They are absorbed easily, and because of their different characteristics, it is possible to choose exactly the right ones in a given case, depending on the illness. + What is the importance of food in Ayurveda? According to Ayurveda, up to 70 % of illnesses can be influenced by diet. A well-rounded, satisfying diet that leads an individual to balance can be designed in compliance with the constitution. Ayurveda does not expressly forbid any food, nor does it incline to any artificial, unnatural diet. In each group (fruit, vegetables, meat, grains, and dairy products) there are certain foods that are more appropriate for an individual than others. Properly chosen food, through its own qualities, has a curative influence on particular organs. + Can one take Ayurveda medicine with modern medicines? If not indicated otherwise by your physician, Ayurvedic medicines can generally be taken along with allopathic medicines. Moreover, Ayurvedic medicines can be used to supplement allopathic medicines in most chronic and degenerative diseases. As such, there is no harm in practicing Ayurveda, even without the prescription of the doctor. However, mineral-based medicines should only be used after consulting your doctor. "}
