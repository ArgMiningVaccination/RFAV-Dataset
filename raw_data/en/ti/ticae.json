While Canadians have picked up plenty of healthy hygiene habits in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us may still end up fighting a bad cold or flu as the fall and winter seasons approach. But there's good news. Even if you get sick, there are plenty of things you can do to manage symptoms and even shorten the duration. The first step? Talk to a pharmacist for advice on choosing cold and flu products. In many provinces, children as young as age 5 can get the flu shot from their Walmart Pharmacy. \"We are here to serve the community and answer their questions,\" says Rami Frjo, a Walmart pharmacist in Mississauga, Ont. With more than 11 years of experience, Frjo can provide service in both English and Arabic. Fortunately, it's often easy to tell whether it's a cold or the flu. Cold symptoms are generally milder and come on gradually. They often start with a runny nose, watery eyes, congestion and a sore throat. You might sneeze or develop a light cough. Flu symptoms, however, appear suddenly and are more severe. Look for fever, chills, fatigue, and body aches and pains. And with the flu, you'll likely feel unwell for a week or longer. Of course, flu and even some cold symptoms, especially in younger children, can mimic those of COVID-19, so it's important to be tested for the coronavirus if there's any doubt, says Frjo. \"It's not always possible to differentiate between them based on symptoms alone, so it's better to confirm the diagnosis to reduce the chance of spread,\" he explains, mentioning that test centres are open for symptomatic cases, while some Walmart pharmacies can administer COVID-19 tests to asymptomatic people who, say, need to visit a relative in long-term care. Medicine cabinet must-haves While there is no cure for the common cold or flu, there are plenty of well-priced over-the-counter medications available at your local Walmart to address symptoms and maybe even get you back on your feet faster. Frjo says he usually recommends Walmart's own brand, Equate. Generic products use the same high-quality ingredients, are just as effective and are sometimes even manufactured in the same facilities as brand-name options. They're also less expensive. Stock up on these six must-have meds now and be proactive for cold and flu season this fall. [Zinc lozenges, tablets or syrup](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/equate-zinc-lozenges-with-vitamin-c-and-echinacea-unisex/6000202324724) Give your immune system a boost with zinc to potentially shorten the duration of your cold. [Studies show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3273967/) that taking zinc supplements within the first 24 hours of the onset of a cold can also reduce the severity of symptoms. [Pain relievers ](https://www.walmart.ca/browse/health/pharmacy/pain-relievers/6000199008297-21022-32486?f=1019908&b=1) Take generic acetaminophen or Tylenol to bring down a fever, and lessen aches and pains.

[Nasal spray](https://www.walmart.ca/search?q=nasal%252520congestion%252520spray&c=6000199008297) Decongestants narrow blood vessels in the lining of the nose and shrink swollen tissue to help you feel less stuffy, while saline spray thins mucus and provides moisture to ease congestion. Frjo says that Equate 24-Hour Allergy Relief Spray also helps with sneezing and watery eyes. If you decide to use a decongestant, don't take it for more than five days in a row or you could experience \"rebound congestion,\" with worsening symptoms. [Cough drops ](https://www.walmart.ca/search?q=cough%252520drops) In many cough drops, that minty, cool sensation comes from the active ingredient, menthol. Lozenges also encourage saliva production to help soothe sore throats and control coughs. [Equate Cold Assist](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/equate-cold-assist-regular-strength-unisex/6000189073609) Echinacea has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to help relieve the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections and soothe sore throats.

These tablets and syrups contain acetaminophen, dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant) and other cold-and-flu-fighting meds.

[Get the flu shot](https://www.walmart.ca/cp/shop/flu-shot-vaccinations/6000203002159) Finally, consider getting your flu shot this year, even if you've already had influenza this season. As there are different flu viruses in circulation each year, you can become sick with influenza more than once within the season. Frjo will be ready to give this year's flu shots starting this fall. He anticipates Walmart will be using its popular online appointment booking system to keep things running smoothly, although he's happy to take questions about the flu vaccine from Walmart shoppers who pop by between filling their carts. \"We're here for people,\" he says. \"Just ask your Walmart Pharmacist.\" To be the first to know when flu shots will become available, sign up for an alert at your local [Walmart Pharmacy](https://www.walmart.ca/cp/shop/flu-shot-vaccinations/6000203002159).
