At Atlas Brain and Body...", "sitename": "Atlas Brain and Body", "date": "2021-04-21", "cleaned_text": "Atlas Orthogonal chiropractic is not a part of the core curriculum at most chiropractor colleges, but it does exist as an entirely separate specialty that requires students or established doctors to learn and develop competencies outside of basic chiropractic education. [Dr. David Nygaard](https://atlaschiropracticofasheville.com/david-nygaard/) is board certificated in advanced upper cervical care; Atlas Orthogonality. There are currently less than 250 worldwide doctors that has achieved this advanced certification. A major difference between upper cervical chiropractic specialists and traditional chiropractors is that the doctor will not adjust the patient without x-rays. Dr. David Nygaard relies on detailed imaging and precise calculations. At Atlas Brain and Body we understand the importance of your care. Diagnostic imaging is an important first step in providing you with a tailored treatment plan that will ensure that every treatment is effective. The high frequency digital x-ray technology allows for precision and accuracy when determining your misalignment. The reason that your Atlas adjustment is so precise is because of these very specific x-ray imaging. Getting started requires 4 images; 1 from the side, one from the back of your head and 2 from the front. These images are the analyzed with a unique computer program providing a unique blueprint of where your misalignments are. Atlas Orthogonal treatment would be impossible without these images. Upper cervical chiropractors specialize in the most important part of your nervous system - the brain stem. Think of the brain stem as the junction box for your communication between the brain and the rest of your body. Misalignment at the base of your skull can interfere with this communication. The most critical area to have properly aligned in your body is the vertebrae that are located below the skull (known as the atlas and axis - the first and second cervical vertebrae). The upper cervical misalignment is the most complex and difficult region of the spine to align, but when correction is achieved the results can be simply amazing. Specialized specific care also means that fewer adjustments will be needed. The focus of upper cervical chiropractic is to establish the proper relation between the skull and the top vertebrae called the atlas. This removes any interference to the nervous system that may be present as a result of an atlas misalignment. As the correction in the upper neck is achieved the entire body is brought back into balance as stress on posture nerves feeding the brain stem is relieved. This is why people with problems even in the lower part of their body respond well to the Atlas Orthogonal correction. Patients notice changes throughout their entire body as normal alignment and posture is restored. Atlas adjustments have full body consequences, while traditional chiropractic mobilizes stuck joints. This single segment focus has less of a full body affect. Atlas adjustments help to restore your brain to body communication. After your Atlas adjustment, your doctor will check to evaluate your nerve pressure to feel that it has been relieved and that the top vertebrae are now in proper alignment. You will be also asked if there is any tenderness or soreness present. Your doctor will also measure and validate that your body is in a state of balance and that your leg length analysis shows the legs are even. The Atlas Orthogonal procedure is one of the most gentle chiropractic treatments in the world. It employs a unique approach that focuses solely on spinal adjustments and never involves twisting or cracking, which makes it safe for even those with severe fear of being manipulated. Patients feel little to no discomfort during treatment as they are only feeling light pressure from their spine being adjusted without any other manipulation techniques used by more traditional chiropractors like popping joints back into place or adjusting them using rotational motions often seen in many forms of manual therapy. One concern people have when thinking about visiting a chiropractor is safety. People often are scared because they have the wrong idea of what treatment will actually be like. Because Atlas Orthogonal treatments are so precise these adjustments are extremely safe. The adjustment is delivered by an instrument that uses just 3 pounds of force.
