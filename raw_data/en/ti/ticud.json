QUIZ](/pages/pratima-dosha-quiz) Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) Neem oil is my go to product for so many needs: face, cut, mosquito repellent. I love this product! I love this product for the body, but also use it on my face as a nighttime oil. I have noticed a clear difference in my skin - it's less congested and clearer! I get a lot of cuts/bug bites/sun damage etc as I work outside. I have been using this mixed w my normal oil that I use on my body after I shower, and feel like my skin heals faster w it! Smells lovely too. I love how light this oil is, and the fragrance is divine! I have been mixing it with a bit of argan oil and water and applying it to my face after showering each morning. I absolutely love the smell and feel of Neem Oil. I use it daily on my face and body and it heals and moisturizes my skin. My skin has never looked or felt better.
