I cannot drink coffee at all because of stomach problems. I take 2 energy tabs in the morning and it gives me a pick up for the rest of the day. It does not make me feel jittery,just the right lift you need in the morning. I have never had that crash feeling you get when it wears off. I highly recommend this product . I am a 71 year old woman, and have never had any side effects. - TateI do not recommend this productRated 1 out of 5 stars9/6/22no i will not buy this product again upset my stomach. Not for me. - KaitI do not recommend this productRated 2 out of 5 stars2/18/21Kinda Helped, But Tastes Horrendous I tried to keep an open mind, but it has a strong medicine like taste. It gave a little energy but the taste wasn't worth it. - LalaI recommend this productRated 4 out of 5 stars10/11/20Works but gross. Does it work? Yes. Is it gross? Also yes. Totally tastes like cough medicine. Nothing pleasant about the taste, unfortunately. But I'm trying to ween myself off of energy drinks because I know they're unhealthy (I'm the weird person who actually enjoys the taste of R*d B*ll). I don't think it'll cause me to ditch my energy drinks completely (the individual strips are almost as much as the cost of one). It gives a boost, but for me, not one that lasts the whole day. I'm using these on days where I need a pick me up, but it's too late in the day for an energy drink, or on days where I'm trying to eat/drink really clean. - TaraI recommend this productRated 5 out of 5 stars10/10/20Love these! These are just great! They are easy to use, and give me a great pick me up when I am feeling sluggish. I would highly recommend them over energy drinks.
