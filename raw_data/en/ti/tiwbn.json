DISTRUST IN GOVERNMENT OR BIG PHARMA? SCHOOL OF NURSING FACULTY AND STAFF VACCINATION EXPERIENCE TESTIMONIALS: Employee #1: \"I knew that I wanted to get vaccinated when I saw the study results from the first two FDA approved vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna). I knew that for us to return to a state of normalcy, we would need to reach herd immunity through vaccinations. By receiving the vaccination, I would not only be protecting myself but also contributing to protecting others in the long term. I received the Moderna vaccine (2 doses). My side effects included arm soreness, generalized fatigue, and a low-grade fever for 24 hours after my second dose. I teared up in line as I watched others wait patiently to receive their vaccination doses. To have three effective vaccinations available for administration in under one year is truly remarkable.\" Employee #2: \"My motivations/reasons for getting vaccinated we for safety; ease of mind; and to return to some semblance of normal life seeing friends and family, dining out, theater, arts, grocery shopping, and travel. My vaccination experience was that I experienced NO SIDE EFFECTS at all; if I was in a trial, I would I felt a greater sense of freedom, anticipation that we can get COVID under control for everyone and consternation as to the hesitancy for some.\" Employee #3: \"After the first dose of COVID vaccine, my arm was quite sore, very similar to soreness after a tetanus booster. Otherwise, I felt fine. My usual response to potential side effects is to quit being a baby and get over it. However, I did feel unwell after the second dose of the COVID vaccine. I got the second dose around noon on a Thursday. By Thursday evening, I had chills and was quite tired, so I went to bed early. When I woke up Friday morning, I felt worse. Very fatigued, sore all over, and general malaise. I ended up not doing very much on Friday. I did not even walk my dog. But, by Friday night, I was feeling better, and I was back to normal on Saturday. I would take the vaccine again in a heartbeat. The vaccine is the light at the end of a long tunnel which started in March of 2020.\" Employee #4: I knew that I wanted to get vaccinated when I saw the study results from the first two FDA approved vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna).

I got vaccinated to do my part in slowing the spread and, hopefully, eradicating the disease. I also want to be able to visit family safely. After receiving my shots, I had very few side effects. My arm was sore after the first shot for a few days, and I had some minor swelling and redness at the injection site. After the second shot, I was very tired for a day. After being vaccinated, I feel a sense of relief and security and hope for the future. I hope that everyone who can does their part and gets vaccinated, so we can end this pandemic and life can get back to normal.\" INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT THE COVID VACCINE?
