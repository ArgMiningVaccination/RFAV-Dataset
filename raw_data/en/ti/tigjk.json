Your digestive health refers to the health and function of your gastrointestinal (GI) system, which includes your esophagus, stomach, and intestines. In a broad spectrum, it may include the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas as well. A functional digestive system assimilates the food and absorbs the nutrition from it before eliminating the rest as waste products. If your digestive health is on the decline, there are many signs that something isn't right. You may struggle to obtain and benefit from the nutrients you consume, which leads to many possible health issues and problems, not only limited to your digestive system, such as mood disorders, fatigue, joint pain, brain fog, frequent infection, etc. The team at Las Vegas Integrative Medicine evaluates your digestive health by taking your health history and utilizing functional lab tests if necessary. When something isn't right in your digestive system, symptoms may or may not appear serious enough to be addressed with expert help. Some of the most common signs and symptoms of a dysfunctional digestive system are: Eventually, you may experience some symptoms that you might not initially link to your digestive problems. Nutritional imbalances can be a result of poor digestion, which may cause ambiguous symptoms like neuropathy, an irregular heartbeat, and declining vision. Improving your digestive health starts with great nutrition. However, great nutrition may need to be customized for individual differences since there is no one type of diet that works for every single person. Your overall well-being largely relies on the health of your gut. Your digestive tract is full of beneficial bacteria that are there to aid in the health of your gut. This is called the microbiome. Balance of microbiomes means a healthy immune system, so you can avoid getting sick from infections. Balanced microbiomes may also affect the status of your mood and metabolism, including weight and blood sugar. Unhealthy diet and lifestyle factors have a heavy influence on the microbiome, so it's important to evaluate your lifestyle and make appropriate changes. The team at Las Vegas Integrative Medicine makes personalized lifestyle recommendations to improve your gut health and digestion. They may recommend nutritional therapy to restructure your eating habit in addition to other lifestyle changes like getting more exercise or improving your sleep or stress management. Herbal supplements and acupuncture are also options that can improve your digestion.
