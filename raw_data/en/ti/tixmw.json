Ingeneral, semiconductor strain gage transducers exhibited larger zero shifts than theother types oftrans- ducers tested. Within thesemiconductor transducers, thelargest zero occurred intransducers with strain gages diffused into asilicon diaphragm. Next come those transducers which hadsemiconductor strain gages bonded toametal diaphragm. Lesser zero shifts were measured for transducers with semiconductor strain gages mounted onanauxiliary beam connected tothediaphragm bymeans ofapush rod.

This statement particularly applies totransducers A,B,C,and D, with amaximum deviation from theaverage method to produce meaningful results. between type ofconstruction could beexpected toundergo a complex inresponse tothermal transients. Ingeneral, semiconductor strain-gage pressure transducers exhibited larger zero shifts than theother types oftransducers tested. Within thesemiconductor transducers, thelargest zero shift occurred in transducers with strain gages diffused into asilicon diaphragm (such astransducers M,N,0,and P) transducers. Thesmallest zero shifts were measured fortrans- ducers with semiconductor strain output, inthermal ientenvironments with little user awareness oftheresultant large errors. Thetestmethod developed in principle becarried outwith theaidofthis test method. Itis 24 likely, however, that theevaluation ofeffective protection schemes will require thermal -trans ient inputs ofgreater energy than are presently available.
