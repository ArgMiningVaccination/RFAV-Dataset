Beautiful to look at, healing crystals are available in various shapes, sizes, finishes and, of course, gemstones, and are used by people to help with a myriad of things. Over the years, crystal healing has grown in popularity, and currently has somewhat of a celeb following. The likes of Victoria Beckham, Adele and Naomi Campbell all reportedly turn to crystals to help them with different aspects of their life. If you're new to the world of healing crystals and would like to know more about it or you know a bit about it and are keen to find out more, keep reading. This article provides you with a practical introduction to crystal healing stones. Crystal healing involves using healing stones, AKA various different crystals, to help with spiritual, mental and physical healing and support. The benefits of crystal healing are believed to be unlocked by holding, wearing or carrying them around with you. You can also have crystals dotted around your home and within your workspace too. They are said to work by absorbing and channelling the energy that's present within your body (your aura) and interacting with your energy field (your chakra).1 2 Used in a number of different areas, such as mental wellbeing, different types of crystal healing stones each come with their own special energies and are used in accordance with what you would like them to help you with. Their shape, size, and even their colour is believed to influence the impact they can have.3 Over the years, some research has been carried out on the effects of healing crystals, with very few studies evidencing their healing abilities. However, one study that was carried out into the effectiveness of crystal healing in 2001 reported that crystals may 'work' just as effectively as the placebo effect. A total 80 people were asked everyone to meditate for 5 minutes while holding either a real quartz crystal or a counterfeit crystal. The researchers concluded that the overall effects that were reported were a result of the power of suggestion, not the power of the crystals.4 It very much depends on what you are using them for. Some people choose to keep 1 or more healing crystals on them - e.g. in their pocket or handbag, tucked inside their bra or wear them as a pendant or bracelet or another type of jewellery to enhance their personal energy. You can also place crystal healing stones around your home to increase vibration and energy. Certain healing rocks can also be placed in certain spaces to create a particular atmosphere, such as concentration in the office or relaxation in the bedroom.5 Selenite and apophyllite are reportedly ideal for putting in your living room because they can potentially help create more of an uplifting and energised vibe. Meanwhile, apatite and carnelian are linked to boosting creativity, and because of this, are highly recommended for boosting culinary creations in the kitchen. When it comes to office spaces, azurite is said to potentially aid concentration, and pyrite is linked to manifesting wealth, abundance and prosperity. As for the bedroom, amethyst and selenite are believed to deliver cleansing and relaxed energies. All in all, you can keep your crystals wherever you choose. Some people prefer to carry them so they are touching their skin, others prefer to just have them near them. The most important thing is that they are close to you so they can interact with the energy around you.6 If you've already started to research crystal healing, then you've most probably realised just how many different crystals they are out there and just how many different properties are linked to them!
