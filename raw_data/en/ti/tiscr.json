They can impact your ability to function, may worsen symptoms and side effects during cancer treatment, and may even affect your response to treatment. Many therapies and practices are available to help you get the sleep you need. If you have difficulty managing your daily schedule to give yourself at least seven hours in bed before you need to get up, see our Sleeping Well handbook for guidance. In this handbook, we discuss ways to manage and improve your sleep quality if you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep once you're in bed.
