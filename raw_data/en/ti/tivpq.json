Methods: 92 cases of HP infected CAG admitted in People's Hospital of Zhengzhou from March 2014 to March 2015 were selected and randomly divided into experimental group and control group, each group with 46 cases. Patients in the control group were treated by standard triple therapy and given lansoprazole tablets, clarithromycin and amoxicillin orally for 2 weeks. Patients in the experimental group based on control group were given Qingyou Jianpi decoction. The clinical efficacy and the improvement of symptoms of the two groups were compared. Results: (1) Comparison of clinical efficacy showed that symptomatic relief in the treatment group was better than that in the control group (P<0.05). (2) Comparison of pathologic histology indicated that improvement rate of gastric mucosal atrophy in the treatment group was 85.00%, which was significant superior to that in the control group (P<0.05). (3) Comparison of HP-clearance rate revealed that HPclearance rate in the experimental group was 81.67%, which was better than that in the control group (P=0.01). (4) Comparison of incidence of adverse reaction between the two groups: the incidence of adverse reaction in experimental group was 2.2%, which was much lower than that in control group (P=0.04). (5) The detection of routine blood, routine urine, liver and kidney function were normal after patients in the two groups were treated with corresponding treatment. Conclusions: Qingyou Jianpi decoction combined with western medicine can significantly improve the symptoms of patients with HP infected chronic atrophic gastritis and changes in pathologic histology, eliminate HP and prevent its relapse in a better way, which is well worth developing in clinic.Author(s): Tao Chen "}
