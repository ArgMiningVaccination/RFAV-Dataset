Herbs are one choice for optimal health, which includes attention to body, mind and spirit. TCM herbs are not recommended to replace prescribed medications. It is advised that clients seek and continue medical care when indicated. Regulation of Herbs as Dietary Supplements The FDA regulates herbs as dietary supplements. This regulation is not the same as over the counter and prescription drug products. Herbal manufacturers are responsible for ensuring that dietary supplements are safe before they reach the market. The FDA can be contacted by mail, telephone or on the internet regarding concerns or complaints. Warnings and actions are listed on their web site. The Federal Trade Commission regulates dietary supplement advertising and holds manufacturers responsible for truthful and non-misleading product label information. Side effects The historical record and modern research indicate that TCM herbal products have an exceptional safety record. However, adverse events can occur after using any active substance. Side effects that have been reported after using herbs include headaches, skin rashes and digestive upset. Allergic reactions are also very rare but have been reported, usually in individuals with contact allergy to specific plants. Herb -drug interaction Although speculative interactions between herbs and drugs are sometimes publicized, confirmed cases are rare. Nevertheless, some prescribed drugs are very strong and have a narrow range of safe dosage, which makes any interaction more risky. It is the responsibility of the patient to disclose fully any medications currently in use, including other herbs and supplements. We also request that you inform your physicians of any herbs or supplements you are using. Any suggestion that the effect of a drug is being altered by simultaneous use of an herb should be reported directly to all health professionals involved. It is also advisable to stop taking herbs at least 48 hours before any surgical procedure, and in the event of being prescribed anticoagulants, antiepileptic drugs, anti- viral medication and digoxin until expert advice is received. Toxicity Client health & safety is our paramount concern. We will not prescribe TCM supplements at doses known to have toxic effects. The organs that are most vulnerable to any potent substances are the liver and kidneys, and it will be important for the client to divulge any previous history of disease in either of these organs. Herbs also should not be used in pregnancy or lactation; if you become pregnant you should stop taking herbs until advice is received. I have read the above information and agree to follow the advice of the UBAI supervisor about the taking of the TCM herbal products. ___________________________________________ _______________ Signature Date Print Name I have been informed of the nature and purpose of all procedures being recommended to me as treatment.
