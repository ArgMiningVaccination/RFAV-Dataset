A garden can heal therapeutically on so many levels: Physically, emotionally, spiritually, and everything else in between, no matter what or who you believe in. And, as aromatherapists, we know that scented gardens are the ultimate Holy Grail. Ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans heavily influenced the scents of today's gardens. Gardens have been immortalized in the works of artists such as Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890) and Claude Monet (1840-1926). And French Empress Josephine Bonaparte (1763-1814) spent years building an exquisite rose garden of scents. As we head into our second spring of the pandemic, our spring issue of the NAHA Aromatherapy Journal seeks to take you on a journey of fresh starts, fresh air, gardening, and ultimately to the source of our oils and waters, no matter your home situation. Walk with us through the garden and explore such garden herbs as sweet basil ( Ocimum basilicum L.) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris) , look more closely at the essential oil chemotypes of some garden herbs, and find out how you can start your own herb garden as an aromatherapist. Take a quick peek at a spring favorite dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and glimpse at the fascinating making of bee bread (and its benefits). Although many plants have essential oils, some may not be used for aromatherapy, such as those in bryophytes. Find out why that is. And don't forget to stop by the olive (Olea europaea) tree to learn more about this beneficial oil . One important group that comes up time and time again with the use of aromatherapy is babies and children. We take another look at how essential oils can be used with this age group and NAHA President Annette Davis answers a popular question: Do eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) and peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) essential oils have to be avoided in children's products? If you are producing aromatherapy products regularly, learn why different measurements are used in aromatherapy formulations, and which measurement you should be using to maximize your success in formulating products. And, in today's changing world as more and more businesses move online, discover why maximizing content planning and web tools for your business is paramount to your business success. As always, we have some aromatherapy blend recipes from our team of dedicated directors for you to round out the spring issue. I hope that this journal issue brings some joy into your world. I hope that it will inspire you to start a garden, enjoy a garden, or just use and appreciate the benefits of our oils and waters which we can use from our gardens! If possible, get out there and take in the healing benefit of a garden. Sit, relax, and listen. You deserve it.

It's so familiar that you may not actually know its true origins and how it came to be there. Basil has a myriad of chemotypes, with an extensive family of close relatives and offshoots of cultivars and varieties, making this familiar culinary aroma one of the most complicated plants to understand aromatically. Basil is very easy to grow in a pot on a kitchen windowsill, or in your spring herb garden, so getting to know this plant \"in person\" is something you can do quite easily, if you are so inclined. It's used in both aromatherapy practice and herbal medicine and, to a lesser extent, in natural perfumery making. I think that it's one of the most versatile aromatics for your toolbox and worth getting to know The Sweetness of Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) By Sharon Falsetto, BA (Hons) Photo this page: L.)The Scientific Name for Basil Translated Ocimum (OS-i-mum): The Greek name for an aromatic plant (Lamiaceae ).1 basilicus (bass-IL-ih-kus)/basilicum : \"With French basil.5 Chemotypes: estragole (Mint). Zones: Annual.Examples of the Complexity of the Genus Ocimum The genus Ocimum L. consists of 70 species and subspecies. 9 The table on the next page shows just a few examples of the popular close species and cultivars/varieties of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.). There are in fact many other close species of Ocimum basilicum , as well as a multitude of cultivars and varieties.more intimately if you haven't already done so. Here's more information about this most complex of aromatics.12 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopThe Sweetness continued Plant Profile Cultivars and VarietiesBasil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is a small, annual herb which is commonly found in herb gardens worldwide. Its adaptability to grow almost anywhere has spawned a number of cultivars and varieties. A cultivar is a new plant bred from the original plant by human interaction. An example of this is Ocimum basilicum 'Genovese Gigante,' a popular basil cultivar grown in herb gardens. A variety is a random plant within \"the geographical range of a species or subspecies [may be] recognized as varieties.\" 11 An example is Thai basil (Ocimum basilicum var. thyrsiflorum ). Varieties occur naturally in nature whereas cultivars require human intervention. Overall Appearance: Basil is short (up to 2 feet in height) with a square stem. 5,12 Leaves: Glossy green, large ovate leaves.5,12 Lamiaceae plant family characteristics.5,12 Essential Oil: A steam distillation of the leaves (and flowering tops) produces an essential oil.Plant Distribution Basil is native to the tropics of Asia and Africa,9 most likely India.12,13 Like many plants and herbs throughout history, basil made its way to other countries, such as Greece, through warfare campaigns, specifically Alexander the Great (356-323 BC) in this instance. 12,13 It made its way into English country gardens (probably by way of the Romans), Italian pesto dishes, and French cuisine, each nationality embracing this most ubiquitous of herbs as their own. Its spicy aroma, however, gives a clue to its roots for those not acquainted with its origins. Basil has spread worldwide and wherever you go in the world, this small, unassuming herb may be hiding in plain sight. Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is grown from seed, although it is a tender annual and cold will put a premature end to its short life. Garden Profile Basil is most successful when grown from seed indoors. I have unsuccessfully tried to grow it direct sown outdoors and it is a slow (or non) starter if not given the \"right\" conditions to grow in.Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) Close Species Cultivars/Varieties TopThe Sweetness of Basil continued How to Grow Basil: Sow basil seed in seed pots indoors 6 - 8 weeks before your last frost date for your area. Basil requires several hours of sunlight per day to germinate and grow and it needs soil with a pH of 6 - 7.5. Do not overwater. 14 Before transplanting the seedlings outdoors, make sure that the outside temperature is warm enough. A temperature of 80-90 degrees F is optimum for basil, as it's a tropical native. Plants also need to be gradually hardened off before transplanting into the outside herb garden. Garden Benefits: Basil works well as a companion plant, particularly when planted with tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) . It can repel flies and mosquitoes 15 (a therapeutic benefit of the essential oil as well) and like many plants attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.Greek Basil Translated basileus: Greek word meaning king.16 basilikon: Greek word meaning royal.16 ocimum: Derivation of Greek words meaning smell or sharp, a name bestowed by Theophrastos, a reference to its aroma.13 Historical Profile Basil has quite a tale to tell historically. Due to translations of both its Greek and Latin names, one theory postulated that basil was historically used in royal circles. 16 However, Heilmeyer suggests that the ancient Greeks did not revere basil as a \"royal\" herb.13 Indeed, the Greeks didn't hold much stock with basil symbolically believing that it symbolized misfortune. They even went as far as chastising the seeds at planting time, by shouting at them, believing the bad treatment would produce more bountiful plants. 16 Perhaps a more surprising association is one with scorpions. It was believed that where basil was planted, it would attract scorpions. 17 Ancient Greek physicians such as Dioscorides, Hippocrates, and Pliny recommended using basil for melancholy, diarrhea and nausea, and \"fainting spells, excessive drowsiness Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) and headaches,\" respectively, and in various formats.13 Keville18 writes that the ancient Egyptians were already using basil much as we use the essential oil today by burning it (the herb) with myrrh (Commiphora myrhha) to relieve headaches. Basil earned a reputation as a strewing herb (scattered on the floors of houses to rid it of unpleasant aromas and to repel pests) in England 16 where it was planted in kitchen and medicinal gardens, an act most likely inherited from the Romans, during their time of the occupation of Britain (AD 43 - AD 410). The Romans enjoyed planting basil in their herb gardens. 13 Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) was in popular use in Far Eastern medicine. Common uses included \"respiratory problems such as 14 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to Topbronchitis, coughs, colds, asthma, 'flu and emphysema.\"5 However, wider use included use \"as an antidote to poisonous insect or snake bites\" and \"against epidemics and fever, such as malaria.\" 5 It is no secret that the Italians love adding basil to pesto sauce, perhaps in an attempt to snag a potential lover. Keville writes that \"a pot of basil on the porch [also] puts out an invitation to one's lover\" and \"a suitor can proclaim his intentions by wearing a basil sprig.\" 18 Chemistry Profile Herb: Chevallier12 lists cineole, methyl cinnamate and \"other terpenes\" as a minor part of the constituents of sweet basil. He also states that basil contains approximately 1% of volatile oil. Mabey 19 adds that in addition to the essential oil which basil contains, it also has tannins and basil camphor.Essential Oil: In the course of my research on basil, I came across an interesting extract online from the book, Handbook of Herbs and Spices, 20 which stated that, \"The time of the harvest [of basil] plays an important role in the quantity and quality of [essential] oil produced.\" Like many essential oil extractions, geography, climate, and timing all affect the end result. In basil's case, the authors P. Pushpangadan and V. George go on to state that, \"The crop is usually harvested on bright sunny days in order to achieve a good oil yield and high-quality oil.\" Maximum yield time was a harvest between 8.00 h and 12.00 h. If the shoots were stored for a long period of time (before extracting essential oil), it was found that linalool content within the plant made a significant increase: 45.18% to 86.80%. 20 Peace Rhind21 lists the main chemical components of basil essential oil as linalool, eugenol, 1,8-cineole, and methyl chavicol. This aligns with the major chemotypes of basil, which can be affected by elements of weather, geography, harvest procedures and times, and storage length, as indicated in the previous paragraph. Tisserand and Young 6 list three states that sweet (or French) basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) has a higher linalool content when compared to exotic basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) which has a higher methyl chavicol content. Again, this can reflect the various factors which change the resulting chemistry of the essential oil, based on location in this instance. Exotic basil is found mainly in the Comoro Islands. 5,23 The Caddy profiles confirm this projection of constituents with a significant difference between phenols The Sweetness of Basil continued Basil to TopThe Sweetness of Basil continued Comparison of the Aroma of the Two Main Chemotypes of Basil Essential adds that the exotic- type basil is often produced as the ct. methyl cinnamate and it is not the preferred type of basil for perfumery use (ct. linalool is the usual preference). In all resources researched, it is clear that the two main chemotypes of basil ( Ocimum (estragole) for essential oil use in aromatherapy.Aroma Profile The aroma of basil as a plant when compared to the essential oil can be quite different. Keville 18 describes the aroma of the plant as a \"spicy, clove scent, with [a] hint of mint and pepper.\" Basil is a top note essential oil. Basil ct. linalool is described as clear to pale yellow in color by various sources. Basil ct. methyl chavicol is described as yellow to pale green in color.Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.)16 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to Top The Sweetness of Basil continued Therapeutic Profile Herb: Chevallier12 states that basil is primarily useful for digestive issues such as indigestion, flatulence, colic, nausea, vomiting and stomachache. Because of \"mildly sedative action\" 12 basil is good to use with nervous conditions such as anxiety, depression and insomnia. Use the leaves to repel insects and to treat bites and stings, much like geranium (Pelargonium graveolens) essential oil. Tierra 25 lists basil's as \"carminative, antipyretic, stimulant, alternative, diuretic and nervine.\" He suggests using the herb as a tea for flu, colds, fevers, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, and other related digestive and nervous issues. Essential Oil: Basil essential oil's therapeutic properties include as an analgesic, Use basil essential oil for nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, arthritis, headaches, fatigue, clearing the mind, exhaustion, amenorrhea, flu, asthma, in skin care, stress, depression, insect bites, insect repellent, coughs, gout, flatulence, and \"promotion of emotional connection with others.\" 5,9,21,26 Energetics: Battaglia states that basil is \"a warming oil which tonifies Yang and strengthens the Shen .\"9Safety Profile - Cautions for Use Herb: None noted, although individual situations may vary.Essential Oil: The main caution associated with sweet basil ( Ocimum basilicum L.) essential oil is regarding skin sensitivity. It also very much depends on the main chemotype of the essential oil in question. Most sources cite basil ct. estragole (Ocimum basilicum ct. estragole) as being the most problematic in this area. 5,6,21 Peace Rhind eugenol (trace-4%).\" 21 However, Tisserand and Young appear to disagree with this statement by stating that \"...no restrictions are required, in our opinion, with regard to carcinogenesis.\" 6 The recommended dermal level use varies between \"no limit\" 6 and 1.5%,6 depending upon source (including the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) and the European Union (EU) regulations) and chemotype. Lawless also recommends avoiding the use of basil ( Ocimum basilicum L.) essential oil during pregnancy, although specific chemotype is not stated. 5 Penny Price Academy of Aromatherapy cautions the use of basil essential oil with babies and children, unless the linalool chemotype is used. 27 The same is true with the use of basil essential oil in pregnancy - Price only recommends the use of sweet basil ct. to TopClinical Research The following clinical studies and trials demonstrate the versatility of basil essential oil's therapeutic properties: Migraine Pain: A conducted Ardalan A, Ebrahimzadeh F, Bahrami P, Sheikhi E. on The Efficacy of Topical Basil Essential Oil on Relieving Migraine Headaches: A Randomized Triple-Blind Study, conducted a \"triple-blind clinical trial study was performed on 144 patients diagnosed with migraine.\" 28 Pain intensity was measured between different groups on the effectiveness of the use of basil essential oil in relieving the migraine pain, in addition to the frequency of attacks, in combination with the use of acetaminophen. It was found that \"Time lapse and higher doses of basil essential oil [would] reduce[d] both the intensity and frequency of migraine attacks.\" 28 Antibacterial Agent: Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) essential oil was shown to be effective against Escherichia coli, demonstrating an ability to inhibit growth of the bacteria. This study , The potential of use basil and rosemary essential oils as effective antibacterial agents, was conducted by Sienkiewicz, M., ysakowska , M., Pastuszka, M., Bienias, W., & Kowalczyk, E. 29Insect Repellent : While many of the Ocimum species demonstrate mosquito and larvicidal properties, Ocimum basilicum came out on top with the strongest larvicidal activity in this study, Mosquito repellent activities of ocimum volatile oils, conducted by Chokechaijaroenporn O, Bunyapraphatsara N, and Kongchuensin S. 30 Clinical studies need to be read in context with many factors including size of study, control methodology, number of participants and location. The above are extracts or summaries of studies and their stated perceived outcomes. Research each study fully and correctly to learn more. Basil in Full ProfileBasil is a complex essential oil, depending upon species and chemotype, but sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) deserves a place in your aromatherapist's toolbox. Why? It is a versatile essential oil, tackling such issues as depression and stress, colds and flu, insects and pain, in addition to reviving dull, tired skin and toning down oily skin. 31 It also has a mesmerizing spicy aroma which is not too overpowering. And you can always grow a basil plant on your kitchen windowsill to compliment your culinary creations.

Measure out each of the ingredients and set aside in separate bowls. 2. Prepare the essential oil blend if you are using it. Set aside. 3. Set up the silicone molds. Make sure that you have a firm method of moving them (silicone molds are flexible when filled with liquid). I used a piece of cardboard slid underneath the molds before filling them. 4. Slowly heat up the water on the stove for the double boiler. 5. Add cocoa butter to the double boiler and melt slowly . 6. Once the cocoa butter is melted, add coconut oil and continue to melt slowly. 7. Once the coconut oil is melted, add both of the infused oils to the mix and stir in gently, making sure all of the ingredients are blended together completely. 8. Take off the heat and add the essential oil blend if you are using it. Stir in well. 9. Immediately pour the mixture into the silicone soap molds. 10. Sprinkle about a teaspoon of crushed oats into each mold. Press down gently to make sure that they are immersed into the liquid. 11. Leave to cool on worktop for about 15 minutes. 12. Next, place the silicone molds in the fridge without spilling any liquid. After about half an hour to one hour, the liquid will begin to harden. If desired, sprinkle further crushed oats onto the top of each filled mold, while semi-solid. 13. Leave in fridge for about another four hours. 14. Next, remove from the fridge and place in the freezer. The molds should be solid but may still be flexible. 15. Leave in freezer overnight.Day Two: 1. Remove the silicone molds from the freezer. They should now be solid. 2. Prise the cleanse bars gently from the molds. They should slip out easily if the mixture has set correctly. 3. I advise storing these cleanse bars in a small soap box in the refrigerator until you are ready to use the bar, especially in warm climates. The coconut oil in this recipe makes the bar unstable under heat. Use direct from the fridge or take out five minutes before use. Instructions for Use: Use the cleanse bar as an alternative to soap in the shower or bath. Rub the bar over yourself before stepping into the bath or shower for maximum effect. Allow to soak in for several minutes and then wash off in the usual way that you use a bar of soap. Due to the extreme moisturizing effects of this bar, you will probably not need to use a moisturizer after drying off. Cautions: For adult use only. Avoid use in pregnancy. Possible skin sensitivity. Discontinue use if sensitization occurs. Avoid use on face. Warning! The cleanse bar will make all surfaces slippery and oily. Take extreme care when stepping in and out of the bath and shower. Wipe down the bath or shower immediately after use to avoid prolonged danger of slipping and/or staining of surfaces. 20 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopThe Sweetness of Basil continued Basil and Parsley Infused Oil and Elderberry Infused Oil Ingredients: 24-oz.

I worked alongside scientists from all over the world. I recall having lunch with one of the postdoctoral fellows from France, Dr. Tymes who was pregnant with her first son. As we discussed baby names, she said, \"Well I can't choose Justin. All his life he'd be 'Justin Tymes.'\" We had a good laugh. Kidding aside, thyme hydrosol and herb is worth getting to know, especially \"just in thyme\" for spring to support the body and household in many ways from respiratory support, spring cleaning and more. Cultivation and Botany of Thyme The genus Thymus contains about 350 species of aromatic, herbaceous perennials, a number of which are cultivated as culinary or medicinal herbs and ornamentals. Thymus vulgaris , aka common or garden thyme, is the best-known species. The low growing, perennial evergreen is a member of the Lamiaceae (mint) family and grows from two to fourteen inches (five to thirty-eight centimeters) tall. Thymus vulgaris has woody stalks, fibrous roots, and small \u00bc - \u00bd inch (6.35 - 13 millimeters) green-gray, oval shaped leaves along its creeping stems. Tiny flowers with tubular calyx (sepals) grace the stems in summer with hues of pinks, purples, and whites, with lilac being the most common. 1 Thymus vulgaris is widely cultivated in temperate climates across the globe. It is native to Southern Europe from the western Mediterranean to southern Italy and naturalized to some parts of the northeastern United States. 2 A hardy perennial Thymus vulgaris tends to thrive in most climates but prefers a sunny location with well-drained, alkaline soil. 3 Thyme Copyright to TopFor medicinal and used. Sometimes lemon thyme (Thymus citridorus) is also used. Historical and Modern Use of Thymus vulgaris Thymus originates from the Greek thym\u00f3s and has several meanings including spirit, courage, strength, anger, or other passions . 4 As its Greek name suggests, the aroma of wild thyme was said to endow one with courage and strength according to Scottish legend. Roman soldiers would exchange thyme sprigs as a sign of respect. 5,6 Thyme has also been viewed as a protector. The Romans believed that eating thyme before or during a meal would protect them from poison (making thyme popular with emperors) and that a warm bath full of thyme could stop any poisonous effects. 6 Thymus vulgaris has historically been burned to purify homes and temples. It was thought to ward off venomous creatures, rid the home of insects, and purify a space. 2,6 Thyme was placed under pillows to promote sleep and prevent nightmares during the Middle Ages. 7 Rich in aromatic oils (such as thymol and saponins, and resins, thyme is well known for its ability to support the respiratory, digestive, and immune systems. 8 Thymus vulgaris has been employed as a tonic, to stimulate the thymus, and help to support uterine health.For breathing difficulties, Thymus vulgaris acts as a bronchodilator, anti-inflammatory, and expectorant. 10 It is often used as a tea, gargle, or with honey to help clear congestion, support a productive cough, and address chest complaints.

The Sumerians are believed to have used thyme as an antiseptic in 3000 BCE. During the Middle Ages, thyme was worn to curtail the plague. In the 18 th century, an apothecary in Germany discovered that thyme was beneficial against bacteria and fungus. 7 Honestly, I don't feel like I can do justice to this beautiful herb in the scope of this article, so I encourage you to continue to explore thyme in your own time.

It is native to Eurasia and North America. The two most common species are Taraxacum officinale and Taraxacum erythrospermum , which were introduced from Europe, and now grow wild. They are edible from root to tip. The common English name is derived from French: Dent- de-lion, or \"lion's tooth.\" 1 Many are familiar with the bright yellow flower of the dandelion. Dandelions often cause distress to those trying to maintain their lawn when the flowers transition into the downy seeds that then fly over the yard and plant \"Dandelions put down roots almost anywhere and it's almost impossible to destroy. It's an unpretentious plant, yet good looking. It's a survivor in a broad range of climates. Military children bloom everywhere the winds carry them. They are hardy and upright. Their roots are strong, cultivated deeply in the culture of the Armed Services...planted swiftly and surely. They're ready to fly in the breezes that take them to new adventures, new lands, and new friends. Military children are well-rounded, culturally aware, tolerant, and extremely resilient. They have learned from an early age that home is where their hearts are, that a good friend can be found in every corner of the world. They learn that to survive means to adapt, that the door that closes one chapter of their life opens up a new and exciting adventure full of new friends and new experiences.\" Author UnknownThe Official Flower of the Military Child is the Dandelion. Why? Dandelions are high in phytonutrients, and are also an excellent source of Vitamins A, C and K, and minerals like calcium, potassium, phos - phorus, iron and manganese. 2,3 Dandelions are the highest in lecithin content of all the plant sources and depending on which part of the plant you use, it can have varying effects on the organs of the body. 3 The flowers and leaves can be used in salads, or used in cooking, and the roots are delicious in themselves in what was once a pristine green sea of grass. But did you know that dandelions are actually very special? Firstly, they are the symbol of military children everywhere - resilient, hardy, unpretentious.

Maybe you noticed the typical sweet basil, but also a large leaf basil, or even a basil with purple leaves. Like most aromatherapists would be tempted to do, you may have stopped to sniff each of the basil varieties and noticed their differences in aroma. Several garden herbs offer significant aroma and flavor variations that might not be determinable when looking at a plant's common or botanical name. Sometimes, deeper investigation is required! Whether you are making an herbal tea, flavoring your favorite recipe with fresh-cut herbs, or using an essential oil for aromatherapy, it can be beneficial to know a plant's chemistry. This article will discuss what to look for in a plant's name and some key chemical differences between basil (Ocimum basilicum) , Botanical Name? Plants are classified based on similar anatomic characteristics. Botanical names identify a plant's genus, species, and sometimes chemotype, subspecies, or variety. Typically derived from either Latin or Greek words, each plant has a unique botanical name. For example, Roman chamomile has the botanical name of Chamaemelum nobile. The plant's genus is Chamaemelum, and its more specific species is nobile. Botanical names differ from common names. A plant can have many common names, but typically has one botanical name. Further, botanical names can be used across the world to identify a specific plant, while common names are used locally. Essential Oil Chemotypes of Common Garden Herbs By Kathy Sadowski MS in Aromatherapy, RA, LMT 38 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopEssential Oil Chemotypes continued Subspecies Variety Hybrid Description A subspecies is a category further specifying species, and typically identifies an established geographically isolated race. This is a category that further specifies subspecies (when present) or species, based on minor but permanent or heritable characteristics. Hybrids are created when two different species interbreed. This can be identified in a botanical name with the multiplication symbol \u00d7 written between the genus and a cross between L. angustifolia and L. latifolia. What is a Chemotype? When plants from the same species produce differing odor and chemical composition, this is called a chemotype. It is often related to geo-climatic conditions such as temperature, precipitation, soil quality, and elevation. It can also be related to the life-stage of the plant and harvesting time. 1 Example: Ocimum basilicum ct. linalool. In this example, the dominant chemical component of the plant is linalool. Eight Aromatic Garden Herbs with Significant Chemical Variations Basil, chamomile, lavender, sweet marjoram, the mint, oregano, the sage, and the thyme species all have significant chemical variations. This section describes the constituent differences among these plants in more detail. Note that this section identifies some of the variations, but there can be many more!

Safety: As an herb, avoid ingesting sweet marjoram beyond normal food quantities dur - ing pregnancy, lactation, with small children, or for prolonged periods of time. 7 Some chemi - cal varieties of sweet marjoram most similar to oregano (Origanum vulgare) could be con - traindicated with certain medical conditions beyond normal food spice amounts. 14of linalool, linalyl acetate, camphor, ( Lavandula angustifolia ), known as true lavender, produces an essential oil with 50 - 83 percent linalool and linalyl acetate with chemo-variations based on growing conditions. 9 Spanish lavender ( Lavandula stoechas) produces an essential oil which is high and 1,8-cineole. 3 Spike lavender ( primarily 1,8-cineole, and camphor. 9 Benefits of Lavandula plants: Those plants which are high in linalool and linalyl acetate constituents can have a calming effect and are good for the skin. Lavender species with camphor and 1,8-cineole components can help with breathing. The plant may also be useful to help ward off biting insects. 10 Safety: Concerns are related to Lavandula species with constituents of camphor and 1,8-cineole making them less appropriate for use with young children and those with certain medical conditions, such as asthma. Marjoram Essential Oils There are numerous chemotypes of sweet marjoram (Origanum majorana). To make it more confusing, some plants may have the common name of marjoram, like Spanish marjoram (Thymus mastichina), but are not in the same genus. Spanish marjoram (Thymus masti- china) essential oil is high in the constituents of 1,8-cineole, camphor, alpha-pinene, cam-phene, and borneol. 3 This species has a cam - phoraceous aroma that may aid in breathing. 42 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopEssential high carvone content of spearmint (Mentha spicata) essential oil can be an irritant for the skin and mucous membrane and has a maximum dermal use level of 1.7% . 3Mint Essential Oils Plants of the Mentha genus have almost twenty-four unique species, with countless hybridizations and variations. Here are the most common species used to make essential oils: Corn mint ( Mentha arvensis ) is often dementholized for aromatherapy use, and the essential oil contains the key constituents of menthol, menthone, ) and spearmint (Mentha spicata). The essential primarily of the components of menthol, high amounts of carvone and limonene constituents. 9 Benefits: These three mint plants may be helpful with respiratory and digestive complaints. Those containing menthol (corn mint (Mentha arvenis) and peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita )) may also topical analgesic activity. 12 Safety: The menthol and carvacrol constituents found in corn mint (Mentha arvenis) and peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) essential oils can be a skin and mucus membrane irritant. In excess, the menthone and pulegone constituents can be toxic. 3 Avoid use of these two essential oils with pregnancy, babies and young children under 3 years of age (due to breathing difficulties), and with certain medical conditions. Top-to-bottom: Corn Mint Return to TopUse of the herb leaves of corn mint, peppermint, and spearmint are generally safe in small food quantity amounts. However, avoid eating peppermint or corn mint leaves and drinking the tea with gallstones. 7 Oregano Essential Oils In the Origanum genus, there are over fifty species, plus many varieties. Popular oregano species used to extract for essential oils include common oregano (Origanum vulgare), All three essential oils in carvacrol content with p-cymene, gamma-terpinene, and thymol as additional key constituents. 3 In the culinary world, these types of oreganos are described as Mediterranean oregano. Plants commonly called Mexican oregano are not technically a member of the Origanum family and include Lippia graveolens. Much higher in thymol content, with p-cymene, carva crol, and 1,8-cineole as additional key constitu - ents, Mexican oregano offers a more intense flavor well suited for Southwestern cuisine. 13 Plants high in the constituents of carvacrol and thymol (like oregano and some types of thyme) demonstrate significant antimicrobial activities but can be toxic in excess. Safety: Avoid use of oregano essential oils with young children, pregnant and breastfeed - ing women, and those with certain medical conditions. These essential oils may also be sensitizing to the skin and mucus membrane. 9 As an herb used in small amounts, oregano is generally well tolerated. Avoid in doses beyond normal food spice amounts with pregnancy, small children, and certain medical conditions. 14 Essential Oil Chemotypes continued Sage Essential Oils Salvia is the largest genus in the Lamiaceae family, with over 500 species found growing in America.15 Even our dear friend rosemary moved over to the Salvia family recently, with her new name becoming Salvia rosmarinus . Common sage (Salvia officinalis) essential oil is the most common sage used in aromatherapy, along with clary sage (Salvia sclarea). Other varieties of sage seen in essential oils include Greek sage ( Salvia fruticose), white lavandulifolia) , which are all high in 1,8-cineole content and also contain camphor, which may help with respiratory complaints. Safety: Common sage (Salvia officinalis) essential oil is high in the constituents of camphor and alpha-thujone, two highly potent and toxic constituents when used in excess. Thus, this species has multiple contraindications for use in aromatherapy, depending on the essential oil. Common sage (Salvia officinalis) essential oil is Sage Smudge Sticks: Sage is a staple garden herb used in cooking, and its leaves contain 1-2.5% essential oil.7 However, my favorite thing to do with the sage (Salvia officinalis ) growing in my garden is to make smudge sticks.

As an herb, avoid use beyond normal food spice amounts with children, pregnant women, and certain medical conditions. Some people have an allergy or hypersensitivity to sage species and should avoid internal and topical use. Also, avoid use with asthma. 14 Thyme Essential Oils With over 350 plants in the Thymus genus, there is also huge array of chemical variations. Even within the Thymus vulgaris species, there are multiple chemotypes: Thymus is high in carvacrol content. 3 Benefits: This plant type is similar to oregano in flavor and aroma, with significant antimicrobial activity. Safety: The essential oil is a possible skin and mucus membrane irritant. Also, avoid the use of the essential oil with young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and those with certain medical conditions. 9 Thymus vulgaris ct. thymol is high in thymol content.3,9 Benefits: plant's flavor and aroma are less intense than oregano and offer antimicrobial activities.

SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE Spring 2021.1 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal49 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to Top An Aromatherapist's Guide to Starting an Herb Garden By Anna Pageau NAHA Certified Professional Aromatherapist\u00ae Many of us get involved with aromatherapy because we love the fragrances of all the essential oils. We also love the healing benefits that they provide. Unfortunately, other than seeing pictures of the plants from which essential oils are extracted, many haven't had much exposure to the plants themselves. Maybe you fee l like you have a black thumb vs. a green thumb, or you don't have the space to grow plants. I assure you, if you have a south facing window or a balcony you have space to enjoy some of your favorite essential oils in their plant form. Understanding Plant FamiliesAromatherapists spend an abundance of time studying plant families. We know that plants in the Lamiaceae family are effective for helping conditions of the skin, pain in muscles/joints, problems of the digestive system, immune sys - tem, respiratory system, and nervous system. 1 We also know that the Asteraceae family has plants that produce essential oils, carrier oils and hydrosols. 2 This plant family tends to pro - duce essential oils that can be used for a wide variety of issues and substituted if needed. For example, Roman chamomile ( Chamaemelum nobile) could be used to work with insomnia, digestive issues and muscle pain. Did you realize that understanding these vari - ous family traits can also help you grow the plants with great success?Lamiaceae Plant Family Herbs Plants in the Lamiaceae family are commonly used in the kitchen. This plant family is also one that many essential oils common to the basic aromatherapists toolkit are extracted from. Some of the plants include of thyme officinalis ). 1 Many of these plants originated in the Mediterranean region. Therefore, they grow best in warm weather and sandy soil. Ensuring that the soil drains well is a key element to these plants' growth. The roots cannot handle remaining wet, known as \"wet feet. \" If the roots do sit in water, they will begin rotting. You will notice the leaves yellowing and generally the plant will brown from the base up. These types of plants can tolerate the soil drying out between watering, but not for too long. You will have the best success with this family of plants if they receive eight hours or more of sun per day. Plants can be harder to start from seed, but once they are growing, they are easy to manage. With the right soil and a temperate climate, many of them grow year-round. A lot of the Lamiaceae family are perennial plants 50 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopStarting an Herb Garden continued so they will grow back from the roots each spring. Of course, there is always an exception to the rule. For example, in this family basil (Ocimum basilicum) does not grow back from the roots, but if you let it flower it will self-seed and you will get new plants in the spring. Asteraceae Plant Family HerbsThe Asteraceae family in gardening is often referred to as the daisy family. It is also known as the aster family, lettuce family or Compositae family. The flower heads are made up of a composite of small flowers clustered together making it appear to be one flower. 3 As an example, dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale ) is the most known spring flower. The design of this composite flower head is to attract pollinators. It provides a nice flat surface for them to land. The Asteraceae family is one of the largest plant families with over 23,000 species of flowering plants. Included in this family are Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum it includes plants which are used for carrier oils including calendula ( Calendula officinalis) and sunflower ( Helianthus annuus). This plant family tends to prefer cooler climates or growing temperatures. The root systems are shallow, spreading out rather than down. The plants also need less sunlight than the Lamiac- eae family. They can grow with as little as four hours of sunshine a day although they will be more productive with more sunlight. The Asteraceae family grows well in containers due to the root system not being as deep as others. A container can be as shallow as six inches. The soil needs to be sandy for these plants as well, although plants do not like the soil to completely dry up. They can be easier to start from seed than Lamiaceae plant family members. Apiaceae Plant Family HerbsThe Apiaceae family is also known as the Umbelliferae or carrot family. Knowing that it is referred to as the carrot family provides a clue as to the type of root that plants produce. The tap root of Apiaceae herb family members Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopStarting an Herb Garden continued likes to grow straight down. These plants are generally harvested before they flower. If they do flower, the flower heads have the appearance of an umbrella. Plants of the Apiaceae family used in aromatherapy include dill ( Anethum (Foeniculum vulgare ) and carrot seed ( Daucus carota). To grow these types of plant s you need loose, sandy soil that drains well, but remains damp. Due to the tap root, you must make sure that the root can spread down without having to fight. The long root allows these plants to remain in the garden for a while. They prefer weather to stay around 75\u00b0 F, so grow best in spring or fall in most areas. Towards the end of its life cycle, the plant will flower. The flowers will dry and become the seeds for next year's plants. Many of these plan ts get used for their leaves or seeds. For example, a lot of people use dill leaves to flavor butters, fish, or eggs. The dill seeds are then used for pickles. Cilantro (Coriandrum sativum ) leaves are used for salsa, but once it flowers and the seeds form, the seeds are known as coriander and are used to flavor soups and meat dishes. Both cilantro (leaves) and coriander (seeds) are used as essential oils. All the varieties discussed here have delicate leaves and can be found fresh at local grocery stores. Fresh store-bought herbs can be expensive. Generally, they are not as flavorful as fresh clippings from your garden. Harvesting plants from your garden encourages new growth. You can harvest about one-third of the plant every few days. Growing Your Own Aromatic HerbsDeciding where you want to grow your herbs will take some investigation and will help you decide the next steps to get started growing. If you are growing in containers, ensure that you have picked containers that are large enough for the roots. Then you need to create a soil mix for the plants. If you will be transplanting into the ground, consider amending your soil a week before you will be transplanting your starts or prior to laying seeds. The soil amendments could include adding sand to clay-based soil to improve drainage, or compost to enrich soil. Left-to-Right: Yarrow (Achillea millefolium), Lemon photos \u00a9 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopStarting an Herb Garden continued How to Start Seeds Place seed starting mix in a large bowl or bucket. Wet the soil with water to get it moist but not soaked. This ensures that the seeds have a moist environment to get started. Fill the plug cells in your seed tray with the soil. Decide which seeds you will be planting and create labels. It's easier to do this first than forget where you have planted your seeds. Use a tool (such as a dibber or unsharpened pencil) to make an impression for the seed. The rule for planting a seed is to bury it only twice the width of the seed. Many of the seeds just need a dusting of starting mix on top or gently press them into the soil. With dry, clean hands pour out a few seeds from your packet and start dropping them in the holes you created or lightly press into soil. Try to only get one or two seeds per starting cell to ensure good spacing once the seed starts to grow. Once you have planted your seeds use a cover to help keep them moist. If you are in a cooler climate, consider using a heating mat to keep the soil warm. Check the tray every few days for moisture and warmth. It will take 3-7 days, depending on the seeds, to see sprouts. Once the seeds sprout, remove the covers. If you don't have enough sunlight, consider using an artificial light source to continue good growth. Create a watering schedule. Pour water in the tray so that the roots reach downward . This also ensures you don't displace seeds. After a few weeks when the herbs have several leaves, they will be ready to be transplanted. Seed Starting TipsA few quick notes about starting from seed: Asteraceae and Apiaceae plants have larger seeds and can be easier to start. In the Lamiaceae family, the seeds are much smaller and require more patience to get started. Also, the woody type plants like lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), rosemary (Salvia Rosmarinus) and oregano (Origanum vulgare) in this family tend to be easier to start from cuttings. Hopefully understanding the plant families and soil needs can help you have greater success. Happy growing! Seed Starting Supplies Seeds of choice. Seed cells or a plug tray. Tray cover (generally a plastic cover that comes with store bought trays). Organic seed starting mix. Light source. Water. Heat mat (optional). Seed tags (such as popsicle sticks). Dibber tool or unsharpened pencil. You can find all the materials at a local garden supply store or visit your local farmer's markets. When purchasing your seed starting mix and your soil make sure you get organic, as you want to make sure your plants have a healthy start.Spring 2021.1 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal53 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA TopStarting an Herb Garden continued Plant Family Sun* Soil Water Space Temperature Growing DurationStart Best From Lamiaceae 6 + Sandy Low 1 per square foot70\u00b0 F + Most are perennialClippings or established roots Asteraceae 4 + Sandy with nitrogen Consistent but not too wet 6-9 per square foot45\u00b0 F - 75\u00b0 F +3-6 monthsSeeds Apiaceae 4 + Sandy and loose Consistent but not too wet6-9 per square foot45\u00b0 F - 75\u00b0 F +3-6 monthsSeeds *Hours per Day 1.

We also find mention in many bibli - cal stories of anointing with olive oil to bless and sanctify objects. It was an olive branch that signaled the end of the flood for Noah on the ark, and even today, it is well known that extending an olive branch is a gesture of peace. 2 And though the oil itself is now mostly known as the main fat \u2014and a key ingredient \u2014 in the healthy Mediterranean diet,3 it is a great addition to any aromatherapist's toolkit. The Tree The olive ( Olea europaea) tree, of the family Oleaceae , appears to have originated in Iran, Syria and Palestine and then spread throughout the rest of the Mediterranean basin. 4 Now it is also cultivated in many places around the globe, including California, Mexico and Australia. The evergreen tree is relatively short, reaching a height of about 25ft (8m). 5 It is often as wide as it is tall with a gnarled trunk and silvery green foliage. 6 The olive tree is a very long living tree, producing fruit only after fifteen years but continuing to do so for hundreds of years. 7Extraction The oil is cold pressed from the fleshy pulp of the fruit. The fruit is picked then left in the sun to lightly ferment. Next, it is gently crushed, stones removed, and the flesh pressed. The collected oil is centrifuged and filtered for clarity. The very first collection is known as extra virgin olive oil , and subsequent collections of the first pressing are labeled virgin olive oil . Water is then added to the flesh for a second pressing of lesser quality. More pressings of the remains are done by boiling and solvent methods, which yields a lesser quality oil suitable only for things such as low-quality soap. 8 Therapeutic Properties Traditional therapeutic uses for olive (Olea europaea) oil vary greatly. For example, olive oil has been used ingested with lemon (Citrus \u00d7 limon ) juice to treat gallstones. 9 It was also used in ancient Greece for the prevention and treatment of sports injuries. A deep friction massage with olive oil was often done before a sport, such as a wrestling match, or used after a sport to relieve muscular pain. 10 It has more recently been shown in research that ingesting the oil can improve your lipid Olive (Olea europaea): An Ancient Gift for Aromatherapy By Dawn Shipley Rodriguez, Registered AromatherapistOlive (Olea europaea)56 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 to Topprofile, decrease DNA oxidation, ameliorate insulin resistance, reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure, regulate endothelial dysfunction, 11 reduce body mass index, have immunomodulatory effects,12 and decrease risk of dementia and neurodegeneration.13 It is recommended for liver disorders, hyperacidity, to stimulate bile flow and act as a laxative. 14 It has been suggested it may also reduce the risk of multiple types of cancer, such as colorectal and postmenopausal breast cancer. 15 Benefits of Olive ( Olea europaea) Oil Relieves itchy skin and insect bites Somewhat astringent and antiseptic Helps heal strains, sprains and bruises Lifts cradle cap on babies16 Emollient Demulcent Calming Helps relieve burns17 Supports skin's sebum production Protects skin Prevents moisture evaporation Supports delivery of oxygen to skin cells Removes waste from skin cells.18Olive ( Olea europaea) oil have traditionally been attributed to the high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) that make up nearly 80% of its lipid profile. It is now thought that the 1-2% of phenolic and other antioxidant components largely contribute to the unique and vast array of health properties, 19 too, as they are unique to the oil. More than 200 different chemical compounds have been detected in olive oil that include phenolic compounds, sterols, carotenoids, and triterpenic alcohols. The phenolic contents alone have antioxidant properties higher than those of vitamin E. 21 Their antioxidant and anti-atherogenic effects which have been widely confirmed in literature are theorized to cause the oil's cardio-protective, and chemopreventive properties. 22 The most notable phenolic compounds with some of their properties are: Hydroxytyrosol: A reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger that reduces oxidized LDL and platelet aggregations. Oleuropein: An anti-inflammatory that promotes nitric macrophages. 23 Oleocanthal: An anti-inflammatory that exerts properties similar to ibuprofen, inhibiting the activity of cyclooxyrgenase (COX) enzymes. It has been reported that it may reduce the chances of getting Alzheimer's disease and some cancers. 24 Squalene is another notable component of olive oil that adds to its unique health benefits. Spring 2021.1 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal57 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to Top Olive (Olea europaea) continued It is a lipid most commonly produced by skin cells with a structure similar to vitamin A that is a precursor to phytosterols. First discovered in pure form in shark livers, it is only found in a few plant sources. It is lubricating, prevents moisture evaporation, protects, supports oxygen delivery to skin cells, and removes waste. 25 It is also proposed that the high squalene content of olive oil is a major factor in the cancer risk-reducing effect of the oil. 26 Usage/Shelf Life/ Cautions Olive (Olea europaea) oil is best used for dry skin, and not suitable for oily or sensitive skin, dry scalp or dandruff. It is recommended to use extra virgin olive oil for aromatherapy since it has the highest amount of minerals, and it can be used up to 100% topically . However, the scent can be overpowering, in which case it is suggested to use it in a blend up to 20%. 27 Greek olive oil is much greener and more acid-ic than oils from Italy and California, so it is less suitable for use on the face or acned skin. 28 The oil is quite stable and can tolerate some heat and light exposure. 29 It can be stored un- refrigerated for a year,30 and proper storage can extend life from eighteen months to two years.31 Olive (Olea europaea)Relaxing and Healing Body Oil olive ( Olea Essential Oils: 10 extract2 2 drops yellow drop Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii) To Make: Mix together carrier oils in a 1-oz. bottle with cap.

You grab a bouquet and head to your loved one, contributing to the $15 billion-dollar floral industry. From the beginning of life at baby showers to the end of life at funerals, cut flowers fill our lives with beauty and scent. They signify love, as they should since they are plant sexual genitalia. Yes, you read that right, when you give someone flowers, you are giving them sexual organs. Perhaps you never thought of flowers in that respect, but the reality is that pollination is plant sex via third party assistance from pollinators since they cannot walk. Pollination is that kind of party. Flower SexFlowers have male and female organs. The female portion, the pistil , contains the stigma, style, ovary, and ovule. The top part of the pistil, the stigma, catches and traps pollen. The male section, the stamen, contains the anther and filament. Pollination (flower sex) results from the sperm of flowers, male reproduction gametophytes (pollen) formed in anthers of flowers, being transferred onto the female stigma. The semen from the pollen fertilizes the egg cell and an embryo is formed. Of all the pollinators together, the 20,000 different species of bees are the most impactful in facilitating successful plant pollination. Bee PollinationForaging honeybees find large swaths of a single species of flower to collect during a trip. They are very efficient at mixing regurgitated nectar and pollen together to pack them into pellets on their hind legs via tiny hairs. These pollen pellets come in an array of colors such as yellow, red, orange, purple, and green, depending on the flowers pollinated. The rainbow of collected flower sperm is taken back to the hive for food. Collected from individual species from varying environments that affect volatile and nutritional compounds, these unique pollen grains with their Parts of a flower62 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to Topdistinctive DNA can help to identify historical ecological and paleontological histories. Bee collected pollen brought back to the hive is mixed with honey and digestive system enzymes which partially ferment the pollen through lactic acid fermentation for long term preservation and storage in wax comb cells. This partially fermented pollen mixture, effectively called \"bee bread,\" is used by nurse bees to feed honeybee larvae once hatched, and to feed young worker bees which produce royal jelly. Royal jelly is then in turn used to cradle eggs and to feed queen bees through their entire lifespan. Many varied sources declare unsubstantiated claims that pollen is \"the only complete food.\" Since environmental aspects change the composition of pollen from species to species, nutritional content also varies. Proteins can range from 7.5% to 35% as well as containing various proteins, flavonoids, minerals, fatty acids, and trace elements. Even still, some pollen types such pine ( Pinus spp.) and eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus spp.) are nutritionally insufficient even for the raising of honeybee larvae. 1 Bee Pollen and Bee Bread Although it is true that all amino acids essen - tial to human life are present in pollen, some more so in \"bee bread\" versus fresh pollen, it is only sufficient to be used as a food supplement, not a primary source. As a food supplement added to diets, pollen has shown to improve positive weight gain and overall health. 2 For example, bee pollen \"improved semen quality, increased fertility percentage, improved bio - chemical profiles of blood and helps outstand - ing of (rabbit) bucks...increased body weight gain and survival rate and reduced feed intake and feed conversion ratio of offspring.\" 3 Bees store the \"bee bread\" (fermented pollen) scattered throughout brood combs (the baby nursery) to facilitate easy access to nurse bees feeding the young larvae. Thus, harvesting \"bee bread\" from the colony needs to only occur from older brood combs that the bees have abandoned and no longer use. Since pollen traps collecting pollen prior to hive entry can possibly negatively impact colony growth, sustainable harvesting of pollen from abandoned brood comb contributes to low and only seasonal availability. 4 The use of raw local honey, due to the small quantities of pollen, purportedly helps to relieve allergies according to community folklore. However, only anecdotal evidence through community experiences exists rather than actual scientific evidence. Yet, if you would like to try to use honey for this purported purpose, obtain local raw honey with the pollen intact as each ecological area and season is unique. There have been many short-term studies on the benefit of using bee pollen which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory The Making of Bee Bread continued Spring 2021.1 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal63 \u00a9 Copyright as well as hepatoprotective properties.8,9,10 In addition, wound healing, especially burns, is aided using bee pollen according to some studies.11,12 Bee pollen extracts can even lower blood cholesterol levels and thus possibly improve nearsightedness in people with clogged arteries. 13,14,15 Do you have hot flashes and menopausal symptoms? Perhaps bee pollen could help alleviate some of those uncomfortable symptoms. 6,16 However, all of these benefits have only been researched through short term studies. \"The only long-term observations on the medicinal effect of pollen are related to prostate problems and allergies. Several decades of observations in Western European countries and a few clinical tests have shown pollen to be effective in treating prostate problems ranging from infections and swelling to cancer 17,18,19 (Denis, 1966 and Ask-Upmark, 1967).

Ingredients: \u00bc cup of carrot seed ( Make: 1. In a bowl, combine the honey, bee bread, and bee propolis tincture. Use the back of a spoon to crush the bee pollen granules into a powder. Stir together as best as possible. 2. In a double boiler, combine the carrot seed oil, calendula herbal oil, and beeswax. Heat and stir slowly. Heat until the beeswax is melted, and the mixture is combined. 3. Once the mixture is slightly cooled, after two - five minutes (do not let the mixture harden), then add in the honey, propolis, and bee bread mixture. 4. Next, add in the essential oils. Whisk the mixture together thoroughly to emulsify the blend. 5. Finally, pour the mixture into four 1-oz. tins and refrigerate to prevent separation.To Use: Apply sparingly to the face up to three times daily as a facial moisturizer. In addition, if the graininess and stickiness is undesirable, this can be used as a mask with a hot steamy towel. Let sit until the towel cools and then wipe off. Rinse afterwards with cool water and moisturize. Cautions: Please see box on this page. *The recipe for bee propolis tincture was featured in the NAHA Winter Journal 2020.4.Cautions for using pollen and bee products Since pollen and bee products can be highly allergenic, as a precaution, users should try small quantities of any bee products before using in regularly prescribed dosages. Also, those breastfeeding or pregnant should avoid using pollen as a supplement or food additive. Bee pollen may interact with medications such as warfarin, so consult a physician. In addition, adding pollen to wax coated gelatin capsules (size 0 or 00), which are stored in dark glass containers in a cool environment, can lower the risk of allergenic incidences. If such is used, it is best to keep the pollen refrigerated and use within 180 days. 2164 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopThe Making of Bee Bread continued 5.

There is some evidence that ingested pollen can protect animals as well as humans against the adverse effects of x-ray radiation treatments (Wang et al., 1984; Hernuss et al., 1975, as cited in Schmidt and Buchmann, 1992).\" 20 For such prescribed treatments, bee- gathered pollen and bee bread are best to use versus just using flower-derived pollen. The bee-produced enzyme glucose oxidase, added to the regurgitated nectar and pollen, increases the overall holistic value. 1 Much commercially available pollen is machine collected from wind pollinated plants which release large quantities of dry pollen rather than collected by bees and harvested. 2 Since pollen is a protein rich food, it loses its nutritional value very quickly if not stored properly in a dark and cool environment. Fresh pollen, such as hand or machine collected, can be stored at room temperature for a few days, and up to a year if frozen. However, the more enzyme-rich and more easily digestible lactic acid fermented \"bee bread\" has essentially an unending shelf life like honey. Keeping pollen raw, like honey, helps to keep the beneficial properties intact.Spring 2021.1 NAHA's Aromatherapy Yi-Jia Lou. \"A steroid fraction of chloroform extract from bee pollen of Brassica campestris induces human 20.

Many think from a top-down approach, that somehow humans are the ultimate beings and rule the world, rather than the fact that humans evolved as part of the elegant web of life as we know it. For example, our long, beautiful ancestry provides clues to our own use of plants. Understanding the sense of smell unfolds an elaborate and intertwined history that showcases the deeply connected unifica - tion between humans and the world around them. And t he power of scent impacts the hu - man body and mind as we continue to evolve. Non-Seed Plant Aromatherapy: Bryophytes Dr. DorothyBelle Poli Professor of Biology at Roanoke College, Certified Aromatherapist beginnings. Those ancestral smell-reactions are key to our health and reproductive success. Some smells directly impact our sympathetic nervous system and cause us to relax; others cause us to go on high alert. Aromatherapy currently focuses on the angiosperms (flowering plants) and the gymnosperms (conifers). Of course, when you think of plants and aroma, the flowering plants are the first to come to mind. 2 The appearance of flowers often elucidates an emotional response in us.3 But beautiful flowers have learned how to manipulate their environments (and us) for the sake of their own reproduction. Scent is a powerful force for this need - reward the insect and bird who visits and lure the mammal, all to move pollen to the next flower 4-8 or to move the resultant fruit.9 And any nature lover will tell you that the scent of the forest, full of pines, junipers, and cedar trees and their soils, provides a sense of instant calm. Yet, plants have been around much longer that those most recent family members. Bryophytes (liverworts, hornworts, and mosses), ferns, and lycophytes are much older than Homo sapiens. This means that humans have always been surrounded by more than just obviously scented plants. Should we not have a relationship with all plants? Do all plants have a scent to have a relationship with?Smells alert us to our immediate environment: Yum! Mom's famous pie is cooking. Gross! Something died close by. Skunk! Ew, that leftover Chinese food may make me ill. We have all done a double take, breathing deeply, when someone walks by us who smells good. 1 Behavioral reactions to scent are learned (mom's pie for example) but others are from deep connections to our animal 72 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopNon-Seed Plant Aromatherapy continued Interestingly, I have taught plant evolution for decades and yet have not truly thought about when \"scent\" evolved. Every phylogenetic clade I have shown in class is missing the idea of scent (I went back and checked all my resources). As a plant biologist, I am aware that all plants have hairs and specialty organs that express essential oils. For example, details like the cellular oil bodies are used to identify whole groups of liverworts. So, I began to explore what was understood regarding human use of essential oils in non-seed plants. But I needed to remember that less than half of 1% of the 265,000 flowering species have been exhaustively studied for their medicinal value 10 and that means even less has been done on the non-flowering plants! Where are these more primitive plants in aromatherapy education? What is known about them? Are they ignored because of lack of smell or just overlooked? This article is the first in a series to explore just that.Bryophytes: The Liverworts, Hornworts, and Mosses Bryophytes are Together these plants make up about 24,000 species worldwide. The plants are small, often on the sides of trees, rocks, or on the bank of a stream. Being fantastic bioindicators, their presence informs us of a relatively clean environment. You immediately notice that these diverse plants are rarely ravaged by insects or other animals in nature. And it is rare to find them decaying from a fungal or bacterial invasion. Upon further investigation, bryophytes are not damaged by snails or slugs either. 11 Surely, with talents like these, the bryophytes should have essential oils that are useful to humans ? But even in my most intimate moments with bryophytes (often on my belly on wet ground), I cannot remember distinct scents standing out to me even though they are reported to showcase a broad range of sweet, pungent, or bitter aromas when crushed. 11 Traditional Use The literature reports that numerous cultures have used bryophytes for better living. Often these plants are dried and crushed into a powder. Lipophilic terpenoids are constituted in the oil bodies of liverworts and have been compared to the stink bug . 12 Once added to ointments, lotions, and into teas, their main medicinal use is for skin concerns. 13 Chinese medicine has been found to use twenty-two mosses and five liverworts in a broad set of applications including burns and scalds, bruises, external wounds, pulmonary Mixed bryophytes to TopNon-Seed Plant Aromatherapy continued needs, and pneumonia.14 American Civil War soldiers knew how to stuff moss into gunshot wounds to plug the initial hole and to keep the wound clean. The Materia Medica discusses liverworts being beneficial to the liver simply because the thallus resembles the liver's lobes. Interestingly, the hornworts (the least diverse of the three groups with only 300 species) are not mentioned in the literature. This may be due to very small populations which often results in being overlooked in their habitat. Chemical ComponentsSimilar components are found in bryophytes that are common in the regular aromatherapy arsenal. For example, bornyl acetate and cinnamate are shown to even exist in different chemotypes of do not possess a cuticle, so their direct interaction with the environment dictates a lot about their internal chemistry. Wiesnerella denudate, a common thalloid liverwort in Asia, is a true chemotype suspect since the components change dramatically when you compare specimen from Borneo and Japan. 16-17 In addition, some plants can be problematic. Frullania, a leafy liverwort, will cause contact dermatitis has long-chain alkylphenols that cause severe skin issues. 20 But the chemistry of liverworts and mosses shows similar properties as our beloved angiosperms: Cytotoxicity against cancer cells, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticides, antioxidants, neurotropic, muscle relaxing, and more (for a review 21). It should also be noted that only about 5% of bryophytes have been studied chemically with most of their components (80%) being lipophilic terpenoids and aromatic compounds. 22 But exploring \"essential oils in bryophytes\" revealed limited to no research depending on how you interpret the papers. I was not shocked by this. Bryophytes, especially the mosses, are hard to identify since they are small and tend to have two sight-types (one when hydrated and one when desiccated). Worldwide, there are only about 300 people who study this group of plants professionally. Researchers tend to look at numerous research angles with them, but few of us are chemists that like to explore botany, rather we are botanists who use chemistry. It was only after teaching a recent class about genetics that it dawned on me why secondary compounds discussed as essential oils are not studied much in bryophytes. It is rare to find large patches of these plants in places. They do not grow well in greenhouses or on farms due Mixed mosses with flower \u00a9 2021 NAHA Return to TopNon-Seed Plant Aromatherapy continued to symbiotic microbe soil interactions rarely understood in the literature. They are slow growers that have unique relationships with other species of bryophytes in nature. There - fore, to make essential oils from this group of plants you would decimate populations! As a result, analytical chemists have been trying to determine which chemicals bryophytes possess so science could manufacture synthetic ver - sions of the prize compounds. Table 1: Examples of some medicinal properties found in bryophytes (modified 22) Liverworts Mosses Antifungal AntihepaticAntimicrobialAntipyreticAntisepticExternal woundsBruisesAntihypertensiveAntiphlogisticAntipyreticBleedingDiureticExternal woundsSedative Conclusions The obvious was there and yet, I was unable to see it. It is not that the liverworts, hornworts, and mosses are missing from aromatherapy. It is not that this group of plants do not possess excellent opportunity for human health and well-being. T o use them would eliminate a precious resource. I will always be impressed by the vast amounts of plant material necessary to distill to acquire essential oils. Sustainability is not possible to use the bryophytes responsibly. They have unique symbiotic relationships with their environments. We must remember that whole populations are merely five meters across or may produce a chemotype in a single location. But their potential is as limitless as any other species. All plants have aromatic compounds. All have developed their own chemical arsenal to combat the world from which they cannot run. Take time to get on your belly and learn the bryophytes in your area today! References: 1.

It is important to keep in mind that even though aromatherapy is 'natural' and can be beneficial, it is not risk free. This is because essential oils are highly concentrated substances. 2 Each oil has its own unique chemical composition that affects its scent and leads to variances in physiologic and psychologic effects. 3,4 As aromatherapy continues to become more accepted in the pediatric population, it is imperative that one understands how essential oils impact children, considerations to using essentials oils, and safety concerns. In 2001, a study in South West England reported Complementary and Alternativ e Medicine (CAM) use to be 17.9% in children under sixteen years old, with aromatherapy being the second most used. 5 Through the years, studies across the globe have reported increases in CAM use among the pediatric population, ranging from 41% to 71.4%. Aromatherapy continued to be one of the most used non-medicinal CAM practices. Other non-medicinal CAM practices included chiropractic, naturopathy, Traditional Chinese therapies, acupuncture, iridology, therapeutic massage, reflexology, Buteyko breathing, kinesiology, reiki, hypnosis, special exercises or modified diet, faith healing, and relaxation. 6-8 The odds of CAM being used in children increased by 1.4 for every 5-year increase in age. Children who had poor or fair health were 2.1 times more like to use CAM and 9.4 times more likely if their parents used CAM. 6 Reasons that caregivers gave for using CAM included dissatisfaction with conventional medicine, fear of side-effects of conventional medicine, and having a child with a chronic condition. Caregivers reported that CAM often helped their child's condition. 5 The most common conditions for CAM use included general health, cold/cough/flu symptoms, dietary supplement, eczema/skin conditions, gastrointestinal symptoms, TopAromatherapy and Children continued musculoskeletal symptoms, asthma/ respiratory symptoms.7 For those that did not use CAM the main reasons included: don't know enough about it don't think it is necessary don't believe in it not available to them can't afford it concerned about safety doctor warned against using it worried about side effects from mixing with other treatments. 6 CAM was self-initiated between 74% and 86% of the time based on the recommendation from a parent, caregiver, family or friend. 6-8 Only 6% of the time did the recommendation come from doctors and 14% of the time it came from CAM practitioners. 8 Other sources of information included health food stores, pharmacies, books, and magazines. 6 Even though information did not frequently come from practitioners, it was reported that the highest trusted sources of information were health care providers, CAM providers and family. 6 As research findings continue to demonstrate positive benefits in children, western medicine and alternative practitioners need to continue to bring together these practices through improved communication and education. 6,8 Parents will continue to use CAM as an alternative way to improve and maintain health in their children. 7 Conlon et al demonstrated it is possible to successfully and safely bring the use of essential oils into a hospital system using an evidence-based practice process. Their evaluation of the implementation of essential oil use found that there were individual differences in preferences and the effectiveness of essential oils, but clinical aromatherapy was positively received by many patients and healthcare workers. Positive feedback from families and children included that they liked having access to essential oils and some were surprised that it relieved their symptoms when used alone or in combination with medications. Several patients stated they continued to use aromatherapy at home and patients who were frequently admitted would ask for essential oils on admission. Many patients and families asked for more scents to be available. There were some negative comments. It was reported that some children did not want to try the essential oils, aromatherapy didn't work every time, and a few said it made them nauseous. This study also highlights the need to accommodate individual preferences when using aromatherapy. 3Spring 2021.1 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal79 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopAromatherapy and Children continued Essential Oil Use in Children When using aromatherapy with children it is important to keep in mind that essential oils are not medicines and that kids are not small adults. Medications are defined as a substance used for medical treatment. As defined above, aromatherapy is a way to heal the mind, body, and spirit. 1 As parents can be more nervous when using essential oils with their child, they may ask for very prescriptive directions and request detailed information on efficacy and safety. It is important to be clear that while there is evidence for use, there is limited, conflicting information and variations in expert opinion, especially for use in children. Most information comes from adults and while many concepts are the same, there are different considerations especially as it relates to odor preferences and response, topical use and dilutions, and safety considerations. Of note, this article does not address ingestion of essential oils. Odor Preferences and Response From the time of birth, aromatherapy is a natural thing to a child. Babies identify mothers through smell and their early life revolves around smell and touch. A familiar scent can be compared to a \"favorite blanket\" as a way to calm a child and bring about security. 9 However children can be extremely sensitive to smell and often have different odor preferences compared to adults. 9,10 Culture, developmental stage, experience and personal preference can strongly influence odor perception and effects. 4,10 Effects of inhaling aromas include alterations in mood, cognition, physiology and behavior/performance. The two main theories on this are the pharmacological hypothesis and the psychological hypothesis . The pharmacological hypothesis is based on aromatic compounds having direct effect on the autonomic and central nervous system and/or endocrine system. As the compounds would need to get into the blood stream via nasal or lung mucosa, this hypothesis isn't as well supported as the psychological hypothesis as it relates to inhalation of essential oils. The psychological hypothesis is that \"odors exert their effects through emotional learning, conscious perception, and belief/expectation.\" 4 If an odor is thought to be pleasant, it can have both emotional (e.g., improve mood, decrease anxiety) and physiologic effects (e.g., reduce pain). 4,10 These responses to odors are learned through experiences with an odor. This experience/response relationship with the odor will ultimately influence future effects when exposed to that scent. 4 This is important to be aware of when using essential oils in children, because they are still developing their experience/response relationship with odors. For example, if you use lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) every time a child was in time-out and only for time-out, it is possible that the child forms a negative relationship such as sadness and getting into trouble with lavender (Lavandula angustifolia). Years later, if this negative relationship was formed and lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is suggested for calming and sleep, it likely will not work. Instead of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) being relaxing in this person, it may bring about sadness and negative emotional and physiologic effects. The more exposure to an odor and the better a person can identify the odor, the stronger the experience/response relationship will likely be to that odor. 1180 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopInterestingly, Willander et al studied how memories are tied to the senses and if odor, visual and verbal triggers brought back memories from different ages. This study found that compared to visual evoked memories, odor evoked memories brought on a stronger feeling of being brought back in time. The odor also seemed to bring back older memories, specifically from ages six to ten years old. Verbal and visual cues typically brought back memories from ages eleven to twenty years old. 12 Thus it appears that odor response/experience relationships are strongly developing in children between the ages of six to ten years old. It is important to instill positive experiences with inhalation of essential oils during childhood, because this will strongly influence odor evoked memories and ultimately emotional and physiologic effects into adulthood. Children tend to be willing to try aromatherapy as an option and many perceive it as an acceptable and appealing option. 3,10 If an essential oil is suggested for a child and is considered unappealing it will likely lead to a negative emotional or physiologic response. 4,10 Children will have differing preferences in odor compared to adults. Adult studies often report a preference for lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), while in children lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) was often rated low. 10 A study looking at children's acceptance of various essential oils found differences by ethnic group and gender. The essential oils included ginger ( Zingiber (Mentha spicata) orange were preferred and among non-Latinos, lemon (Citrus \u00d7 limon) and sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) were most preferred. Amongst all children, ginger (Zingiber officinale) and lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) were rarely selected. More information is needed on children's preferences for blended essential oils. 10 When using essential oils in children, allowing a choice or two can be advantageous. 9 Too many choices may overwhelm a child. It is important to never insist that a child must use aromatherapy if they refuse. Forcing aromatherapy can lead to negative effects immediately and unpleasant memory associations into adulthood. 4,10,12 Topical Use and Dilution The skin provides a barrier between a person and the environment around them.13 Premature infants do not have a fully developed skin barrier and are at increased risk of substances, including essential oils, being absorbed through the skin and causing systemic toxicity. In addition, they are more susceptible to skin damage. 13,14 For most premature infants, the skin barrier matures over two to four weeks and has barrier properties comparable to adults. 13 In full term infants the skin seems to be fully developed. 14 Even with a fully developed skin Aromatherapy and Children continued Lemon (Citrus \u00d7 limon)Spring 2021.1 to TopAromatherapy and Children continued barrier, the risk of toxicity from a substance being absorbed through the skin is strongly considered before using a product in children. Most cases of toxicity from topical absorption are reported in newborns. H owever, cases have been reported in infants and children. If a compound is absorbed, children, especially infants, are at higher risk for toxicity because of a higher surface area-to-weight ratio and immature drug metabolism. 13 In addition to systemic toxicity, babies up to three months old theoretically are at greater risk for skin sensitivity from substances. Frequent exposure to substances may also put a child at risk of skin allergies later on. 15 These concerns have led to conflicting suggestions on the appropriate age and dilution for using essential oils topically in children. 2,9,15,16 It is ultimately the parent's choice to use essential oils in their child. For young children, it is prudent to try carrier oils first. If essential oils are used, then start with the lowest suggested dilution. If no negative effects occur, then increase the dilution by one drop at a time until an optimal response or the maximum concentration is reached. Table 1 compares concentrations for babies and children as suggested in the books by Tisserand, Buckle and Worwood. Table 2 lists how to make suggested concentrations. As in adults, lower concentrations should be considered for chronic issues, while higher dilutions may be used for acute situations and for a short duration. 2,9,15,16 These should be taken as general guidelines and may not be appropriate in every child. Table 1: Concentrations* for Babies and Children Age Tisserand,** 2014 Recommended (Maximum)Buckle, 2015 Worwood, 2000*** Minimum to Maximum Newborn/1 month (5%) 1% to 5% 1 - 2% *Concentrations are suggested in each reference as recommended unless using essential oils for specific indications. **Per Tisserand - \"These concentrations are not research-based, and should be taken as helpful suggestions rather than absolute rules.

In children under five years of age, essential oils were one of the top twenty-five substance categories most frequently involved in pediatric exposures at 1.61% of all exposures. Regardless of age, the total number of essential oils reported as single exposure totaled 22,068. Tea tree ( Of all the exposures: 15,249 (69.1%) were in children under five years of age 853 (3.9%) in children 6-12 years old 553 (2.5%) in 13 to 19 years old 20,781 (94.2%) of all exposures were unintentional 597 (2.7%) were intentional 113 (0.5%) were other 514 (2.3%) were adverse reactions. None of the exposures lead to death and 184 (0.8%) were considered more serious outcomes and classified as a moderate and major outcome. 17 Essential oils containing 1,8 cineole (e.g., eucalyptus ( (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) known to cause toxicity in children.* 1,8 cineole has been shown to cause seizures and has caused breathing two other essential oils to avoid in children. Toxicity associated with camphor (Cinnamomum camphora ) essential oil may include nausea, vomiting, vertigo, headache, altered mental status, seizures, and hepatoxicity. This usually happens if ingested, however they can occur from inhalation or topical application. Wintergreen ( Gaultheria procumbens) essential oil can be absorbed when applied topically especially if the skin is inflamed or broken. It contains salicylate and if absorbed will cause salicylate (aka aspirin) toxicity in children. 19 These essential oils and chemical components should be avoided since it is unknown at what age and how much of the essential oil will cause negative consequences in children. *Editor's Note: 1,8 cineole and menthol containing essential oils can be safely used as a minor percentage in a professionally formulated, properly diluted essential oil blend without being harmful. Please seek the advice of a professional aromatherapist if you are unsure about a certain essential oil blend before use.Spring 2021.1 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal83 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopEven if using an essential oil not known to cause toxicity in children there are general safety recommendations that should be followed found in Table 3. It is also important to follow general safety considerations as well (Table 3). Aromatherapy and Children continued Table 3: General Safety Considerations for Essential Oil Use in Children* Pediatric Safety Considerations Overall Safety Considerations Ensure the essential oils used are safe to use in children. Monitor for paradoxical effects when using essential oils in children. Do not use essential oils unless a health condition requires it. Do not add undiluted essential oils to a child's bath. Do not put essential oils near or on a child's face. Do not apply essential oils directly into the nose of a child. Keep strong essential oil vapors away from children less than six years old. Keep all essential oils out of reach of children as they can be poisonous if swallowed. Call the Poison Help Line: 1-800-222-1222 if you suspect that a child ingested essential oils. Dilute essential oils in carriers before using them on the skin. Avoid sunlight or tanning bed rays for up to eighteen hours after applying a phototoxic essential oil. Do not apply essential oils in or around eyes, ears, or other orifices. If an essential oil contacts the eye, wash hands and put carrier oil on a paper towel and gently wipe eye. Repeat as necessary. If needed, flush with saline solution. If irritation continues, seek medical advice. Use caution in people vulnerable to seizures. Use caution in people with asthma, seasonal or skin allergies, multiple chemical sensitivities or who have had allergic reactions to perfumes. Use essential oils cautiously during pregnancy and breastfeeding. If an aroma is known to trigger a headache, it should be avoided. Consult with an expert prior to using essential oils during cancer treatment. Consult with an expert to ensure there are no drug interactions with a person's 2021 NAHA Return to TopSummary The use of essential oils continues to increase in children. Most parents and children get their information from a parent, caregiver, family or friend. It is important to keep in mind that using essential oils in children has additional considerations compared to using them in adults. Children have different preferences in odor. Children tend to prefer citruses and, from my own experience, have also enjoyed some floral essential oils. When using essential oils for inhalation it is important to use them during positive experiences as they are developing their odor response/experience relationship throughout childhood. This response/experience relationship will ultimately influence memories and emotional and physiologic effects into adulthood. When using topically, there is conflicting information on the appropriate age and dilution for using essential oils in children. Ensure that general safety considerations as well as those specific to children are followed. And always keep in mind that it is ultimately the parent's and child's choice whether or not to use aromatherapy. References: 1. NAHA. National Association of Holistic Aromatherapy .

Answer: A major constituent of several commonly used eucalyptus species is 1,8 cineol, and menthol is a major constituent of peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) essential oil. It is true that essential oils which contain a high percentage of 1,8 cineole and/or menthol should not be applied to the faces of infants and children. While it's also true that caution is advised, the skillful use of these essential oils can be quite beneficial, especially for respiratory illness and disease. If eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus spp.) and peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) essential oils' adverse event reports are examined, it will quickly become apparent that these events are the direct result of indiscriminate use. Using a professionally formulated, properly diluted essential oil blend which includes eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus spp.) and peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) essential oils in minor percentages is quite different than indiscriminately using these single essential oils. The recommended use level for pure eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus spp.) in products intended for children aged three years and up is approximately 1% diluted in carrier, depending on the expert safety source consulted. Let's use Eucalyptus radiata essential oil as an example. This species contains an average of 60-70% 1,8 cineole. If 'Sample Blend A' contained 10% of Eucalyptus radiata essential oil and then it was to be diluted to 2% in carrier oil, the resulting blend would contain only 0.2% eucalyptus essential oil and a maximum 0.14% of 1,8 cineole which is well within accepted safety recommendations. The recommended use level for pure peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) essential oil in products intended for children age d three years and up is approximately 0.5% diluted in carrier, depending on the expert safety source Ask a Professional Aromatherapist By Annette Davis, NAHA President Certified Clinical Aromatherapist Nutritionist and Natural Products Formulator 86 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopAsk a Professional continued consulted. Let's use peppermint ( Mentha \u00d7 piperita) essential oil as an example. This species contains an average of 30-50% menthol. If 'Sample Mentha \u00d7 piperita) essential oil and then it was to be diluted to 2% in carrier oil, the resulting blend would contain only 0.02% peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) essential oil and a maximum of 0.01% menthol which is well within accepted safety recommendations. It should be noted that respiratory disease is a leading cause of death in children worldwide. Safe and effective children's products containing 1,8 cineole and menthol have been on the market for hundreds of years and many studies attest to their safety and efficacy when used in responsible doses. Even water can kill if used irresponsibly. Why would we completely avoid the safe and effective use of essential oils which can help with respiratory disease, just because we have to be mindful of their safety guidelines? That line of reasoning is absurd and could be compared to advising parents against bathing their children in water.

In business it is important to have all formulas ready for easy duplication and scaling up, as well as creating consistently safe products, accurate labeling, and verifiable percentages of essential oils in a finished product. Volume measurements simply will not accomplish all these important objectives as well as using a scale can. I know there are many who will disagree with me but hear me out. If you don't know me, I also started really small with a micro home business that exploded into a significant small business. I simply cannot overstate the value of being able to scale up. I started in my kitchen and built a multi-million-dollar company. When I started, I never imagine that the one jar at a time business would some day make that same formula in 50-, 200-, 500-, and 1000-gallon tanks of products on a regular basis. But it did and I thoroughly learned the importance of formulating with scaling up in mind. Also, if you want to pass your business down to your family, or sell it onto someone else, in the future, you will need trackable, accurate, and measurable Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in place. In addition, if you decide to work with someone to private label your product, they will either require that your formula be standardized, or they will charge you to take the time to standardize your formula. I get handed recipes in drops and tablespoons with a dash of weight measurements all the time to duplicate. The first thing I have to do is weigh out all the various measurements and convert them into grams. We can't even quote a project that comes to us in inconsistent and/or volume measurements. The Problem with DroppersDroppers vary enough to make a significant impact on a blend when you upscale your production. In formulation I always assume that what I am creating will become a huge seller and require large scale production. I like to formulate once instead of having to come back to a formula to determine weights and volume conversions for manufacturing with a scale. Why duplicate your efforts? Another issue with droppers is that you can get a different measurement from droppers even with the same bottle of essential oil and the same dropper. Why? Because the angle at which you hold the dropper, air bubbles, 90 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopMeasurements for Aromatherapy Formulations continued accuracy of pressure on the bulb, and human error can all impact the size of each drop. Even if you measure in drops and then write your formulas in percentages the variation of weight of each essential oil can impact your formula when you switch from volume to weight measurements to upscale production. Drops are simply not accurate and volume measurements are for small scale production. Think big. It is really easy to tell yourself that you are just making a tiny batch and skip the scale. I hope to talk you out of that idea. The Problems with VolumeLet's talk about viscosity. Viscosity is a material's resistance to flow. Oh boy, are there differences in flow between essential oils! The viscosity of an essential oil will dramatically change the size of your drop. Look at the example of a thin drop of sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis L.) essential oil next to a thick drop of vetiver (Vetiveria zizanoides) essential oil. And some prunastri L.) and vanilla ( Vanilla planifolia) are so thick that they cannot even enter the vessel of the dropper. Let's talk about density because it is a key player in the art of formulation. Density is the degree of compactness of a substance\u2014it measures how tightly packed a material is within unit of volume measurement. In other words, density is the ratio between the mass and the volume of a material. The formula is mass divided by volume. Water is the gold standard for measuring because it has the density measurement of 1 in one cubic centimeter. As we all know, essential oils are hydrophobic, so water is an easy way to visually see density in action. Hydrophobic literally breaks down to water fearing. Hydrophobic materials repel themselves from water. Most essential oils are less dense than water, however a few are denser than water. The essential oils that are less dense than water will float to the top and then ones that are denser than water will sink to the bottom of water. Vanilla (Vanilla planifolia) absolute is denser than water, so it sinks to the bottom, whereas sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L.) essential oil is less dense than water and floats to the top. Reasons not to measure essential oils by drops or volume Scaling formulas . You will never count hundreds or thousands of drops. You are going to need every formula in weight in order to scale up. Variations of droppers and viscosity of essential oils. Variations of density. Human error. I guarantee that losing count or missing counting a drop can and will happen. Duplication of formula is essential in business. Consistent methods of measurements. For instance, if your formula uses vanilla absolute and sweet orange essential oil it could not be measured in drops because vanilla absolute will not go through a dropper. The variation of measurement standards can result in inaccurate labeling. Accurate percentages for safety are best determined when the entire formula uses a scale.Spring 2021.1 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal91 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopMeasurements for Aromatherapy Formulations continued Get a good scale. Or two. Or three. Scales are essential to your business. I personally use what I call my baby scale, momma scale, and pappa scale. My baby scale is what I use to formulate essential oils, terpenes, and premium ingredients that go into a formula at low percentages in the formulation phase of developing a formula. My baby scale measures from 0.01 to 500 grams. The momma scale normally goes to work on all the other ingredients in the formulation phase. My momma scale goes from 0.1 grams to 2600 grams. The pappa scale is what we use for production and measures from 0.1 to 11000 grams. As our company grows, I am sure we will continue to invest in scales with larger capacities. It is vital to check the accuracy of your scale often. Get them balanced. Every scale comes with directions on how to balance your scale. Check your scales often to keep them accurate. Essential Oil Number of Drops Amount in Grams: Test 1Amount in Grams 0.43 If I was writing a formula in percentages from drops it would not be an accurate measurement when I convert to using the scale. Essential Oil Drops as a PercentageGrams as a Percentage: Test 1Grams as a Percentage: Tests A formula written in drops cannot accurately be converted to percentages that will also work in weights. 20 drops of sweet orange essential oil do not weigh the same as 20 drops of patchouli (Pogostemon cablin) essential oil or 20 drops of vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides) essential oil. Let me show you some examples that demonstrate this. Editor's Note: Readers will note that aromatherapy blend recipes listed in the NAHA Aromatherapy Journal are usually given in drops or volume weight due to the small size of the aromatherapy blend recipe and expected use. If you are making the same aromatherapy blend recipe on a commercial scale, you may want to consider formulating your aromatherapy blend recipe by weight as is suggested in this article.92 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopEssential Oil Amount in Volume Amount in Grams Sweet Orange ( Citrus sinensis L.) 1 4.68 As you can see the weights are significantly different. If we use percentages, it is even more of a dramatic difference. Essential Oils Volume as a Percentage Grams as a Percentage Sweet Orange ( these results is: Essential Oil Drops as a PercentageDrops/grams: Test 1Drops/grams : Test 2Teaspoon/grams Test Formulations continued Let's look at the same essential oils measured in teaspoons to see if more accurate volume measurements will get better results. Drops, Weight or Percentage? I did an informal poll on Facebook while I was writing this article which showed that there are people firmly in the \"drops\" camp, some people in the \"weights\" camp, and others in the \"percentages\" camp. I am in the most accurate measurements camp and the tables above show weighing material is the most accurate measurement. From there you should also look at the formula in percentages that are developed from the weight measurements. In my company we have created a spreadsheet for me to formulate in that has a space for grams which automatically tells me percentages and has a column to scale the formula up as well. We created this form from day one of business and everything goes into it.

JennScentsAromaversity.com Spring 2021.1 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal95 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopMaximizing Content Planning and Web Tools for Your Business By Haleigh Fioravanti As a reader of the NAHA Aromatherapy Journal, it probably is reasonable to assume that you are a creative first and an en - trepreneur second. I know this is definitely the case for me : Let someone else do all the \"busi - ness stuff,\" and \"I'll just be over here making!\" Unfortunately, we don't always have the luxury to outsource all that \"business stuff\" as small business owners. Most of us wear a lot of hats, and being the maker, sales manager, social media manager and bookkeeper can become overwhelming. Luckily, there are some amazing content planning and web tools available that can help you manage your time and maximize the outcome. There are a lot of tools out there, so I'm only going to share a popular few that I've had great success using. Marketing Tools As a marketer, I truly believe that marketing is the essence of any business. How are people going to know that your product or service exists without marketing? You might have the most amazing product or service, but without good photography, design, social media presence and strategy, a potential customer could choose your competitor over you. So, what do you need to start marketing successfully? Here are my tips: Canva : In need of a stunning logo, Instagram graphic or blog banner? Canva does it all for you with their gorgeous templates! All you have to do is drag and drop in the photos and elements of your choosing. Hootsuite: If you are active on several different social media platforms, you need one single dashboard that allows you to view, manage and schedule all of your social media accounts. Hootsuite is a platform that does just that, so why are you still hopping from platform to platform? Planoly : Want to know how people create visually pleasing Instagram grids? It's because of platforms like Planoly . I'm partial to Instagram because I'm a visual person. Instagram is also where my target audience is. I use Planoly to visually plan, manage and 96 Aromatherapy Journal Spring 2021.1 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopMaximizing Content Planning and Web Tools continued schedule all my Instagram static posts and stories. Planoly also offers suggested post times and advanced analytics to maximize the best time to market those amazing creations! Email Marketing: If you don't have an email list, it's time to start building one. This is probably the single most important asset for any business because this is where you have direct access to your customers and potential customers! These are your people! Mailchimp , Benchmark and Flodesk are some of the more popular platforms that offer free limited plans and gorgeous templates to start using email to market. Project ManagementMost small business owners juggle several projects at a time, and without sufficient tools and proper planning, things can get pretty chaotic. By implementing project management software, you can improve scheduling, easily collaborate with others, and enhance productivity! Here are a couple of my favorites: Google Workspace: Most folks are already using Gmail, so why not take advantage of Google Workspace (formerly known as G Suite)? This platform offers everything you could need as a small business owner: C ustom email, calendar, chat, a drive for file storage and file sharing, Google Docs, Google Spread - sheets, and so much more! Google Workspace doesn't exactly have a project management software, but you can create your own project plans and timeline in Google Sheets. This op - tion can be limiting for some people, but it is great for those who are just starting out. Asana : Asana allows you to build, manage and track projects. This is a really popular project management software, and it is kind of that next step when you feel limited by Google Workspace and need something a little more automated with a focus on team-based projects. Customer Relationship ManagementCustomer Relationship Management (CRM ) software can help you to improve customer service, customer satisfaction, increase sales and market your products and services! Doesn't that sound nice? This is the CRM platform that I use: HubSpot : This platform is quite literally the hub for all your marketing and sales needs. You can create and organize content for all your social media accounts, nurture leads and manage all of your customer contacts in just one place. The only way to scale your small business is to start utilizing the tools out there that are designed to do just that. Don't make being a business owner any harder than it already is. It is impossible to do it all on your own. Implementing just one of these tools could help you save time, improve your content, and increase your sales. Most of the tools I've Spring 2021.1 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal97 \u00a9 Copyright 2021 NAHA Return to TopMaximizing Content Planning continued listed have a limited free plan, so what are you waiting for? Start to grow your business with the myriad of technological tools designed to do just that. About Haleigh Fioravanti:Haleigh is a true Nashville Native\u2014a unicorn as some would say.

Flower Photo LibraryBy Valerie Cooksley, Texas Ingredients: 8-oz. (240 mL) floral water or herbal infusion (such lavender ( Lavandula 2 apple cider vinegar or homemade herbal vinegar Essential Oils: (optional) 4 drops lavender ( (Myrtus communis ) To Make the Herbal Infusion: Lavender floral water can be used, or you can make your own herbal infusion. Simply take fresh or dried flowers and herbs (from the examples given) and pour hot water over them, about 2 or 3 tablespoons per cup, to make a strong infusion. To Make the Herbal and Floral Vinegar: Pour apple cider vinegar into a wide-mouthed glass jar. To one quart of vinegar, add one to two handfuls of fresh-picked flowers and herbs. Set in the sun for a few weeks, shaking daily. Alternatively, gently heat the vinegar and add to the herbs and allow to steep for several days. Strain and bottle. To Make the Herbal Rinse: Combine the herbal infusion and vinegar together. Add essential oils (if using). To Use: After shampooing, pour the aromatic herbal rinse over your hair. Squeeze out excess or lightly rinse with water. If you wish to follow up with a conditioner, you may. However, this preparation leaves your hair smelling clean, fresh and feeling silky soft. Cautions: For adult use only. If adding essential oils, avoid use in pregnancy, with high blood pressure or with epilepsy. Valerie's Tips: Vinegar, diluted in herbal infusions or floral waters, helps to normalize the scalp's delicate pH balance and aids in toning the skin. It also successfully removes oil and shampoo residue from the hair.

Integrative Medicine is a time-tested medical protocol that merges the practices and philosophies of both conventional andalternative medicine to create a new para-digm for optimum health. Treatments are individualized to each patient's condition, and are developed to activate the body's natural healing processes.
