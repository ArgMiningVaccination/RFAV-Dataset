Laser is an acronym that stands for Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Low-level laser therapy, cold laser therapy, soft laser therapy, laser biostimulation, photobiomodulation, and laser phototherapy are all generic terms for the therapeutic application of a red-beam or near-infrared laser with a wavelength between 600 and 1000 nm and a power between 5 and 500 mW . Compared to traditional manual acupuncture, LA has multiple advantages, including ease of application, dose measurement precision, painlessness, and non-invasiveness. It is also quick, safe, and carries no risk of infection. Growing medical evidence indicates the viability of laser acupuncture as an alternative for weak patients, elderly patients, young patients, and patients who fear needles. Wavelength, dosage, procedure, and site of application are all factors that affect the efficacy of laser acupuncture. By finding the right combination of the individual underlying factors, more interest in the applicability of laser acupuncture can be generated. The laser I use in acupuncture treatments is produced by a Gallium Aluminum Arsenide (GaAlAs) semiconductor diode Laser Phototherapy Device. The laser handheld device itself is applied directly and perpendicularly to the skin surface. To avoid scattering the laser beam, slight pressure contact is made between the device and the patient's skin. Irradiation points include tendons, trigger points, Ashi points, acupuncture points, and pathognomonic points. The results of laser acupuncture on patients with musculoskeletal disorders, insomnia, dysmenorrhea, obesity and rhinitis are particularly promising. Laser acupuncture has proven to be very effective when applied to selected single points. The method of laser acupuncture for the treatment of these conditions will be introduced and the incredible clinical response discussed.

Shoulder pain includes Dislocations, frozen shoulder, fibromyalgia, tendinitis, rotator cuff tear, etc. Most of all, we often give patients with painkiller or rehabilitation, even with the operation. We also know painkiller will lead to GI upset. In some case, painkiller is no use fore shoulder pain patient. Method: Acupoint Nei Guan (PC6) is helpful to reduce shoulder pain. The patients came to our clinic, complained of shoulder pain. We had to check them at Ortho OPD, with the treatment of only pain release medicine. The orthoptist did not think more limitation. We arranged acupuncture with PC6 at OPD, twice or triple per week. The needle keeps for 30 minutes. If a patient complained of right pain, we use right PC6. The same is at left shoulder Result: We observe about 100 shoulder pain patients. We only use V AS (Visual Analogue Scale to evaluate our outcome. After receiving acupuncture of Nei Guan (PC6), the V AS decreased from 5-6 down to 1-3. And during the time of treatment, they did not take any painkiller by themselves. Besides, the Range of motion, including internal and external rotation, flexion and extension, of shoulder improved. The patients can do shoulder activity easily without painful sensation. Then patients can try to accept rehabilitation. Most of them avoid the side effect of medicine or surgery. Conclusion: Nei Guan (PC6) is located at 2 cun above the wrist crease between the tendon of palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis. The function of Nei Guan (PC6) is usually used for the Gastro-intestine problem, such as nausea, vomiting; chest pain; insomnia; anxiety; depression. In our clinical experience, Nei Guan (PC6) is also useful to knee pain. According to the theory of meridian of Chinese medicine, we can explain why Nei Guan (PC6) is helpful for shoulder pain relieving. terryyen1974@gmail.comChiaming Yen, Altern Integr Med 2017, (Suppl) Altern Integr Med, an open access journal October 24-26, 2017 October 24-26, 2017 | Dubai, UAE7th International Conference & Exhibition on TRADITIONAL & AL TERNATIVE MEDICINEPatients' characteristics and satisfaction on mobile medicine of traditional Chinese medicine at rural areas in Taiwan Chieh-Ying Chin1,2,3 1Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan 2Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taiwan 3China Medical University, Taiwan In Taiwan, the medical rural area is defined to the number of Chinese medicine (CM) physician is 1.8 for every 1 million population and the total CM physician is < 9 in a township. To promote the role of CM in the National Health Insurance (NHI) and protect the health of people in rural area, the National Union of Chinese Medical Doctors' Association encourages all teaching hospitals or clinics to take the mission by increasing the payment. To explore the accessibility and satisfaction of the CM care in the rural area, we use a questionnaire and some information from NHIRD. Our result found that (1) the number of CM physician has increased from 153 in 2010 to 230 in 2014, (2) the number of patients and their medical visit has increased from 22,635/121,660 to 33,779/183,779, (3) the number of serving townships has increased from 62 to 85, and (4) the proportion of service resident has risen from 9.97 % to 15.05%. The satisfactions of top 3, reported by patients, were CM physician attitude, medical skill, and therapeutic effect. Conversely, the most common dissatisfactions were the time of consultation, as well as the imperfect medical equipment and process. In addition, we have found the common diagnosis of the rural residents were myositis, lumbago, cough, arthralgia, common cold, sleeping disorder, headache, sciatica. TCM practitioners actively involved the project grants supported by government could improve the patients' accessibility and satisfaction in the rural area. This result could provide a reference for CM physician to choose the formula or single herb on medical services in rural area.

Incidence of end stage renal disease (ESRD) was rising among adults in Taiwan. The purpose of this study is to determine the prescription commonly used by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physicians in the treatment of CKD by the analysis of National health insurance (NHI) database. Methods: The data used in this study is NHI-TCM outpatient database from 2004 to 2006. We selected the CKD patients which were coded with ICD-9 diagnostic code 585 and 586. We reviewed the series of prescription and treatment schedules (CD) and outpatient prescription (OO) of these patients, and recorded the Chinese medicine health insurance code including formulas and single Chinese herbs. We calculated the frequency and percentage of the Chinese herbal formulas and single herbs used in CKD patients. Results: 293 Chinese herbal formulas and 362 single Chinese herb were used to treat CKD. We found the top 20 of the highest percentage of prescriptions in Chinese herbal formulas as following: supplementing (10), dispelling dampness (3), harmonizing (3), clearing heat (2), precipitation (1) and rectifying blood (1). The top 20 single Chinese herbs for treatment of CKD were tonify herbs (7), quickening the blood and transforming stasis (3), clearing heat (2), disinhibiting water and percolating dampness (2), warming center (2), precipitation (1), transforming dampness (1), stanching bleeding (1) and quieting the spirit (1). Conclusions: Prescriptions for CKD by TCM physicians were made with tonify-based formulas, accompanied by formulas for quickening the blood and transforming stasis, formulas for disinhibiting or dry dampness and formulas for clearing heat. Our study provides the basis for research to use traditional Chinese medicine in treatment of CKD, and a new thinking to make appropriate prescriptions for the treatment of CKD.

This plant is widely used to treat many diseases in folk medicine including constipation, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, pneumonia, malaria and so on. However, the role of Delonix regia on cardio-protective effect remains unclear. In this study, we followed the law of Chinese medicine judging theory \"red foods nourish the heart\" on plant morphology, speculated that the flaming red flowers plant Delonix regia may act as an \"active blood and resolve stasis\" reagent on heart diseases and may improve heart function. We used Delonix regia leaf extract (DRLE) as a tool for its easy to obtain and the higher anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effect. According to our finding, we found that DRLE could reduce the mortality rate in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced heart injury and hypertrophy mice. In addition, we also confirmed that DRLE could alleviate the heart damage by pathological examination. In the biochemical study, we also found that CPK, LDH, GOT and TNF- are reduced but NO level is increased in DRLE treated ISO-injected mice. In the in vitro study, we found that DRLE could dilate porcine coronary artery in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, we firstly demonstrated that DRLE has cardioprotective effect might associate with NO induced vasodilation and reduce myocytes injury via inhibition of TNF- pathway. Based on our above findings, we thought DRLE could act as a novel herbal medicine for cardio protection.

In this style of \"holographic acupuncture\" needles are inserted into specific zones of trigger points on the scalp behind the head to represent spine in holographic principles combining the moving Qi-therapy patients move their body during needles retaining to achieve the desired therapeutic effects. The key point is to loosen the Qi knot where the needle is inserted. This means there is Qi stagnation forming what feels like a knot or abnormal pain points along the chosen meridian and needle is inserted here to move qi and free stagnation. This is a very good method of minimal needle count but with significant therapeutic effects. Statement of the Problem: A 68-year-old Women had left leg length discrepancy and scoliosis caused leg pain, after the vertical rectangle Tian character acupuncture treatment combined with moving Qi-therapy about 20 minutes her leg pain relieved obviously. Single Tian-character acupuncture: From Baihui GV20 (corresponding to the head) to Naohu GV17 (corresponding to the last sacrum) is equivalent to the whole spine of holographic principles. According to Dr. Wen-jing Song's point of view, the line of demarcation for Qiangjian GV18 is at the lumbosacral, and for Houding GV 19, it is at the thoracolumbar area. As the scale, there are the four trigger points on both sides of Naohu and one center point (near Qiangjian point GV18) of them. Performing acupuncture on five trigger points is equivalent to loosen the Qi knot of the five tight points on the waist area of holographic principles. (Figure 1) Double Tian-character acupuncture: Therapeutic efficacy of acupuncture can be strengthened by single Tian-character acupuncture adding a Tian-character above or on two sides of Tian-character to form double Tian-character acupuncture: the vertical and horizontal rectangle Tian-character. The vertical rectangle Tian-character is the field up and down stacks, but the horizontal rectangle Tian-character is the field side by side and wrapped by the second field. Selecting the vertical rectangle Tian-character acupuncture with moving-Qi-therapy simultaneously to relieve pain and discomfort if one suffers from serious neck spine related problems; selecting the horizontal rectangle Tian-character acupuncture if one suffers from thoracic and lumbar spine related problems. Enhancing the therapeutic efficacy by combining moving-Qi-therapy simultaneously - patients walk around or move their body to re-adjust the spine and Qi stagnant situation based on the holographic principles to relieve symptoms of spine related problems.

The purpose of this case study was to illustrate the effect of Bo's abdominal acupuncture on a patient with PVOD. Clinical Features: A 52 years old female caught a cold, with stuffy nose, headache, and purulent sputum. She lost the sense of smell since then, after that, all her sense of smell became garlic flavor. She was diagnosed with viral sinusitis by otorhinolaryngologist while water's view showed good pneumatization of paranasal sinuses without clouding and CT showed no polyp but retention cyst of bilateral maxillary sinus floor. (Figure 1) She had taken steroids for four weeks, but the situation didn't improve. Therefore, she came to Chinese medical department for help. Intervention & Outcome: The patient was treated with Bo's conducting Qi back to its origin and at both sides (). (Figure 2) Disposable stainless steel filiform needles (30 gauges, 40mm long) were inserted and retained for 15 minutes. Acupuncture was performed twice a week for two months. During treatment, the garlic flavor was gradually fading and the patient could distinguish flavor of fruits and flowers over time. Conclusion: Treating PVOD with Bo's abdominal acupuncture can improve the sense of smell, and may shorten the time of improvement. It might be an alternative way or adjuvant therapy of PVOD when steroids don't work.

Some patients perceive self-motion whereas others perceive motion of the environment. The main difference between dizziness and vertigo is that the patients with vertigo have a rotational component. It arises because of asymmetry in the vestibular system due to damage to or dysfunction of the labyrinth, vestibular nerve, or central vestibular structures in the brainstem. A 31-year-old woman from Vietnam experienced vertigo for several years. She felt as if everything was turning around, and that she was not able to balance and might fall. The patient had to take a rest, staying in bed to relive the discomfort. However, the patient once fainted and hit her head four years ago and the symptom got worse since then. The vertigo attacked more often, two to three times a month, accompanying with temporal headache. She had ever come to many hospitals for medical treatments, but there were no improvements, even though she sought for medical advice in Vietnam. The patient was referred to Chung Shan Medical University Hospital for Chinese medical treatment on 08-08-2014. After diagnosing based on syndrome differentiation, she was considered as dual vacuity of qi and blood, syndrome of phlegm-damp stagnation, and little hepatic stagnation. The doctor prescribed her some powder of Chinese medicine, Guei Pyi Tang (8g/day, TID), Ban Xia Bai Zhu Tian Ma Tang (7g/day, TID), and bupleurum (1g/day, TID) combined, and gave her health education. There was a significant improvement of vertigo when the patient received for four-month TCM treatment, but she discontinued the treatment because she went back to Vietnam at that time. One year later, we contacted the patient to know how she had been recently. The frequency of Vertigo was twice to three times per month but has now reduced to once every three months. The vertigo was improved significantly via Traditional Chinese medicine.

It will not be corrected by lens or other instruments. The brain cannot acknowledge the image of the amblyopic eye. It is common in children and affects the learning of them. The most treatment is that a patch is placed on the normal eye. But sometime, the vision still not recovery. Method: Laser acupuncture is a safe and painless treatment for patients who are afraid of acupuncture with fine needles. We used laser acupuncture on the acupoint \"Qingming\" (BL1) and Qi\u00fah\u00f2u (EX-HN7). The laser acupuncture is performed by doctor. Patients received treatment 2-3 times per week. Every treatment time is about 1 minute for one acupoint. Result: We observed about 20 children with amblyopia. They still use patch cover treatment for amblyopic eye. But some children got vision improved after 2 months. Finally, we found about 80% children that they can see things clearly. Even some child refused patch covered got the vision improved. Conclusion: In clinical, we used acupuncture on periocular area acupoints. But it will lead to bruise around the periocular area. Besides, children may be afraid of needle acupuncture. After receiving laser acupuncture, they can complete the course of treatment. The vision of the amblyopic eye had been treated and cured.

There is dearth of information of the chemical composition of most fork medicine from plant. We studied in vitro modulating effectiveness of A. indica secondary metabolites (AISM) on formulated neem soap, cream and toothpaste for management of infectious and oxidative stress diseases. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: Essential oils (EOs) were obtained by hydrodistillation and AISM characterized by GC-MS, while the radicals scavenging, antimicrobial and cytotoxicity of the neem cosmetics products (NCPs) without and with the AISM were examined by spectrophotometric, phytol (14.12%) The NCPs without AISMs exhibited bacteriostatic effects (BEs) against three reference bacterial strains (L. ivanovii, S. aureus, E. cloacae) and two multi-drug resistant bacteria (V . paraheamolyticues and E. coli 180) at dose below 0.31 mg/ml. Similar BEs were observed against two clinical dermatophytes cruiz, Tinea capitis) and two fungal strains and A. fumigatus) at concentrations below 0.50 mg/ml. On other hand at same dose, the neem soap formulated with the AISMs demonstrated bactericidal effects on most of the test pathogens reported to be linked to some infectious diseases. The NCPs produced with AISMs displayed noteworthy effects in scavenging known radicals associated oxidative stress diseases. None of the NPCs showed haemolytic activity on human red blood cells at 0.850 mg/ml except the soap. Conclusion & significance: The study indicates that apart from tradition uses of Azadirachta indica , the EOs contained very potent secondary metabolites and possible new antimicrobial agents, as well as alternative to synthetic antiradical and may likewise be useful in pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries.

Additionally, six compounds were reported for the first time in the species viz., -sitosterol (3), ursolic acid (5), oleanolic acids (6), pomolic acid (7), 2-epi-tormentic (9), -sitosterol-3-O- -D-glucopyranoside (11) and Finally, two more compounds were previously reported; stigmasterol (4) and acteoside (12). The structure elucidation was based on comparison of their chemical, physical, chromatographic properties, spectral data (MS and NMR) with literature in addition to direct comparison with authentic compounds. The antimicrobial and antiprotozoal activities of the total ethanolic extract (TEE), its fractions as well as the isolated compounds were tested. The TEE was the most effective exhibiting the lowest MIC (1.0 \u00b5g/mL) against E. coli. Moreover, ursolic acid, acteoside and epi-tormentic acid were the most potent against P . aeruginosa with MICs 1.2 \u00b5g/mL, 1.6 \u00b5g/mL and 2.3 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Additionally, the epi-tormentic acid and acteoside showed the lowest MICs (1.2 \u00b5g/mL) against Candida glabrata . All the above results are higher than standard drugs. While, the secondary phase assay of the petroleum ether fraction revealed IC 50 of ng/mL against Additionally, the dichloromethane fraction was the most against L. donovani amastigotes in THP1 with 86% inhibition. Finally, the epi-tormentic acid and -sitosterol-3-O--D- glucopyranoside did not exhibit any effect on hepatitis C virus. ashrafnag@mu.edu.egPage 56 Volume 6, Issue 6 (Suppl) Altern Integr Med, an open access journal October 24-26, 2017 October 24-26, 2017 | Dubai, UAE7th International Conference & Exhibition on AL TERNATIVE MEDICINEAltern Integr Med 2017, 6:6(Suppl) DOI: 10.4172/2327-5162-C1-036 African traditional medicine in South Africa: History of the practice and current developments in its regulation Conrad Tsiane and Nceba Gqaleni Interim Traditional Health Practitioners Council, South Africa Statement of the Problem: The practice of African traditional medicine (ATM) in South Africa (SA) is as old as the cradle of human kind.

Findings: The Constitution of SA, the Health Act, and the Traditional Health Practitioners (THP) Act form the basis for the transformation of ATM. The Interim THP Council of SA is leading the process of regulating THPs Conclusion & Significance: ATM will never be the same again in SA info@drtsiane.co.zaPage 57 Volume 6, Issue 6 (Suppl) Altern Integr Med, an open access journal October 24-26, 2017 October 24-26, 2017 | Dubai, UAE7th International Conference & Exhibition on AL TERNATIVE MEDICINEAltern Integr Med 2017, 6:6(Suppl) DOI: 10.4172/2327-5162-C1-036 Practical application of energy healing to pain management Gloria Kaye Energy Healing Institute, USA Energy healing is an ancient phenomenon that can be traced back to Biblical times. The recent interest in energy healing and alternative medicine is growing, and more and more medical schools are including energy medicine in their curriculums. Dr. Kaye has taught her techniques to first year medical students and has been conducting healing sessions for over 50 years. Using infrared technology, a physicist could capture images of energy and heat being transferred from her hands to her clients. In her presentation, students will learn the practical application of energy healing to a variety of medical conditions including acute and chronic pain because of injuries or trauma. Working energetically, students will learn how to positively affect pain levels. As the energy is transmitted, cells may respond in one of three or more of the following ways: Dispersal - unwanted cells may be dispersed. The intervention lends itself to numerous conditions such as: dispersal of arthritis, adhesions, infections, and bone spurs. Reorganization- traumas and injuries are frequently reduced as skeletal changes create physical balance. Pain associated with physical imbalances may be resolved. Regeneration - as new cells are regenerated, wounds, incisions, open sores and infections can frequently be affected. This is an exciting, interactive presentation where participants will come away with informative, practical techniques for dealing with pain. drgloriakaye@gmail.comPage 58 Volume 6, Issue 6 (Suppl) Altern Integr Med, an open access journal October 24-26, 2017 October 24-26, 2017 | Dubai, UAE7th International Conference & Exhibition on AL TERNATIVE MEDICINEAltern Integr Med 2017, 6:6(Suppl) DOI: 10.4172/2327-5162-C1-036 Quality control and standardization of herbal medicines - A dire need today Mohammad Kamil ZCHRTM, UAE Ever since the incorporation of Traditional Medicines in its programme in the year 1976, World Health Organization (WHO) has gone a long way for the worldwide promotion and development of different systems of Traditional Medicines and their best utilization in the health care services. In the recent years with ever-growing commercialization in the field of herbal medicines, there has been an instant demand for quality control of the drugs used in this system. For this standardization is usually recommended as the solution to the problem. But unfortunately, quite a number of these drugs are frequently adulterated with cheap, less potent and spurious plant materials either posing danger to the public health or not as efficacious as expected. The challenges are innumerable and enormous, making the global herbal market unsafe. This talk seeks to enlighten physicians, pharmacists, consumers and stakeholders in herbal medicine on the need to establish quality parameters for collection, handling, processing and production of herbal medicine as well as employ such parameters in ensuring the safety of the global herbal market. The processes of excellent quality assurance and standardization of herbal medicines and herbal medicinal products will be discussed. In the present study an attempt has been made to deal a clear understanding for research on medicinal plants starting from good agricultural practices(GAP); good cultivation practices (GCP); good field collection practices(GFCP); technical planning; population density; geographical distribution; topographical maps; collection; identification; storage; chemical standardization; assay; good manufacturing practices of hidden ingredients/synthetic drugs in herbal medicine; pre-clinical studies to clinical approach, with special reference to maintain standardization at every stage and subsequent production of quality herbal medicinal products (HMP). drkamil55@hotmail.comPage 59 Volume 6, Issue 6 (Suppl) Altern Integr Med, an open access journal October 24-26, 2017 October 24-26, 2017 | Dubai, UAE7th International Conference & Exhibition on Integr Med 2017, 6:6(Suppl) DOI: 10.4172/2327-5162-C1-036 Antimicrobial testing of some of the prominent invasive plants used by the traditional healers of Vhembe district municipality in the treatment of HIV/AIDS related symptoms S G Mbambala, M P Tshisikhawe and N A Masevhe University of Venda, South Africa The antimicrobial activity of restorative plant extracts justifies them to be used as a part of numerous fields, for example, sustenance industry, drug store and solution. There are an expanding number of illnesses, including bacterial diseases which are displaying different levels of drug resistance. In this study, 6 invasive plants were investigated, on their frequency of use and the little literature reported on the antimicrobial activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of both the acetone and aqueous extract against the different test organism ranged from 3-50 mg/ml. The concentration of plants extracts were conducted at 1 mg/ml, 5mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml, respectively. The results were slightly shown at the concentration of 50 mg/ml. This clearly meant that the plant extract are not effective for MIC. The results were slightly shown at the concentration of 50 mg/ml. This clearly meant that the plant extract are not effective for MIC. The investigation of plant extracts may be a first step towards finding new therapeutic agents against resistant human pathogens of bacterial origin. Pathogenic bacterial strains which may be etiologic agents of sexually transmitted infections include E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. The positive results demonstrate that plants utilized by the Vhembe traditionally healers have an impact in the treatment of some HIV/AIDS related symptoms.Page 60 Volume 6, Issue 6 (Suppl) Altern Integr Med, an open access journal October 24-26, 2017 October 24-26, 2017 | Dubai, UAE7th International Conference & Exhibition on AL TERNATIVE MEDICINEAltern Integr with reduced incidence of post- prandial dietary endotoxin, triglycerides, and disease risk biomarkers Thomas Bayne D C Microbiome Labs, USA Dietary or metabolic endotoxemia is a condition that affects approximately 1/3 of individuals living in Western society. It is characterized by increased serum endotoxin concentration during the first five hours of the post-prandial period following consumption of a meal with a high-fat, high-calorie content. Long-term repeated dietary endotoxemia may increase the risk of developing a variety of chronic diseases. Of the available treatments, oral probiotic supplementation has been purported to reduce gastrointestinal permeability to endotoxin, which in theory should suppress the dietary endotoxin response. The purpose of this study was to determine if 30-d of oral probiotic supplementation could reduce post-prandial dietary endotoxemia in \"responder\" subjects. Apparently healthy men and women (N=75) were screened for post-prandial dietary endotoxemia. Subjects whose serum endotoxin concentration increased by at least 5-fold from pre-meal levels at 5-h post-prandial were considered \"responders\" and were randomized to receive either placebo (rice flour) or multi-strain probiotic supplement (Bacillus indicus (H36), Bacillus subtilis (H58), and Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacillus clausii) for 30-d. The dietary endotoxemia test was repeated after the supplementation period. Dietary endotoxin (LAL) and triglycerides (enzymatic) were measured using an automated chemistry analyzer. Serum disease risk biomarkers were measured using bead-based multiplex assays as secondary, exploratory measures. Data were statistically analyzed using repeated measures ANOV A and a P < 0.05. We found that probiotic supplementation was associated with a 42% reduction in and 24% reduction in triglyceride (P=0.004) in post-prandial period Placebo subjects presented with a 36% increase in endotoxin and 5% decrease in triglycerides over the same post-prandial period. We also found that probiotic supplementation was associated with significant IL-1 (P=0.020), and ghrelin (P=0.017) compared to placebo subjects. The key findings of the present study, were that oral probiotic supplementation reduced responses that were consistent with \"leaky gut syndrome\" and transient reductions "}
