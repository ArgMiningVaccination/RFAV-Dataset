On December 3, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) announced a [60 percent vaccination target](https://apnews.com/article/public-health-africa-kenya-coronavirus-pandemic-73e1b251e5ba1faf9b59895022a7ff9e)\u2014one estimate of the level needed to achieve herd immunity from COVID-19\u2014in Africa's fifty-four countries. Since American and European officials have [pre-purchased](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-is-cleared-for-use-by-eu-drug-agency-11608560164) vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna for [domestic use](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3111490/will-china-move-africa-end-coronavirus-vaccine-queue), African governments and the Africa CDC are being forced to find alternative vaccine supplies. The immunization drive is expected to be among the [largest in the continent's history](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/11/1078642)\u2014the first being the campaign to [eradicate polio](https://www.who.int/news/item/25-08-2020-global-polio-eradication-initiative-applauds-who-african-region-for-wild-polio-free-certification), which required 9 billion oral vaccine doses, over the course of twenty-four years. More on: [Public Health Threats and Pandemics](/health/public-health-threats-and-pandemics) The World Health Organization's COVAX program aims to help developing countries secure vaccines. However, the program will only cover [the most vulnerable 20 percent](https://www.who.int/news/item/15-07-2020-more-than-150-countries-engaged-in-covid-19-vaccine-global-access-facility) of each country's population. Assuming that each vaccine requires the administration of two doses, Africa, with a population of over 1.3 billion people, will need at least 1.6 billion doses to meet its 60 percent vaccination target. Africa CDC\u2014after accounting for COVAX's contribution\u2014will need to secure 1.28 billion more doses at an [estimated cost](https://www.afro.who.int/news/who-urges-african-countries-ramp-readiness-covid-19-vaccination-drive) of $13.54 billion to close the remaining gap. More vaccines may be needed, however, as some will inevitably spoil during transport\u2014Africa's heat, rainy seasons, and poor road infrastructure provide [logistical barriers to distribution](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/africasource/barriers-to-mass-testing-for-covid-19-in-africa/). To make up for COVAX's limited reach, African governments are considering deals to buy vaccines that are viewed with [skepticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/business/china-coronavirus-vaccine-united-arab-emirates.html) in the West. In particular, several governments have [expressed interest](http://www.focac.org/eng/zfgx_4/jmhz/t1825406.htm) in China's leading vaccine, BBIBP-CorV, developed by the China National Pharmaceutical Group (SinoPharm); Novetta's [Rumor Tracking Program](https://www.novetta.com/products/novetta-mission-analytics/) revealed that Russia's leading vaccine, V, [also remains popular](https://www.cfr.org/blog/russian-disinformation-popularizes-sputnik-v-vaccine-africa) on the continent. The SinoPharm vaccine received approval for distribution on January 4 after reporting [a 79 percent efficacy rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/30/business/china-vaccine.html) in interim late-stage trials. The vaccine is now being lined up to inoculate [50 million people](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/532537-china-giving-covid-19-vaccine-to-50-million-in-a) in China before January 15, with second shots to be delivered before February 5\u2014all [free of charge](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/30/asia/china-sinopharm-vaccine-efficacy-intl-hnk/index.html) to Chinese citizens. However, medical experts have questioned the vaccine's safety, citing China's [unwillingness](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/business/china-coronavirus-vaccine-united-arab-emirates.html) to release publicly any of their trial results. Regardless, China could use vaccine access to bolster its economic and political influence in Africa and other regions struggling to secure enough vaccines. In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping [addressed developing countries' need for vaccines](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-05/18/c_139066851.htm), offering to provide the Chinese vaccine as a \"public good\" at an affordable price. On October 16, Liu Jingzhen, chairman of SinoPharm, [told fifty African diplomats](https://thediplomat.com/2020/11/chinas-multifaceted-covid-19-diplomacy-across-africa/) visiting a SinoPharm vaccine factory that \"after the COVID-19 vaccine is developed and put into use, it will take the lead in benefiting African countries.\" Those who visited offered messages of reassurance to their citizens regarding the vaccine. James Kimonyo, Rwanda's Ambassador to China, commented on SinoPharm's size and experience developing vaccines on polio, yellow fever, and smallpox, [stating](https://www.africanews.com/2020/10/16/50-african-diplomats-on-anti-covid-19-visit-to-china-s-sinopharm/) that the visit was \"an eye-opener\" that led him to \"hope that we get the vaccines anytime soon.\" This \"vaccine diplomacy\" is a continuation of China's efforts to frame itself as the solution to\u2014rather than the cause of\u2014the pandemic. Since the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, China's President Xi Jinping has focused on publicizing Chinese efforts to supply medical aid worldwide. According to state-owned China Global Television Network, an international language broadcasting network, from March to mid-October the Jack Ma Foundation delivered over [four hundred tons of medical supplies](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-10-16/50-African-diplomats-visit-Chinese-coronavirus-vaccine-maker-UDKAcH773O/index.html) across Africa, including monthly deliveries of thirty million testing kits, ten thousand ventilators, and eight million surgical masks. In addition, the Chinese government claims that it sent nearly two hundred experts to support medical personnel across the continent. China's planeloads of COVID-19 donations\u2014including hospital gowns, nasal swabs, and surgical masks\u2014were initially viewed positively, especially in countries like Zimbabwe, where equipment in public hospitals has been [systemically looted](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/11/7/africa-vaccine-diplomacy-and-the-us-china-rivalry/) over the years. However, in August, a corruption scandal emerged over Jack Ma's medical donations in [Kenya](https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20200903-kenya-jack-ma-covid-19) and [Tanzania](https://chinaafricaproject.com/2020/08/18/kenyas-health-chief-denies-accusation-jack-mas-donated-ppe-was-illegally-smuggled-to-tanzania/). Kenya's Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission accused the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority of selling a consignment of medical equipment intended for the Kenyan people to a dozen Tanzanian companies in March. The scandal raised doubts over China's ability to circumnavigate corrupt institutions and ensure that medical supplies\u2014including vaccines\u2014will arrive and be administered to their intended targets. More on: [Public Health Threats and Pandemics](/health/public-health-threats-and-pandemics) In another front of China's public-relations offensive, state-owned news outlets are suggesting the SinoPharm vaccine has technological and logistical advantages over mRNA vaccines, such as those developed by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. The Global Times, a Communist Party mouthpiece, [emphasized](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1208668.shtml) SinoPharm's use of an \"inactivated\" vaccine, a decades-old technique used for influenza and polio vaccinations that delivers a killed or weakened virus into the body to prompt an immune response. This was [presented](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/china-firm-uses-workers-to-pre-test-coronavirus-vaccine-in-global-race/articleshow/76994592.cms?from=mdr) in contrast to Western firms using \"less-proven technologies\" to develop their vaccines. The Global Times further questioned whether African medical staff have the experience to deal with any adverse reactions from mRNA vaccines. Chinese media assert that distribution networks in Africa are well-established due to existing commercial ties. Alibaba, Jack Ma's e-commerce giant, has a firm footing on the continent; the company recently [struck a deal](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1208610.shtml) with Ethiopian Airlines to ship vaccines to Africa. Media also highlight that SinoPharm's inactivated vaccine can be transported in affordable, [off-grid refrigeration units](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1208668.shtml)\u2014a genuine advantage over mRNA vaccines, which need to be stored between -20 and -70 degrees Celsius. In Africa, tropical heat and a dearth of ultra-cold freezers\u2014the machines can [go for over $15,000](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1208668.shtml), more than fifteen times the cost of off-grid units\u2014make it especially challenging to deliver mRNA vaccines to rural communities and remote islands. Yet despite Chinese media's questioning of mRNA vaccines, one Chinese company, Fosun Pharmaceutical, [partnered](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1206562.shtml) with Pfizer-BioNTech to develop and commercialize the mRNA vaccine that has been authorized in [many Western countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55401136). Furthermore, in December, following a strategic [cooperation agreement](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-biontech/shanghai-fosun-pharma-sinopharm-group-sign-deal-to-supply-biontech-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-idUSKBN25Y1BC) between Fosun Pharmaceutical and SinoPharm, China agreed to [receive 100 million doses](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3114172/coronavirus-china-set-100-million-doses-biontech-vaccine-amid) of the popular mRNA vaccine\u2014demonstrating an approach to stockpile both domestic and foreign-made vaccines. China's vaccine diplomacy in Africa serves to be a [high-risk](https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/why-mass-vaccination-west-could-be-bad-news-chinese-leaders?utm_source=tw&utm_content=122120&utm_medium=social_owned), high-reward venture. If SinoPharm's vaccine restores a sense of normalcy to life across Africa, China will be praised. However, if the vaccine proves ineffective or creates unforeseen health effects, China's carefully crafted image\u2014one based on ideals of credibility and philanthropy\u2014could be undermined.
