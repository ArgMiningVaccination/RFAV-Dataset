It is based on traditional and current clinical observations concerning response to herbal therapy. Simply put; when using a potent herbal formulation it is best to start at a lower dosage before increasing to the full therapeutic dosage, and then lowering the dosage to a maintenance dosage once the goals have been accomplished. Protocol 242 uses 2 capsules per day during the Initiation Phase, 4 per day during the Restoration Phase, and 2 per day during the Maintenance Phase. Protocol 242 is effective in all the [Hormone Specific Endocrine Complete is not designed to taken according to Protocol 242. The Suggested Usage for Endocrine Complete is \"Adults take 4 capsules daily with food, or as directed by a healthcare professional.\" The dosage may be customized based on the unique needs of each person. Phase One: INITIATION Clinical experiences reveal that patients do much better when they started on a lower dosage during the initiation of the recovery process. In addition, their recovery was easier if they also addressed the foundations of health, such as diet, foundational nutritional support, rest, recreation and relaxation, hydration & elimination. The Initiation dosage for the Hormone Specific Formulations is 2 capsules each day with food. This should be done for 1 to 2 weeks. As with all herbal therapies, the dosage can be further customized to the individual needs of the patient. Occasionally some patients may find that they only need 1 capsule per day during the INITIATION phase. Many people start to feel better even during the Initiation Phase, as their wellness increases. The goal is to get to best level of health - the top of the wellness plateau. Starting at 2 capsules per day gives the body some time to heal - to get to the top of the wellness plateau. After 1 to 2 weeks at the INITIATION dosage, the dosage can be increased. Phase Two: RESTORATION To fully achieve restoration of health and homeostasis in each of the homeostasis regulatory systems, it is important to maintain consistent and proper dosages of Hormone Specific Formulations. The restoration phase recognizes that it often takes more energy, and more intensive therapy, to get to a higher level of function and an improved quality of life - to get to the top of the wellness plateau. The Restoration dosage for the Hormone Specific Formulations is 4 capsules each day with food. This should be done for 2 to 4 months. As with all herbal therapies, the dosage can be further customized to the individual needs of the patient. Occasionally some patients may find that they only need 2 capsules per day during the RESTORATION phase. Once you experience the higher level of function and improved quality of life it is best to stay on 4 capsules per day until you feel good for at least two months. If you have had a long history of relapses, the then it is often best to stay on the restoration dosage for at least four months. One you have felt better for two to four months, it is okay to lower to a maintenance dosage. Phase Three: MAINTENANCE The maintenance phase recognizes that the restorative dosage that was required to increase level of function, and improve quality of life is typically not required for long term maintenance. When a patient says; \"I have been feeling great for two (or four) months! Do I still need to take the full dosage?\", then it is time to lower the dosage to maintenance. A majority of patients will be able to maintain a higher level of function and improved quality of life on the lower Maintenance dosage of 2 capsules each day with food. Occasionally a patient needs to stay on the restorative dosage of Hormone Specific Formulations longer than four months, or they may need to return to the restoration dosage after a relapse. As with all herbal therapies, the dosage can be further customized to the individual needs of the patient. Some patients may find that they only need 1 capsule per day during the MAINTENANCE phase. Occasionally, there will be a patient that will feel better on 3 or 4 capsules long term. However, this may also be considered an extended restoration phase. When patients have difficulty staying in the maintenance phase, I reevaluate their health, such as diet, rest, recreation and relaxation, hydration, elimination, or look for stressors that may be causing them to relapse. The WELLNESS PLATEAU The following graphic shows how in Phase One (INITIATION) the Hormone Specific Formulations is started at two capsules each day with food. This allows a gentle increase in the level of wellness for the first two weeks. In Phase Two (RESTORATION) the Hormone Specific Formulations is taken as four capsules each day with food. During this phase, the level of wellness will continue to improve until it reaches a higher place of wellness, indicated by the wellness plateau. In Phase Three (MAINTENANCE) the of Hormone Specific Formulations is lowered down to two capsules each day with food because wellness has been attained. The dosage of two capsules each day with food may be increased back to four capsules each day with food if there is a relapse because of a major stressor. Once health is reacquired, the dosage may again be lowered down to two capsules each day with food.
