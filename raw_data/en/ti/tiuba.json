Here's what WCH members, staff, and coalition partners are saying about Monica's presentation: Kim: It's crazy that natural therapies are still considered fringe and quackery. This has to change! Nicky Adolphe: I used homeopathic tissue salts for my baby daughter who was told she would be on medication for life for a heart condition - SVT (high heart rate), and possibly heart surgery at about 5 yrs old. She never had another attack. Marco Albertazzi: One of the doctors that contribute in or medical-scientific team works with homeopathy and she has been very successful...

Transcript [00:00:00] [00:00:30] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Now. It is my great pleasure to introduce our friend Monica Frohmann. And it's a great pleasure to introduce you. Monica has been practicing homeopathy since 1999, where she graduated in Canada from homeopathic medicine. [00:00:47] And she has a full-time practice, has been a faculty member since 2004, and she teaches homeopathy and supervised in teaching clinic. She treats people of all ages and has a special interest in treating children and animals by vet referral, which is very interesting. And boy, I wish you were around helping me with my pets. [00:01:09] She has a wealth of information to share with us all in a field that has been shunned by allopathic medicine. So I know everyone will find Monica's talk about homeopathy very, very informative. She's affiliated with homeopaths for medical choice.com and Monica's topic today is homeopathic medicine and treatment and prophylaxis. [00:01:31] So thank you very much for being here. We're pleased to have you, and please share your knowledge with us. [00:01:38] Monica Frohmann: Thank you very much, Jennifer. And thank you, Siji too for your very inspiring and timely presentation. It was, it really struck me and I have to just quickly throw this in there. The thing that surprised me about the presentation was the very first thing that you said was with three horizontal lines, because I sure didn't put myself on that third line. And it actually literally surprised me that wow, that actually could have been a choice and I would never have thought of it. So thank you for that. It was very, very inspiring. [00:02:07] And hello to everyone in all corners of the world. I have to think Jennifer Hibbert for inviting me to speak today, and I'm very, very pleased to be here. [00:02:17] And I'm also very pleased to be able to introduce homeopathy to you and give it the much needed voice that it deserves. There may be some people in this group who already are familiar with homeopathy or even use it in their lives, whether it be medical doctors, homeopaths themselves, or at home for the family. [00:02:38] But I will start with a little bit of history and just walk you through the whole thing very briefly, of course, just so you can get a general picture of where everything began. But I would like to say before I start into the history is, often when I'm asked about what homeopathy can treat, I like to say that the list of what we can't treat is actually shorter. We're able to treat acute disease such as fevers, flus, colds, trauma injuries, food poisoning, acute COVID infection and so on, but we're also able to treat chronic illness ranging from migraines to multiple sclerosis, to chronic long-term symptoms of COVID and beyond. [00:03:23] And homeopathy is also very effective in the treatment of vaccine injury, both in conventional childhood vaccines, which we've had a great deal of success in and in mRNA, gene therapy or vaccines or whatever we'd like to call them. Homeopathic remedies are made of plants, minerals, elements, and animals substances, and are completely safe and effective for everyone from the pregnant or nursing mom, her infant child to the frail and elderly and as Jennifer mentioned, the family pet or farm animal. [00:03:58] Just to get you a little bit of background, homeopathy saw its beginnings in the late 1700s by an MD by the name of Samuel Hahnemann. He was a German doctor and had become dissatisfied with the medical practices at the time. The toxic substances that were being used to treat people such as arsenic, lead, mercury and other methods like bloodletting and purging, only left the patients sicker. [00:04:26] And in many cases, it's not really all that different today because we use very heavy chemicals to treat disease for things like cancer, using chemotherapy, radiation therapy that doesn't just burn the cancer, but also affects other parts around. And so, as a result of his disillusionment, he began to work as a translator of medical texts instead of continuing to be a doctor. And while translating a Materia Medica by William Cullen, Hahnemann read about Peruvian bark called cinchona, which was then being used to treat malaria. And Hahnemann was intrigued by the symptoms that he read about that bark. And he was realizing as he was reading that it was causing symptoms that sort of mimicked malaria, and he decided as most good doctors do, to ingest the bark himself. And upon doing so he discovered that these symptoms really did produce symptoms similar to malaria; intermittent fever, trembling, chills and then fever again and so forth. So this led him to working more on the healing principles of similias with further research into the symptoms caused by various different substances. And similia similibus curentur is the Latin phrase, meaning, let likes be cured by likes. [00:05:51] And it is the primary principle of homeopathy and a lot of nature, just like gravity is a law of nature. So thanks to Hahnemann, we now know how to apply this law nature to promote the body to heal itself. And that's a very important factor we have to keep in mind for later, we're going to talk about the fact that the body actually heals itself. A homeopath searches for a homeopathic remedy made from a substance that would cause similar symptoms in a healthy person when ingested in its crude form. [00:06:21] So this is a concept that somewhat difficult to understand, even for the most well-versed homeopath. It's not easily explainable because it's such a foreign concept. But I'll give you an example from the metal alloy arsenic. We know that it is in acute and chronic poisonings, we know we have plenty of historical documentation on the symptoms that it causes. It affects almost all bodily systems. And when ingested in large quantities, we see constriction in the throat, difficulty swallowing and we see watery diarrhea and vomiting, violent stomach pains pains, bloody stools, pallor, cold sweats, difficult or sighing respiration, muscle cramps, neurological symptoms, collapse and eventually death. [00:07:09] When taken in small quantities like it used to be in paint on the walls, it used to be in wallpapers. There have been poisonings through, I believe it was beer, but I can't recall for sure where there was arsenic in small quantities and people would develop symptoms. And when taken in small quantities, symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, restlessness, sneezing, and hoarseness, liver complaints, and large eruptions on the skin occur. Later, neurological symptoms develop as well as many others. So as you can see, it really does affect almost every bodily function in some way or another. [00:07:49] So from this learning, there's this thing called a homeopathic proving, which is different than just what we learned from the toxicology reports for accidental poisonings. [00:08:02] And this is where we refine this information, in order to know what a homeopathic remedy can do. Approving consists of a group of people. One of which is the person who distributes the potentized homeopathic remedy or the placebo the person who distributes these things if the proving is being done correctly will not know who was getting what, only the master prover will know who is getting what, and then the people who are taking the remedy are asked to record every single day, what the symptoms are that they experience. So a homeopathic proving was done with Arsenicum Album and, once the homeopathic remedy is being given or being used in a proving it no longer retains the top toxic properties of the original substance, but instead, only has the curative powers. [00:08:55] But because in a proving, we are taking the remedy every single day for a period of time, people will begin to develop symptoms that are very similar to what the poisonings were, but not exactly. This is why it's called the law of similars. It's not the law of exacts. And so why by using the proving, it gives us an indication of what a remedy can be curative in. [00:09:18] And once the remedy has stopped the symptom cease and not no harm done. So it's very safe. [00:09:23] So we go on now we've chosen to do a proving on arsenicum or arsenic in homeopathic preparation is called Arsenicum Album. And it's, as I said, no longer retains the toxic properties of the original substance, but instead only has the curative powers and now must be matched to the unique symptoms the patient is presenting. And what makes homeopathy so effective is the fact that we treat the whole person, not the named disease. [00:09:52] We take the unique symptoms of the individual that point us in the direction of the remedy. And maybe I can best illustrate this by giving you a little case. So patient X, so one of my patients from practices so a real story, presents with chronic stomach upset, leading to vomiting and diarrhea. [00:10:12] Often the vomiting and diarrhea occurs simultaneously. He is restless and weak, has thirst for small quantities of cold water often, and is worse after midnight. He has missed at least one week of work every month for the last number of years due to his illness. And it has had a massive impact on his income and ability to maintain employment. [00:10:36] By nature, he was already a worrier, is very anxious and has always been concerned about the future and financial security. These mental symptoms have been exacerbated by the illness. The patient has been suffering with this for 11 years, despite frequent visits to many doctors and specialists. Now, after taking the case and questioning the patient carefully to determine all aspects of the presenting disease picture, so not just the vomiting and diarrhea, not just the stomach pains, but the mental state of the patient, the physical temperature, the thirst and so on, the remedy that I chose was arsenicum album in the 200 C potency. And after taking one dose of two pellets, once, at the appointment and to repeat the remedy as soon as the symptom returns, the patient was cured of the disease within one month and had no further relapses. [00:11:32] So you can see how incredibly effective homeopathy is. And this is just one of thousands of examples, not just in my own practice, but in the practice of every other homeopaths. Homeopathy has been used with great success in the prevention of disease, in the treatment of acute and chronic disease and in epidemics, and often with a much higher rate of success than in allopathic medicine. [00:11:56] It has been villified and marginalized, perhaps because it threatens conventional medicine due to its effectiveness. Maybe it's out of fear. Maybe it's out of a lack of understanding. But we have definitely been put out, in the far, far corners. And when you, for example, if you look up what homeopathy is on Wikipedia, at best, we're called quacks and at worst, it's considered dangerous. [00:12:22] Neither of which is true. We as homeopaths go through a great deal of education to be able to treat chronic disease effectively and homeopathic remedies are, I'll discuss this later, but homeopathic remedies are very, very effective and safe, far from being dangerous. But this brings me to the most important points and the reason why I wanted to speak to you all today. [00:12:46] And which is, we have seen what has happened in the world in the last couple of years. And we've seen what has happened in the field of medicine and the direction it's going in and going forward. And we are not being given solutions to treat disease. [00:13:03] And I'm talking of course today, mostly about COVID, but I'm also talking about disease in general. We are not being offered other solutions, we're being offered the only solution, which is drugs, and there are so many other solutions. We are not being given any solutions to treat COVID. The only way out apparently is to vaccinate using mRNA gene therapy. [00:13:26] But there are solutions. Many of which have been discussed probably in this forum already. And homeopathy needs to be a part of this solution. Thousands of homeopaths around the world have been treating COVID patients since the beginning of this pandemic. There were a group of homeopaths. I live in Austria now, and there are a group of homeopaths that were treating the first outbreak in Austria, in that ski town where we, that was very close to the Italian border, when they were for, they treated the first outbreak in Austria, in patients ranging with symptoms from mild to severe and virtually nothing was known about the disease in the beginning, which is why homeopathy again is so valuable. [00:14:08] In conventional medicine, people were dying in hospitals because they had no idea what to do with the disease. They didn't know what body parts it was effecting. They didn't know what the pathophysiology was, the trend that it was following. So they were completely lost. And in homeopathy, all we need to do is take a case. [00:14:28] All we need is the symptom picture, and we can already begin to treat the moment we see the symptom picture. Again, here, we were at the very beginning of this outbreak in Austria, and there were a group of homeopaths that were treating these people. The oldest patient was 91 years old and was in very severe condition and out of this group of patients, not a single patient that was treated homeopathically was lost. And to my knowledge, and I, I couldn't be a hundred percent sure about this, but to my knowledge, none of them even ended up in hospital. [00:15:07] Since then, I myself have treated in the neighborhood of about 200 people with COVID and I'm talking about people in that 200, I'm talking about people who tested positive either by antigen tests or by PCR tests. There's another, who knows how many people who probably had COVID, but at the end of the day, we don't need the name of the disease only need to know is symptom picture. [00:15:33] And again, all of these patients were all age ranges with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. And in every case, hospitalization was prevented and full recovery occurred. Out of those 200 patients, roughly that I've treated, there were no deaths and there are associations in the USA and in Europe that are gathering data on the homeopathic treatment of COVID with homeopathy. [00:15:57] And it is happening everywhere in the world. There are homeopaths all over that are treating, patients, despite the instructions from the various medical boards telling us not to do so. Because why are we in this business? Because we want to treat people. We want to help people. And we don't want to be told not to. [00:16:17] So most of us have been doing it. It's happening everywhere in the world, but it's happening silently. And the reason I wanted to speak to you here today was because, the success of homeopathy needs to be not so silent. It needs to be louder. It needs to be out there. A few months after everything started people after people had recovered from COVID, either in hospital or recovered at home through their own means, we began to hear of people with longterm symptoms. [00:16:47] This is being now referred to as long COVID or [inaudible]. And these people are also being treated with great success homeopathically. There are private Facebook groups run by homeopaths, helping en masse people with post viral symptoms. There are homeopaths in private practice, helping people with long COVID and in some countries where medical doctors practice homeopathy, they too are treating their patients using homeopathic remedies. [00:17:12] We have over the past two years also learned about the unique symptoms of the disease, which now point us to remedies that can help to prevent COVID. And this is where we're taught the title of this talk I think had something to do with prophylaxis, I can't remember the exact title, but prophylaxis is the prevention of disease and that's what our aim was to do is to be able to prevent COVID to begin with. Or at least to lighten the symptoms in a much more effective way than the vaccine has been doing. And let me also add too, though, that even if we're not talking about prevention of the disease itself, people who are in regular homeopathic care have a stronger immune system, are innately more healthy. As a result they are far less susceptible to getting sick, to begin with. [00:18:05] And there are also far less if they do get sick to being susceptible to a harder course of the disease. So, if we're going to talk about preventing the transmission of COVID, part of it is just being a healthy individual and that doesn't just include the use of homeopathy, but it very much does also include that, but it also includes a healthy lifestyle, being outdoors, getting enough vitamin D, eating properly, et cetera, and taking the proper supplements that are in this time in the world necessary for the prevention. [00:18:39] But before just looking at it from a homeopathic perspective, over the past two years, we learned about the unique symptoms of the disease, which now point us to a group of remedies that can be used to help to prevent COVID, depending on the region or country, different remedies are needed. [00:18:58] But once the remedy is found, we have an excellent track record in the prevention of the disease. Some of you may have heard of the remedies that you've been in use, such as Bryonia, Arsenica, which is one of the ones we talked about earlier and Gelsemium, just to name a few. And just to go back for a second, because we talked about our arsenica in the digestive tract being effective, recall that Arsenicum is a remedy that's very strongly affects the digestive tract and COVID in some people is actually where it, where the disease itself prevents. So again, goes back to individualizing the symptom picture. It talks about the patient and it's individual symptoms, not the disease itself. So it's very, very unique, it's very individualized and it's the reason why it can be so effective. [00:19:47] So in terms of prevention, homeopaths from around the world, banded together to communicate the symptom picture of people with COVID-19 to decide on this group of remedies that I've mentioned to you that were effective in his treatment. And as a result, these remedies also act preventatively. [00:20:05] This is referred to as the genus epidemicus. That's a whole other lecture that we can't talk about today, but there's plenty of information on it and we can provide you with that if that's something you'd like to know more about. But there is some, evidence to suggest that homeopathic remedies induce an antibody response, but this is through the use of a Nosode, which is a different form of homeopathic prophylaxis. [00:20:34] Just again, a little bit of history, the oldest study is from 1932, where Dr. Shabanah measured the antibody response to the homeopathic nosode diphtherinum used to preventive diptheria. His results were reproduced by doctors, Boyd and Patterson. And most recently, Dr. Rajesh Shah from India produced similar results with the use of the Coronavirus nosode in his patients. But we need much more research in this area. But early in the the pandemic, I conducted my own little trial using the homeopathic Nosode made of the Coronavirus. And using the Nosode is very different from the genus epidemicus, using the Nosode requires not as such careful case taking, and isn't individualized to the person or to the many people who have similar symptoms, but instead just uses the homeopathic remedy made from the product of the disease. [00:21:30] And it is in many instances, very effective. So there is evidence such to suggest that the Nosode in the prevention of disease is extremely effective and in my little trial, of 116 patients from my practice, all who gave consent ranging in ages from three to 90 years old, who were included. And of those people receiving the homeopathic prevention, not one single person developped COVID, which to me was mind boggling. And not even those who lived in a household with, and had direct contact with others who had not taken the homeopathic prophylactic and had tested positive for COVID. [00:22:14] So what does that telling us? I mean, the, ideas of, or the possibilities are seemingly endless. If this is how effective this can be. I included in these trials, the people whose family members were tested positive, not just presumed positive. I wanted to try and be as clinically accurate as possible. [00:22:36] Still my information is only anecdotal, but, I have dropped some of the people from the trial who at some point along the way, decided to vaccinate for whatever reason, usually because it was easier, needed to travel, or because they had to for work etc. And the only ones who remain in the study are the ones who have never taken the vaccine and to this day, even with the newer variants, the nosode still seems to have the required effect. So to me, this is a very promising, however anecdotal, indicator that using the homeopathic remedies as prophylaxis for COVID will be something we need to consider in the future. And for further information on this topic, I urge you to contact me or another homeopath in your area because it, I think it would be very valuable for anyone in any region to have this information at hand. [00:23:31] So just sort of to summarize homeopathy is the second most widely used medicine in the world. It is used in over 70 countries. But again, very silently. Around the world, more than 300 million people use homeopathy and either alone or in combination with other healthcare treatments. And it needs to be said that homeopathy is very complimentary to other treatment methods. Just because you're taking a homeopathic remedy doesn't mean you have to stop taking your cholesterol medication, your insulin, your thyroid medication, whatever, but what it might do is it might reduce your need for the medication or potentially eliminate the need for it altogether. [00:24:10] It is an extremely deep acting, highly effective form of medicine and free of side effects. When ingested accidentally, it is harmless yet when given for the well indicated set of symptoms it is curative. I've had parents call me, hysterical because their children have reached into the top cupboard way, high up in the kitchen, gotten the homeopathic remedy box out and eaten all of the remedies and absolutely nothing happened, which is phenomenal. I don't think you can say that about any kind of medicine besides homeopathic medicine or energy medicine, of course. But anything that involves a substance is in some way or another potentially toxic and homeopathy in that way, is not.. [00:24:55] I think the most beautiful aspect of homeopathy is that it is not the remedy itself that heals the body, it is the body that initiates the healing. The remedy only serves to stimulate the body's own innate wisdom to begin the healing process. So if you have to think of it as; the body has this ability to heal and for whatever reason, along the way, it has simply forgotten how, whether it be because of an accident, an injury an emotional shock, whatever that might be, it just doesn't remember how, so you just have to think of the homeopathic remedy as the catalyst to remind the body to know what it needs to do to begin the healing process. [00:25:38] And if you're still skeptical, which many of you may be, and that's totally okay, there is plenty of homeopathic literature full of effectiveness studies, randomized, blinded studies and outcome studies from official hospital reports to just to name a few. There's a fantastic report on the treatment of COVID from a hospital in Spain that lists you wouldn't believe how long of all the different studies that have been done since all of this started , but I definitely have access to it, I just have to find it for you. So again, if you're still skeptical, just let me know, I have all kinds of information for you. [00:26:12] And my association, the homeopaths for medical choice can help guide you to the various studies available. So please use our resources. [00:26:19] Homeopathy embraces a holistic approach by considering all aspects that make a person unique, such as the mental, physical, and emotional states and brings about a permanent cure without masking symptoms. You can't say that about a lot of different types of medicine, especially not allopathic medicine. And I highly recommend further research into homeopathy. And for anyone who's interested, we can help you find out where you can learn more about homeopathic prophylaxis or even, for those of you who might be interested learn how to treat acute cases in your practice or how to use the nosodes or the genus epidemicus. [00:26:55] So please don't hesitate to contact me directly cause I've been more than happy to do a little, I don't know what you want to call it like a mini course or something like that. It would thrill me no end to be able to do something like that. [00:27:07] We would humbly like to make it our mission to get homeopathy into the medical practices and the households of as many people as possible. [00:27:15] So I hope this information has been informative for you and I thank you for your time and your kind attention. [00:27:21] Dr. Tess Lawrie: Thank you very much, Monica. What a wonderful presentation, so clearly explained because I have to say, as an allopathic trained doctor, I have very little , knowledge of homeopathy and how it works and you just explained it so beautifully and clearly. [00:27:38] And I must say that as a member of the steering committee of world council for health, I feel very, very blessed and pleased to be able to to highlight the power of homeopathy through this presentation of yours. And I hope that we'll be able to continue to highlight the value of of homeopathy going forward. [00:27:57] There are many, many questions. I didn't even know where to start, but let's start with one from the newsroom. Do we have any emergency medicine for Erysipelas? This is a skin condition for people who might not know. [00:28:13] Monica Frohmann: So the short answer is yes. But the somewhat longer answers that a case absolutely needs to be taken. It's very treatable, very responsive to homeopathy, but it's because of it being individualized medicine. I couldn't just simply name a homeopathic remedy. [00:28:28] Dr. Tess Lawrie: There's another question about long-term asthma. Someone from the newsroom is asking, I expect the answer would be the same, but would you like to... [00:28:37] Monica Frohmann: Yeah, there are always going to be a group of remedies that perhaps, uh, come to the forefront in certain respiratory diseases, but because I've talked about individualizing the symptoms you could have a patient who has nothing, all that striking about the asthma presentation itself, but they may have had an ingrown toenail, which persists no matter what this patient has done in trying to get rid of it. [00:29:01] So one of the things as a patient of homeopathy is you need to be able to make sure that you hold nothing back, because if you go and present and talk only about your asthma, of course, through questioning the homeopaths, we'll get more information, but you would never think of the toenail to be of any interest or importance in the general picture. [00:29:19] But it's the body's ability to speak to us and the persistent re growth of an ingrown toenail that just doesn't respond to any kind of treatment is the body's way of talking to us and saying, Hey, listen, here, this is the symptom that it's going to guide you potentially to that asthma remedy that you need. [00:29:38] So again, that no matter what disease you name, my answer will be similar because we always have to individualize every person. [00:29:47] Dr. Tess Lawrie: Thank you. A question from one of our colleagues Rima Laibow, is there a homeopathic prophylaxis equivalent for the COVID jabs? [00:29:57] Monica Frohmann: Yeah, sort of. It seems like the problem with that is that the symptoms that occur after the jab seem to be attacking the area of susceptibility of that particular individual. So we have a few remedies that we know that there's a group of about 30 different remedies that historically have been used very effectively against the childhood vaccination, um, side effects and so forth. [00:30:23] And we do use a few of those remedies. Silica is one that we use for puncture wounds [inaudible] we use for elements from vaccination of all different kinds, but I don't think we can safely say yet that we have a specific remedy for the jab, because it seems to really affect the areas of susceptibility in each person. [00:30:45] So a person who has a history of asthma, which has been well controlled for many years, maybe even without medication, suddenly the asthma returns or if a patient has an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis, perhaps symptom free for years suddenly redevelops the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. [00:31:06] We have a group of symptoms that seem to come on that are very specific to immediately after the vaccine. And often that's a nux vomica state with chills that are worst at 3:00 AM, highly irritable, a terrible headache, better from covering, worse from the slightest draft. That's a very common symptom picture for immediately after the jab. [00:31:26] And that would be often nux vomica. But for the long-term effects, it's I think it's vital for someone to be treated homeopathically and taking in the case of the effects of the shots. [00:31:37] Dr. Tess Lawrie: So just to be clear, you suggesting that someone who's taken a COVID jab should continue indefinitely taking a homeopathic remedy. [00:31:48] Monica Frohmann: Not indefinitely, they should be treated homeopathically. [00:31:52] And then the homeopath would make the decision along with the patient when to stop and when the patient has begun to recover. [00:31:59] Dr. Tess Lawrie: Right, thank you. A question from Nikki Adelphi, how did you obtain a Nosode of COVID? [00:32:05] Monica Frohmann: It's a little bit of a secret, because again, because it's all so clandestine. I mean there was a patient in China who had COVID the sputum was prepared in China based on proper homeopathic principles and then it was shipped to the US, to a particular homeopath, which will remain nameless to protect him and his company. And, then it was distributed. [00:32:29] Dr. Tess Lawrie: Thank you. Also from Rima, I attempted to find homeo prophylaxis nosodes for my dogs, since I will not vaccinate them in the US wide search. I could not find a single vet willing to provide these for my dogs instead of conventional vaccines. Do you have any thoughts on this? [00:32:48] Monica Frohmann: Sadly, there are very few vets who will use homeopathic remedies at all, much less , homeopathic prophylaxis and I'm from Canada. I lived in Canada, I moved to Austria five years ago, then just before the pandemic began they made it a rule that you couldn't even have your animals spayed or neutered in a veterinary clinic without having at least the rabies vaccine. [00:33:10] So what we do know, as I said that there is some evidence to suggest that antibodies are developed as a result of using homeopathic prophylaxis. And so you need to find a homeopaths who will help you with your animals instead of a veterinarian. Sadly, although there are a few vets that practice homeopathy, I would have to find the names of them for you, but I am a big portion of my practice is the treatment of animals. [00:33:35] Dr. Tess Lawrie: Thank you, And I'm going to take one little question from Christof Plothe, he says, could you give us the links to the nosode studies, especially the COVID ones. And what are your thoughts on isopathic approaches to COVID. [00:33:50] Monica Frohmann: Another way of considering the use of homeopathy, I prefer to use, take a proper case and use the indicated remedy that's well, I'm kind of always accused of being very Hahnemannian. [00:34:03] I just wanted to say, I'll take a look at the chat and I guess there's a bunch of questions that are unanswered and I'll see if I can answer some of them just by answering in the chat if that's okay. [00:34:12] Dr. Tess Lawrie: That'll be really great. And a couple of people wanting to reach out to you for further contact so up to you to make that connection. [00:34:19] Thank you very much, Monica. It's great to hear from you, actually we had Carol Boyce, a homeopath from the UK, speak I think a month or so and it's just wonderful to hear about these modalities that we actually know so little, to hear more about what you're doing and and that's very exciting. [00:34:36] Monica Frohmann: Thank you again very much for letting me speak. [00:34:40] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: And thank you, Monica. That was amazing. Amazing talk. How perfect balance between ourselves with the environment, your explanation ties is so well with Siji's talk about how the body has so much power too. That was fabulous. This is an avenue of medicine we all have a lot to learn about. I'm so interested as many here now are I'm sure to learn more about your medical art. I look forward to taking courses, to educate myself in this field, to understand at a level to benefit and collaborate with homeopathics specialists like yourself. Can you please tell tell everybody or put it in the chat here, or we will definitely communicate it down the line of where people can go to for more education in this field. [00:35:21] That's really wonderful that you're offering for us to get in touch with you also, but I understand there are some courses too, that that we could probably register and take and learn. [00:35:31] Monica Frohmann: For sure. I mean, if you want to have a full education in homeopathy, there are several schools around the world. [00:35:36] My alma mater is the Canadian college of homeopathic medicine and they provide an excellent education in homeopathy. And we're one of the few schools that didn't allow themselves to be pressured into forcing people to vaccinate in order to attend college. So they switched everything over to online learning. I think it's absolutely brilliant. And I can get a list of, of the different places in which you can educate yourself to become a full fledged homeopath. But what I was actually talking about was still in its very baby stages is to develop a course for allopaths who are interested in a quick in quotation marks, quick education on how to use remedies acutely and to prescribe rapidly for acute disease, whether it be COVID or the flu or whatever, because I think with an arsenal of about 50 remedies and the knowledge, the fairly intensive knowledge of about 50 remedies, we could do a lot of good in the world in allopathy. [00:36:34] And I think too, that if we develop a course like this, then we would be able to be available to those allopaths or vets or dentists or whoever who would want to use it so that if they run into a snag or if it's a chronic case, they know they have a group of people that they can refer to. So I will look for or provide, I guess, should I send them to you, Jennifer, the links, and then you can pass them along? [00:37:00] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Certainly, I think what you last spoke about is really whatever everybody would like to tap into, how to actually compliment the knowledge that they have and compliment their healthcare talents already and extrapolate and expand with homeopathy also, the assistance of having a trained homeopathic specialist, let yourself to a consult with would be create. Thank you. [00:37:23] Monica Frohmann: We're very lucky because we have a handful or two handfuls of very skilled homeopaths that have knowledge and probably have files on hand already of lectures that could be developed very quickly. [00:37:35] I think it's something that's very doable, so I'd be very excited to do something like. [00:37:40] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Oh, this sounds great. Let's make it happen. That's wonderful. That's great. Okay. Thank you so much, thank you, "}
