Culture, which is a way of life of a particular group of people, is an important variable when healers (both modern and indigenous) or counselors, patients and clients interact. There are common practices that prevail with all indigenous practitioners all over the world. The similarities are more prevalent and evident than the differences from one area of practice to another [1]. The time has come for Western trained practitioners to look beyond labeling indigenous healing and counseling as superstitious because of the secretive nature of their methods and practices. Traditional healing has its varied and rich values. It is high time that these values, methods and practices be reflected in multicultural studies and medical schools' curricula, because differences in healing methods, procedures, practices and techniques are means to an end [1,2]. Indigenous healing and counseling are based on the whole person. Holistic health and healing are based solely on the whole person who focuses on the mind, body and spirit of an individual [3]. My research on indigenous healers and healing and on similarities and differences between healers from USA, Canada and Africa point to the conclusion that we have a lot to learn from these healers from global perspective [1,2,4]. These different research conclusively illustrated many ways and areas where human beings are similar than they are consciously aware. The bottom line is we can all learn from each other and from indigenous healers' methods and practices. References 1.
