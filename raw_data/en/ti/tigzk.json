{"title": "RADIO PROGRAM No. 146 - Spiritual Healing: Natural or Miraculous?", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": null, "cleaned_text": "has been given in past years to spiritual healing, healing through prayer. But many people are baffled by this approach. The inclination to view such healing as miraculous is brought out by the Reverend Edgar L. Sanford in his book, \"God's Healing Power.\" He writes: \"In spiritual healing, a favorite word is 'miracle.' In other therapies, a man can just 'get well.' In spiritual healing, the minds of many people seem to insist that there be a miracle.\" (\u00a9 1959, by Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N. J.) I realize healings occur frequently in Christian Science and without any material remedies at all. But many people feel that spiritual healings are miracles. How do you as a Christian Scientist feel about this? SPEAKER: We don't look upon such healings as miracles, but as the natural result of the operation of the law of God. Think what the word \"miracle\" actually means: something which deviates from or transcends the known laws of nature, and for which there is no known explanation. Many of the things that are happening today are so remarkable they would have seemed miraculous a hundred years ago such things as television and orbiting satellites, for example. They are accepted today because of the greater understanding we now have of the underlying physical laws. The same is true of spiritual healing in Christian Science. We recognize that healings are not the setting aside of natural law, but they are the evidence of divine law understood and properly applied. Spiritual healing, based upon an understanding of spiritual law, confirms the teachings and practice of Christ Jesus and of his apostles. Jesus said to his followers ( [John 8:31, 32](https://login.concord.christianscience.com/concord3/search/?query=John+8%3A31%2C+32&book=tfccs.main.hb.kj)), \"If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed: and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\" INTERVIEWER: You said there is a law involved that we can understand and prove? SPEAKER: Yes, there is a spiritual law that underlies all being, and material law is a hint at the certainty and invariability of spiritual law, which is ever operative. Now I can assure you that the more we accept this fact and understand the spiritual nature of God's being, the more we shall see the evidence of the operation of this law in our experience. It is really not a miracle for God, divine Love, to give good to His children. It should not be considered miraculous for the all-knowing Mind to impart limitless intelligence or for infinite, divine Truth to impart justice, integrity, and honesty or for eternal Life, which is God, to give strength and well-being. The wonder would be if the all-loving Father didn't do all this, and more, for His children. It is a wonderful thing when we begin to realize and honestly accept the fact that man, in his true being, is always at one with God and with the law of divine Love. This is the truth, which brings freedom and which heals, protects, and blesses. INTERVIEWER: What prevents a more general acceptance of spiritual healing as being natural and not miraculous? SPEAKER: What was it that prevented people in ancient times from accepting the fact that the earth was round when they thought it was flat or from accepting the fact that the earth revolved around the sun instead of vice versa? It was ignorance of the truth. When the facts were known, the restrictions imposed by ignorance were removed. In much the same manner, when the spiritual facts of God and of man are understood, the restrictions on thought and experience imposed by ignorance are removed. In the Christian Science textbook, \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,\" Mary Baker Eddy writes ( [p. 131](https://login.concord.christianscience.com/concord3/search/?query=SH+131%3A26%E2%80%9329&book=tfccs.main.sh)). \"The mission of Jesus confirmed prophecy, and explained the so-called miracles of olden time as natural demonstrations of the divine power, demonstrations which were not understood.\" Now, it was the failure of the people to understand his teachings, and the spiritual basis of what he taught, that caused them to think that what he had accomplished was miraculous. And it is the failure of people in general today to understand the spiritual basis of being that makes spiritual healing seem miraculous to them. You know, the people's ignorance at the time they believed that the earth was flat didn't operate to change the facts about the earth, but it did limit the benefit they could have had if they had known what was true about it. In much the same way, ignorance of God won't change the facts of God either. Eternal Truth, divine Love, is always the same: it never changes. By the same token, then, ignorance of man's real nature as the spiritual likeness of God doesn't change the facts about man. No form of mortal ignorance can ever operate to separate the real man from God or from man's benefiting from the law of harmony. INTERVIEWER: How do you take this reasoning out of the theoretical and make it practical? SPEAKER: I'm not sure that I would say we make it practical; the fact is that it is practical already. It may seem to be theoretical until we begin to see the results of this understanding. Many people marveled when they saw this take place in the life of a woman from California. She had suffered from many physical problems\u2014valvular heart ailment and serious blood conditions. The situation had become so severe that she was unable to retain food, and she was down to about seventy-five pounds. She had been in and out of the hospital, and the doctors finally told her that she could live only a short time. Then one day as she was reaching out sincerely to God in prayer, she remembered that her husband's family some years before had given them some Christian Science books. So, with great difficulty, she got up out of bed and found the package in which they were wrapped. It included a Bible, a Christian Science textbook, and also a copy of the Christian Science Quarterly in which the Bible Lesson-Sermons are printed. Now she was only familiar with the Bible. But she turned to one of these Bible Lessons, the one entitled \"Are Sin, Disease, and Death Real?\" and began to look up and read the references that were contained in the lesson. One Bible passage which meant a great deal to her was ( [II Tim. 1:7](https://login.concord.christianscience.com/concord3/search/?query=II+Tim.+1%3A7&book=tfccs.main.hb.kj)), \"God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.\" She became so conscious of God's goodness, of His love, and of the presence of that love with her that she lost all sense of fear. And the thought of her physical troubles left too. Well, as we indicated in our discussion, the facts of God hadn't changed, and the facts of man's spiritual being hadn't changed. But this woman, for the first time, began to get a glimpse of those spiritual facts. And as her thought was transformed, an immediate transformation took place in her body too. She was healed! That night she slept like a baby. The next day a Christian Science practitioner was called and asked to help her through prayer. Within three days she was active again, and within a few months her physical appearance was completely normal. It was a wonderful healing, but again I want to emphasize that it was not a miracle. It was the natural result which followed a growing understanding of God. "}
