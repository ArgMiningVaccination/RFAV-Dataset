In recent years, people have started to talk more rigorously about this topic: period pain, symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome, etc. Now we know that the period should not hurt and that if it does it is very possible that we have an excess of estrogens in our body or an imbalance between progesterone and estrogens, for example. We also know that diet and lifestyle significantly influence our hormonal system, therefore, although each case is particular and should be individually addresses, the strong drop in estrogen that women suffer during menopause and all the related can be supported by introducing more phytoestrogens into our diet (considering there is no risk of estrogen-dependent breast cancer). In this article we are going to talk about everything you need to balance your hormones. Some of the symptoms that can show a hormonal imbalance are: - Irregular menstrual cycles - Mood swings, irritability, [anxiety](https://www.vitaeinternational.com/product/calmtu/), depression, [stress](https://www.vitaeinternational.com/stress-and-anxiety/)... - Unexplained weight changes [Fatigue](https://www.vitaeinternational.com/product/vibracell/) [Sleep disorders](https://www.vitaeinternational.com/product/calmtu-night-plus/) - Variable appetite [Digestive problems](https://www.vitaeinternational.com/digestivehealth/) - Hair loss or thinning Here are 5 herbs that help to balance your hormones: - Maca Maca has been used for centuries by the Peruvian people for fertility, hormonal balance, libido and endurance. It does not produce hormones but rather works as an adaptogenic herb which means that it adapts to each body's circumstances and balances hormones depending on that person's needs. So if a person is producing too much or too little of a hormone, it will act in the opposite direction either increasing the deficient hormone or decreasing the body's production of the over abundant hormone. We like to call it a regulator. It regulates hormones and keeps them in check not allowing them to get out of control in either way. Maca stimulates and nourishes the pituitary and hypothalamus glands of your endocrine system which are known as the \"master glands\". These two glands are responsible for regulating all the other hormone producing glands. With these \"master glands\" in balance it has the ability to naturally bring all other glands into balance as well. This herb is not just for women! Men benefit greatly from this herb and it can often times increase libido and endurance. It is a natural \"Viagra\" of all sorts. Also because 40-50 percent of infertility cases are due in part to the man, taking this herb may help with sperm motility, volume, and quality. - Red Raspberry Leaf It has a pleasant taste as a tea and is a nutrient dense power packed herb for women. This herb is best known for its uterine strengthening properties. This wonderful herb is a rich source of vitamins and minerals particularly vitamin C. Red Raspberry Leaf has many benefits besides that of a uterine tonic. It has been known to help increase fertility in both men and women, prevent miscarriage and hemorrhage, and help decrease heavy blood flow and painful menstrual cramps. It can ease the nausea associated with pregnancy, reduce pain during and after labor, and help stimulate milk production. - Vitex Or (Chaste Tree Berry) This herb has a long extensive history of use for hormone regulation. It is often used for treating endometriosis, infertility, PMS, preventing miscarriage in first trimester, and menopausal symptoms particularly hot flashes. Vitex or chaste tree berry. This herb helps to regulate the menstrual cycle and even helps to initiate a period in women who have had absent periods for some time. Vitex does not contain actual hormones but rather works to help naturally balance the body's hormones by way of regulating the pituitary which we talked about earlier and that it was one of the body's \"master glands\". By regulating the pituitary it has an effect on the function of the other glands involved in this system. The pituitary sends out the signal to the other glands to tell them when and how much hormone to produce. This communication system is called a hormonal feedback loop. If the pituitary is not balanced properly this will effectively throw off the balance of the other glands. - Milk Thistle This is one of an all-time favorite herb for a multitude of health conditions. Milk Thistle is one of the best [liver cleansing](https://www.vitaeinternational.com/product/vitarlic-cleanse/) herbs and a healthy liver is vital for hormone balance. Many women have an excess of estrogen and a deficiency of progesterone because of it. What many people don't know is that excess estrogens get filtered out of the body through the liver. If the liver is congested and stagnant the body cannot eliminate these excess estrogens and they re-enter the body. The liver is also the processing plant for our body's toxic wastes such as chemicals, heavy metals, fungus and other toxins. Many of these toxins can act to mimic hormones in our body and lead to further hormonal imbalance and disruption. - Oatstraw Oatstraw may not be the typical herb that comes to mind when people think of herbs for hormones. Oatstraw strengthens the nerves, calms the body, strengthens the blood, stabilizes moods, strengthens digestion, sooths the stomach, balances the endocrine system or those hormone producing glands, supports the skeletal system due to its abundance of bio-available calcium, magnesium, and silica, and calms the central nervous system. Other benefits of this beautiful herb are great supportive benefits to the hair, skin, and nails, diuretic, cholesterol lowering and heart health.

Even so, consumed in its proper measure and combined with omega-3 in a specific proportion, it can bring us great benefits. The correct ratio should be between 1: 1 and 4: 1 of omega-6 and 3 respectively. The problem is that most diets have more omega-6s than omega-3s.
