SoothingCONTENTS The world of Weleda, at a glance 2 3 V = Vegetarian Ve = Vegan and VegetarianG = Contains Gluten D = Not suitable for diabetics= Event Gift See page 117 for more information about our Weleda wellbeing eventsEGWe start with soil and how we grow our plants, following a regenerative organic practice known as 'biodynamic agriculture'. Through this we don't just nurture the plant but care for all biodiversity, from the soil through to the rich bio-culture of species, growing certified organic ingredients, full of vitality. Alongside this unique philosophy, what makes Weleda different is our ownership. We are still owned by the not-for-profit foundations of our founders, ensuring our purpose is authentic and truly lived. We see Weleda not just as a place for work but for human development - where we work at eye level with our co-workers, suppliers, and customers, in partnership. From creating honest, fair, and transparent relationships with our customers, partners, and suppliers through to embracing personal responsibility and accountability for our work. It is these values which enable us to create a sustainable, long-term future for Weleda through ethical, value-creating practices, where profit is the result but not the goal. When we're formulating products - whether creating pampering skincare, protective baby care or holistic medicines - rather than just creating a superficial quick fix, Weleda products are formulated to support the body's own healing process. We even created a whole book about it and are sharing some insights from 'Natural Wellness Every Day: The Weleda Way' throughout this catalogue, which we hope you'll enjoy and want to come back to, again and again. Our purpose is to help you connect with your own health through our products to help bring natural balance to your everyday life and to support you in finding your own level of wellness. Weleda is a place where working 'in harmony with nature and the human being' is much more than a catchphrase - it's our purpose which we have honoured since the founding of our company, over 100 years ago.At Weleda, we have followed a holistic approach for the past one hundred years. It underpins all we do, from how we grow our plants through to running our business. This philosophy has deep roots - from our understanding of the human being, our link with the Earth and how we are connected to the cosmos.A word from Jayn Jayn Sterland, Managing Director, Weleda UK 4 5 \"Weleda is a trusted and much-loved brand in our family . From my father to my youngest \"Weleda is a trusted and much-loved brand in our family . From my father to my youngest child, we rely on its quality in all areas of wellbeing, ethical values and most importantly child, we rely on its quality in all areas of wellbeing, ethical values and most importantly relaxation. I am a long-standing devotee of Weleda both in my personal and professional life, relaxation. I am a long-standing devotee of Weleda both in my personal and professional life, and I defy anyone else to match their all-round goodness.\"and I defy anyone else to match their all-round goodness.\" Erin O'Connor, MBEErin O'Connor, MBE Model and fashion ambassadorNatural pioneers for over a century - this is the Weleda way Weleda is a purpose-led business and has been since 1921. For over one hundred years we have built the path that many others have followed - creating natural, organic, life-enhancing products to \"support the unfolding of health and beauty in the individual, through working in harmony with nature and the human being\". It all began with a hospital and a pharmaceutical laboratory - founded by the Dutch doctor Ita Wegman, the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner and Oskar Schmiedel, a chemist and pharmacist from Munich. Now it has become the world's leading manufacturer of certified natural and organic cosmetics, and holistic health products: Weleda. Today, Weleda is sold in over 50 countries on five continents. Weleda produces hundreds of natural cosmetics and thousands of pharmaceuticals, many still made with medicinal plants grown in our own gardens. Responsible and ethical dealings with both nature and people have always formed part of our business, ever since Rudolf Steiner articulated his vision of a company completely at the service of human beings and the world as a whole. Whether it's through fair trade, biodynamic cultivation or the supportive development of our employees - sustainability is part of our roots. Leading the Way 6 7Right from our beginnings we've always chosen to grow our own plant ingredients using biodynamic methods. Weleda has eight medicinal plant gardens worldwide, where we farm over 250sq kilometres of land biodynamically, and over 50 long term partnerships with growers who use regenerative agricultural methods like biodynamics and organics. Weleda provides advice, expertise and the guarantee of a regular and fair income for all of our long-term projects, and in return Weleda is assured the finest quality ingredients at a fair price that ensures our products remain affordable for our customers. Traditional farming methods are preserved for local communities, sustainable practices are nurtured, and the landscape is protected from potentially destructive large scale development. The partnership We are Nature Planet, plants, people flourishes on a shared philosophy of sustainable development and environmental protection. Biodynamic growers always aim to promote and increase biodiversity, ensuring that we're giving more back to nature than we're taking out as raw materials. We consciously cultivate for wildlife's needs not just our own, so we grow lots of flowers just for the pollinators, feed the micro-organisms in our soils with biodynamic compost and provide plenty of different habitats and hiding places to encourage the rich tapestry of life into the garden. This helps us grow the best quality ingredients for our products and ensures that we're always working with genuine care and deep respect for our growers and the Earth we have just temporary custodianship of. 8 9 Biodynamic Gardening If you are curious about organic gardening and what biodynamic growing has to offer, then our book Biodynamic Gardening is the perfect way to get going. This incredibly accessible, practical guide comes with fully illustrated step-by-step instructions on biodynamic techniques for home gardeners and allotmenteers. Full-colour photographs and easy-to-understand charts and graphs provide helpful tools that anyone can understand. 404078 \u00a312.95B-Corp B Corp certification is awarded by the non-profit organisation B Lab. It is not products that are certified, but a company's actions and overall approach. The focus is on social added value and ecological sustainability, and not maximising profits at any price. In other words, it is about the environment, biodiversity, species protection, human rights, climate protection, employees and customers. B Lab calls it 'business as a force for good'. Zero Plastic Inside This certification, provided by the Plastic Soup Foundation, can only be awarded to brands and companies that do not use microplastic ingredients in their products. This includes liquid polymers which are still commonly found in many cosmetics, not just plastic microbeads. Demeter Certified Weleda UK is the proud owner and careful custodian of 13 acres of Demeter-certified organic land just a couple of miles up the road from our Head Office in Derbyshire. Here we ensure the eco-system is balanced, growing to biodynamic standards to ensure no pesticides or artificial fertilisers are ever used. The land is managed sensitively and we've developed different habitats such as a pond, woodland, meadows and hedgerows, which help to sustain a rich and diverse population of insects, birds and animals. Weleda's 7 other medicinal plant gardens worldwide are Demeter-certified. Living Wage Weleda UK has recently been accredited as a Living Wage Employer by the Living Wage Foundation. The Living Wage Foundation is an organisation at the heart of the independent movement of businesses and people that campaign for the idea that a hard day's work deserves a fair day's pay, recognising responsible employers who choose to pay a real Living Wage based on the cost of living, not just the government minimum. Sustainable Beauty Coalition The Sustainable Beauty Coalition formed by The British Beauty Council champions a beauty industry whereby all practices are sustainable, ethical and profitable. Weleda UK Managing Director Jayn Sterland is SBC Chair and her work as a lifelong environmentalist feeds directly into Weleda's own green policies and practices. B Corp Beauty Coalition The new B Corp Beauty Coalition (SBC) brings together over 35 leading cosmetics firms from all around the globe, to improve sustainability standards in the beauty industry. Its mission is to improve the social and environmental impacts of business practices in the beauty industry, through knowledge sharing and responsible innovation, with consistent and transparent communication. Through solid engagement, collaboration and coalition, they seek to improve social and environmental conditions along the supply chain, from raw materials to the finished product. Jayn Sterland, managing director of Weleda UK, represents Weleda in the Beauty Coalition as a board member. 10 11\"Animal testing is fundamentally against NATRUE's underlying values \"Animal testing is fundamentally against NATRUE's underlying values and ethics; a principle that is embedded in the NATRUE standard\"and ethics; a principle that is embedded in the standard\" Dr Mark Smith, Director General, NATRUE UEBT Certified: Sourcing with respect The Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) is a non-profit organisation that provides a globally recognised standard for the ethical sourcing of natural ingredients. It guarantees that biodiversity is conserved and used sustainably in the cultivation, harvesting and processing of raw materials. It also ensures that all our partners along the supply chain are treated equitably and paid fairly. Weleda is one of just two beauty brands worldwide to have achieved this certification to date. NATRUE Certification The NATRUE seal on all of Weleda's natural and organic cosmetics guarantees the highest standards of naturalness. The global seal identifies products you can trust to contain truly natural and organic ingredients, free from synthetic ingredients, silicones and mineral oils, GMO ingredients, artificial additives of any kind. It's also your reassurance that the product is cruelty free, because the NATRUE seal is not permitted on cosmetics that have been tested on animals.Increasingly often in the beauty industry it can be hard to identify which products are genuinely sustainable, natural or organic. The cosmetics market is flooded with 'nature inspired' products that, in truth, have very little natural goodness in them and do even less good for the planet. In an ocean of greenwash, how can we be sure that the products we buy are the real deal? At Weleda we adopt only the gold standards of ethical and sustainable practices, setting new benchmarks and driving the change within the beauty and health sectors. Our certifications are independently awarded, globally recognised and rigorously verified.Our Sustainability Standards Sustainable since day oneHow can I Get Dirty to Save Earth's Skin? Join our mission - alongside DIRT and Arizona Muse - to help regenerate soil and Save Earth's Skin. Together, we can make a difference, one small step at a time. For more information on soil and how you can make a difference, visit https://www.weleda.co.uk/save-earths-skin Whether in your own garden or community plot, it's time to get your hands dirty! By planting more native herbs, flowers, vegetables, shrubs and trees we increase soil health and help prevent soil erosion.

Download the Planet Positive Beauty Guide for dozens of practical ways to Save Earth's Skin - simply scan the QR code for your free copy. Because planting trees is one of the best ways to care for the soil, Weleda has partnered with charity TreeSisters, to plant a tree with every single purchase of Skin Food between September and October 2022. Given the incredible popularity of Weleda Skin Food, that's a lot of trees! To find more fun and practical ways to do your bit, Weleda has also created a useful bank of tips and advice on what you can do to help Save Earth's Skin. Visit https://www.weleda.co.uk/save-earths-skin for more details. Join us to #GetDirty and #SaveEarthsSkin Soil is the skin of our Earth - a rich, crucial, living biome. A healthy soil supports healthy life. But our soil is under threat - from deforestation, surface sealing and soil erosion, with the latter alone accounting for over 24 billion tonnes of soil being lost each year. A teaspoon of soil contains more living beings than there are people on Earth: billions of microorganisms and tiny creatures such as bacteria, worms, water bears, fungi, mites, springtails, woodlice, beetles and algae. These tiny inhabitants help make the soil fertile, enhancing plant health and enabling soil to store carbon and water. Weleda is embarking on a mission to help save the soil, the skin of the Earth, by raising awareness and encouraging us all to make positive changes in our lives - starting with simple, small steps. Not only is Weleda committing \u20ac400,000 to soil-focused projects across the globe in 2022 and investing a 1% of total turnover globally in climate protection, biodiversity and soil conservation but it is also launching a brand new campaign Save Earth's Skin, encouraging us all to treat the ground beneath our feet as we would our own skin. Partnering with environmental activist Arizona Muse and her soil regeneration charity DIRT and the Sustainable Soil Alliance, Weleda is encouraging us all to 'Get Dirty'. \"Weleda's Save Earth's Skin campaign is all about treating soil, the skin of the Earth, as we would our own skin - without harsh chemicals and in a way that demands care and respect,\" says DIRT founder Arizona Muse. \"It's a campaign that's very close to my heart. We can all do our bit when it comes to treating soil with the respect it deserves.\" Our latest campaign is fighting to protect our precious soil 12 13Soil contains 25% of all life on Earth and stores three times the amount of carbon in the atmosphere Soil is being destroyed 10 times faster than it is being created One cubic metre of healthy soil is home to over 5,000 billion living organisms 31 percent of greenhouse gas emissions can be directly linked to agriculture and land use change (IPCC) With over 20 years experience as a holistic facialist and highly qualified in several complementary therapies, Elizabeth joined Weleda to help share and support the Weleda Skincare Philosophy, as well as creating a Weleda accredited holistic esthetician course. She specialises in the anthroposophic approach to beauty - working in harmony with nature and the human being. Your Skin Not sure which products are right for you?

Our skin is also a mirror , a personal expression of ourselves - changeable, intuitive and responsive. When we are well and in harmony within and between our inner and outer worlds, our skin is healthy , radiant and glowing. When we are out of balance, unwell, stressed or struggling with hormonal or digestive issues, our skin reflects this too.\" Elizabeth King, Weleda Skin Care ExpertWeleda Skin Care Philosophy We are all individual and our skin needs different products at different times of life. Rather than a skin 'type', we should consider our skin 'phase', which is influenced by our age, our health and environment.

It should all make sense to you, be easy to follow and feel both purposeful and pleasurable. Avoid constantly chopping and changing your preparations. Consider your skin's phase as a journey - if you keep swapping products over the course of a few days, not only will your skin become confused, but you are unlikely to see positive results (and will find yourself with a cupboard full of half-used bottles). Instead work with your skin's own natural 28-day renewal period - also called our inner-moon rhythm - and try to commit to a 28-day process with your chosen skincare. You should begin to notice a change to how your skin looks and feels soon after you start using Weleda skincare, but avoid becoming too absorbed with the daily changes of your skin as this can sometimes be more disruptive than helpful. Instead, care consciously for your skin while at the same time taking a step back, trusting that the natural preparations are supporting the skin to regain its capacity to self-regulate. Divide your 28-day process into four weeks, and journal skin changes every seven days. This allows space for both the skin's processes to come into effect, and also gives you time to reflect. You may begin to notice how the skin's self-regulatory capacity increases as each week progresses. Perhaps this offers you an invitation too - to reflect on how you are feeling in relation to your skin, as well as on your inner wellbeing and relationship to the outer environment. You could also use this time as an opportunity to implement some positive lifestyle changes, such as addressing your sleeping patterns, beginning some gentle daily exercise or beginning to eat in a more seasonal way. You can find more holistic wellness advice throughout this catalogue and in our new book Natural Wellness Every Day: Weleda Way & Tone \"My skin is really sensitive, so I'm cautious trying new products. I love Weleda's Skin Food moisturiser and Gentle Cleansing Milk.\" Actor Lucy Boynton, (Elle magazine) Plant Story: Witch Hazel Witch hazel contains essential oils, flavonoids and a large amount of tannins in its leaves and bark.

Over 95% of adolescents the western world are affected at some point, but it's not confined to our teen years, adult acne is on the rise, with over 15% of all women now experiencing it*. The Weleda Aknedoron Purifying range takes a gentle yet effective approach for a visibly clearer complexion, without drying or irritating the skin. * https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/acne-vulgaris/background-information/ prevalence/Purifying Purifying Skin Care \"As a makeup artist, a favourite of mine is the Aknedoron Purifying range which I've really seen to improve skin tone and texture with just a week's worth of regular use. It's gentle on the skin, but keeps it clear and fresh for an easy makeup application.\" Makeup artist Sarah Spears Plant Story: Willow Bark Weleda's willow bark extract is sourced from organic farming partners in Germany from four species of willow. A natural antimicrobial with soothing properties, willow bark contains salicin, a natural anti- inflammatory compound. Willow is also rich in polyphenols including flavonoids, which contribute antioxidant benefits to help repair skin damage. Healthy ways to support and rebalance oily skin When looking for a cleanser for oily skin, choose one that is 100% natural. Ensure that your cleanser does not leave your skin feeling tight and 'squeaky clean' (this is never a good thing - skin should not squeak!), but instead feels calm, comfortable and clear. Facial compresses can help rebalance sebum production. Try a sprig of sage or thyme, with lavender or chamomile - add to 500ml of hot water and let infuse for 15 minutes. Then soak a clean cloth in the cooled liquid and apply to face for a balancing post-cleanse treatment. Do not squeeze your spots or blackheads. Instead give yourself a herbal facial steam 1-2 times weekly to support the skin's own ability to cleanse, clear and then heal. If you feel critical of your skin and find it hard to resist fiddling, try dimming the bathroom lights when cleansing and applying your skincare; alternatively, you could cover your mirror or close your eyes and focus on treating your skin gently and intuitively. This is also a great opportunity to awaken your other senses - sense of touch and listening to your skin. You will find more holistic wellness advice like this in our new book Natural Wellness Every Day: The Weleda Way, see p70-71Aknedoron Purifying Lotion Intensive care for problem skin, this lotion contains organic tinctures of calendula, valued for its wound healing, natural antiseptic action, alongside soothing chamomile and echinacea.

Used overnight, this lotion reduces inflammation and promotes skin healing, while during the day, it works as a mattifying lotion to reduce shine and minimize pores. 102006 50ml Ve \u00a311.50Aknedoron Cleansing Lotion Made with therapeutic plant extracts of organic chamomile and calendula plus toning organic lemon and grapefruit juices.

Skin is nourished, refreshed and moisturised for up to 24 hours, while a refreshing blend of essential oils including palmarosa, green mandarin and peppermint provide an uplifting shower-fresh scent. Pear cactus is sourced from organic farming partners in Mexico where it thrives in volcanic soils. The plant is harvested at the optimal time when the cactus' large lobes are bursting with mucilage. Putting a century of phyto-pharmaceutical expertise to use, we developed a unique, patented extraction process to produce an innovative 100% natural extract from the stems (rather than the more commonly known seed oil or flower extract). This extract contains valuable vitamins together with unsaturated fatty acids and hydrating polysaccharides.24 Hour hydration support for skin After cleansing your skin should always feel comfortable. If it feels tight, sore or irritated, look for a cleanser with hydrating and soothing plant ingredients such as aloe vera, prickly pear and marshmallow, which can be found in our gentle cleansing range. Give your skin a moisture boost around mid-morning and mid- afternoon. Look for cooling, hydrating ingredients such as aloe vera and prickly pear, which can be found in our Hydrating Facial Mist, for an immediate moisture boost. Keep the air in your environment moist. Place a bowl of steaming water and add a few drops of your favourite bath milk. Rosemary Bath Milk (p.67) can be particularly helpful when working, as it aids the mind in staying alert and clear. If your skin is deeply dehydrated, try to take a break from caffeinated drinks, and replace with a herbal tea such as chamomile, or try a shot of aloe vera juice, which is great for the gut too. Remember, that we can also gain essential hydration from water-rich foods - by increasing the amount of seasonal fruits and vegetables we eat, we are watering our skin from within too. Hydrating Eye Gel Our soothing eye gel provides an immediate vitalising boost of hydration and intense moisturisation for up to 12 hours. The roller applicator creates a pleasantly cooling massage effect, to help reduce puffiness and revive tired eyes.

It takes over 2kg of almonds to produce 1kg of precious oil. Containing omega 6 and 9 fatty acids, sweet almond oil is highly effective in protecting skin against moisture loss, and strengthens the skin's own natural barrier.Restoring rhythm to sensitive skin With sensitive skin it is important to realise that something is out of balance. And, like a sensitive soul, the skin can only begin to restore itself when it feels safe and protected. Alternate warm and cool compresses. One warm skin compress held for several seconds followed with a cool facial rinse will help the skin to build natural resilience. Build this into your skincare routine 2-3 times weekly. Create just enough warmth and cool to create the necessary contrast between the two temperatures. If your skin is hyper-sensitive consider applying a few drops of Almond Sensitive Facial Oil to your face before getting into the shower or bath. The oil will act as a natural impermeable barrier to the water, which will help to keep it calm while you bathe. Almond Sensitive Facial Cream Our creamy moisturiser strengthens the skin's natural protective barrier.

It can certainly be a busy life phase with lots of variety. This variety and its subsequent frequent environmental changes can be reflected in the skin. The first self-regulating process that begins to slow down is the skin's ability to bind and store water. For this reason, it is helpful in our mid-twenties to look for hydrating products that help balance oil levels while also boosting moisture. A combination of Hydrating Facial Mist followed by Iris Day and Night Cream will help skin do just that. Plant Story: Iris The iris thrives in inaccessible regions of Morocco's Atlas Mountains, where we work with an organic cooperative comprised of around 300 farming families and source our essential oil of orris. We also source iris extract from long-term farming partners at Casa Dei Fiori - a small cooperative of Demeter-certified biodynamic producers in Tuscany, Italy. The iris was named after the Greek rainbow-goddess of the same name - bringer of water and messenger of the gods. The striking rainbow flowers and the plant's ability to store water for long periods in fleshy roots confirm its connection with its mythological namesake.In our twenties - often a busy time of great change and development - the natural balance of our skin can be disrupted. Iris, with its reliable ability to bloom under pressure, regulating moisture and vital energy, makes it ideal for this stage of life. We combine balancing iris with soothing calendula, purifying witch hazel and gentle, nourishing oils of jojoba and sweet almond, to take care of skin that needs to re-establish its happy balance.IRIS. BALANCINGEG EG EG3030 31 First LinesIn our thirties, skin naturally begins to show the first signs of ageing. It needs intensive nourishment and gentle smoothing to retain its youthful resilience, radiance and elasticity. Rosehip seed oil is perfect for skin during this phase of life. Proven to renew elasticity and intensively moisturise, this rich, golden oil strengthens the skin's resilience to environmental factors, while reducing the visibility of fine lines. WILD ROSE. SMOOTHING Wild Rose Smoothing Facial Care \"I get to try all sorts of expensive beauty potions, but nothing ever compares favourably enough with Weleda's Rose Night Cream and Skin Food. I rate Weleda's authenticity. I rate Weleda's integrity. I just rate Weleda.\" Fashion commentator Caryn Franklin\"I have recently fallen head over heels in love with Weleda's Wild Rose Smoothing Facial Lotion, a light moisturiser with a fresh petal scent, natural ingredients and a great price. What's not to love?\" Makeup artist Kate O'Reilly*tested after 28 days Increased moistureRenewed elasticityWhat women experienced using our Wild Rose Smoothing Day Cream: +23%* +41%* Plant Story: Rose Our organic Rosa Moschata or 'musk rose' seed oil is obtained from rosehips that grow wild, without chemical fertilisers and sprays, gathered by certified wild collection. The rosehips contain seeds from which the valuable oil is extracted. For a long time, the seeds were seen as waste products - their high nutritional value only discovered at the end of the 1990s. Weleda's oil is pressed from the ripe hips of bushes that grow abundantly at the foot of the Andes where environmental pollution is minimal, the hedges a welcome source of income for the Araucanians and Mapuche, the indigenous inhabitants of Chile. The virgin oil is rich in essential fatty acids that play a crucial part in skin regeneration, improving elasticity and hydration.Bringing resilience to skin in your thirties Our thirties can often be a time when we struggle with balancing home and work life - responsibilities mount, free time seems to diminish, and perhaps we find that we feel more in service to others than to ourselves. This can show in our expression lines. Plant ingredients rich in antioxidants are particularly helpful during this biographical phase. Wild rosehip seed oil, known for its ability to adapt and survive extreme weather conditions, is very high in antioxidants and can be really helpful in improving the skin's resilience and elasticity. The skin around our eyes is also very delicate, thinner than the rest of the face. This means it is the first area to show the signs of ageing with the appearance of fine lines. Every hour, take a few minutes and step outside of your working or artificially-lit environment - and away from all screens - into natural lighting, ideally surrounded by nature. If you can't do this, simply close your eyes for 60 seconds every hour. Wild Rose Smoothing Day CreamWild Rose Smoothing Facial LotionWild Rose Smoothing Eye Cream A beautiful multi-tasking cream that is unscented, making it ideal for use around the delicate eye area.

The oil from the evening primrose seeds contains extremely high concentrations of essential fatty acids - up to 85% linoleic and 15% y-linolenic - which play a key role in the skin's natural barrier function. Our organic, sustainably sourced evening primrose oil protects against moisture loss, smooths dry and rough patches, and promotes cell regeneration.The Special Scent: Sustainable Sandalwood The Evening Primrose Day and Night Creams owe their soft, subtle fragrance to sandalwood. Sustainable growers of sandalwood are like the proverbial needle in a haystack but, at Weleda, we work with two dedicated producers, both of whom meet the strict UEBT standards. To ensure a sustainable supply of precious sandalwood essential oil, Weleda has invested in an agriculture project for the future which is part of a reforestation project in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. Every year, 2,500 seedlings are planted here in the open field. If all goes well, in 20 years' time they will be large and strong enough for harvesting. The sandalwood trees that are already growing naturally on the farm will be harvested bit by bit. Meanwhile, 250 trees per hectare are being planted annually, in order to establish a sustainable harvesting method. In this way, Weleda is helping to reforest and future-proof the work that joins people, plants and planet together.\"Weleda products are kit staples, keeping our cast's skin in top shape no matter what the day's filming throws at us.

I forgot how good Weleda products are until recently . They are cheap, organic and easy to order online. The lavender relaxing bath milk is good too.\" Author Meg Matthews (Country & Town House magazine) Plant Story: Lavender Rolling purple fields have long been a feature of the Moldovan countryside, where the rich black soil provides a fertile base for growing lavender. Weleda's organic farming partnership in the Rezina area of Moldova is currently undergoing certification to become the first biodynamic farm in Moldova. Resendjer farms over 300 hectares of lavender fields and runs a dedicated distillery for the essential oils. At harvest time the farm employs over 200 workers. What's good sleep hygiene? Nope, it's not how clean your bedsheets are, but how conscious your bedtime routine is. Numerous studies have found that the best way to support a restorative night's sleep is to do the same thing every night, in the same order, and at the same time - this signals to the brain that we are preparing to slow down, stop and sleep, and has been shown to result in a much better night's sleep. 1 Start an hour before bedtime, with an unwinding routine that will lead you gently and deeply into sleep. Try a nightly bath or shower with our Lavender or Arnica bath milk. 2 Create an environment of absolute darkness in your bedroom. 3 Be disciplined and stick to screen-free time from early evening onward. 4 Avoid caffeine after 3pm to ensure it will not disturb your sleep cycle. 5 Avoid vigorous exercise three hours prior to bed as this can have a stimulating effect. 6 Ensure your room is cool, and that your bed and your feet are warm. Massage Lavender Body Oil into your feet and then pop on a clean pair of socks while it absorbs. 7 Invite relaxing scents into your bedroom with a pillow spray, diffuser or simply by washing sheets with a dash of our Lavender Bath Milk in lieu of fabric softener. It really works!

Bathing with rosemary supports blood circulation and could make all the difference to someone who has poor circulation, Raynaud's disease or diabetes. Rosemary is a common ingredient in ointments and oils which encourage the movement of warmth - stimulating and enlivening circulation. A wonderful way to absorb rosemary's circulation-boosting benefits is to add Weleda Rosemary Bath Milk to a foot bath. The warm water with aromatic rosemary immediately stimulates blood flow and encourages warmth back into the area - a boon for those whose toes are always cold! A restorative rose, lavender and oat bath ritual 1 Prepare your bath by adding a handful of oats to the centre of a muslin cloth, and then tying it securely into a 'ball'. Then add a few drops of Weleda Lavender Bath Milk to your running bathwater. 2 Before stepping into your bath, add an extra layer of cocooning warmth to your skin by applying Weleda Wild Rose Body Oil with gentle upwards sweeping movements to your arms, legs, including your chest, tummy and lower back. 3 Now, sink into the bath, allowing the benefits of rose, lavender and oats to combine. 4 Following your therapeutic bath, gently pat yourself dry and move into a quiet area where you can rest for 30 minutes. Wrap yourself well in a warm gown and blanket. This essential 'wrapping' time allows the oil and aromatherapeutic aspects of your bath to gently permeate all levels of your being.

I really like Weleda's Salt Toothpaste; I found that my mouth and teeth felt clean and smooth after using it and this sensation lasted most of the day.\" Dentist Samantha inconspicuous, bushy plant that grows in the arid landscapes around the city of Arequipa in southern Peru. In the harsh climate of the Andes range the ratanhia thrives, with its spreading, branched root system serving as protection against erosion of thin, dry mountain soil. The plant has played an important role for Weleda's dental care products for over 50 years and is sustainably harvested in the wild. The root of the ratanhia plant contains calming tannins that strengthen and fortify the gums, at the same time relieving irritation in the oral cavity. Krameria lappacea Ratanhia Toothpaste Traditionally used by the people of the Peruvian Andes for gentle natural oral care, the ratanhia plant's natural astringent and strengthening properties are harnessed in this toothpaste. The root is rich in tannins which contribute valuable anti- bacterial properties, to strengthen and protect sensitive gums. We add extract of myrrh and refreshing essential oils of peppermint and spearmint, with calcium-based cleansers for a naturally effective toothpaste. 101002 75ml Ve \u00a35.25Children's Tooth Gel Natural care for children's delicate first teeth.

Highly concentrated, when diluted this 50ml bottle makes more than 5 litres of mouthwash, saving space in your bathroom cabinet or wash bag. 101009 50ml V \u00a39.25Salt Toothpaste Natural sea salt and sodium bicarbonate help neutralise harmful plaque acids, protecting teeth from the build-up of plaque, tartar or staining. Sea salt stimulates salivation to increase the cleaning power of the ingredients in this mouth-watering formulation. The zesty, salty taste is freshened with essential oil of peppermint, for tingly-fresh cleansing.

In fact the list of things not included in our range is equally if not more significant: no detergents, bleaches, foam boosters or optical brighteners, nor synthetic fragrances, colourants, flavourings, sweetening agents, emulsifiers, disinfectants or triclosan, so the balance of natural flora in the mouth is not disturbed.

This is the subject of what is known as true cost accounting. We want to know the true costs and also find out what positive effect biodynamic cultivation has. The initial results offer hope: bitter oranges from Egypt, which we use for neroli oil, have a benefit of 3.30 euros per kilogram and 600 euros per hec tare of cultivated land. This is because more CO2 is bound than emitted by the compost incorporated into the soil. By way of comparison: conven tionally grown bitter oranges generate a loss of 4.50 euros per kilogram.

The soothing properties of white mallow help calm and protect reactive and hypersensitive skin, relieving itching and promoting healthy skin development. The polysaccharides in its roots are particularly effective and, combined with water, form an organic gel which provides moisture, alleviates irritation and envelopes the skin in a soothing cocoon. Organic coconut oil provides high levels of vitamin E which is essential for healthy skin growth and repair, keeping skin smooth and protecting against chapping and cracking. Recent research has also shown its effectiveness in treating atopic dermatitis in Nappy Change Cream Nappy time can be a happier time, with a highly soothing cream that calms even the most sensitive skin. Especially formulated for hypersensitive and atopic skin in babies, this cream blends organic extracts from calming organic white mallow and skin- kind wild pansy with organic sesame and coconut oils to help maintain healthy skin. Comforting zinc oxide protects against damp, and the gentle scent comes from organic golden beeswax and organic coconut oil. No added fragrance. 105801 50ml V \u00a39.50Derma White Mallow Face Cream This soothing and comforting cream for baby's hypersensitive, dry or atopic skin contains no added fragrance and was created with midwives. Nature's kindest gifts unite to cosset, care and bring skin back to centre. This softest cream combines the tender touch of calming organic mallow and gentle wild pansy extracts with nourishing organic oils of coconut and sweet almond. Organic golden beeswax creates a light water-resistant, protective layer that is ideal for dry and itchy skin. 105802 50ml V \u00a311.50 Plant Story: White Mallow At first glance, it is a rather delicate plant, but the white mallow can in fact withstand lack of water and extremes of heat with remarkable resilience. This is due to the gel-like mucilage in the flowers and roots, which prevent the plant from drying out and give mallow its soothing, emollient, protective and moisturising properties. Its delicate fragrance has a calming effect on the senses too, making it a perfect partner for baby skincare. Derma White Mallow Body Lotion Weleda asked midwives to advise on the perfect moisturising lotion, and they helped us choose the most delicate formula we've ever made. Organic white mallow extract wraps baby in a cooling protective layer, kind-hearted wild pansy extract soothes irritation, and organic coconut and sesame oils nurture the skin. The fragrance-free body lotion relieves itchiness and creates a pleasant calming sensation on the skin with just the subtle scent of coconut oil. For delicate skin that needs cosseting, it can be used by the whole family, including adults with highly sensitive skin. 105803 200ml V \u00a313.50 Accredited by the National Eczema Association With extracts of organic white mallow, pansy, organic coconut oil, borage seed oil, organic cocoa butter and sesame oil, Weleda's white mallow fragrance-free products soothe and provide intensive care for skin prone to irritation.

Our 2-in-1 Shampoo & Body Washes were developed by kids, for kids - and everything from the animal-tastic tubes to the upbeat all-natural scents are designed to bring big smiles into the bathroom. Mild and gentle cleansing for both skin and hair, in three fun fragrances. \"Probably as many as 700 different bacteria live in the mouth, some good, some bad, but in harmony - it doesn't take much to upset the balance. Some toothpastes and mouthwashes can contain quite harsh ingredients that can do exactly this. Natural products tend to avoid these harsh ingredients. I dislike the ingredient triclosan which is a known irritant - a range of studies suggest potential harmful effects for human health and polluting the planet. I also like to avoid sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), a foaming agent, as it may cause ulcers.

Farming in this way isn't easy but it is well worth the extra effort we go to as our plants make potent tinctures from which we make your medicines. Weleda has the largest medicinal plant gardens in Europe, home to over 1,000 different species of plant growing on 23 hectares, around 50 different types of bird and more than 30 species of wild bee.

Their job is to nurture, ensuring the plant itself and its environment is healthy. We use our own seed bank as we believe this makes for plants most suited to our environment here in Derbyshire. We use traditional farming methods as it makes sense to rotate our growing beds annually, and we combine wisdom from our many seasons of gardening, creating active composts to feed the soil from our own plant materials; we make our own biodynamic garden preparations from our natural materials which we spray in the Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.

Always read the label. Plant Story: Arnica Arnica is an alpine plant and for this reason it does not thrive in our lowland Derbyshire soil at Weleda HQ in the UK. Instead, Weleda obtains Scottish-grown and biodynamically cultivated arnica from our longterm grower, Duncan Ross. Each year Duncan makes a ten- hour drive with a freshly-harvested crop. The day before the crop arrives, Duncan and four other gardeners are busy, carefully lifting each arnica plant, roots and all (planta tota), washing the roots and removing any discoloured and broken leaves. The plants are then placed upright in boxes, with their roots in fresh water, ready for the journey to Weleda Head Office. In the cool twilight hours, he sets off transporting around 100 kilos of whole fresh plants. Our Weleda gardeners meet and greet Duncan early doors - scrubbed- down and gowned-up to meet the stringent rules we work to in our pharmaceutical laboratories - and take delivery of his precious cargo. Every member of staff at Weleda knows when it's 'Arnica Day' and is ready to chip in as and when they are required. It is critical the arnica plants are processed as soon as possible in order to capture the plant's vitality. It's this duty of care to our plants and production that gives our arnica products their valuable potency and power. Always seek medical advice if your symptoms persist or are causing problems. Always read the label. Arnica 6X Tablets A homeopathic medicine, in tablet form, for accident upset. A handy addition to the family first aid kit.

The plant is famous for its calming properties and a valued natural anti-inflammatory with a soothing, repairing effect on the skin. \"We found the Weleda Hand Sanitiser perfect at London Fashion Show when prepping the models backstage. It's surprisingly gentle on hands, with a lovely refreshing natural scent that isn't overpowering, and it dries fast which is essential when under time pressure. We liked the fact that the ingredients are all organic, and vegan friendly , and the glass bottle is recyclable. It has become a staple for my kit.\" Makeup designer Famida Pathan Calendula & Chamomile Hand Sanitiser is made with natural ingredients that provide effective anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties, with tests showing that it kills 99.9% of bacteria and viruses found on hands. The addition of glycerol to keep skin supple, along with pure essential oil of grapefruit to provide a delicate fresh natural fragrance, make this hand sanitiser both skin-friendly and a pleasure to use. What's more, the calendula and chamomile are home grown organically in our biodynamic herb gardens in Derbyshire, for the ultimate in sustainable ingredient sourcing. The vegan formulation is made with 100% organic plant ingredients, and comes in recyclable amber glass packaging - with a 60ml handbag-sized spray and a great value 200ml refill size - and both bottles are beautifully decorated with botanical drawings of chamomile and calendula. 102269 old empties into new trees Most Weleda packaging is easily and widely recyclable via regional kerbside collection schemes with local councils, such as Weleda's glass bottles and jars, aluminium tubes and plastic lids. However most councils do not accept mixed plastics, such as Weleda's squeezy PE/PP plastic tubes, or plastics with any metal components (such as a hidden spring in a pump or nozzle), and so Weleda teamed up with waste management experts ENVA to ensure that our packaging does not need to go to landfill. Return to Weleda All Weleda customers can download the Freepost Weleda Recycling address label from our website and simply drop off their package at their nearest Post Office when it's convenient. Alternatively, customers can drop their empties off to their nearest Weleda Wellbeing Advisor (there are over 500 all around the UK). Or if customers live near Ilkeston, they can drop off empties at Weleda's Derbyshire shop on Heanor Road. About Weleda and Tree Sisters \"Weleda is deeply aligned to TreeSisters' mission of giving back to Nature with the restoration of the tropical forests. They have been partners since 2020 and have already reached a fantastic fundraising milestone, and are well on their way to reaching their ambitious goal of planting one million trees. We are thrilled that they chose to celebrate turning 100 by growing a forest with us. We love Weleda's commitment to combating climate change and that the company has made giving back more accessible for their customers and encouraged them to get even more involved. Weleda has contributed to TreeSisters' planting of 22 million trees, and we are deeply appreciative of all they bring.

I joined the advisor network 10 years ago. I am a Kinesiologist and needed something to support my practice, to supplement my income and support my clients on their journey to wellness. Weleda ticked all of the boxes for me, and still does. But my journey over the last 10 years has been so much more than just being an advisor . I have grown so much in confidence. I have expanded my wisdom of all things natural and have attained so many other skills, through the collaborative partnerships we have, to increase my knowledge and support my kinesiology . I have met so many friends, both within the community and through the customers that I have helped. Working alongside Weleda has truly enriched my life.
