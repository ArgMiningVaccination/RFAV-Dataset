Was hington-Weik, Ph.D. The University of Texas at Austin, 2009 Supervisor: Toyin Falola This dissertation examines why healing among the Yoruba people remained a successful popul ar institution in the colonial period between 1922 and 1955 . The factors that allowed the Yoruba healing system to flourish were diverse. The Yoruba's indigenous and colonial political structures provided some outlets for continued healing practices. Additionally, the purely phys ical perspectives of western medical and religious competitors were unappealing to many Yoruba. Importantly, the Yoruba healers' systematic and in-depth know ledge of medicinal remedies was attractive to patrons. Furthermore, Yoruba healers' use of religious tools and/or the expansive use of spirituality reinforced this healing system as holistic, thus keeping the appeal of the system broad. Lastly, healers' alliances, standards, certifications and publicity thereof bestowed greater credibility upon the system and its practitioners in an increasingly impersonal region. While changes within Yoruba healing are revealed in this study, additional objectives of this work are to: illustrate the first known history of this institution; situate Yoruba healing as a legitimate system; include female healers in this investigation of Yoruba healing; and present a normal view of an 'alternative' medicine. The period of ix 1922 to 1955 is ideal to explore because various aspects that allowed the Yoruba healing system to thrive developed during this time. x Table of Contents Dedication............................................................. .............................. ...iv Acknow ledgements.................................... ...............................................v Abstract of Dissertation............................................................................viii Table Yoruba Healing............ .................................... ...1 Research Question.................................... ............................ ..2 Project Significance....... .............................. ....... ..................... 5 Relevant Literature................ ...............

Furthermore, this chapter examines noteworthy literature that, in part, serves as founda tions and inspirations for the ideas presented in this work. Next, the research approach discusses the theories, methodol ogy and the evidence that are founda tional to this project. The final section of this introduc tion provides an overview of the chapters that follow, highlighting each chapter's purpose, topics, and main ideas. Why The Resiliency of Yoruba Healing This project grew out of studies on Yoruba religion, culture, and langua ge. For centuries before 1922 the Yoruba were multi-religious. At the same time, the Yoruba maintained various philosophies and approaches to spiritual, phys ical, emotional, and intellectual wellbeing. What is rarely recognized is that the healing system was a significant repository for these indigenous perspectives. Worldwide it was not universally the case that healing was independent of indigenous religion, in many locations healers and priests were one in the same. However, the case of the Yoruba might cause one to inquire into how long both healers and clients of the system engaged in non-indigenous religions. Though the original intent of this dissertation was to pinpoint that answer, it soon became clear that because of a lack of data this assessment is too elusive to make at the present time. Nonetheless, the evidence contains a multitude 2 of insights that aid in discovering other important answers concerning this history of Yoruba healing. One area of interest that inspired this study is the Yoruba's unapologetic pursuit of medical pluralism between 1922 and 1955. This was the case for many who had full access to western medical care. Numerous Yoruba did not accept the foreign view that western medicine is superior and more effective. As with most African societies, healing existed before the arrival of Europeans. In this region Islamic medicine was also present centuries before European residency. During the colonial era, c. 1906-1960 the British politically occupied what is now know n as Nigeria, including the kingdom s of the Yoruba. Europeans brought their system(s) of medicine, which were unde rgoing a scientific revolution in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It was during the colonial era that the indigenous and western medical healing systems increasingly interfaced. This dissertation looks at relevant years of the colonial era, 1922-1955, because this period produc ed important social and civic factors that stimulated the widespread retention of the Yoruba healing system and a prevailing popul ar positive view of it locally. Research Question The primary question of this dissertation examines: Why did healing among the Yoruba people remain a successful popul ar institution between 1922 and 1955? This question is addressed thematically throughout each chapter. The various factors that promoted a resilient Yoruba healing system included social, political, medical, biological, religious, spiritual, and commercial dimensions. The foundi ng principle of this 3 dissertation is that holistic medical know ledge, especially as practiced by the Yoruba, was often effective and valid. Healing systems around the world are reclaiming popul arity and have unique historical circumstances that ensured their continued existence. The resiliency of the Yoruba's healing system was the result of many factors. For instance, the colonial political gove rnments as well as the Yoruba's indigenous gove rnments provided some outlets for continued healing practices. Additionally, the purely phys ical healing perspectives of western medical and religious competitors were unappealing to the Yoruba. Importantly, Yoruba healers' systematic and in-depth know ledge of medicinal remedies was attractive to patrons. Furthermore, healers' use of religious tools and/or the expansive use of spirituality reinforced this healing system as holistic, thus ensuring a wider appeal. Lastly, healers' alliances, standards, certifications and publicity bestowed greater credibility to the system and its practitioners. This project captures elements of Yoruba healing during the time period of 1922-1955, also referred to in this work as 'this colonial period.' While changes within Yoruba healing are revealed in this study, additional objectives of this study are to situate Yoruba healing as an institution, which demonstrated resiliency during this time. The themes are examined chronologically in the chapter 'History of Yoruba Healing,' but in the other chapters the investigation is organized topically. This dissertation begins with the year 1922 because this was the year that \"The Companies Ordinance of 1922\" stimulated the subsequent establishment of numerous gove rnment-incorporated healing associations. Furthermore, it was around 1922 that requests to sell \"native medicines\" 4 began to flourish in the colonial record. By 1955 , while Yoruba healing was still thriving, various locally organized campaigns against evil i.e., the Atinga movement, were declining in fervor. These anti-evil movements created another shift in the state of Yoruba indigenous healing because the system supplied the antidotes to evil. By the end of these campaigns, healing associations had become more copious and defined. Figure 1.1 is a Map of Yorubaland.1 This map of 19th century Yorubaland displays many of the Yoruba towns that were centers of healing between 1922 and 1955. 1 Peter R. McKenzie, Hail Orisha!: A Phenomenology of a West African Religion in the Mid-Nineteenth Century (New York: Leiden: Brill, 1997), xii. 5 Project The Resiliency of Yoruba Traditional Healing: 1922-1955 has multidimensional specific and broad significance. To begin with, it is the first know n history of Yoruba healing. There are hund reds of histories concerning the Yoruba, several works on Yoruba medicine, and many studies of healing in Africa. However, histories of holistic medicine in Africa are actually very few, possibly because some question if the evidence exists to sustain a historical argument on this topic. But, as one will see, it does. Since the Yoruba are the third most popul ous ethnicity in Africa, it is possible to consider a study of this nature as a model for exploring healing among other African cultures and societies. Furthermore, examining the history of healing in a tropical rainforest region is ideal for health studies because of the wealth of natural healing resources available in this environment. Moreover, there is a large phys ical and cultural Yoruba Diaspora with remarkable presence in the United States, England, Cuba, Brazil and Trinidad. The Yoruba healing systems are present in these locations as well. Thus, this research has implications for the study of healing throughout the global Yoruba Diaspora. The broader impact of this project pertains to the fact that healing is still the primary source of healthcare for many parts of the world. Nigeria alone has an estimated 900,000 indigenous healers registered with the governmental association. Documented studies in Benin City, Nigeria, estimate the ratio of healers to the population is 1:110, while the ratio of medical doctors to the popul ation is 1:16,400.2 The World Health 2 Rufaro Chatora. \"An Overview of the Traditional Medicine Situation in the African Region.\" African Health Monitor: A Magazine of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa. (World Health Organization. 2003), 5. 6 Organization (WHO) states, \"In Africa, up to 80% of the popul ation uses traditional medicine for primary health care.\"3 This history of such a popul ar form of medicine will inform not only scientific, social, political and econom ic studies and approaches to healthcare in Nigeria, but it will also enlighten the entire developing world including Africa, Asia and Latin America. The benefit that this study provides to the indus trialized world, such as the United States, is to provide background and data to assess the standardization of approaches to healing and other types of alternative medicine. The ever-growing recapturing or the recognition of the popul arity of alternative and natural remedies in western medical treatment worldwide demands that histories such as this one be written to explain how varying medical approaches coexisted. This study also provides reasons for people's historically pluralistic choices, and explanations why Yoruba healing prevailed despite competition and even attack from certain professional and social elements i.e., from Christian missionaries. Holistic healing has been a primary source of healthcare for the majority of the world because of purely \"econom ic\" circumstances, and because it has been a conscious choice of people for phys ical, social, psychological, spiritual and political reasons, regardless of econom ics. Understanding the complex rationale for these historical choices may lead to better healthcare worldwide. Relevant Literature Only selective publications related to this project are acknow ledged in this section. The goal of this literature review is to incorporate certain perspectives from the 3 \"Fact sheet,\" World Health Organization (WHO). 2007. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs134/en/ (accessed, August 4, 2008). 7 most highly relevant materials that have informed this dissertation. Several significant texts discussed below that do not pertain to Yoruba, may concern African healing or the topic of indigenous medicine from an international perspective. Additionally, what is revealed in this review is that few works mirror the intent of this project. The most closely related studies to this project are by authors Mary Adekson, Anthony Buckley, Peter Dopamu, Una Maclean, D. Oyebola, Osunwole and George Simpson. Each of these authors' work contributes to the development of this topic although most are not intended as historic treatments of Yoruba healing. An in-depth analysis of the importance of the Yoruba healing associations is addressed in this work though it is absent in many other studies. Finally, the majority of these writings focus mainly on the role of male practitioners with little attention given to women practitioners in Yoruba healing. Nevertheless, these works are valuable and are quite informative to this project. Adekson's book, The Yoruba Traditional Healers of Nigeria, presents insights from case studies of five healers, examining their roles as couns elors.4 She gleans useful descriptions of \"techniques used by healers\" that she labels as her hypot heses. She notes that healers' strategies include: divining, sacrifices, herbs, dance, prayers, invoc ations, incisions, dreams, proverbs, folk tales, conve rsation/interaction with patients, deliberately positive environments, affirming words, culture and quality time. Other scholars of Yoruba healing use similar models to hers. A limitation of Adekson's study is that the healer informants were all male. As alluded to in Oyebola's and Maclean's studies, 4 Mary Olufunmilayo Adekson, The Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Traditional Healers of Nigeria (New York: Routledge, 2003). 8 women especially as marketers, midwives and diviners have historically been part of the healing profession in southwest Nigeria.5 Her work uses a psychological approach conve rsely this dissertation integrates female healers, examines Yoruba healing from multidimensional perspectives, and concentrates on a historical perspective. Yoruba Medicine by Buckley examines the internal structure and practical application of Yoruba medicine.6 As with most anthropological studies this work is highly theoretical. He provides a functional model of Yoruba healing by assigning 'symbology' for healing strategies relating to color and divinities as well as remedy recipes. Two critical elements in Yoruba medicine, as Buckley argues, are that illness is the result of excess in consumption and behavior and that the hidden and/or secret aspects of the healer and patient must be revealed or engineered to produc e a balanced healthy body. One drawback is that the book is structuralist, giving the impression that his presentation of information is the only unde rlying ideological and practical approach of Yoruba healers. Additionally, his two male healers-informants limit the scope of his work. Alternatively, this dissertation is historical, is informed by ten mostly elder male and female interviewees, and is suppor ted by a wide range of seconda ry sources. Maclean, Oyebola, Dopamu, and George Simpson contribute significantly as seconda ry evidence to suppor t the examination of this dissertation.7 Although all of these 5 Una Maclean, Magical Medicine: A Nigerian Case-Study (London: Allen Lane, 1971). D. D. Oyebola, \"Antenatal Care as Practised by Yoruba Traditional Healers/Midwives of Nigeria.\" East Afr Med J 57, no. 9 (1980): 615-25. 6 Anthony D. Buckley, Yoruba Medicine (Oxford New York: Clarendon Press, Oxford University Press, 1985). 7 Dopamu's dissertation \"The Practice of Magic and Medicine in Yoruba Traditional Religion,\" is a useful reference. This is because of the outstanding plethora of information detailed in this 714-page project. As a Yoruba scholar who had personal experiences and interactions with Yoruba medicine, Dopamu examines 9 studies were conduc ted post-1955, these authors relied on interviews of healers, and at times clients, that trained and operated prior to 1955. Therefore, the information that these authors present is applicable to the colonial period unde r study. Little know n works such as Dopamu's contribute to Yoruba healing studies; however, the emphasis on malicious \"magic\" unde rmines its limitations as a broadly applicable text. This dissertation differs from these works, especially because of the time periods examined and the focus on the Yoruba healing system itself, as oppos ed to the social impacts that Yoruba healing had, which this study investigates. Maclean's small yet rich text, Magical Medicine: A Nigerian Case-Study is a book that, along with her various journal articles, provides the insights of a medically trained doctor who lived and worked in Yorubaland from the late 1950s until the 1960s . Maclean took a particular interest in healing while working in local hospitals when she realized how much stock Yoruba citizens put into their own healing traditions. Her sympathetic view of the local faith in healing and their partial objection to western medicine was that this common local perspective was \"partly justified.\"8 Because the author was careful not to impose a western medical view upon Yoruba healing, the text has an objective characteristic to it, lending a greater degree of credibility to the information within her work. Conve rsely, many researchers with this background attempted to invalidate the system. the healing system from a holistic perspective, thus the use of the term \"magic\" to denote the supernatural components of the system. Dopamu's dissertation explores and explains the terminology, practical applications and recipes of the Yoruba medical system. The author's unusual concentration on the malevolent supernatural dimensions that relate to Yoruba healing would lead one to believe that the author was fascinated by the malevolent \"magic\" that has been associated with Yoruba medicine. However, there is a fair enough balance in his approach to the benevolent purposes of Yoruba medicine. 8 Maclean, \"Nigeria 1956-65: A Medical Memoir.\" African Affairs, 83, no. 333 (1984): 545. 10 Similar to the works by scholars such as T. Lambo, Maclean posits \"We have much to learn from Nigerian traditional medicine, whose various practitioners have long recognized that sickness can have social and psychological compone nts as well as phys ical causes.\"9 Magical Medicine was written for a Western audience, with the clear attempt of demystifying the Yoruba healing system and presenting the system as beyond superstition. Though this author is sure to point out what she sees as the deficiencies in Yoruba medicine, she also is careful not to illustrate it as merely placebo medicine. Informed by the interviews of 100 healers, over 100 hospital patients, some market persons and home remedy users, Maclean also discusses female healers to a larger degree than most works available during this time. Nevertheless, this book' s objective is mainly to provide another explanation of Yoruba healing, and does not concentrate on major social changes. Oyebola's several articles on various elements of Yoruba healing are quite informative and are also the result of extensive interviews gathered, in part, during the writing of his dissertation. He questioned hund reds of healers and, at times, studied with some\u2014as was the case with the bone setters.10 While his perspectives on midwives are harsh and disdainful, his reports on other types of healers were more impartial. It is clear that he used western medical standards in his assessments of Yoruba healers. However, it is unclear if the scornful discussions of female healers' verses male are because he is chauvinist. Dichotomizing male healers as more proficient than female healers, and 9 Ibid, 563. 10 Oyebola and Immun, \"Yoruba Traditional Bonesetters: The Practice of Orthopaedics in a Primitive Setting in Nigeria\" The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection, and Critical Care 20, no. 4 (1980): 312. 11 using western medical standards to measure Yoruba healing is avoided in this dissertation. George Simpson's Yoruba Religion and Medicine in Ibadan presents an oppos ing style of research to Buckley's, by surveying 272 people, healers and clients11. Unlike Adekson or Buckley, Simpson's work integrates Yoruba religion extensively. Considering that Yoruba healing widely incorporates indigenous religion, his investigation is extremely appropriate. The inquiries that were recorded in 1964 reveal that Yoruba medicine and religion were both most popul ar among the middle and elder generations\u2014this theme reoccurred during various time periods. Many people noted evil medicine and western medicine's inability to cure certain illnesses, like malaria, as a top reasons people sought Yoruba healers. However, it is unclear if these were the only reasons, and if this has consistently been the case historically. Pierre Verger's text Ewe: The Use of Plants in Yoruba Society is a valuable reference companion to anyone studying Yoruba Healing.12 This French born scholar of Yorubaland, Nigeria and Bahia, Brazil (another location with a strong Yoruba culture) was initiated into the 'secrets' of Yoruba healing and religion in 1953 . His work is a compilation of medicinal recipes he learned through intense, decades' long practical and academic research. The book is wonde rfully structured to unde rstand religious healing philosophies, categories of Yoruba medicine, and recipes with comprehendible details of plants, animals, religious references, spiritual requirements and linguistic insights. 11 George E. Simpson, Yoruba Religion and Medicine in Ibadan (Ibadan, Nigeria: Ibadan University Press, 1980). 12 Pierre Verger, Ewe: The Use of Plants in Yoruba Society. (Sao Paulo: Odebrecht/Editora Schwarcz, 1995). 12 Nonetheless, Verger's text is not a humanities study that seeks to contextualize or historicize Yoruba healing. Two authors that do not write on healing yet are scholars of Yoruba religious studies in historical perspective are Peter McKenzie and J.D.Y. Peel.13 McKenzie's Hail Orisha! A Phenomenology of a West African Religion in the Mid-Nineteenth Century uses the Christian Missionary Society (CMS) archives as the main body of evidence, and weaves an intricate web of examples from missionary quotes to describe the Yoruba religion in a phenomenological way. His reconstruction of the missionaries' descriptions in order to illustrate the 19th c. Yoruba religion(s) provides a founda tion for unde rstanding and characterizing spiritual aspects of this society by illustrating that numerous compone nts were not merely 'invented' traditions of the colonial era. On the other hand, the abunda nt works of Peel do argue to a degree, that multiple elements of Yoruba identity were Christian constructions. While Peel's works are extremely valuable, that perspective is largely discarded in this dissertation given the abunda nce of pre-colonial Yoruba cultural dimensions that were Pan-Yoruba, even if not labeled as \"Yoruba\" per se. Abayomi Sofowora's book , Medicinal Plants and Traditional Medicine in Africa illustrates the importance that multi-lateral groups have placed on healing in Africa.14 This work also demonstrates that the Yoruba city of Ile Ife, Nigeria was a hub for (O)AU and WHO research. Here, he systematically displays approaches to unde rstanding 13 McKenzie, Hail Orisha! A Phenomenology of a West African Religion in the Mid-Nineteenth Century. J.D.Y. Peel, Religious Encounter and the Making of the Yoruba, African Systems of Thought (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000). 14 Abayomi Sofowora, Medicinal Plants and Traditional Medicine in Africa (Chichester: Wiley, 1982). 13 healing methodol ogies, in addition to analyzing other issues such as terminology. Furthermore, Sofowora succinctly examines medicinal plants common to Africa. He specifies regions, making this a viable reference book for one researching healing. Sofowora takes a balanced approach in that the negative aspects of healing are not ignored. While he operates from the premise that healing is a legitimate system, he highlights that holistic medical systems within Africa have not been as well organized through gove rnment standards, for example compared to places like India and China. Indigenous medicine disadvantages, like imprecise dosages are listed; while advantages like accessibility are highlighted and elaborated on. Finally, Sofowora advoc ates that African gove rnments should implement \"co-recognition,\" of indigenous and western medical systems. This work is a general text, not intended to answer a research question. Edited volumes are popul ar within the genre of healing in Africa studies. Toyin Falola, whose expertise is wide ranging, has co-edited an unpa ralleled amount of works that incorporate the topic of health in Africa. The Political Econom y of Health in Africa (1992) was the first of Falola's books on health to be published. Here, Falola and Ityavyar coordinate multi-disciplinary and geographically diverse contributions, as is the case of most edited volumes in this genre. Falola notes that econom ic strains on healthcare in Africa caused indigenous healthcare systems to go unde rdeveloped, and that the hosts of other issues arising from lack of financial backing for the healthcare infrastructure have caused a violation of human rights.15 15 Toyin Falola and Dennis Ityavyar, The Political Economy of Health in Africa, (Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Center for International Studies, 1992), 19. 14 Steven Feierman and John Janzen's The Social Basis of Health and Healing in Africa is widely cited as a staple text for the study of healing in Africa.16 This multi-disciplinary work has chapters specifically dealing with healing history. The introduc tion to the section on \"Therapeutic Traditions of Africa: A Historical Perspective\" is quite constructive. The editors recognize that European, Asian and African medical systems have co-existed since the Egyptian dyna stic eras. The fact that Greek medicine is founda tional to Islamic medicine is better demonstrated in works dedicated solely to Islamic medicine. With a pre-colonial sizable Muslim popul ation in Yorubaland, this investigation certainly incorporates Islamic medicine. Feierman's Peasant Intellectuals: Anthropology and History in Tanzania is an ethnogr aphical account of holistic medicine and politics of the Kilindi people. In fact, one might argue that the author provides an innova tive definition of public health, as indigenous African institution here. Feireman examines cultural retentions unde r colonialism. This work discusses the political meanings of the king and the chiefs' powers to 'make rain.' Feireman asserts that royalty seized the ability to make and prevent rain from local healing specialists. Eventually, people began to associate centralized gove rnments with communal land fertility and famine with warfare and dissention. The author is careful to incorporate pre-colonial foreign influences on local healing traditions, such as Islam. Significantly, Feireman unapologetically uses the term 16 Steven Feierman and John M. Janzen. The Social Basis of Health and Healing in Africa (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992). 15 'medicine' in very much an African way\u2014\"medicines\" are whatever means that are used to make life go well.17 As many herbalists and pharmacologists know , \"powerful medical substances cannot be used to heal unless they also have the capacity to kill.\"18 This deadly side to the healing is reiterated throughout Feireman's work though medicinal battles were seen as anti-social and counterproduc tive. These types of similarities in the Yoruba Healing system are illustrated throughout this dissertation. Janzen's chapter \"Ideologies and Institutions in Pre-colonial Western Equatorial African Therapeutics\" in The Social Basis of Health and Healing in Africa examines Central African Bantu groups ' transformations of medical taxonom ies, healing institutional bases i.e., political vs. religious associations, and particular healing ideologies. Janzen's small chapter is more historical than his intriguing book Ngoma: Discourses of Healing in Central and Southern Africa, which examines the Ngoma healing system in Zaire (Congo) , Tanzania, Swaziland and South Africa.19 Nevertheless, throughout all his writings, Janzen is able to maintain his consistent academic position that indigenous medical systems of Africa should be examined independently, yet in context, and not merely as systems that contest or are contested by Western medicine. Megan Vaugha n's Curing Their Ills: Colonial Power and African Illness is a concise presentation of the cultural ideology of the colonial western medicine system(s) in East and Central Africa.20 This text pertains to British colonies; therefore, several of 17 Steven Feierman, Peasant Intellectuals: Anthropology and History in Tanzania (Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 1990), 97. 18 Ibid, 11. 19 John M. Janzen, Ngoma Discourses of Healing in Central and Southern Africa, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992). 20 Megan Vaughan, Curing Their Ills: Colonial Power and African Illness (Cambridge: Polity, 1991). 16 her insights are relevant to Nigeria. As was the trend among African historians of the late 1980s and 1990s , she partially addresses the colonial construction of ethnic identity, in this case\u2014the general depiction of \"the African.\" Vaugha n is able to extract the ideological purposes and results of the western medical arm of the colonial project, which included colonial medical officers and the missionaries. These two sets of western medical practitioners had differing agendas. In general, pre-WWII medical services were \"thinly spread throughout most of colonial Africa.\"21 Nevertheless, the perspectives became pervasive. Africans' health was seen in terms of biological race, with an obsession about sexuality. When that belief became unpopul ar, culture was used to explain indigenous holistic illness. More recently, those concepts have been absorbed by the idea that western medicine is universal. It is clear from medical memoirs that doctors depicted Africa as a place in which they needed to battle nature and savagery i.e., belief in evil. Vaugha n reiterates the point that despite attacks from western medical practitioners and missionaries on forms of indigenous healing these systems have been resilient and transformational. These types of issues raised in this text are discussed in various chapters throughout this dissertation. In Nigeria's neighbo ring country of Cameroon, Kent Maynard conduc ted research for Making Kedjom Medicine: A History of Public Health and Well-Being in Cameroon. Maynard's book seeks to distinguish transformations within the Kedjom indigenous medical system from the pre-colonial era. His position is that \"Kedjom healers and others have sought out oppo rtunities, co-creating the new traditions of contemporary 21 Ibid, 22. 17 popul ar medicine...[which] is the intended and unintended by-produc t of social interaction involving an extraordinary range of agents and institutions.\"22 Maynard examines 'pre-colonial' cosmologies and institutions of healing in social context, the epistemology of Kedjom medicine, the effects of European colonization and Christianity, the waxing and waning presence of healers in the mid-twentieth century, modern roles of healers, and recent public perceptions of the system. As a skeletal model this work is quite functional and the approach is valuable. Nevertheless, the dissimilar historical circumstances, social structures, and forms of evidence detract from the value of this work as a model for the study of Yoruba healing in colonial period southwestern Nigeria. Indigenous healing studies that concern holistic medicine in the Americas and Asia have provided inspiration for this dissertation. H. De Burgos's dissertation Indigenous Medicine and Identity in Nicaragua examines how the people of Veracruz de Zapoltal use indigenous medicine as a strategy to achieve cultural self-determination.23 Similar to the Yoruba, this healing system addresses phys ical, emotional and spiritual health challenges. Conve rsely, the Yoruba did not overtly use indigenous medicine as a key tactic in self-determination campaigns. However, Yoruba indigenous medicine has remained an important identity marker. De Burgos's study notes that the great Yoruba musical star Fela Kuti publicly advoc ated that Africans reclaim healing.24 Nonetheless, 22 Kent Maynard, Making Kedjom Medicine: A History of Public Health and Well-Being in Cameroon (Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 2004), 29. 23 This anthropological argument about cultural identity is common in African studies. 24 H. de Burgos, \"Indigenous Medicine and Identity in Nicaragua\" (University of Alberta, 2006 (Dissertation)) referencing Randall Grass, \"Fela Anikulapo-Kuti: The Art of an Afrobeat Rebel,\" The Drama Review 30 (Spring). February, 9, 1986, 132-148. 18 historical comparisons between Latin American and African groups become difficult because of the significant differences resulting from the timing and implementation of colonialism. A Latin American study that does directly correlate with Yoruba healing is Robert Voeks' Sacred Leaves of Candom ble: African Magic, Medicine, and Religion in Brazil. Candom ble is a Brazilian religion that is primarily derived from the Yoruba faith\u2014many of the rituals, divinities and philosophies are the same. Voeks' ethno-botanical study makes many careful comparisons of the therapeutic philosophies, religions, and plants of Brazilian Candom ble communities, as well as their precursors and contemporaries in Yorubaland. This work also includes archival evidence and a historical perspective. The plants used in Candom ble healing are mostly indigenous to Brazil. However, about 18% of the flora in his study originated in African locations, with many from Yorubaland. About 30% of the herbs he examined have multiple uses, and a significant number are useful in both spiritual practices and physical healing. He notes that multifaceted uses of herbs have, at times, created conflicts. For example, the herb carrapicho is therapeutic for kidneys, but it is avoided because people have used it as a popul ar ingredient for bad/evil magic.25 This work reinforces the global importance of a historical investigation on Yoruba healing. The ancient texts of certain Asian cultures of India and China provide substantial evidence for the abunda nce of these healing studies. For instance, there were at least 25 Robert A. Voeks, Sacred Leaves of Candomble: African Magic, Medicine, and Religion in Brazil, (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1997), 98-99. 19 2600 titles before 1936 on Chinese medicine26. Paul Unschuld's text Medicine in China: A History of Ideas, is one example of an examination on the wide range of therapies that have been present in China, and the reasons why such diverse ways healing arose.27 He employs several strategies in his methodol ogy, including chronologies, linguistic analyses, socio-political investigations, and structural narratives. The author explains that different dyna sties emphasized different ideas, about issues such as illness, religion and drugs. He analyzes religion in detail, includes medical missionaries' information, and translates indigenous medical texts. Such a large project, in addition to his other writings are imperative to consider when assessing any healing system, although the sources of very few other cultures could allow for the produc tion of such comprehensive historical analysis on indigenous medicine. Research Approach Theory Assorted theoretical perspectives have arisen from colonial African historical studies. These include, but are not limited to theories of: African-Centeredness, Subalterns, and Developmentalist. This dissertation accepts, considers and also plainly rejects various theories accordingly. African-centered and subaltern approaches to colonial history are apparent in this project. While Marxist ideology, conceptions of ethnicity and nationalist perspectives have been considered, the 26 Paul U. Unschuld, Medicine in China: A History of Pharmaceutics, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986), 2. 27 Unschuld, Medicine in China: A History of Ideas, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985). 20 evidence does not dictate these perspectives are fully applicable to this study. 28 Conceptualizing history from colonial, social-Darwin, and/or developmental viewpoints is inappropriate because these theories attempt to illustrate that Africa's pre-colonial past was backward and primitive, and that indus trialization has brought 'enlightenment to the dark continent.' Because of these core tenets that colonialists, social Darwinism, and developmentalist have, these theories are rejected here. V.Y. Mudimbe criticizes colonial histories because he believes they seek to establish Africans as \"the man in the bush,\" a stereotype which Frantz Fanon's writings graphically criticize with great detail.29 There is no doubt that many histories on healing in Africa have imitated colonialists, Eurocentric perspectives that have described Africans as moving from the primitive-savage to the modern-civilized being.30 These sorts of evolutionary, social-Darwinist, racist styles of history have at times been disguised as discussions on the 'benefits' of colonization, development, and modernized healthcare.31 Furthermore, there is a strong Eurocentric element to applying European frameworks to African societies for historical analysis, because it is in itself ethnoc entric, if not racist.32 28 \"Subaltern\" meaning the oppressed, commoner or underprivileged local people. This term popularized by Gramsci, is one of several of his historical philosophies accepted here because concepts such as cultural hegemony and organic intellectuals is also appealing. 29 V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge, (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1988), x. Frantz Fanon, The Wretched of the Earth, (New York: Grove Press, 1966). 30 R. H. Davis, \"Interpreting the Colonial Period in African History,\" African Affairs 72, no. 289 (1973), 383 discusses this primitive issue. 31 C. Neale, Independent\" The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge, 30. 21 Moderate and extreme forms of Marxist perspectives have dominated American and European academic African histories written in the post-independence era. Although these histories can illustrate the 'social, political or econom ic'33 impacts of colonialism, analyzing the \"impacts of colonialism,\" still positions Europe at the center of attention in \"African\" colonial era histories. The case is similar with structuralism and post-modernist theories. Various historians who have written on medicine and/or healing refer to Foucault and Fanon, for instance, because of the primary concern of coercive foreign power exercised in Africa, especially over African minds and bodies. However, when the historian steps outside of these theoretical approaches, then alternative agendas can be fulfilled, namely closer examinations of African social, cultural, political or econom ic realities that exist despite the oppression, domination and subjugation of colonialism. This work explicitly expresses viewpoints of the 'subaltern' and asserts African agency during the colonial era. Similar to James Wilson's approach, a large part of the goal in this African history is \"to reconstruct the local histories of ordinary people.\"34 In this respect, this project does what African centered histories have intended to do, which is to incorporate African values and frameworks into its analysis, while working toward a non-imperial, non-hegemonic, pluralistic, diverse, gender sensitive, hone st and self-critical approach.35 As the African historian Ade Ajayi repeatedly sugge sts African/ist historians should not allow the European influence in Africa to be the hub of African 33 A. Adu Boahen, African Perzspectives on Colonialism (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987). 34 J. A. Wilson, \"Political Songs, Collective Momories, and Kikuyu Indi Schools,\" HISTORY IN AFRICA 33 (2006), 365. 35 C. Tsehloane Keto, The Africa Centered Perspective of History and Social Sciences in the Twenty-First Century (New Jersey: KA Publications, 1989). 22 history. Furthermore, he even a argues that colonialism was just \"an episode in African History.\"36 The radical perspective that 'colonialism was just an episode in African history' is considered in this dissertation. However, when accounting for agricultural and iron revolutions, empires and migrations in the long-term view of Africa's past then Ajayi's assertion is not as much of an outstanding disclosure. Of course, as an astute historian, Ajayi observes that during the colonial era some African institutions changed, while others remained the same. He does not propos e that there are pure or static institutions in Africa, neither does this dissertation. Ajayi emphasizes the importance of acknow ledging the strength and resiliency of various African traditions in the face of European assault. This perspective becomes very important when engaging the agency of Africans in constructing their history, such as with the resiliency of Yoruba healing. Methodol ogy This dissertation does not aim to chronicle or designate Africans or African systems as timeless or static. Changes in the Yoruba healing system are evident throughout this work. Strict chronological histories illustrating incremental changes of a certain time frame is the most classic approach to history. Conve rsely, this project falls into the genre of histories that examine a topic during a time period, while recognizing transformations within the issue at large.37 The aim here is to not create artificial distinctions that sugge st overly dramatic chronological shifts toward new states of being 36 J. F. Ade Ajayi and Toyin Falola, Tradition and Change in Africa: The Essays of J.F. Ade Ajayi, Classic Authors and Texts on Africa (Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press, 2000), 165. 37 These thematic type of histories are most common among interdisciplinary histories such as, Nancy Rose Hunt, A Colonial Lexicon of Birth Ritual, Medicalization, and Mobility in the Congo, (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1999) and Vaughan, Curing Their Ills: Colonial Power and African Illness. 23 in the Yoruba healing system, though explicit changes in Yoruba healing are addressed. Lastly, there is a focus on themes pertaining to the state of indigenous medicine in Yorubaland during this colonial period because of the subject matter. This dissertation, as a social and cultural history of medicine, uses a holistic healing investigative approach to reach beyond biological investigative portraits of health circumstances. Social circumstances, gove rnment and public policies, environments and ecologies, in addition to beliefs and perceptions that impact individuals' health and healthcare systems are assed.38 As Charles Rosenberg points out, illness is a universal cultural construction of the experiences and realities of individuals and social superstructures pertaining to health, which must be examined in a myriad of ways. 39 This study integrates the perspective that indigenous healing is holistic. As the WHO maintains: Traditional medicine includes a diversity of health practices, approaches, knowledge, and beliefs incorporating plant, animal, and/or mineral-based medicines; spiritual therapies; manual techniques; and exercises, applied singly or in combination to maintain well-being, as well as to treat, diagnose, or prevent illness...Traditional medical knowledge may be passed on orally from generation to generation, in some cases with families specializing in specific treatments, or it may be taught in officially recognized universities. Sometimes its practice is quite restricted geographically, and [yet] it may also be found in diverse regions of the world.40 The idea of holistic medical approaches was suppressed and ignored in the Western medical system and only in the closing years of the 20th century has the concept 38 Janet Golden and Charles E. Rosenberg. Framing Disease: The Creation and Negotiation of Explanatory Schemes. (New York, N.Y.: Cambridge University Press, 1989), xv. 39 Ibid, xiv. 40 X. Zhang, Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review (World Health Organization, 2001). 24 made a resurgence.41 Holistic medicine means that healing was conduc ted on the phys ical, psychological (mental and emotional), as well as the spiritual levels of the individual. Janzen adds that especially in Africa, healing also may extend outside of the individual being more philosophical, ecological, political, econom ic and/or sociological.42 Historical studies of Latin American, Asian, Native American, Middle Eastern (Islamic) and African Diaspora healing systems demonstrate the holistic nature of indigenous medicine. For instance, in Native American medicine common social beliefs among the Navajo, were that disease was caused by \"soul loss, intrusive objects, spirit possession, breach of tabu [sic] and witchcraft.\"43 African American and Islamic medicine were also holistic and provide further examples for the need to incorporate all dimensions of healing. African American healing system(s) had spiritual and psychological causes and remedies for illnesses.44 Wild herbs were common ingredients to healing recipies and the extensive use of herbs reflected serious expertise of the natural world because most healing plants also are toxic and/or poisonous . In Islam, the Quran, provided guidance on holistic health for its followers, such as rules and prescriptions for proper hygiene and dietary laws (e.g. food taboos of swine, alcohol and drugs). Ramadan (the fasting period) is one of the five major pillars of Islam and in part serves the purpose of purifying the body. Additionally, exercise and psychological well-being are also encouraged through the Quran. Besides addressing 41 Augustine Meier, Thomas St James O'Connor, and Peter L. VanKatwyk, Spirituality and Health: Multidisciplinary Explorations (Waterloo, Ont.: Press, 2005), 1. 42 Janzen, Ngoma: Discourses of Healing in Central and Southern Africa, 6. 43 S. J. Kunitz, Disease Change and the Role of Medicine: The Navajo Experience (University of California Press, 1983) chapter by Jerrold Levy, 123. 44 Sharla M. Fett, Working Cures: Healing, Health, and Power on Southern Slave Plantations, (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002), 86. 25 phys ical health, Islamic medicine has demonstrated a holistic nature in the sense that it has often coupled with religion and because it has incorporated metaphys ical beliefs (i.e. astrology).45 Historical studies of holistic healing thus require examinations of these various compone nts of the system. Evidence Though the written word is forever inscribed and can be drawn upon for generations, there is no absolute guarantee of the validity or accuracy of any text written or oral.46 The orality of most African societies has caused African Historians to seek data beyond the written word. It is now expected that most African historians will use evidence from many genres. Material culture used by art historians, botanists and archeologists are viable forms of evidence that have been used to substantiate or challenge historical arguments.47 For instance, Okediji notes \"Yoruba visual objects are reliable milestones for a people who regard life itself as a journey.\"48 Nonetheless, oral evidence has become most common with Africanist historians. It is important to be aware of the difference between oral history and oral tradition. Oral history is often a personal, unrehearsed background of an individual or their predecessors. Oral tradition is an official social performance, e.g. poetry and songs, or oral bodies of know ledge that in fact, can be acknow ledged as a historical institution in itself. This dissertation 45 Manfred Ullmann, Islamic Medicine, Islamic Surveys (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1978). 46 Jan Vansina, Oral Tradition as History (Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985), 33. 47 As is demonstrated in Weik, \"The Role of Ethnogenesis and Organization in the Development of African-Native American Settlements: an African Seminole Model.\" International Journal of Historical Archaeology, 2009. 48 M.

Okediji, The Shattered Gourd: Yoruba Forms in Twentieth-Century American Art (University of Washington Press, 2003), 139. 26 predominantly uses written and both forms of oral evidence, especially oral history, while citing relevant studies that have prioritized material culture. Primary research for this dissertation was largely conduc ted in southwest Nigeria through the use of archival sources and interviews of healers who base their businesses upon local natural produc ts and beliefs. While there are healing practitioners of the Yoruba system that live on other continents, the likelihood is that they have more difficulty in obtaining prescriptive remedies than those that live in the region of the systems' origin. Thus, it is probable that they are unable to practice as often and have less experience. One exceptional place that has a similar environment where Yoruba healers thrive is Brazil. Since Yoruba were historically urban people, the research was conduc ted in specific cities, namely Ibadan, Ile-Ife, Lagos, Ot(t)a and Osogbo, although some healers resided in areas beyond these regions. Some of these cities are over two hund reds miles from one another, in a geographically broad region. These cities are historically significant to the Yoruba people, for modern and ancient reasons. Ibadan and Lagos, for instance are cities that grew significantly after 1800 as commercial centers, while Ile-Ife and Osogbo have enjoyed status centuries before 1800, having been ancient kingdom capitals. Archival research Archival research consisted of examining the Nigerian archives, local academic studies, and missionary records in the U.S. and England. Archives located in Ibadan, Nigeria were thorough ly examined and over 1200 pages of relevant material were 27 retrieved from the Ibadan archives alone. Additionally, Nigerian university sources included local theses, dissertations, and professors' manuscripts on healing. The CMS archives were examined in Gainesville, FL and Philadelphia, PA microfilm and extensive originals in Birmingha m, England. Documents retrieved from Nigeria were primarily colonial records, such as various Yoruba district 'Intelligence Reports', memorandum s on legal disputes, \"Notes on Customs & Superstition of Indigenous [Yoruba] Institutions,\" \"Native Doctors, Medicine-men & Herbalists: General Medical and Health Departments,\" various 'Native Herbalist Association' papers and multiple forms of 'Corresponde nce on Witchcraft.' While the colonial records are apparently biased, and have cultural know ledge deficiencies, they provide surprising details that prove to be accurate when correlated with other references. Though Yoruba people wrote certain materials in the colonial records, local post-colonial conference papers on indigenous medicine and enlightening dissertations have been retrieved for additional perspectives. The Christian Missionary Society archives in Philadelphia and Birmingha m, England also provided fruitful primary documents. The medical journals that had articles relating to Yoruba included The Mission Hospital and The Way of Healing. Because the CMS established medical missions in Yorubaland during the colonial era, various letters, reports, postcards and newspaper articles discuss the challenges of the medical missions including their encounters with local healers. These records also reflect the variety of western medical professionals present in the area at one point or another, including other missions and the Rockefeller founda tion health workers. Books directly relating to 28 medicine and healing in Yorubaland, which were not available or easily located in the U.S. were found in England. Qualitative Interviews Qualitative oral history interviews were in-depth, question and answer sessions with ten Yoruba healers. These ten healers are profiled in table 1.a on the following page. The group of interviewees represented a diversity of religious and gender classifications. The interviewees were ideal because of their family heritage of healing work, their exceptional reputations, even among other healers, their ages (predominately over 60), their activity in professional associations and their interest in legitimate research. Additionally, healers were selected via the author's and research assistants' social conne ctions and political affiliations, as well as network referrals, especially from one widely conne cted healer, Chief Ifayemi Elebuibon. Personal interviews took place in the business locale of the healers or their associates, and in homes. No interviewees refused to be recorded on video and/or audio, nor were any discernibly uncomfortable with it.49 Written notes also were taken during the interviews. This type of research required assistance because many interviewees spoke Yoruba as a first langua ge and English as their second langua ge. Dele Ajayi, a graduate from the University of Lagos and local business owner, operated as an exceptional and thorough assistant, translator and transcriber during the successful data collection for this project. At the same time thoug h, during most interviews other persons i.e., healers' family and friends were present and interested, and offered excellent insights 49 By law, students conducting oral history interviews are not required to obtain Institutional Review Board permission to conduct interviews. 29 as well. Dayo Adediran a University of Ibadan graduate student also assisted in various phases of this project's research.

The questions were asked in order of topical importance, to create a certain sequence and level of comfort in the dialogue , as well as in the case that the interview was cut short. Furthermore, many 50 Chief Aragberin is also initiated (partially or fully) to Osayin, Osun, Sango, Esu, Osaoko, and Obatala. 30 of the questions returned to a main inquiry focus on their teacher, often a parent who lived during the colonial era. Most of the interviewees themselves were children and/or adolescents during this portion of the colonial era. Therefore some of their personal information and experiences have been adopted into this project. The Chapters The primary questions stimulating this project are as follows: 1. Why was Yoruba healing resilient in the face of powerful religious and western medical oppos ition? 2. How did Yoruba healing maintain regional respect and prominence? The themes that will be addressed in order to comprehensively answer these questions concern the history of Yoruba healing, the Yoruba social landscape, definitions of healing, the role of religions and spiritual beliefs in healthcare, and the significance of healing associations. This section is a brief summary of this dissertation's subsequent chapters. 'The History of Yoruba Healing' is a chronological examination of the transformations in Yoruba healing prior to, during and proceeding the 1922-1955 period. Primary evidence is used to temporally outline the issues that are elaborately investigated in the subsequent chapters. Cultural, political, medical, social, spiritual and professional changes that impacted Yoruba healing are discussed in this chapter. The transformations that occurred within Yoruba healing between 1922-1955 are also examined here. 'The Yoruba Social Landscape' explores the interactions between African and European and to a lesser degree American political, social, medical and cultural systems. First, the Yoruba institutions are reviewed because they retained a critical influence on 31 the health perspectives of local people. At the same time, European colonization brought new laws, new diseases and new curative options via political, social and cultural means and therefore must be unde rstood. Colonization of Africa and the birth of scientific medicine occurred simultaneously. Although the two were not necessarily intentionally related, they do overlap and are historically unpa cked because of the competition western medicine provided to healing. The missionaries played one of the most prominent roles in this \"colonization of consciousness\"51 by using medicine as a key strategy for conve rsion. Thus, the evidence becomes clear that the lines between religion and healthcare were blurred from both the European and African perspectives. 'Defining Yoruba healing' establishes an essential Yoruba healing between 1922-1955 . The concepts that healers use to describe their system are framed here. Additionally, this chapter concentrates on the phys ical aspects of Yoruba healing. For over a century, there have been scientific studies that reveal promise in the healing methods of holistic systems, demonstrating these systems' worthiness and the usefulness of this study.52 This project works from the perspective there was efficacy within this system. Tangible healing elements such as medicinal remedies and applications become more localized and culturally specific when examining healing. This tropical rain forest environment of Nigeria hosts thous ands of plant, mineral and other natural medicinal 51 Jean Comaroff and John L. Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution: Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991). 52 The National Institute of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine has a myriad of trials. Countries such as China, India and Germany have undertaken such studies for decades. 32 forms of life that the healers were familiar with. Recognizing this know ledge is vital to answering how indigenous medicine has survived. Therefore, the variety of remedies that remained resilient over the generations is what provides evidence and explanations for the central questions of this study. This chapter also explores the types of healers, illnesses, and healing methods among the Yoruba. 'Yoruba Spiritual Beliefs in Healing' are two chapters, one concerning religion, the other spiritual malevolency and evil medicine. These analytical categories address the overlaps and divisions between healing and indigenous religious beliefs. They were not the same, although they were closely related and commonly co-opt one another. Healers and clients in southwest Nigeria were religiously plural including indigenous /Orisa53 believers, Muslims, Agnos tic and Christians. Despite religious differences, common beliefs in evil were basically the inverse of cross-cultural definitions of holistic health: that which enhances life, health, prosperity and social well-being. Evil was that which takes away these positive life compone nts. Comprehending the difference between religious and spiritual beliefs in colonial southwest Nigeria was difficult for western medical practitioners, and even today westerners misunde rstand the reasons for healthcare choices people make in Africa and other places. Religion and the concept of evil are examined individually because of their complications and locally unde rstood segregation. Both religion and evil among the Yoruba intimately incorporate 'medicines' or remedies from natural ingredients. During this colonial period, these medicines whether applied for munda ne or metaphys ical 53 Orisa is the Yoruba word for divine forces. 33 reasons, were usually associated with healing. Regardless of their religious persuasion and level of faith or lack of it in Yoruba religion, healers provided antidotes for malicious medicine, thus a medicine for metaphys ical purposes. Islamic and Christian perspectives and approaches to healing of the period are also evaluated unde r this topic. 'The Significance of Yoruba Healing Associations' examines the meaning of the institution(s) that increasingly affected and enhanced the prominence of healing during this period. Similar to western medicine, it was professional associations and the outcomes thereof that reinforced and eventually perpetuated social views of legitimacy upon healers. In the case of western medicine, conferences, journals and collaboration expedited the creation of an effective system. Although the Yoruba did not engage in the same style of information exchange, associations served socially significant roles. Almost every author who has commented on or examined Yoruba healing has dismissed the associations as irrelevant because they did not meet often. However, historically, it is not the frequency with which the associations met that mattered, it was the standards these organizations declared. Associations of various kinds existed among the Yoruba before British colonization. The evidence in this chapter reflects that early twentieth century Yoruba healing associations submitted incorporation papers to the colonial gove rnment. During this colonial period, the Yoruba healers formed colonial gove rnment-recognized associations, likely because of the preexisting social tradition of having associations. Furthermore, healers sought to eliminate and control those practitioners know n to be \"quacks.\" The concept of quacks was universal and found in cultures on every continent; 34 however, in this case, it clearly depicts the fact that Yoruba healing in southwest Nigeria was not an institution of quackery as some western medical practitioners in the colonial era and present day have implied. Yoruba healing in southwestern Nigeria operated with general standards, ethics and efficacy. All of the insights gained from the themes addressed in these chapters illustrate how Yoruba healing was resilient. Conclusion This dissertation provides the first know n history of Yoruba healing. The literature reviewed in this chapter reveals that there were previous studies on Yoruba healing by authors such as Dopamu, Maclean, Oyebola and Simpson who concentrated on documenting the Yoruba healing system in the 1960s and 1970s. While they give very little historical perspectives on the topic, Yoruba healing in the 1922 to 1955 colonial period had similar aspects, making their works useful. The seconda ry literature is founda tional to the history this dissertation illustrates. Nevertheless, this work engages the void left by the lack of comprehensive academic works dealing with Yoruba healing during the period of 1922-1955 . Each chapter of this project uses archival and oral evidence, in addition to seconda ry references. Primary sources are reviewed here, and throughout the dissertation reveal various insights. The oral history evidence allows this project to integrate female healers more than most previous studies. Also, Yoruba healing maintained a focus on both natural and supernatural illnesses and remedies during the years 1922-1955. Additionally, archival evidence indicates the impact colonialism had on Yoruba healing, issues that healers contended with in this period i.e., perceptions of evil, and the critical 35 role that associations played in perpetuating the success of Yoruba healing. The social and political circumstances that affected Yoruba healing, as well as the medical environments healers were forced to contend with during this period are examined. In the next chapter these themes are addressed chronologically. 36 Chapter Two The History of Yoruba Healing This chapter outlines the chronological developments of Yoruba healing over the last century. By highlighting the circumstances and changes within and surroundi ng Yoruba healing, this chapter provides a general history of Yoruba healing. The other chapters of this dissertation then elaborate on and substantiate various themes that are critical to comprehend when examining how Yoruba healing was resilient in the colonial era. Furthermore, prior and later periods are addressed here to provide context for the 1922-1955 period. Transformations within Yoruba healing are illustrated during periods: 1930-1945, 1945-1955 and post1955. The because the British colony of Nigeria's \"Companies Ordinance\" was established then, creating oppor tunities for incorporated Yoruba healing associations to form. The 1920s was also an instrumental decade for western medical expansion in Yorubaland. After 1930 healers increasingly used British currency, amidst a global econom ic depression. In this decade colonial attempts failed to control spiritual malevolency, or people's use of spirituality for negative purposes. It was the efficacy of Yoruba healing antidotes that controlled spiritual malevolency. Around the close of World War II the Yoruba continued to choos e Yoruba healing as a preferable health option and the year of 1945 was another pivotal year for the formation of over a dozen incorporated Yoruba healing associations. By 1955 movements such as the Atinga were 37 well over, and this year preceded the opening of the University of Ibadan teaching hospital. Yoruba Healing Prior to 1922 Healing within Africa is as old as humanity. Worldwide people relied on nature to overcome illnesses of the phys ical, mental, emotional and spiritual human bodies. In southwest (SW) Nigeria, indigenous holistic medicine was practiced since \"time immemorial.\"1 Although time immemorial is a vague concept, people have existed in the area for over a millennium. Since this time, people undoubt edly addressed their needs and maintained good health with the resources at hand. The ancestors of people who are today know n as 'Yoruba,' have occupied this region for over the last 1000 years. Documented evidence of the Yoruba's religion, which includes priest-healers, is abunda nt for the 19th century.2 One group of priests that also served as healers, repeatedly had political appointments, such as being the official couns elor of the king or having a special chieftaincy title. Reverend Townsend, a Christian Missionary Society (CMS) missionary wrote in his journal in 1847 that: The rulers of this country...[are] themselves up to be governed by Ifa [the divinity of knowledge] and other superstitions, who governed them by the casting of lots. Ifa must be consulted and Ifa must be obeyed in matters of the most trivial as well as of the greatest importance.3 1 Dennis Ityavyar, \"Health in Precolonial Africa,\" 36, in Toyin Falola and Dennis Ityavyar (editors).

University of Florida (UF) microfilm reel 54. 38 Thus, the integrative nature of Yoruba medicine, religion and politics was quite common in this pre-colonial era. The holistic aspects of Yoruba healing were not limited to interrelations with religion and politics. Healing addressed the tangible body, the mind, one's spirit, as well as social relationships and daily activities. For instance, one's occupational work could unde rgo healing in the Yoruba context by taking medicine for success on the job. Religious healers were not the only type of healers operating in the 19th century, for hunters and farmers also worked as healers during this time. Farmers grew food crops, as well as medicinal plants. These plants were used to provide home remedies or to allow healing specialists to offer their services part-time. Hunters, whose primary occupation may have been to hunt wild game in the forests, had seconda ry jobs such as being warriors and/or healers. Chief Erelu Onisegun Awo Odua of Ile-Ife, whose grandfather was born to 1922, stated: My father inherited it [Yoruba healing]. My grandfather was a traditional healer and a hunter\u2014chief hunter before he died. My father is the Chief Hunter of Ilare zone in Ile-Ife...My grandfather left it [Yoruba healing] for my father and my father taught his children...[Praise song] We are the Ilare's. The ones who make use of herbs. If this herb did not function, we will add another one to it. The offspring of the leaves that dances in the malta [pounding bowl; END]...This belongs to my father, of the kingdom of King Okunade Sijuade who was the patron of the traditional healers association...[I was also taught] from the books of my grandfather, my paternal grandfather gave birth to my father alone and he took my father from one place to the other so that he would not be killed, so after a while when he married my mother he came back home so my father now brought his father's book. But, I am the first child and I am inquisitive to traditional practice. I learnt traditional healing from this book..My father, the Chief Hunter of Ife is up to 75 years old [now]...[My grandfather's book] it was all based on traditional medicine. The hunters of those days used to have a lot of charms.4 4 Personal interview of Chief Erelu (Onisegun Awo) Odua, April, 2008. 39 Chief Odua's personal history of having forefathers who were both hunters and healers was common throughout Yorubaland. Remaining safe while journeying through the unpredictable forests was just as important as being able to outsmart a wild beast; medicine helped with these things. The fact that Chief Odua's grandfather wrote a book to compile his healing remedies was not as common, although other early books of this type exist, also typically held by private citizen descendants.5 The 19th century was a time in which more Yoruba than ever before became literate, especially with the proliferation of Christian missionary schools. Learning to write Yoruba or English did not necessarily indicate that a person had conve rted to Christianity or lost respect for their traditions. At times, people sought to document traditions. One of the earliest authors on Yoruba healing, Odumosu, published works from research conduc ted in the late 19th century. The idea of Yoruba healing associations mentioned in Chief Odua's statement sugge sts that there were pre-1922 healers associations. Healing associations, (or guilds in which Yoruba healers met) existed in the 19th century6 and of those, many were local ones that tended to be found in highly popul ated areas. However, many of the associations in which healers conve ned were religious and hunting associations pre-1922. While these associations were primarily for priests and hunters, those that had healing abilities befriended, collaborated and competed with others who had the similar skills. 5 If one could manage to obtain a variety of these personal books and compare them, it would greatly contribute to the history of Yoruba healing. 6 \"The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria\" CSO 26 J/1 Z/1c. 40 Above is a photo of Yoruba blacksmiths in Ile-Ife, Nigeria at work making the types of tools that are similar to those that hunters and farmers have historically used.

Figure 2.2. 41 The 1906 establishment of the British colonial \"protectorate\" brought a system of indirect rule, with new laws and manipulations of Yoruba politics. Furthermore, colonial rule coincided with innova tions in the western medical indus try, which were suppor ted throughout the region by the colonial political system. Additionally, there was an increase of European Christians who conde mned most aspects of indigenous culture. They included the morality and efficacy of the Yoruba medical systems in their denunc iations. One might logically presume that all of these colonial circumstances might have eroded the Yoruba healing system, but in fact, it did not. Nevertheless, there were challenges to Yoruba healing in the first two decades of the 20th century. Yoruba healing was contested in the second decade of the 20th century by western medical technologies, the curtailment of healing practices, and new diseases. By 1914, European use of western medicine became accessible to Yoruba people on a limited basis, in part because of the presence of several western trained medical doctors including Yoruba western trained doctors. Some western medical technologies that were not typically used in Yoruba healing at this time included certain pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and surgeries. However, because some of these techniques were unsavory, not all Yoruba people were interested in the options that western medicine had to offer. Circa 1917, the colonial gove rnment outlawed the Yoruba religious society of Saponna, which sought to control and minimize smallpox outbreaks. While the other Yoruba religious societies that addressed healing were not banned, this one was forbad because of alleged scandals that involved priests who intentionally spread the disease to steal from the victims. Yoruba healers still treated small pox cases, but discontinued any 42 overt associations with Saponna. Finally, the influenza pandemic of 1917-18 was not one that healers were profoundl y familiar with. Thousands of people in Nigeria died of this illness. Yoruba Healing 1922-1930 In the 1920s the changing medical, political and religious environments influenced Yoruba healers to fortify their system and take advantage of new circumstances. Healers attended to numerous illnesses that existed at this time, from stomach aches to reversing the fortune of failing businesses. Nevertheless, they took a fluid approach that changed with the times. In surveying the social landscape, healers had greater desires to clarify how they defined Yoruba healing. Furthermore, healers addressed their own and their clients religious and spiritual beliefs with greater diversity. Additionally, the significant increase in the number and types of associations that began at this time reflected healers' initiatives to provide themselves with more oppor tunities. The publication of The History of the Yorubas in 1921 illustrated that attempts by Yoruba Christians to separate Yoruba culture from Yoruba religion were well unde rway.7 This dissection of culture from religion was actually a trend in more areas than religion. During this decade, Yoruba politics also became increasingly divorced from various areas of Yoruba life more than ever before. This separation of life dimensions applied to healing. Yoruba healing was historically ingrained in numerous aspects of Yoruba society and this did not necessarily decline\u2014but, it certainly transformed. Nonetheless, 7 Samuel Johnson. The History of the Yorubas from the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the British Protectorate. (Lagos,: C.M.S. (Nigeria) Bookshops, (1921, Reprinted in 1956). Nonetheless, such attempts had been made before Johnson's, as illustrated J. F. Ade Ajayi, Christian Missions in Nigeria, 1841-1891, the Making of a New Elite, (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1965) for example. 43 the Yoruba religion was one main area in which Yoruba healing became more separate and/or altered. The greater distinction in approaches to Yoruba healing was in part because of the rising number of Christian conve rts, as Islam had existed in Yorubaland for significantly longe r. Between 1922-1930 the number of Christian conve rts never exceeded more than 20% of the Yoruba popul ation, and many of those conve rts still engaged in indigenous beliefs and practices.8 This also meant strong retentions of healing ways. There were Yoruba also choos ing to conve rt to Islam at this time who also exercised this distinction of Yoruba healing. Conve rts who extracted Yoruba healing ways from Yoruba religious practices, or from hunting and farming customs realized that they could still use natural elements and spiritual concepts to relieve an illness or ailment despite one's religion. Mrs. Mulili Atu Oyebisi, the head of one of Ibadan's healing marketplace, illustrates the ways patrons and practitioners maintained older practices while changing religions. She is a Muslim through marriage, but stated: I am from a strong Christian home. My parents were strong Christians and my siblings became pastors and prophets...I am a traditional healer and I sell herbs...One cannot become a traditional healer if one does not understand herbs or usage of herbs. My father was a hunter, he knows charms but never sold herbs or did traditional healing as a job or trade. I learned charms and medicines from him...I got some [recipes] from my father's book...My paternal grandmother was also a traditional healer before she died. My aunt [also] taught me traditional healing... He was over 100 years old, but we announced him to be 100 years when he died. My father died 30 years ago.9 Hunters and farmers were some of the earliest professionals that continued practicing Yoruba healing irrespective of whatever religion they chose. However, both 8 \"Census of Nigeria 1931 Volumes II\", Crown Agents for the Colonies: London, 1933. 9 Personal interview of Mulili Atu Oyebisi, April, 2008. 44 hunting and farming professions were historically aligned with the Yoruba religion through patron divinities, namely, Ogun and Oko. Devotees of other divinities that were less tied to \"professions\" and more elaborate in their priesthood organizations, like Ifa, were less likely to separate healing from religion during this decade. The increasing departure of Yoruba professional reliance on Yoruba religion was due to shifting environments, greater personal choices, as well as political and econom ic climates.

Figure 2.3 45 The 1922 colonial \"Companies Ordinance\" was one of the politically generated oppor tunities that promoted the resiliency of Yoruba healing. This meant the beginning of a period in which the colonial gove rnment allowed traditional healing associations to incorporate, and provided them with the oppor tunity to proliferate. While the majority of healing associations did not incorporate until later decades, the idea that such associations could be recorded and recognized by the colonial government was a win-win situation. The healers who took advantage of such oppo rtunities were concerned with promoting Yoruba healing, their own businesses and/or abilities, as well as the safety of the general public. The colonialists professed to have this last interest, public safety, as their main agenda too\u2014although the real primary colonial interest was to protect Europeans who sought to extract resources out of the area. Nevertheless, through the incorporated associations the colonialists could call on healers aid and expertise on relevant matters, such as disputes and questionable deaths.10 The Ordinance resulted in healers' burgeoning awareness that the colonial gove rnment could serve as an ally. For example, the gove rnment option of incorporating associations helped them to expand their credibility amongs t competitors and to further professionalize. In 1922, healers generally did not know that they could form or join incorporated associations. In this decade, some healers were vaguely aware of the Ordinance and/or had heard of other laws that pertained to the practice of medicine. However, these laws primarily concerned western medical practitioners, explicitly stating little regulation of indigenous medicine. Healers and herbal marketers were interested in 10 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 46 legal options though. \"Yesufu the herbalist\" wrote the Ibadan district officer in 1921, \"Sir, I have the honour most humble and respectfully enter my following application unde r your control for pass [a license] to open a shop for Native Herbal Medicine Store at Idikan Street, Ibadan. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.\"11 Personal licenses were not available for herbal marketers or healers. The western medical indus try was becoming entrenched in Nigeria in this decade. These medical alternatives dramatically increased in the 1920s with the initiatives of colonial gove rnment, western medical practitioners, medical missionaries, non-gove rnment organizations, and Yoruba phys icians. These groups were establishing programs, services, and facilities for the Yoruba during this time. Before 1920, the focus was on the European popul ations, but afterwards there was a greater focus on Nigerians having greater access to western medical services.12 Activities of these various groups in Yorubaland provided competition to Yoruba healers in unprecedented ways. Patients/patrons of these systems did not necessarily see the presence of both healing options as problematic or inherently competitive. They saw the increasing diversity in healing options as advantageous to them. Nevertheless, Yoruba were in many instances suspicious of the western medical options. It was a turnoff when the western medical attendants patronized or were prejudiced towards Yoruba people. Additionally, if the western medical professionals did not provide a working remedy for an ailment, or offered an unde sirable remedy (such as, an invasive surgery) then many Yoruba people did not pursue further treatment. The illnesses that western medical 11 Ibid. 12 Worboys, \"The Colonial World as Mission and Mandate: Leprosy and Empire, 1900-1940,\" 211-12. 47 professionals concentrated on were not always in accordance with what Yoruba people sought . Western medical professionals were limited in the kinds of the illnesses that they addressed in this decade, even for just phys ical ailments (i.e., skin diseases), but they were especially unequipped to deal with emotional, mental and spiritual problems. Western medicine did provide options and treatments to the Yoruba that were useful. This, coupled with their medical facilities, served as points of attraction. Of all the decades prior to 1955, the 1920s was the decade in which the largest proportion of hospitals was established in Yorubaland. Of these newly established hospitals, a missionary hospital was established in 1923, two government facilities opened in 1925, one missionary and one gove rnment facility were opened in 1926, and a gove rnment hospital was established in 1927.13 However, while hospitals offered more extensive services, smaller facilities called 'dispensaries' provided basic western medical options also. Dispensaries multiplied in this decade. Yoruba western medical phys icians were mainly permitted to treat only Africans due to the bigoted colonial customs and legal strictures. There were several of these foreign trained African doctors that established businesses in Yorubaland during this time. Furthermore, there were a few Yoruba who were trained in other western medical occupations, such as midwives and pharmacists. In 1923, a man named Joseph Ladipo Ogedengbe repeatedly appealed to the colonial government for testing, in order to acquire a druggist license.14 The colonial gove rnment did not quite know how to handle his 13 Schram, Development of Nigerian Health Services: Five Hundred Years of Medical History from 1460-1960, appendixes six and seven. 14 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 48 requests because he was Yoruba, and they only seldom engaged African western medical professionals\u2014and then usually only phys icians. They avoided giving him permission to operate and responde d on a couple of occasions that he should continue working with the missionaries. He first worked with the Baptists, and then finally, in 1924 , they asked him to seek help from the Wesley mission. Doctors office cartoon satire by Gbenro. Figure 2.415 The satirical cartoon pictured above , is in part, relevant to the 1920s. First, because in many cases health problems arose from issues of challenging lifestyles and political manipulation that Yoruba healers were aware of and remedied. Western medical professionals rarely considered the health impacts of funda mental survival issues or econom ic problems. Secondly, the fees for high quality western medical services were usually costly in this decade. On the other hand, many western medical services in the 15 Photo from the special collections at the University of Birmingham: National Concord, Sunday Concord: Selected Editorial Cartoon from Boye Gbenro's Collection (reproductions bound). Ikeja: Nigeria, Concord Press of Nigeria Limited, 1985. Figure 2.4. 49 1920s were free or offered at low cost.16 Yoruba healers and western medical professionals competed and overlapped on the issue of affordable care. Mr. Adeboje stated that \"My father was a very good herbalist...W e have different types of healers, and my father did not charge because he was a farmer.\"17 Chief Aragberin states that in reference to the time in which his father practiced Yoruba healing, \"Then it [Yoruba healing] was not for making money.\"18 It could be easy to conclude that western medical professionals competed with Yoruba healers and caused a decline in their patrons. However, this was not generally the case since patients exercised medical pluralism and used all methods of healing available to them. The presence of competition forced healers to seek ways to strengthen their offerings and to realize that there were more ways in which they could treat patients. New models and competition ultimately contributed to the resiliency of Yoruba healing. Yoruba healers did not take full advantage of the 'Companies Ordinance' in the 1920s . The two associations that were launched in this decade, namely the Ilupeju Society in 1926 , and the Native Medical Society in 1929 are only mentioned in the records and are not extensively documented with incorporation papers. It took slightly less than a decade for the concept that healers could incorporate their associations with the colonial gove rnment to spread. Nevertheless, there were Yoruba healing associations operating during this time. 16 See Ven. Archdeacon H. Dallimore. \"The Call From Ekiti, Southern Nigeria\" article in The Mission Hospital: A Record of Medical Missions of the C.M.S. (Journal) London, 1935; from Church Missionary Society Archive, Section 3, Central Manuscript Records (England: Adam Matthew Publications, 1996-). University of Pennsylvania microfilm reels 55-62. 17 Personal interview of Mr. Olusegun Adeboje, August, 2001. 18 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin, April, 2008. 50 Most of the Yoruba healing associations, or egbe onisegun that operated in the 1920s were locally-organized for communal purposes, and were allied with indigenous political leaders. For instance, the Ilupeju Society noted that their existence was with the approval of the king of Abeokuta.19 Chief Aragberin notes that his father \"was a member of this [local] association. As a matter of fact, they were the founde rs of this association.\" He explained that the association carried out activities for the king and had no know n interactions with a national gove rnment before the 1950s . 20 These locally oriented associations were the most recent additions to the hunting, farming and religious associations, which all served as templates for the incorporated associations that arose in later decades. Yoruba Healing 1930-1945 Like many countries around the world, Nigeria had visible social transformations during the years 1930-1945. In the opening of this period there was a global econom ic depression, and by the end, the world had experienced its second war, which was more global in scope than the First World War. These factors played an important role in the social changes that impacted Yoruba healing. The growth of incorporated associations, environmental degradation, increased use of currency, and the use of public trials to resolve evil practices are noted changes of this period. While western medicine continued to expand and rival local healing systems during this time, the Yoruba healing system continued to be resilient because of healers' efficacies, alliances and contestations. Additionally, Yoruba healing remained of people's 19 \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657. 20 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin, April, 2008. 51 spiritual perspectives, for instance the need for recourse against the evil initiatives of malevolent people. By the year 1930, healers had begun to take advantage of the 'Companies Ordinance' and submit incorporation papers to the colonial gove rnment. Generally speaking, these earlier societies' rules, purposes and modes of operation were not as sophisticated as the associations that appeared in later decades. The rules of the Lagos Doctor's Society of Shangode yi's House, established in 1930 , addressed two major areas: local expectations and colonial laws for the proper approaches to Yoruba healing work. The rules forbade abuses of women, theft, misrepresentation, and the use of vengeful small pox medicine.21 Even though the first rule demanded that all healers be members of their association, this could not have happened and was a too crude of an attempt to encourage professionalization. The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria/The Native Herbalist (Guild) of Nigeria submitted paperwork in 1937 although they noted that they existed since 1855. This organization's regulations demonstrate a shift in awareness of the possibilities that associations could actualize. However, many of the basic ideals still applied. For instance, they note that a main objective of the organization was for healers to \"assist one another.\"22 The concept of maintaining networks for collaboration was a common thread throughout most associations, local and national. 21 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 22 \"The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria\" CSO 26 J/1 Z/1c. 52 Figure 2.523 The First Native Herbalist Society professed a wide membership. The pursuit of regional, as oppos ed to just local, membership was becoming ever more popul ar at this time. As global markets expanded, travel became more common and the nation-oriented colonial gove rnment became more entrenched; local citizens had a greater awareness of 23 Ibid. 53 the potential strengths that could result from alliances with persons from other regions. Figure 2.5 illustrates the extensive breadth of The First Native Herbalist Society membership. The image shows a list of approximately 71 members, who all have official posts in the organization. This list does not include the general membership, which was larger. Some of the dozen \"sections\" listed in figure 2.5 reflect that the membership spanned important regions of Yorubaland, including examples.24 Another subject exemplified when analyzing declarations of The First Native Herbalist Society is the use of currency becoming a staple aspect to Yoruba healing in the 1930s . This association notes \"Every head shall contribute a sum on One Shilling (I/-) into the Society's funds every general meeting day.\"25 If healers had the currency for membership dues, then they must have earned this currency. The request of one shilling every couple of weeks must have been reasonable to spare. Thus it might be deduced that some healers' charges were near this figure. Nonetheless, the fees that healers charged in the 1930s were variable and are difficult to determine. However, it can be stated that this was a period in which there was a transition from healers not charging and/or bartering, to healers requiring payment in currency. When examining the associations it becomes evident that the Yoruba healers used various means, including networking and incorporation of currency to be resilient in this shifting social atmosphere. On the contrary, other antagonistic aspects to Yoruba healing arose, besides western medicine, such as the increase in polluted environments. It was 24 Ibid. 25 Ibid. 54 becoming obvious in the 1930s that urbanization, commercial farming, deforestation and neglect were eroding the towns of this tropical rainforest area. 26 Unhygi enic environments also created health problems that the healers attended to, although Yoruba healers were not always aware that environmental sanitation was a cause of illness. Before the 1930s, colonialists had been debating what to do about African beliefs in curses and evil spiritual practices. The colonialist used various terms to essentially concentrate on malicious metaphys ical crafts. By the mid-1930s colonialists felt the demand was so strong for their participation in resolving these issues that they decided they would hear cases in Yorubaland of individuals accused of evil practices in traditional courts. With more social anxiety existing in the 1930s than ever before, it is no coincidence that accusations of spiritual wrongdoing resulting in misfortune were on the rise. Many calamities that people experienced were the result of colonial exploitations and there were certainly misfortunes that were bound to occur in daily living, regardless of the time, place or people. At the same time, there were actually people with malevolent intentions who used special resources to disturb other people's lives. In Yorubaland, certain colonialists unde rstood nuances of evil practices among the Yoruba. In 1933 a district officer of Ife and Ilesha asked the Oyo resident officer if accusations of \"bad medicine\" or \"magun\" fall under the issue of \"juju.\"27 Various officers distinguished what they thought was \"juju\" from \"witchcraft\" from \"bad 26 \"Annual Reports of Medical and Health Departments,\" 1942, Ibadan Division, 1978 volume 1. 27 \"Witch-craft or Juju cases Trial of by Native Courts Forbidden exception in minor cases,\" Oyo Province 1150. 55 medicine.\"28 This was because they were using definitions from different parts of Africa and Europe. Some of these definitions were relevant to the Yoruba, and others were not. Nevertheless, magun or bad medicine in Yorubaland was exercised. Generally speaking, these Yoruba ideas concerned intentional, spiritually-affiliated attacks upon individuals that brought about suffering. In 1934, the Oyo resident officer explained that \"there is a class of native doctor who will...prepare medicine or juju...to cause harm to individuals.\"29 Of course, what is indicated here is the role in which Yoruba healers could have played if they created bad medicine. Nevertheless, healers made clear declarations that they did not engage in such behavior. In fact, contrary to the image portrayed above , most healers provided antidotes to evil medicines. Chief Aragberin stated that \"I started first with a particular cough , which I cured, when I was 15 years old. The victim/patient was poisoned at night while asleep.\"30 The poisons that he speaks of were a concoction or curse that caused this person's affliction. Evil activities resulted in a variety of misfortunes that healers had remedies for, such as Madar ikon, medicine that protects one against all types of evil. This is a principal reason why the mid-1930s court trials available to the Yoruba to resolve their conflicts were not popul ar choices of conflict resolution among the Yoruba. The few cases that were heard were sometimes of unus ual, obscure natures. The Yoruba had various indigenous options to fight evil practices besides healers' methods. The Yoruba 28 Discussed in greater detail in chapter 6. 29 Ibid. 30 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin, April, 2008. 56 religion, as well as societies such as the semi-political Oro and Gelede societies sought to ensure that spiritual power was not misused. Laypersons used home remedies to detect if someone had intentionally generated misfortune for another. With these assorted ways in which the Yoruba could counteract evil practices, the courts were the most unattractive choice. In any case, Yoruba healers were consistently available and vastly know ledgeable in how to remedy such cases. As the decade of the 1940s opened, an independent Christian church movement named the Aladura spread and presented an alternative type of competition to Yoruba healing than the various missionaries who had established medical facilities throughout Yorubaland. While the Aladura did not institute medical facilities per se, the church focused on faith-healing. The Aladura used rituals, as did the Yoruba religious healers. They also incorporated prayers and fasting to aid in an individual's holistic healing. This church provided ways to counteract evil practices. Ultimately, the church, which began to expand widely in the 1940s , not only contended with Yoruba healing, in several instances Aladura complimented Yoruba healing. Chief Erelu Odua stated, \"I became a Christian and even established a church\u2014a Cherubim and Seraphim church but...when I was operating the church I used traditional medicines to do the things of the church...\"31 31 Personal interview of Chief Erelu (Onisegun Awo) Odua, April, 2008. Although her testimony of her own personal experience only occurred in the 1980s/1990s other such cases are alluded to for the 1940s period\u2014but none found to be explicitly stated. 57 This circa 1930s photo is a \"kola market near Lagos.\" Kola nuts were used for many purposes between 1922-1955 including as a whole or part of Yoruba medicines. Figure 2.6.32 By 1945, Nigeria had been affected by World War II because Britain extracted soldiers and resources from the region. This impacted Yoruba healing on several levels. First, Yoruba healers were expos ed more intimately to foreign medical concepts, via soldiers' service and other means of international interaction. Secondly, the financial situation of the region dictated that people continued to become more currency oriented. Thirdly, there was a growing awareness of nationalism in the air, and to healers this 32 Photo from the special collections at the University of Birmingham, CMS Unofficial Papers, Acc 233 F10/1-103 1860-1930. Figure 2.6. 58 meant a deeper drive to obtain status. Likewise, the multiplication of media outlets and overall commercial advertising influenced healers to promote themselves in new ways. Yoruba Healing 1945-1955 The Yoruba healing system retained aspects of itself that were effective, such as usage of certain remedies. Meanwhile, it adapted to the post-WWII climate, via patrons' and practitioners innova tive styles and approaches. The expansion of Christianity via medical facilities, schools and of course churches, impacted Yoruba healing in numerous ways. During this time, the status of priest-healers came into greater question; healers sought to institutionalize Yoruba healing; and lay person's attempted new methods to handle evil practices. As colonialism drew closer to its end, Yoruba healing continued to be resilient by adjusting to shifts in political, social, religious, and cultural circumstances. The status of Yoruba priest-healers was in question after 1945 for various reasons, including the efforts of non-priest Yoruba healers, and because of new choices that the Yoruba priest-healers took themselves. Yoruba healers that came from hunting and farming lineages, or from less-influential Yoruba religious societies like Saponna, which was outlawed by this time, sought to gain an equal amount of recognition for being as effective healers as priest-healers, especially priests of Ifa the divinity of wisdom. Yoruba religious priest-healers formerly had the highest status among healers for a multitude of reasons. Priest-healers were often recognized as preeminent among healers because of their in-depth know ledge of the Yoruba religious system, insights into the mysteries of the spirit world, as well as an expansive healing repertoire. However, because some other types of Yoruba healers were more engaged as fulltime practitioners, 59 and because clients' religious interests were changing, clients were increasingly turning to other types of healers besides priests. Another reason priest-healers were formerly respected as the most senior of healers was that the Yoruba royal gove rnments often recognized these types of healers, and several of these Yoruba religious healers, especially those of Ifa, had royal titles. However, because the colonial authority had eroded the standing of Yoruba royal political offices (i.e., kingships, chieftaincies, etc.) by 1945, the status of religious priest-healers was also challenged. Non-priestly healers had been steadily asserting themselves as high quality healers, declaring that they too had the respectable credentials necessary to heal patients. They considered themselves colleagues of priest-healers, and even of medical doctors. The Yoruba ancient religious scripts, the association papers, and the oral history interviews used for this dissertation all confirm that in Yorubaland there has been a historical asymmetrical relationship between the priest and non-priest healers.33 In almost every case, the non-priest healers also offered spiritual remedies and/or approaches to healing. Nevertheless, the method of diagnos is of spiritually-oriented illnesses, and the amount and types of spiritual remedies that non-priest healers offered often did not compare to that of Yoruba religious healers. However, as more of the popul ation became Christian, people wanted to patronize Yoruba healers that did not overtly practice the Yoruba religion. Rivalries, friendly and otherwise, occurred between healers of any type. Chief Fatai stated: 33 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 60 He [my father,] was a member of an association. It was a difficult task then because whoever must be a member must be powerful and charmful...Then in the association, they usually test themselves with charms. There was a time my father took me along to one of their meetings, a memb er of the association gave my father some herb to use. My father did [take the herb], not knowing it was a poison. After a while my father became uncomfortable, so he took some medicines from the bag he gave me to carry for him, so when he took the herbs, he was healed. They tested themselves with bad herbs and charms [then].34 Such incidents did occur even though association members networked and coope rated with each other. At the same time, some Yoruba priest-healers were also members of the same associations that the non-priest healers were part of, as is illustrated above in figure 2:3 'The First Native Herbalist Society' membership officer's list. Besides the fact that non-priest healers sought an elevated status in this era, priest-healers conve rted to Christianity and Islam in unprecedented numbers, likely in accordance with the trends of the rest of the popul ation. Yoruba priest-healers that altered their religions also did so in part because of the global access these religions provided, although many did not realize the global networks of the Yoruba religion at this time. Various Yoruba priest-healers that conve rted to other religions covertly incorporated Yoruba religious approaches to Yoruba healing.35 For instance, Mr. Olusegun Adeboje who was trained at one point as a babal awo, or priest of the divinity Ifa, described his long-standing career as a Christian. Additionally, he was a member of international spiritual societies such as the Rosicrucian order. Mr. Adeboje used the Odu's or the ancient scripts of the Yoruba religion, to aid in his healing work, and even expressed that his proficiency was so exceptional that babal awos such as Wande Abimbola, priest, author and scholar, have sought advice from him. One of Mr. 34 Personal interview, Chief Fatai, April 2008. 35 Mary O. Adekson, The Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Traditional Healers of Nigeria (New York: Routledge, 2003). 61 Adeboje's recent projects involves conne cting the Odus with the book of Psalms in the Bible. Nevertheless, his father who taught him a substantial portion of the healing that he knew, was not a baba lawo, he was a farmer and a \"really good healer.\"36 Mr. Adeboje's father had specialized in gyne cological Yoruba medicine. While some healers specialized prior to 1945 , healers that specialized became a regular pattern at this time. This was in part because of capitalistic ventures rising in number and more healers operating their businesses full time. Gynecology was an area of great concentration among Yoruba healers because of the supreme importance placed on motherhood, children and legacy through children. Both male and female healers offered remedies for fertility and the birth and development of healthy children. While the western medical indus try also sought to increase fertility of Africans generally, the use of midwifery and post-natal care was their main approach. Western medical practitioners did not offer as much in the way of aid in conceiving as did Yoruba medicine. This cultural goal permeated Yoruba people's priorities regardless of their religions, and was yet another instance in which Yoruba healing was resilient. Several associations were established in 1947. The articles of incorporation of these later societies conve yed a broader range of objectives that connot ed an awareness of the post-WWII climate. For instance, the emergent international perspectives of numerous healers were more apparent in the corporate papers of \"The Nigeria Association of Medical Herbalists\" which stated: The Executive Committee...shall have power to appoint delegates from among its members or co-opt any other member from any group or branch of the Association to 36 Personal interview, Olusegun Adeboje, August 2001. 62 attend conference/s or meet ing/s inside or outside of Nigeria, interview any person or persons relating to any matter touching upon the interest of the Association.37 The idea that Yoruba healers would need to and/or want to attend conferences outside of Nigeria is reasonable and obviously would benefit the efforts to reinforce the Yoruba healing system. Healers' desire to maintain the Yoruba healing system led them to the realization that it was important to incorporate additional know ledge, perspectives, and affiliations. The supplementary information and connections allowed them to enhance the system and compete with encroaching western medical options. Healers sought greater involvement in legislative and academic/scientific initiatives as additional methods of legitimacy. Because Yoruba healing was a system that touched upon various areas of Yoruba life, healers felt it imperative that those they collectively considered creditable, should be the ones in which the gove rnment relied on in times of need (such as for court cases). They sought to prevent gove rnment reliance on \"quacks.\" Healers also wanted to influence any laws that might be created in reference to Yoruba healing, since they were the experts in this area, not gove rnment agents. Educational institutes offered healers additional opportunities to maintain resiliency. For instance, the earliest college in Yorubaland, the University of Ibadan, was established in 1948. Part of the mission of the university was to study local topics, and this resulted in eventual studies on Yoruba healing. Healers, especially those affiliated with associations, at times willingly contributed to academic and scientific investigations into Yoruba healing. In 1953 Chief L. Fawole, an Ile-Ife native and President of the 37 \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657. 63 \"African Counc il of Herbal Physicians,\" sent a formal request to the Lagos Department of Education and carbon copied 'Muslims, Christians and Catholics' on his request to lecture about African herbalism in schools. He sought to share the \"advantages,\" \"practice,\" \"philosophy\" and \"result of researches carried out on African Herbs with special attention paid to their preventive and curative power they possess in relation of disease,\" propos ing herbalism be taught with botany.38 Thus, healers not only sought to participate in research studies, they also facilitated them. Practical issues still shaped the direction and initiatives of Yoruba healers and the healing system. The Yoruba healing system had to contend with the Atinga movement that swept across Yorubaland in 1951 , since Yoruba healing offered antidotes to spiritual malevolency and evil medicinal attacks. The Atinga movement was a traveling West African movement against \"witchcraft,\" as colonialists, Atinga and Yoruba called it.39 The Atinga used some general techniques that certain African religions including the Yoruba also used, so they were appealing in many ways. However, because of there excessive abuses and schemes this movement, was outlawed in colonial British Nigeria. Nevertheless, they were invited to operate in several Yoruba towns. The Atinga would \"smell\" \"out\" so-called evil doers, most of whom by their standards were older women who had children that died.40 The culmination of high social anxiety in this intense colonial time, Yoruba's concern for fertility, and the consistent concern over people who intentionally sought to 38 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 39 Witchcraft is the pejorative term used throughout the archival record and by previous scholars on this movement, i.e., Morton-Williams, Simpson and Apter. 40 \"Witch-craft or Juju cases Trial of by Native Courts Forbidden exception in minor cases,\" Oyo Province 1150. 64 inflict illness and suffering produced a ripe environment for the Atinga movement to have its burst of popul arity. Nevertheless, Yoruba healers were mostly silent in commenting on the Atinga. Many Atinga participants had little experience with healing and antidotes for bad medicine outside of their brief careers in the organization. The circumstantial inference is that healers did not generally suppor t the movement. By this point, healers had demonstrated their lawfulness and their sustained interests in maintaining the long-standing tenants of ethical healing. Avoiding becoming associated with a movement like the Atinga's was another strategy that healers used to ensure the resiliency of Yoruba healing. The requests for individual licenses that appeared during these years, were, in part petitions to the gove rnment to establish this type certification. Gaining extra credentials was yet another strategy to enhance the Yoruba healing system. The request often resembled this 1952 inquiry of a \"registration for native doctor:\" I humbly beg to submit this application seeking for registration as a native doctor. I do not know exactly how much it shall cost me to have the business registered so, I humbly request for necessary information and procedure. I shall be very thankful to you if you can do me the favor of directing this application to the correct office if the above address is incorrect.41 Healers communicated that they expected and desired a gove rnment office to address their needs and concerns. By 1954 the colonial gove rnment, with more indigenous representation, considered Yoruba healing more seriously than previously, although prior colonialists curiously showed respect. In a March debate of the House of Representatives, D.A. 41 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. This request was from a non-Yoruba Nigerian healer, as \"applications\" were coming from all over Nigeria at this point. 65 Nnaji stated that the current year's \"sum of 950\" pounds is too little for the gove rnment to give toward an investigation into African drugs and medicines and local manufacturers of medical requirements...I say so because African drugs are playing an important part in the curing of many diseases where the [colonial] Medical Department has failed to cure or has been unable to cure. I have in mind sir such sicknesses as lunacy and tuberculosis...42 Healers' still generally did not expect that the gove rnment would suppor t them financially; their aim was to gain suppor t legally. Econom ically, attempts to establish hospitals may have fit the small and large desires of healers' to be financially successful. The numerous western medical hospitals that speckled the Yoruba landscape had decent patronage and thus provided greater influence than ever over the state of medicine in Yorubaland. Healers were not able to actualize hospitals during this era because colonial laws only allowed western medical enterprises to run hospitals. The 1956 establishment of the University of Ibadan's hospital was one of many pivotal changes that further inspired healers to eventually actualize hospitals in future decades. Yoruba Healing Post 1955 By 1955, Yoruba healing had been resilient while numerous social, religious and political changes occurred in the decades before. Healers had gone from largely part-time non-charging healers to a greater number of full-time healers for financial compensation. As oppos ed to becoming weak in the face of competition from western medical healers, Yoruba healers fortified their system by establishing networks through incorporated associations and attempts to establish hospitals. Additionally, the colonial 42 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 66 political climate created oppo rtunities for Yoruba healing that indigenous politics did not address. Because of colonial political options, healers increased collaboration, as well as strove for research and more forms of substantiation by 1955 . After 1955, there was a significant spike in the number of research studies conduc ted on Yoruba healing. This was in part because of the expansion of the University of Ibadan. Many of the seconda ry studies used as key references in this dissertation were completed in the 1960s . The post-independence era included intentional efforts of many new African nations to recognize indigenous systems. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1964 created the Scientific and Technical Research Commission. This group held the \"Inter-African Symposium on the Development of African Medicinal Plants,\" in 1968.43 One fact that was reflected in the studies of Yoruba healing in the 1960s and 1970s was that more Yoruba healers were trained through apprenticeships with non-family members, versus the historical way in which healers were trained, through their families. Additionally, what was demonstrated was a remaining popul ar usage of Yoruba healing. In the 1970s and 1980s healers integrated western medical technology and approaches more than in previous decades. Healers used tools, techniques, and some of the langua ge, of western medicine. From the 1980s to the present, there has been a remarkable increase in musical, print, video, and internet advertisements for traditional healing produc ts and services. 43 Ossy Kasilo. \"Enhancing Traditional Medicine Research and Development in the African Region.\" African Health Monitor, A Magazine of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa. (World Health Organization. 2003), 18. 67 These types of publicity and marketing strategies have promoted the Yoruba healing indus try allowing for resiliency, despite ever-growing alternative medical options.44 In more recent decades, healers have also succeeded in establishing Yoruba healing hospitals. Mrs. Osawemimo, a Yoruba healer and priestess states: I also have a modern hospital which I built specifically for gynecology and traditional healing and if you need my services, you have to register. Also, the place we use for traditional healing is separated from where we sleep. These are the major changes from how our father used to do it then.45 The Nigerian gove rnment has assisted Yoruba healing efforts to proliferate. For instance, aid for patents was offered in the 1990s . Furthermore, a national association for traditional healers is active in the new millennium. Again, Mrs. Osawemimo provides insight on this current matter. She has an impressive stature in the national association. Myself and Soton, a soldier, brought the association to Osogbo. Because I am the mother of traditional healers of the federation (nationwide). And, I am the Ofun- Iyalode...all traditional healers, the Hausa, Ibos and [of] every traditional healer in Nigeria, I Ofun-Iyalode in general...[At the meet ings we] enlighten ourselves...[members] can only tell me the kinds of medicine they use whenever such cases arise...We use to hold our meetings everywhere, like Port-a-court, [etc.]... but when the government told us to merge up, we were restricted from holding the meet ings in all these places...[Furthermore,] the medical doctors do not want us to progress, we sent a letter to them so as to establish an understanding... [Ironically though, the medical doctors] bring jobs/patients to me. Sometime when I was interviewed by the general hospital, shortly after some days, I received a messenger from Kuti a medical doctor with a letter that he needed my presence at his hospital, so I went to him. When I got there he told me about a patient whom has been sick for so long and they had done everything they could but the illness refused all medicines. He wanted me to help so that the patient would not die. I did my best and the patient was healed.46 Thus, as the Yoruba healing faces age-old challenges and continue to adapt to innova tions, the system remains resilient. Resiliency as the persistent existence of the 44 Akintunde Akinyemi \"African Health on Sale: Marketing Strategies in the Practice of Traditional Medicine in Southwestern Nigeria,\" in Toyin Falola and Matthew Heaton's Traditional and Modern Health Systems in Nigeria, (Trenton, N.J.: Africa World Press, 2006). 45 Personal interview, Mrs. Edun Ogundeji Osawemimo, April, 2008. 46 Ibid. 68 system and the continued use of it, in recent years is for similar and yet differing reasons than those of the colonial period. A national association with multicultural members and healing hospitals are examples of recent beneficial modifications. Healers financial gain, negotiations with political and western medical professionals, as well as continued demands from people for Yoruba medicinal remedies, like fertility medicines, are just some of the reasons for resiliency that extend from the 1922-1955 period. Conclusion This chapter has illustrated transformations in Yoruba healing before, during and after the period 1922-1955 in the investigation of why Yoruba healing was resilient. The Yoruba healing system benefited from political changes of this period by gaining advantages through formalized engagements with the colonial gove rnment. Yoruba healers at this time became inspired and motivated, not overpowered, by the presence of western medicine. For instance, healers attempted to establish their own hospitals and addressed a wider array of illnesses. Yoruba healing also integrated religious diversity well and continued to offer remedies for the malicious elements of society. Additionally, Yoruba healing associations increased in number, scope and professional structure during this time. This subsequent chapters of this dissertation explores these and other aspects of the resiliency of Yoruba healing more in-depth. In the next chapter, \"The Yoruba Social Landscape,\" political and western medical circumstances healers dealt with between 1922-1955 is examined more closely. 69 Chapter Three The Yoruba Social Landscape Yorubaland went through a period of social transformation from 1922 to 1955 , and in many ways this time was one of social renovation, especially affecting Yoruba healing. This timeframe covers key years during this colonial period. Because the British implemented indirect rule, traditions and culture were, in part, redefined, while at the same time, certain features were reinforced and maintained. During this same timeframe, there was an increase in foreign presence. Therefore, the Yoruba created various methods of management for these European cultural influences. This chapter looks at Yoruba institutions because they fortified, yet challenged the health perspectives of local people. This chapter simultaneously explores relevant aspects of colonial Nigeria, and discusses western medicine and specifically, the missionary's roles as they relate to health. New laws, new diseases and new curative options via political, social and cultural means are imperative to unde rstand how the indigenous healing system in Yorubaland was resilient in this period. Indigenous and Colonial Institutions in Yorubaland The econom y and gove rnment were the two major institutions that were maintained yet manipulated between 1922 and 1955, which directly impacted the state of healing in Yorubaland. Agriculture and markets are the main focus of the econom ic discussion, since agriculture was the principal occupation in this region. Agriculture was 70 also a notable aspect of healing businesses.1 Additionally, the indigenous political system, which was historically intertwined with the religious system, must be unde rstood in order to discover any relationships that directly impacted Yoruba healing. From a chronological standpoi nt, it was likely that agriculture gave rise to the political structures, and therefore, was the most founda tional compone nt to Yoruba society. Agriculture was a critical occupation that suppor ted Yoruba healers. Econom ies in the Colonial Era Yorubaland, was composed of woodland savanna in the northern section and in the south was tropical rain forest with various rivers flowing throughou t the region. Over the centuries agriculture is identified as the reason that the savanna regions expanded and the rain forests declined.2 The amount of rainfall directly affected the crop yield and most areas of southwest Nigeria had good drainage. As in other African societies, Yoruba popul ations were aware and thus cautious of pests and epidemics, which were intensified with dry seasons. For example, the disease smallpox was associated with the dry season. Crops grow year round not just because of the dependable rainy season, but also because the soil was very fertile.3 The agricultural indus try involved many crops including: yams, palm (for oil and wine), cereals, maize, beans, okra, kola nuts, groundnuts, black eyed peas, shea (for 1 Toyin Falola, Economic Reforms and Modernization in Nigeria, 1945-1965 (Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 2004), highlights the importance of agriculture in Nigeria. This project's oral history interviews with Mr. Adeboje and Chief Elebuibon, and works such as Mary O. Adekson, The Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Traditional Healers of Nigeria (New York: Routledge, 2003) confirm that farming was common among healers. 2 James McCann, Green Land, Brown Land, Black Land: An Environmental History of Africa, 1800-1990 (Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann, 1999). 3 Although many crops were seasonal. 71 butter), melons, bananas, oranges, pineapple, mushrooms, calabashes/gourds, hone y and cotton. Common foods were part of certain healing recipes. Scholars have noted that some crops such as yam and cassava, were staple food crops, meanwhile cash crops produc ed for export accelerated in this colonial period. Prior to the nineteenth century there were exceptionally popul ar crops that were actually adopted from external areas. \"Plantain and groundnut s from Asia; maize, cassava, tomatoes, 'West Indian' mangoe s from the New World; commercial crops such as cacao, coffee and commercial tobacco,\" have made their way into West Africa.4 These distinctions become noteworthy in a study on the history of Yoruba healing because ingredients such as mango leaves were quite common in remedies, and lead to the need to recall that indigenous medicine does not only include completely native ingredients. This rich environment fostered the development of densely popul ated towns, suppor ting the third largest ethnic group in Africa.5 The success of this popul ation size was, in part, the result of the efficacy of the healing system. The Yoruba people have been urban dwellers for centuries. Iron technology along with rich iron ore deposits in certain areas enabled the Yoruba to penetrate the forest regions and build urban areas. Nevertheless, it has been well documented that farms surrounde d the majority of Yoruba towns. S. Godda rd notes that the Yoruba referred to two different types of farms oko etile, which means farms on the outskirts and oko egan or farms in the forest/bush.6 4 J. I. Guyer, \"Diversity at Different Levels: Farm and Community in Western Nigeria,\" Africa(London. 1928) 66, no. 1 (1996), 71. 5 Falola, Economic Reforms and Modernization in Nigeria, 1945-1965. 6 S. Goddard, \"Town-Farm Relationships in Yorubaland: A Case Study from Oyo,\" Africa (1928), 23. 72 People travelled from urban areas to the suburban farmlands for work. However, the people who worked the oko egan lived in the rural regions. Before and during colonization land was communally owned. Laborers consisted of family, organized labor, and prior to colonization, slaves. The number of wives and children a farmer had often determined his wealth. The organized labor system in which neighbor s and friends exchanged work was seasonal. Scholars such as Godda rd, Jane Guyer and Toyin Falola note that men were active farmers in the last century and a half, and there is little evidence to suppor t the idea that women were the main agricultural force as in some other parts of West Africa. Furthermore, all scholars agree that it is necessary to distinguish the part-time verses the full-time farmers. The part-time farmers typically had other occupations such as for men: healing, weaving, hunting, iron smelting/blacksmithing, leather workers, performers, musical instrument makers, fishers, carpenters, and carvers. Women also were healers and weavers. Furthermore, women were the dyers of the cloths, beer brewers, manufacturers of beads and pottery, palm oil and shea butter producers, hairdressers, marketers, and animal domesticators. While Guyer maintains \"cropping at the community level has not changed as much, if at all,\" she as well as Falola illustrate the major twentieth century changes in commercial farming. Agriculture as a full-time specialization does not necessarily equate to cash cropping. The British colonial regime concentrated on cash crops, and in Southwest Nigeria cocoa took the lead.7 Meanwhile, many Nigerians resisted the 7 Falola, Economic Reforms and Modernization in Nigeria, 1945-1965, 69. 73 plantation style farming that the colonialist brough t.8 The exploitation that colonial plantations brought not only applied to people, but also to environment, causing decreases in flora and animal diversity via deforestation, climate changes as well as increased pestilence\u2014all of which impacted Yoruba healing to confront greater challenges. Indigenous large scale farming was somewhere in between small scale farming and cash crop farming, with a few crops being cultivated, but not always for sale to urban areas.9 Most full-time farmers specialized in agriculture only, usually because they felt competent in that occupation.10 Typically, Yoruba social relationships were maintained through events such as naming ceremonies, weddings, funerals, religious festivals and community projects, which would draw people to the urban areas for days if not weeks at a time.11 Undoubt edly, the interaction between part and full-time farmers in the urban area provided oppor tunities for persons to exchange healing ingredients. The palace, which contained major markets and religious structures (i.e., shrines) were located in urban areas. 12 These urban areas or towns (ilu) had numerous shoppi ng options. While the rural areas had food market places, the urban markets were essential social centers. All types of people made public appearances on market day\u2014i.e., healers, hairdressers, musicians, debtors, criminals, politicians, diviners, and, of course, market 8 Ibid. 9 Goddard, \"Town-Farm Relationships in Yorubaland: A Case Study from Oyo,\" 27. 10 Guyer, \"Diversity at Different Levels: Farm and Community in Western Nigeria,\" 81. 11 Goddard, \"Town-Farm Relationships in Yorubaland: A Case Study from Oyo,\" 26-7. 12 Toyin Falola and A.

The Iyaloja was know n as politically influential and a proactive woman. The urban Yoruba city of Ibadan, c. 1930. Figure 3.1.15 In reference to purchasing ability, the Yoruba did use currency before the introduc tion of British money in the form of cowry shells for small transactions. Beads were used for larger exchanges, because they were valued as precious stones. However, bartering in the pre-colonial era was possibly the most popul ar form of market exchange. Falola and A. Adebayo note that bartering was not necessarily a social activity; it was between people who were acquainted or could occur between those who simply did not 13 Deji Ogunremi and Biodun Adediran, Culture and Society in Yorubaland Rex 1998). 14 L.

Figure 3.1. 75 know each other. Furthermore, there were two types of barter\u2014\"goods for goods\" or \"goods for service.\"16 It was common for healers to receive goods in exchange for their services in this colonial period. Nonetheless, during this timeframe European currency became increasing popul ar. For instance, from the late nineteenth century until 1959 the elite used the British pound .17 Although most trade was at the local level, for centuries there was a market for long distance trade. The savanna and forest regions of Yorubaland exchanged goods, which meant that healers used food and other products that were not indigenous to Yoruba areas because they became available through long distance trade. Importation of European goods began in the slave trade era. Additionally, raw material from southwest Nigeria had been traded overseas for centuries. Colonization also brought an increased amount of European indus trial technology, which changed the landscape of African handcrafted indus tries, and made certain aspects of agricultural produc tion easier i.e., mills for palm oil. Thus, some of the founda tional ingredients for healing recipes became more widely available. In addition, innova tions such as, railroads and eventually cars in this colonial period increased inter-regional trade, as well as stimulated the growth of previously small urban areas. Foreigners were in control of many of the income generating indus tries between 1922 and 1955 .18 16 Falola and Adebayo, Culture, Politics and Money Among the Yoruba, 30. 17 \"The Global History of Currencies (GHOC), An Exclusive Service of Global Financial Data: Nigeria,\" from http://www.globalfinancialdata.com/index.php3?action=showghoc&country_name=Nigeria. accessed on April 29, 2007. 18 Falola, Economic Reforms and Modernization in Nigeria, 1945-1965, 157. 76 Governments Under Indigenous and Indirect Colonial Rule Yoruba kingdom s consisted of a collection of towns (ilu) with royal administrations that were hierarchical. The king was suppor ted and directed by a network of community leaders. These community leaders included the compound or family head (baale) at the local level, and at the royal level, the king's counc il of senior chiefs of certain lineages. Chiefs were often semi or full religious leaders; some healers also were chiefs. The Ogboni society provided spiritual and econom ic protection to the town, religious sects, and the king. Related to the Ogboni was the Oro society. Oro was secretly respons ible for protecting the power of the ancestors, executing sentenced criminals including those engaging in spiritual malevolency. For instance, chiefs felt compelled to offer protection against evil practitioners, well into the 1950s .19 These circumstances both complemented, and yet challenged the aims of Yoruba healers who also sought to control evil delinque ncy. During this colonial period the authority of political leaders was distorted and diminished. Yoruba systems of gove rnment were similar, but not identical in various Yoruba kingdom s. After colonial rule began, in the \"golden age of indirect rule\" from 1914-1933, the British recruited chiefs as subordinates to the colonial district officers because they historically had social respons ibilities of collecting taxes.20 Various circumstances resulted from British political manipulation during colonization. The \"Native Authority Counc il\" was partially respons ible for various changes, which in some 19 \"Witchcraft C226 and \"Atinga\" 1951, Status, Yoruba Historical Perspective,\" in Toyin Falola and Ann Genova, Yorub\u00e1 Identity and Power Politics, (Rochester, NY: University of Rochester Press, 2006), 168. 77 cases included: citizens detesting indigenous leaders who over-collaborated with colonial authorities, chiefs obtaining higher status than kings, chiefs losing status, kings losing the rights to capital punishment, Yoruba gove rnment officials becoming salaried employees of the colonial state, and educated elites being placed in indigenous political positions.21 In the case of the educated elite acquiring indigenous authority, this contentious situation became counterproduc tive, because so often the educated were taught to loath tradition and local culture, and thus, they often disrespected the system. The average citizen still adhered to indigenous authorities though. Healers engaged these various types of authorities. The parliamentary system was established in Southwest Nigeria in 1951 . While Yoruba rulers were incorporated into this system, in part, the educated elite retained most control of European style gove rnments. Obas (kings) were even relegated to ceremonial status.22 The levels of authority among Yoruba rulers in the colonial period transformed because they were still concerned with culture and religion, but decreasingly enforced laws or controlled econom ics. Various healers were aware of these differences and therefore, corresponde d to colonial and indigenous authorities in accordingly. Laws were an essential compone nt of the indirect rule system and \"customary law\" were expected to be uphe ld by the indigenous leaders.23 Nevertheless, colonial laws sought to assert cultural and political reform and were used to define and challenge 21 Ibid, 168-170. 22 Ibid, 169. 23 Kristin Mann and Richard L. Roberts, Law in Colonial Africa, (Portsmouth, NH, London: Heinemann Educational Books, James Currey, 1991), 21. 78 'labor, authority, morality and culture.'24 The Yoruba healers continuous ly used these laws to their advantage. Nigeria's 'native laws' gained strength post-1930.25 The law cited repeatedly in reference to healers was the 'Medical Practitioners Ordinance.' Ironically, this was because: Nothing in this Ordinance contained shall apply to the practice of a native system of therapeutics...[provided that the person practicing such system]: (a) is native of Nigeria who is recognized by the members of the tribe or of the section of the native community to which he belongs as being duly trained in such system, (b) does not practise [sic] such system except amongst the members of the tribe or of the section of the native commu nity to which he belongs, (c) does not perform any act which is dangerous to life, and (d) does not supply, administer or prescribe any poison within the mean ing of the Drugs and Poisons Ordinance.26 Therefore, the colonial gove rnments were not greatly concerned with \"native medicine\" as long as it did not adversely impact the health of Europeans, nor was seriously contested by local popul ations. The limited attention that the colonial representatives gave to Yoruba healing did not stop the healers from appealing to the gove rnments for aid and recognition, even 'licensing,' in the colonial period. This increase in requests continued and became part of the general post-World War II acceleration of indigenous demands for democracy and development through political colonial institutions.27 In this colonial era, healers were well aware that the colonial authorities could detain and punish them if their practices were contested. Although quacks and charlatans existed, many healers relied on their reputation for protection, as well as their prosperity. Most healers did not attempt to heal an individual unless they were confident that they 24 Ibid, 3. 25 Vaughan, Nigerian Chiefs: Traditional Power in Modern Politics, 1890s-1990s, 34. 26 \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657. 27 Vaughan, Nigerian Chiefs: Traditional Power in Modern Politics, 1890s-1990s, 44. 79 would have either some success, or at least not failure. Most of the oral history interviewees remarked that they never having 'lost' a patient, just as this indigenous surgeon intimated to Issac Delano in the 1930s . \"I [Delano] spoke of his probable arrest, if discovered by the authorities...he had been similarly warned before...He would tell them [the police], he said, that if any of his patients died he was prepared to be hanged by the neck. And he laughe d.\"28 It should not be concluded that it was colonial rule that encouraged healers to take the humble perspective of refusing care if a case appeared too difficult, because the religious records reflect this was a pre-colonial healing perspective. This 1922-1955 period, a post-World War I and II era, also meant that there was a rise in healers that had know ledge of foreign medical systems. In a 1954 registration letter request, Adebayo, an herbalist states he was an \"ex-service-man\" having been a nurse for five years, and was \"capable to use Native and English Medicine for healing and curing of all existing natural or human ailments.\"29 While he may have had an unus ual pedigree, it was common that healers accepted western medicine, perhaps not for personal practice, but as complementary to what they could offer. This was not commonly the case with western medical practitioners, who sought to ignore and discredit the entire system of Yoruba healing. Western Medicine in Colonial Yorubaland Western medicine was commonly know n as the type of medicine in which repeated documented scientific trails and standardized measured experiments i.e., via biological and chemistry observations have been used to help determine disease causes 28 Isaac O. Delano, The Soul of Nigeria (London: Werner, 1937), 87. 29 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 80 and treatments. Western medicine was primarily based in Western societies such as Britain. Most typically, this branch of medicine was exclusionary to indigenous and faith oriented medical traditions that were deemed as \"alternative medicines\". Professionals of the western medical indus try ordinarily claimed that only specific organizations and institutions such as, academic medical associations and schools could declare a practice or practitioner as part of the western medical establishment. Many medical professionals used the Greek Hippoc rates' definition of the medical arts concerning disease, the patient and the phys ician.30 In the late 19th and 20th centuries, health reforms, socio-medical discoveries, inventions and movements created and reinforced this system of western medicine. In the 19th century the medical frontiers were established or advanced in areas such as: cell biology, the development of technology i.e., stethoscopes, internal thermometers and better microscopes. These innova tions were achieved because of Western prosperity, partly resulting from colonial domination, the professionalizing of medicine in education and practice, greater gove rnment involvement in healthcare i.e., via licensing, and improvements in long distance communication e.g. via journals, conferences. However, the success of these aspects of western medicine only began to flourish during the Nigerian colonial era. 30 Roy Porter, The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity, (New York: Norton, 1998), 4-5. 81 The adoption of \"germ theory\" is regarded as one of the most singularly revolutionary western medical and social reforms in the West to date. The concept that many diseases are caused by microorganisms that attack the body has been largely attributed to the research of late 19th century scientists Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. Subsequent discoveries and inventions of cures, such as antibiotics and vaccines were thought to be final answers in the search for effective remedies; however, that was not the case. Although a monum ental medical breakthrough, germ theory did not explain the origin of all diseases and as Yoruba healers recognized, certain illness had strong psychological compone nts. Hospitals became a central compone nt for perpetuating the western medical indus try in the 20th century, in part, because they adopted germ theory, antiseptic surgery, clinical pathology, and technology such as x-rays. Doctors trained and specialized in 20th century hospitals. With doctors, hospitals, commercial advertising and gove rnment campaigns against germs, the public did not have to rely on religion to answer questions about phys ical ailments. Thus the secularization of medicine was another 20th c. phenomenon of western medicine. The alliance of medicine and science reinforced the increasing disconne ction between spiritual beliefs and healthcare because many disease causations were being proven as phys ical not spiritual. This did not negate the fact that certain diseases were cultural constructions.31 31 Janet L. Golden and Charles E. Rosenberg, Framing Disease: The Creation and Negotiation of Explanatory Schemes (New York, N.Y.: Cambridge University Press, 1989), xiv. 82 Imperial Medicine The western medical indus try openly represented itself as a triumphant and benevolent aspect of imperialism, implicitly justifying the manipulative exploits of colonialism.32 For example, the genre of 'tropical medicine' was not only created to allow Europeans to survive in foreign places, it also sought to paternalistically substantiate colonial notions of Africans, Native Americans and Asians as exotic, \"primitive,\" dangerous and lacking capacity for self-care. Additionally, various innova tions to the western medical databanks i.e., medicines from herbs were sought and adapted from indigenous medicines, like the Yoruba, and credit for this was often not given. Western medicine, additionally served as an \"acculturating agent\" among many indigenous groups .33 Other imperial compone nts of western medical engagement with various popul ations were the efforts to test theories and inventions by using certain people as experimental groups . The western medical establishment proved to be a menace to a variety of people, thus western medicine's universal benevolence is a moot point. Worboys states: The role of colonial medicine in promoting the development of colonies went through three phases. Befo re 1914, priority was given to protecting the health of European functionaries, soldiers, traders, and managers to support the political and economic health of each colony. It was in this context that disease-specific approaches were introduced 32 As discussed in David Arnold, \"Imperial Medicine and Indigenous Societies,\" (Manchester, New York, New York, NY, USA: Manchester University Press/St. Martin's Press), as well as in Cunningham and Andrew Cunningham and Bridie Andrews, Western Medicine as Contested Knowledge (Manchester, New York: Manchester University Press/St. Martin's Press, 1997). 33 S. J. Kunitz, Disease Change and the Role of Medicine: The Navajo Experience (University of California Press, 1983), 3. 83 and ITM [Imperial Tropical Medicine] was established. After 1920, by which time morbidity and mortality rates among Europeans had improved, the health of the indigenes became an issue in situations where they worked in mines and plantations, and were potential consumers in towns. In the third phase, from the late 1920s-in the context of the collapse of world trade and the rise of colonial nationalism- the development and health policy agenda again changed. The welfare of indigenes became a focus of debate, if little action...The issue of the indigenous population's health was shaped by the ideas of 'trusteeship' and the 'dual mandate' that had emerged in Britain in the 1920s. This mandate required colonial governments to try and preserve indigenous cultures, while at the same time promoting their economic and cultural development.34 This circa 1930 postcard photo of European woman with a Nigerian mother and children. This photo displays the paternalistic attitude of many Europeans at the time, stating that this European can care for an African child even though the mother is present. The photo invokes the idea of 'the poor helpless Africans,' especially with the contrast in dress conjuring ideas of alleged African inferiority, which did not represent reality since the Yoruba women of this period wore many styles of dress.

Figure 3.2. 84 Western medical staff sought to eradicate what they believed was endemic to Africans namely: traditions, hype r-sexuality, disease, ignorance and bad anatomy.36 Additionally, western medical practitioners made thorough attempts to demean people's confidence in local health systems and demoralize social participation in holistic and local health approaches, especially of colonized people. The process of 'professionalization' resulted in the exportation and adaptation of the concept that there was a hierarchy of healers, with western medical doctors claiming to be at the top. A representative segment of western medical professionals socially constructed their indus try as elite and attempted to completely suppress healing approaches not canonized by western medical practitioners or institutions. In places such as Yorubaland, western medical doctors had some tolerance of Yoruba healers, though doctors such as medical officers and missionaries, used professional and political strategies in attempts to subjugate local healers. In the 1940 medical missionary journal, The Way of Healing, Dr. Mays reiterates throughou t her article that \"poisoning from native medicine is due to administering large doses of medicine, [which is] completely unsuitable at the best of times.\"37 In sympathy of the doctors' perspective, yet accreditation to Yoruba healing A. Lucas and R. Hendrickse note that because Yoruba people normally patronized hospitals as a last resort: \"a hospital 36 Muisi, \"The Politics of Perception or Perception as Politics?

Some societies in fact, violently resisted western medicine while other societies reacted more subtly. For instance, when considering religion and spirituality as part of the \"anti-medicine movements\" case of Southern Rhode sia demonstrates that people turned toward African churches for therapy and blamed evil spirits for the influenza pandemic of 1918. 39 This pandemic certainly affected Yorubaland, with an estimated quarter of a million deaths because of it.40 One reaction was that many coastal Yoruba fled to the interior, and this \"flight of many Nigerians and their mistrust of European medicine were based not on ignorance, but instead on the know ledge of the 'reckless disregard for human Native life'.\"41 The colonial gove rnment offered little in the way of aid to the majority of Yorubaland during this pandemic, thus did not seize on a potential oppor tunity to gain western medical trust or confidence.42 In the long run this epidemic was one of several catalysts that caused healers to continually expand their 38 A.O.

Other epidemics in southwestern Nigeria included the buboni c plague from 1924-26 and a 1932 famine during the world econom ic depression.43 Imperial medicine concentrated on other epidemics and very particular health issues such as: hookw orm, malaria, yellow fever and tuberculosis. The historical trend of western medicines orientation toward disease actually reflected and reinforced the approach of western medical practitioners' tendency to focus on programs that could produc e immediate results. The focus on disease eradication often disadvantaged other health issues. Therefore, while some illnesses were relieved through western medicine, others still proliferated in various societies. Furthermore, this western medical approach excused participants in such efforts from engaging the social orientation of illness. For instance, the diseases that required repeated personal engagement and cultural sensitivity to resolve were those such as, diabetes and mental illnesses. Thus, healers emphasized their proficiency in resolving certain illness that Europeans could not. It was not only colonial and missionary workers that promoted imperial medicine between 1922 and 1955, non-gove rnment (NGO) and multilateral organizations increasingly served as the most prolific, visible and penetrating aspects of the imperialistic western medical health forces.44 Economic aid and scientific approaches suppor ted through benefactors such as Rockefeller, is an example of forces that may have saved western medicine from possible failure otherwise. These two forms of redemption are interconne cted because the western medical hospitals, medical schools and even 43 D. H. Crumbley, \"On Being First: Dogma, Disease and Domination in the Rise of an African Church,\" Religion 30, no. 2 (2000), 171-2. 44 E. Richard Brown, Rockefeller Medicine Men: Medicine and Capitalism in America (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979), 3. 87 insurance companies were bolstered by the external suppor t they received to pay for the expensive scientific technology. The International Health Division (IHD) of the Rockefeller Founda tion operated from 1913-1951 in over 80 countries including Nigeria and poured millions of dollars into its global projects. With the help of the IHD, New York laboratories, researched and promoted a wide range of tools to curb diseases, such as \"chemical drugs, antibiotics, vaccines and insecticides\" with DDT being the most infamous.45 These efforts were not perfect or always effective. In some cases money was severely wasted and there were some serious side effects to certain remedies employed (like cancer), drawing criticisms that these international remedies were actually experiments on world popul ations. Furthermore, the excessive scare tactics used on people and gove rnments to coerce them into project participation was a common ploy of the western medicine complex.46 Though the IHD operated in Nigeria, their presence was part of a wider NGO presence because the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, after 1920 brought some basic western medical services to Nigeria too.47 An example of an IHD doctor was Dr. Wilbur Sawyer who, with a team of scientists, in the 1920s and 1930s worked on a yellow fever vaccine in a Lagos laboratory.48 The IHD is important to consider because multilaterals such as the World Health Organization (WHO), established in 1948 , largely adopted the 45 John Farley, To Cast out Disease: A History of the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation (1913-1951) (Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 1. 46 Farley, To Cast out Disease: A History of the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation (1913-1951), 139. 47 Ralph Schram, Development of Nigerian Health Services: Five Hundred Years of Medical History from 1460-1960, (Kampala, Uganda: Makerere University College Medical School (Dissertation), 1968), 170. 48 Schram, A History of the Nigerian Health Services (Ibadan: Ibadan University Press, 1971), 156. 88 Rockefeller approach to aid.49 The Yoruba healing system did not have these types of financiers to compete with western medical initiatives. Nevertheless, they still managed to maintain resiliency.50 Converging Points of Western Medicine and Indigenous Healing George Simpson and Z. Ademuwagun's studies post 1955 reflected that patients generally remained pluralistic in their approach.51 These conclusions are worthy of consideration because it helps to contextualize the patient. The patient was the critical overlapping variable in western medicine and holistic indigenous healing. Ademuwagun observed that the clash between the two medical approaches increased because of pride not professional philosophy; Yoruba patients exercised medical pluralism regardless of the extra effort they spent. The degree of patients' education did not significantly impact pattern of choice; for indigenous , cultural, religious or psychological issues healers were preferred; and these practitioners seemed to better handle local diseases (i.e., malaria) over foreign diseases (i.e., flu).52 Chief Olojede states that \"there are some illnesses and sicknesses that medical doctors cannot heal...but traditional healers can.\"53 Numerous western medical doctors were fully aware that Yoruba healers had the same goals, which was to help patients get well.

He led public health campaigns pertaining to various issues including small pox and infant mortality. Photo of Dr. Oluwole. Figure 3.3.55 In reference to small pox, he sought to transform the Yoruba attitudes that vaccines were fatal, and he promoted bringing the sick to hospitals, instead of exercising the common practice of secluding the ill. \"With a view of conve rting them he invited herbalists to the hospitals to see how new patients are treated and to compare results. Due to his persistence and untiring efforts vaccination became accepted\".56 During the same period, another Yoruba western medical doctor, Dr. Oguntola Sapara campaigned 54 Dr. Isaac Ladipo Oluwole 1892-1953, Father of Public Health in Nigeria, (Ibadan, Nigeria: Society of Health, Nigeria). 55 Ibid, preface. Figure 3.3. 56 Ibid, 22. 90 against the indigenous Yoruba religious practices pertaining to small pox. \"Dr. Sapara pretended to become a priest [of Saponna, the divinity of smallpox] himself, and discovered what was going on.\"57 The \"cult\" was outlawed, though people still practiced clandestinely. The issue of vaccination in Yorubaland during this period is worthy of commentary. As indicated above the Yoruba practiced inoculation with diseases such as small pox, years before a western medical presence in the region. Nonetheless, western medical vaccines were perceived as invasive. A colonial report stated that \"Notwithstanding this [small pox epidemics], the people show no enthusiasm for vaccination, and were often hostile to it. This is no doubt due partly...to the employment of foreign vaccinators who show too little respect for the local authorities.\"58 Furthermore, Maclean, who worked in the region for many years, even stated many people who were immunized still contracted smallpox.59 Thus, in reality, Yoruba's social acceptance of vaccinations was minimal between 1922 and 1955. African doctors were, in fact often fighting two forces, racists Europeans and 'unenlightened' Africans. They stood in the middle of these two groups , but as members of these indigenous societies, the doctors were very concerned about the manner in which Europeans approached African patients. An African doctor educated in the U.S. wrote (c. 1909) that: Europeans frequently scheduled to serve the British government...have almost invariably been of that cheap trashy hide of human extraction, which being incapable of more than 57 Schram, A History of the Nigerian Health Services, 141. 58 \"Notes on Customs & Superstition of Indigenous Institutions\" CSO 26 6076. 59 Maclean, \"Nigeria 1956-65: A Medical Memoir.\" 91 the meanest possible livelihood in their own country, have now and again been inflicted on West Africa. Godless whitemen, some of them the veriest heathen, who go to our country to teach vice, inebriety, and all the follies of their vaunted Western civilisation. We regret the recommendation [to not allow African MDs to attend to European patients] did not exclude English doctors from attending West Africans. This would, of course, simply give official confirmation to the accepted rule of English physicians refusing to attend the natives (except at the hospitals), prevent their get-rich-quick fees, and save some of my people from some of those frightful alcohol sodden specters which sometimes terrorise their bedside.60 So there is additional visibility into why African doctors engaged Yoruba healers with more depth than most European doctors did. Besides the doctors being culturally competent by know ing some benefits of Yoruba healing, they were not blind to the deficits of European perspectives upon Africans, even if they chose to learn the Europeans' medical systems. The issue of infant mortality was of great concern to both healers and western medical practitioners alike, but for very different reasons. Missionaries and colonialists worked to correct the problem of African unde r-population.61 At the same time, sophisticated questions on the legitimacy of blanket depopul ation/unde r-popul ation ideologies has only been propos ed and investigated by very few scholars.62 For instance, missionary records normally do not reflect the ratio of the medical incidents that they treated to the popul ation of their regions. Thus, there is skepticism in the amounts of missionary and colonial claims that certain types of health calamities were common to 60 Schram, Development of Nigerian Health Services: Five Hundred Years of Medical History from 1460-1960, 115, original document only referenced as above, not professionally cited. 61 Muisi, \"The Politics of Perception or Perception as Politics?

Missionaries and certainly colonialist, paternalistically needed reasons to save the 'helpless Africans' Midwifery was available both through the indigenous and western medical healing systems for many in Africa, including Yorubaland. Both colonialist and especially missionaries concentrated their efforts on maternal healthcare. Vaughn concludes that missionaries focused more on women, because they saw women as having the religious and healing power in their cultures. In particular, these women were midwives and leaders of initiations.63 Nonetheless, the midwives' training in the western medical system was typically more medically intricate64 and primed for difficult births. Indigenous midwives often aided in birth with a basic health and large cultural agendas because Yoruba indigenous midwives saw birth as natural and women perfectly capable of handling it mostly on their own. Additionally, both western medical and missionary practitioners recruited and trained local midwives. While Oyebola criticized Yoruba midwives for not having certain know ledge of anatomy and phys iology65, one still finds that all groups of midwives had the intent of delivering healthy babies, but had dissimilar methodol ogies and differing priorities to this end goal. 63 Megan Vaughan, Curing Their Ills: Colonial Power and African Illness (Cambridge: Polity, 1991). 64 Turrittin's \"Colonial Midwives and Modernizing Childbirth in French West Africa,\" 72. 65 D.

Figure 3.4.66 Missionaries and Hospitals Missionar ies Missionaries were some of the greatest architects of colonial change in Africa, though they were only unofficially a segment of the colonial enterprise. The missionaries aggressively instituted an array of social programs in the areas of culture, education, indus try and healthcare\u2014they did more than engage in the business of proselytizing. Their efforts often exceeded that of colonial gove rnments. Numerous scholars have depicted the missionaries as colonizers. The Comaroff's Of Revelation and Revolution, for instance, concentrates on missionaries' 'colonization of consciousness' providing 66 \"Student Nurses in the Practical Classroom\" photo from pamphlet of the ceremonial opening of the University College Hospital Ibadan, c. 1957. \"West African Medical Panel\" CMS Archive, Overseas Division AFW M2 1955-1959. Figure 3.4. 94 detailed evidence that European missionaries intentionally sought to change Africans' ways of viewing life and the world. The missionary project was deliberately hegemonic, not just in religious, but also in cultural terms. This included approaches to sickness and wellness. In a 1948 missionary meeting in reference to a hospital in Ado-Ekiti Yorubaland, it was plainly stated that the hospital would help them 'preach the gospel.'67 Certain insightful themes that unde rscore the missionary-colonialist alliance included the facts that: the ethnicity of the catechist also was transmitted in the religious teachings; the act of seeking conve rts was by nature ethnoc entric and demeaning to the target of conve rsion; missionary careers and daily work greatly resembled that of colonialists; and lastly the compartmentalization of 'sacred and secular' affairs was typical, yet antithetical to African holistic lifestyles, causing disruptions in the local social fabric.68 The ironic division missionaries' made in practicing secular medicine, though having a sacred mission meant inevitable clashes with African's so-called beliefs about the spiritual impacts on phys ical health, which missionaries often deemed as superstitious beliefs. Missionaries were determined to destroy African beliefs. Doctors frequently commented on Africans' beliefs in evil as part of the 'savage' ideals they needed to civilize before they'd be effective. However, the adaptability and pragmatism of African belief systems did not erode just because missionaries sought to eliminate them. Many Yoruba people embraced Christianity and western medicine while retaining their 67 \"Correspondence\" CMS Archive, Medical Department M/Y A2 1918-1949. 68 Beidelman, Colonial Evangelism, 8. 95 indigenous beliefs. In general, and especially when it came to the most precious possession people had, their body. These spiritual beliefs carried over into Africans' views of missionary medicine. There were western medical treatments Africans received from missionaries that unde niably worked. The mysterious ways in which healing took place caused some Yoruba to interpret these forms of relief and cures as the \"white man's juju.\"69 Though missionaries, at best, secretly hope d that African people would see the medicine as miracles and then conve rt. Many Yoruba people were grateful for good health,. However, they often reacted with suspecting awe, unsure of the motives and uncertain of the source of this transformative power. Especially confusing would be the missionary stance that medicine and healing had no spiritual power, while their purpose for being present was to spiritually guide the Yoruba toward what they deemed as the proper and correct spiritual path. The missionaries made significant inroads, yet their failures were numerous and continual. Etherington's notes that the missionaries contributed to their own mediocre level of success.70 The small percentages of Yoruba people that did conve rt typically fit into categories of being: outcasts, educational seekers and econom ic oppor tunists.71 Many Yoruba had a resilient desire to live according to traditions and in harmony with their environment and society. Additionally, the heavy missionary presence i.e., Anglicans, Baptists, Catholics and Adventists, in various regions created a competitive environment 69 Mayes, \"Pioneering in the Yoruba Country.\" 70 Norman Etherington, Preachers, Peasants, and Politics in Southeast Africa, 1835-1880: African Christian Communities in Natal, Pondoland, and Zululand (London: Royal Historical Society, 1978). 71 Ibid. 96 and gave some African groups , such as the Yoruba, so many choices of Christianity that they often opted out. A 1935 letter from the CMS Yoruba mission secretary stating that the Methodist plan to expand their medical practices. Therefore, the Methodists \"may endanger our prestige\" and that \"jealosy [sic] is growing\" between the two missions.72 That same year chiefs in a town named Ifaki, in the Ekiti district requested that all the churches in the area merge together\u2014Anglican/CMS, Methodists and Roman Catholics so that these missions could build one hospital for the town, as oppos ed to the one Methodist dispensary they had at the time.73 One result of missionary activities that simultaneously expresses both the failure and the successes of missions in Africa was the proliferated establishment of independent churches, such as the Aladura church of Yorubaland. Certainly, African people demonstrated agency in accepting and rejecting missionaries' efforts. For instance, Josw Kate Mugema argued that the alliance of Christianity with western medicine was equivalent to a pagan cult.74 This curious perspective reverses the accusations that were often placed upon African healing systems, which were only sometimes directly allied with indigenous religious institutions. The missionary goal of evangelizing was constantly thwarted because the Yoruba sought out medical missionary health workers for non-medical reasons. Because many people viewed their own personal troubles with money or love as health issues, they expected that medical missionaries could resolve these problems. Thus, often times 72 \"Correspondence\" CMS Archive, Medical Department M/Y A2 1918-1949. 73 Ibid. 74 Frederick B. Welbourn, East African Rebels; A Study of Some Independent Churches. London: SCM Press, 1961, 42. 97 Yoruba people were disappointed when medical workers told them that they only offered services for phys ical ailments, so the Yoruba continued to exercise medical and spiritual pluralism. In fact, many medical workers in colonial Africa viewed Africans as difficult to work with because of their pluralistic attitudes. The 1931 Census roughl y estimated that only about 10% of Yoruba people were Christians,75 thus indigenous beliefs clearly dominated. Finally, though medical services were \"thinly spread throughout most of colonial Africa,\"76 in Yorubaland, between 1922 and 1955 there was a steady increase in western medical options. Western medical Facilities in Yorubaland As indicated earlier hospitals and 'dispensaries' became the main mode for perpetuating the western medical indus try internationally in the 20th c. While the colonial gove rnment established hospitals, the missionaries largely controlled the propagation of medical stations available throughout Yorubaland. Though the Christian denominations competed with, and also aided each other, Felix observes that: \"the result of the interdenominational rivalry was the establishment of medical facilities, especially dispensaries, maternity centers, and hospitals in various parts of the region. In fact from about the 1920s , mission hospitals proliferated in Nigeria, and, as Ajayi observed, hospitals 'almost rivaled schools as the means of evangelization.'\"77 Schram, who wrote two of the most comprehensive examinations of Nigerian medical history, lists the western medical facilities by types and dates of when they were 75 \"Census of Nigeria 1931 Volumes II\", Crown Agents for the Colonies: London, 1933. 76 Vaughan, Curing Their Ills Colonial Power and African Illness, 22. 77 J.

Clearly they were cognizant of providing geographically broad access. The leprosy settlements may have been a greater reflection on European priorities verses an overwhelming need in Yorubaland. Although there was only one nursing home and one mental hospital listed, the establishment of these institutions speaks to a health concern visible to colonialists. The Catholics established five 78 Schram, Development of Nigerian Health Services: Five Hundred Years of Medical History from 1460-1960, appendixes six and seven, Table 3.a. 99 hospitals, the Baptists two, the Methodists one (though they had numerous dispensaries), the Seventh Day Adventists and Anglicans also having one hospital each. Most of these hospitals had at least 30 beds, typically more, and, there were outpatient services. Eighteen hospitals in Yorubaland was an impressive number alone, however this chart does not include 'dispensaries' and smaller western medical establishments that existed prior to 1955. For example, Schram notes the Methodists actually established at minimum, several stations. One of these stations was founde d in Igboo ra in the late 19th c. This medical outlet was actually established by a local herbalist who conve rted to Christianity and began to implement western medical care. By 1909 the \"dispensary had washed away and no further medical work was established there until the nineteen sixties when it became an outpost of the medical school at Ibadan\".79 The case of the gove rnment-spons ored mental hospital established in 1947 is certainly one of interest, especially because of the work of a prominent staff member of this hospital, Dr. T.A. Lambo, an internationally renowned Yoruba psychiatrist. Although Lambo only began his work at the hospital in the mid-1950s , he clearly respected certain indigenous healing approaches toward the mentally ill, as did his contemporary Raymond Prince. Lambo not only worked with Yoruba healers, but also instituted certain Yoruba practices. His method of dealing with psychiatric disorder in patients sent to Aro was not to admit to the hospital unless it was unavoidable, but to place the patients in neighbouring villages as day-care patients, receiving their treatment from the hospital, or coming in for procedures that required hospital facilities. This type of commu nity care was then still very rare in Western societies, and he was ahead of his time. The villages were more accep ting of disordered people than their counterparts in Europe.80 79 Schram, A history of the Nigerian health services, 157-8. 80 Schram, A history of the Nigerian health services, 188. 100 The new 1956 Ibadan University teaching hospital. Figure 3.5.81 Lambo publicly commented in numerous ways that western medicine was \"grossly lacking\" in its abilities to address the emotional and spiritual needs of people.82 The numbers of attendees reported by various hospitals were in the thous ands, giving the impression that Yoruba people flocked to the hospitals for care. Table 3.b is an example from the Anglican CMS mission to illustrate this point. 81 Photo from pamphlet of the ceremonial opening of the University College Hospital Ibadan, c. 1957. CMS archive file, 2. Figure 3.5. 82 T.

Given that this hospital had 57 beds, one would deduct that the hospital was sizable, but not gigantic.84 The CMS records frequently indicated that the hospital only had one doctor on staff at a time in normal circumstances. The number of patients reflects those who attended in a single year. In considering the number of \"total out-patient attendances at the hospital,\" 14,526, one could then estimate that per day in a year's time, with the exception of Sunda ys and no holidays, approximately 46 outpatients were seen per day. That number seems dubious because even if that many people arrived in search of care, it is questionable as to whether they all could have been treated. If indeed this one hospital saw over 40,000 patients in a year, then there were 83 \"Yoruba Medical Information\" CMS Archive, Overseas Division G3 A2 ML 1935-1959 from the special collections of the University of Birmingham. Table 3.b. 84 Schram, Development of Nigerian Health Services: Five Hundred Years of Medical History from 1460-1960, appendix 7 notes there were 57 beds at this hospital. 102 enough attendees to make a claim that the Yoruba were quite willing to use western medicine during this period. Financial considerations were part of the scenario from the European and the African points of view. Firstly, one reason why such a report would be of great importance was because the CMS, similar to other missions, received their funding from abroad. Those philanthropists needed reasons to continue suppor ting these endeavors, and high numbers of service could certainly encourage funding. An even larger curiosity in this discussion is that mission hospitals provided services at no or low costs. While it was stated earlier that one African doctor felt many European doctors wanted to extract money out of Africans, he was referring to gove rnment and independent doctors, not necessarily to missionary workers, who provided the a large majority of western medical healthcare in Yorubaland. While the Yoruba patient didn't need to pay for western medical services, they exercised medical pluralism although they needed to compensate healers, because of numerous western medical limitations and the array of options available through Yoruba healing. Conclusion Political and social factors affected the Yoruba healing system during this colonial era. Yoruba society was transforming from a primarily agrarian to an increasingly commercial society. Furthermore, indigenous gove rnments increasingly eroded because of the impositions of the colonial government. Additionally, the medical arm of British imperialism sought to implement health and social reforms. By 1922 this meant strategies and campaigns to eliminate certain cultural beliefs that related to 103 healing. At the same time, Christian medical missionaries were quickly establishing a strong presence, especially through hospitals and dispensaries between 1922-1955. The growing presence of imperial western medical options and medical missionaries did not stop Yoruba people from patronizing Yoruba healers. Some reasons Yoruba were not as interested in western medicine included racism, western medical services being basic and limited, as well as too narrow a focus on the phys ical dimension of illness. Most importantly, the efficacy of Yoruba healing, in addition to the ways in which healers took advantage of the colonial circumstances promoted the resiliency of Yoruba healing. The latter two facts will be highlighted in greater detail in the following chapters. Next, the attractiveness of the natural and phys ical Yoruba healing ways are examined. 104 Chapter Four Defining Yoruba Healing This chapter examines the meaning of Yoruba healing during the 1922-1955 period. The ideas discussed and analyzed in this chapter are: healers on \"traditional healing,\" the social aspects of Yoruba healing, such as prevention, holism, and public confidence, and the structure of the Yoruba healing system that related to the phys ical person terms as oppos ed to supernatural or spiritual compone nts. In this chapter the phys ical and psychological compone nts of Yoruba healing are examined. The final section details types of Yoruba healers, sicknesses, and methods of healing in Yorubaland during this time. What emerges from an examination on the status of Yoruba healing from 1922-1955 is that the system was resilient because of its popul arity, array of remedies and efficacy. Healers on \"Traditional Healing\" Yoruba healers explicitly label their practice Healing (iwosan), healer (onisegun) and medicine (oogun) were terms and concepts employed among the Yoruba since at least the 19th century.2 Nonetheless, the term \"traditional\" (ibile) is of question specifically in the Yoruba context and most certainly worldwide. Many scholars take the position that \"traditional\" is a colonial creation. While this perspective has validity, it does not restrict the definition to purely colonial distortions, 1 As is noted in mid-twentieth century Yoruba healing studies by many authors such as D. D. O. Oyebola, \"Traditional Medicine and Its Practitioners among the Yoruba of Nigeria: A Classification,\" Social Science and Medicine. Series A: Medical Sociology London 14, no. 1 (1980). Furthermore confirmed by this study's oral history interviews. 2 See Joseph Odumosu, Iwosan (Ikeja: John West Publ., 1995 (originally 19th c.)). 105 nor does this line of thinking eliminate the term \"traditional\" as an appropriate description. On tradition in the colonial context, Thomas Spear reasons: When people resist forces intruding in their societies they frequently do so in the name of 'tradition', of defending their own way of doing things. Contrary to popular belief, however, 'tradition' is neither static nor monolithic. Rather, tradition is a contested terrain over which people debate contentious issues amongst themselves employing social ideas and values drawn from the past. Tradition provides a language for thinking about, debating, and resolving the problems of the present in an endless process of renovation, innovation, and transformation of the past. In short, tradition is a way of continuously discussing what constitutes a moral community.3 In direct relation to health and medical studies Green states: First, a note on the terminology. It has been argued that 'traditional healer' is a misnomer because healers are not strictly traditional; they are adaptive and ever changing. However, I will use the term because African healers themselves tend to prefer it over alternative terms that have been proposed and it is the preferred term in public health.4 \"Traditional\" healing is an idea that generally connotes a local, multigenerational healthcare system. Scholars of various disciplines such as history, religion and medicine have undertaken studies pertaining to indigenous healing. Nonetheless, the fields of anthropology and botany have dominated these investigations and thus, have provided numerous labels. In fact, there is no shortage in the wealth of terms that apply to the concept of indigenous healing. These types of \"medicine\" or \"healing\" may include the following: herbal, ethno, alternative, natural, holistic, complementary, tropical, popul ar, social, folk, traditional and indigenous . The terms therapeutics, alchemy and shamanism have also been used. These words take on an assortment of meanings with subtle and 3 Thomas Spear, Mountain Farmers: Moral Economies of Land & Agricultural Development in Arusha & Meru (Dar es Salaam. Berkeley, Calif.. Oxford: Mkuki na Nyota. University of California Press . J. Currey, 1997), 12. 4 E. C. Green, Indigenous Theories of Contagious Disease (AltaMira Press/Sage Publications. Wahiut Creek, CA, 1999), 29. 106 sometimes significant differences; however, often times, the scholars focus on similar topics\u2014culturally relevant and locally based strategies for well-being. While all of the healers interviewed for this study noted some transformations in Yoruba holistic medical practices all indicated strong links with the past and confidence in local resources, material and philosophical. Chief Aragberin of Otta stated, \"Traditional healing has existed since the days and times of our fore-fathers, before the arrival of the white men.\"5 Iyalorisa or priestess Edun Osawemimo observed, \"Traditional Healing is important to the society if practiced with good spirit. My mother was a gyne cologist and a traditional healer. My father also was a traditional healer. Traditional healing is made to heal people who are sick.\"6 Meanwhile, the 1930s \"Native Herbalist Egbe Onisegun Dudu Ti Eko,\" is just one example of several associations and individuals between 1922-1955 that linked themselves with past and local culture, in this case commonly using the colonial term \"native\". In one set of incorporation papers they state: This Society has been in existence for very long years before its being popularized by the late ABETIPA who became President in the year of our Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty-five (1855)...This Society is formed for the purpose of (a) natural aid and protection among Native Herbalist, Adaunses or Oniseguns and those who practise [sic] the native system of Therapeutics in Nigeria.7 The WHO simply states, \"a medical system is called 'traditional' when it is practiced within the country of origin.\"8 Thus, as these reflections sugge st, \"traditional\" 5 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin Edun Adebiyi Omoyebi April, 2008. 6 Edun Ogundeji Osawemimo, April, 2008. 7 \"The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria\" CSO 26 J/1 Z/1c. The date on the actual document states 1933, though correspondence in relation to it notes other dates. 8 X. Zhang, Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review (World Health Organization, 2001), 1. 107 incorporates innova tion, links with the past and local or native ways. It is fair that the Yoruba healers describe themselves as \"traditional healers.\" Although the term \"indigenous \" is a descriptor used occasionally throughout this dissertation it carries a similar meaning to \"traditional\" in that local cultural compone nts were a strong part of the healing system. While there seems to be a common connot ation and apparent meaning to the idea of indigenous healing, this is not always the case. Distortions of the idea of healing are reflected in views that label all healers as 'quacks' or 'charlatans' and/or practitioners of evil.9 Scholars who have done this often produc ed works that further reflect their ignorance, and laypersons' motivations for doing such are often the result of stereotyping and/or the result of religious prejudice.10 Yoruba healers throughout the colonial period petitioned the gove rnment to promote the distinction between healers and charlatans. One appeal in 1940 stated, \"riff-raff or uncertificated [sic] Herbalist pretenders are spoiling our proffesional [sic] works.\"11 Colonial administrator's corresponde nce does reflect a consistent unde rstanding of the difference between quacks and legitimate healers. In 1955 Parliamentary Secretary C.J. Mabey expressed the importance of investigations into \"African medicine\" and noted, \"The great danger, of course is that for every genuine healer, there may be twenty charlatans whose sole object is to prey on the 9 Generally this is the idea a healer is fake or unskilled while claiming skills. 10 Though there are scores of texts to highlight this point, one is example is the work by E. L. Margetts, \"Traditional Yoruba Healers in Nigeria,\" Man 65 (1965). 11 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 108 credulity of the ignorant. Our objective must be to protect the public from these charlatans.\"12 The Social Significance of Yoruba Healing General definitions of indigenous medicine are applicable to the Yoruba, none theless, a closer examination of Yoruba healing system demonstrates that it was informally structured and expansive. Clearly, this medical practice had numerous similarities with those of the colonial era, thus confirming a resiliency. At the same time the changes that occurred among the Yoruba popul ation at large, as well as within its medical system were notable. The three compone nts that reflect social views of Yoruba healing between 1922-1955 are: prevention, holism and public confidence. Prevention This c. 1930 postcard photo of Nigerian children bathing sought to substantiate the colonialists European impressions of the Yoruba as 'clean.' Figure 4.1.13 12 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 13 Photo from the special collections at the University of Birmingham. CMS Unofficial Papers, Acc 233 F10/1-103 1860-1930. Figure 4.1. 109 A major focus of the average Yoruba citizen was well being, especially having consistent good health and a long life. Therefore, prevention of sickness was a part of daily living. Two ways in which prevention was evident among the Yoruba was avoiding excess in consumption and behavior and maintaining good hygiene. The issue of hygiene was commented on greatly in this period. In a report on \"Customs & Superstition of Indigenous [Yoruba] Institutions\" c. 1930 a discussion detailed how the \"Yoruba people are of healthy appearance and of good phys ique.\" The work indicated that body cleanliness was important, men were well shaven, people washed daily and the towns were usually clean.14 The multiple types and uses of both soap and water in Yoruba healing makes it obvious how important cleanliness was among the Yoruba.15 Black soaps, most especially were medicinal, but also practical and commonly used. A 1946 missionary attempted to illustrate Yoruba culture to a friend noting, \"As a person the African is often falsely represented as dirty, dishone st, and inferior. He is, on the contrary, particular over his toilet, and the 'mud' smeared over his body in illness is really native medicine.\"16 While personal hygiene was coveted, both urban and rural areas of Yorubaland had been criticized for pollution and filth by various commentators during this colonial period. One colonial report noted that while \"the general health of the people seems to be good, the sanitary condition of most of the villages is bad.\"17 For instance, in 1942 at an 14 \"Notes on Customs & Superstition of Indigenous Institutions\" CSO 26 6076. 15 E. M. Rinne, \"Water and Healing\u2014Experiences from the Traditional Healers in Ile-Ife, Nigeria,\" Nordic Journal of African Studies 10, no. 1 (2001). 16 \"Correspondence\" CMS Archive, Medical Committee meeting, Oyinloye Jenriyin spoke about his concerned that the new generations since colonization forgot the ways of the old women [who] kept guard over wells and brooks with mounds built round them to prevent pollution and they (the old women) would not allow any person with guinea worm to go in to fetch water...old women kept vigilant watch over wells and brooks by constantly sweeping the surroundings. Water lettuce protected and made it cool and their roots to some extent, purified it.18 Thus while care and concern for the hygiene of the environment declined during this colonial period, personal hygiene did not. Holistic Healing The holistic nature of Yoruba healing fascinated countless foreigners and scholars; none theless this perspective was ingrained and quite normal to Yoruba citizens and to the healers, regardless of their religion. Holistic health and healing is defined as well being and medicine that is on the phys ical, psychological (mental and emotional) and the spiritual levels of the individual\u2014 usually simultaneously. The holistic aspects of Yoruba healing are considered separately in this text, for various reasons. Firstly, the phys ical, psychological, and spiritual aspects of this healing system were complex and intricate. Most importantly, both healers and patients operated with different degrees of commitment to the various aspects of healing. Thus, it is imperative that these distinctions be made. Such a separate view also will provide explanation on how it was that persons of various religions patronized and practiced this system. Cross culturally, it is common to find that an individual's mental and emotional issues were considered when phys ical or spiritual health problems arose. Because of the 18 \"Annual Reports of Medical and Health Departments,\" 1942, Ibadan Division, 1978, volume 1. 111 ambiguous and overlapping nature of psychological health concerns, this study does not analyze this area independently with great depth. Alternatively, the psychological dimensions are woven throughout this study. Another reason for integrating the psychological dimensions of health into this study is that various scholars relegated indigenous healing as only psychologically effective (the placebo effect).19 Such a sugge stion is considered invalid and unacceptable here. Yoruba healers and patients certainly unde rstood that many diseases were natural and had little if any psychological or spiritual compone nt to them.20 The phys ical aspects of Yoruba medicine were the baseline, the most munda ne feature of this system that facilitated resiliency of these healing methods . Numerous healers declared during this period that \"we are not 'BABA-ALAWO'S' but Native Herbalist Practitioners,\" as the Ibadan Native Herbalist Co-Operative Society did in 1940.21 Increasingly between 1922-1955 the aim of many healers was to present themselves as being free from indigenous religious approaches to healing. At the same time, the first line of health defense for patients using home remedies was common for simple illnesses. Merely purchasing medicines from herbal markets or asking a healer for a concoction addressed these simple issues. A 1927 report on Otta stated, \"A patient can approach a native doctor in two ways. Either he may give him a prescription to make 19 This is most often found in western medical literature, see authors such as Roy Porter, The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity, 1st American ed. (New York: Norton, 1998), for an example. 20 Osunwole, Samuel. \"Healing In Yoruba Traditional Belief Systems,\" (Dissertation, Ibadan: University of Ibadan, 1989), 29. 21 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 112 up, or he may ask the native doctor to diagnos e his complaint and treat him.\"22 The 'diagnos is' in this case could mean a holistic assessment or plainly labeling the illness, in the latter case signifying that it was naturally caused. Healers ability to distinguish themselves as religiously neutral promoted their resiliency between 1922-1955. Public Confidence The diverse range of health assessments that the healer could give the patient, healers' adaptability, and the efficacy of remedies were some of the reasons for the popul arity of and social confidence in Yoruba healing. This was despite the growing number of western medical options available to patients during this period. Mid-century studies reflect that Yoruba people preferred indigenous healing to western medicine for various illnesses.23 In 1945 , the Secretary of the Western Provinces said that in Ijebu \"most sufferers prefer to seek 'native medicines' and hide in the outlying villages.\"24 Still, toward the close of this period, The Nigerian Association of Medical Herbalists note that in 1954 a public radio debate held by the Lagos Minister of Health \"in order to test opinion of the public...the Herbalists secured the highest vote 22 in favour and 2 against.\"25 Many scholars who sought to unde rstand the social popul arity of indigenous healing concentrated only on the shortcomings and repulsive dimensions of western 22 \"Assessment Abeokuta \"The Yoruba Cultural Construction of Health and Illness,\" Nordic Journal of African Studies 11, no. 3 (2002); Z. A. Ademuwagun, \"The Challenge of the Co-Existence of Orthodox and Traditional Medicine in Nigeria,\" East African medical journal 53, no. 1 (1976). U. MacLean, \"Leighton, Ah, Ta Lambo, Charles C.

Simpson, Yoruba Religion and Medicine in Ibadan (Ibadan, Nigeria: 1980). 24 \"Leprosy in 1941-56, Ijebu Provincial office 780 volume 2. 25 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 113 medicine. As if to say, 'if only western medicine would address these issues, then people would stop patronizing indigenous medicine.' Vaugha n illustrates that in parts of East Africa, people remained most confident in their own systems because of invasive techniques like vaccinations and amputations, impersonal care, overly individualistic approaches, and socially destructive campaigns. 26 To this list other scholars also have commented that lack of access, limited technology in many impove rished locations and greater expenses were additional reasons people continue to use holistic healing methods . While all of these reasons were legitimate and significant, popul arity was also the result of the structure of the Yoruba healing system. The Structure of the Yoruba Healing System on Natural Terms To grasp the structure of the Yoruba healing system between 1922 and 1955 one would want to know : What types of healers were there, what illnesses did people face, and what treatments did healers provide. The bias in this section is on the \"natural\" compone nts, not the \"supernatural\" aspects. Nonetheless, the ability to completely distinguish the natural from the supernatural components is difficult. For example, while Mr. Adeboje, whose family did healings of phys ical and metaphys ical origins, cleverly observed, When you are asking God to help you solve problems, but the answer is not coming down right away. You send in somebody, the problem may be solved through me. What you call a problem, may not be a problem by my sight. You have a stomach ache, instead of you going to one doctor to miscarry and say open your stomach [do an operation], I pray in the traditional way and it will go [away].27 26 Megan Vaughan, Curing Their Ills: Colonial Power and African Illness (Cambridge: Polity, 1991), 43-50. 27 Personal interview of Olusegun Adeboje, August, 2001. 114 Types of Yoruba Healers \"You know we have different types of herbalist...[there were] specialist in gyne cology...You see when you are saying traditional medicine we have brands, some go to mental healers...\" Mr. Adeboje explained. 28 Table 4.a Type 'herbalist' or 'indigenous healer.' This term was most often used for healers, regardless of their specialty or religion. However, onisegun was also the term for the priests of Osayin, the divinity of herbs. Adahuns e A type of Onisegun who learned his/her skill on their own, without extensive formal training. Awon Leku-leja, Iyaloja, Babaloja, Oluta Pharmacists and market sellers. These were often women. Obstetricians, Gynecologists & Midwives Sometimes know n as: Iya-Alagbo or Baba-Alagbo29 These people were Onisegun specializing in obstetrics and/or gyne cology, or people who helped with basic aspects of birth such as cutting the cord. Bonesetters A type of Onisegun who usually exclusively healed broken bone s. Psychiatrists An Onisegun or Babalawo who specialized in the mentally ill patients. Olola Surgeon who usually did circumcision. Babalawo (or Iyanifa) Diviners that were priests of Ifa, the divinity of know ledge. These priests often had in-depth unde rstanding of herbs and natural remedies. Olorisa Priest of any other Orisa (Yoruba divinities). They often kept shrines and divined, some also had know ledge of healing remedies. Afaa Mallams or Islamic priests/prayer leaders. Aladur a A Yoruba spiritual healer from the Aladura Church, an independent Christian church. 30 28 Ibid. 29 Osunwole, \"Healing In Yoruba Traditional Belief Systems,\" 59. 30 Table 4.a, adapted from Oyebola, \"Traditional Medicine and Its Practitioners among the Yoruba of Nigeria: A Classification.\" 115 Oyebola's classification of Yoruba healers discusses eleven categories and subcategories of healers that are used as the main reference for table 4.a. 31 These healers were all evidently in operation during the between 1922 and 1955. The table does delineate the healers by non-religious and religiously oriented practitioners as much as possible. Nevertheless, the table is not completely in order of importance, especially since the Onisegun and the Babalawo were the most documented of the various types of healers described here. This table 4.a reflects the fact that while some healers were general practitioners other healers were specialists. During this period, the difference between indigenous 'doctors' and priests was noted in colonial reports as well as healers associations' correspondences. Healers distinguished themselves as \"native doctors\"/Oniseguns or \"priests\"/Babalawos. The colonial authorities recognized and respected the difference between the two as demonstrated by a 1927 Assessment Report on Otta in which accounted for over 40 occupations. Most of the 7,985 people listed in the report were farmers and food sellers, however seven were designated as \"fetish priests\" and five were listed as \"native doctors.\"32 It is not likely the colonial administrators fully unde rstood that some \"native doctors\" were actually babal awos, on the other hand reputable babal awos would not declare themselves as 'native doctors' unless they had a specialty, which included 31 Oyebola, \"Traditional Medicine and Its Practitioners among the Yoruba of Nigeria: A Classification.\" For purposes of this dissertation, the strongly religiously oriented healers will be discussed further in the next chapter. 32 \"Assessment Abeokuta Province; Report: Otta District,\" 1927 similar references are made in \"Intelligence Report on Ado District, Ekiti Division Ondo Province\" 1935 CSO 26 29734. 116 making medicines for natural illnesses.33 It should also be noted that the two terms were normally not interchangeable, because Babalawos did not call themselves Oniseguns and vice versa. The fact is that many healers were farmers or hunters regardless of their religion. The farmers had know ledge of how to grow their own herbs, while the hunters had an eye for the wild medicinal sources.34 Almost every one of the oral history interviewees had parents who were farmers or hunters. The relationship of healing know ledge and hunting dominates the historical record. The obvious conclusion may be to assume that more onisegun were hunters as oppos ed to farmers, however, this assessment is oversimplified. What becomes more apparent is that the array of reasons for which the hunters sought to use medicine was more fascinating, and thus determined to be more worthy of documentation. Additionally, compared to farmers the hunters encountered a broader assortment of healing resources, such as wild plants, animals and minerals that would suppor t a greater diversity of remedies. The former point is emphasized in a 1930s colonial report stated: Certain hunters are reputed to have great knowledge of medicines and magic and they are consulted. Medicines are prepared with a reputation for making the hunters invisible as a protection against attack and also to enable easy approach to the animals. There are special medicines which must be obtained before the elephant, lion, leopard, etc. can be hunted.35 [Yes, these animals did exist in this region.] It may be inferred that healing specialties had a long-standing pre-colonial history when considering the range of occupations Yoruba engaged in for centuries, as well as 33 Wande Abimbola, If\u00e1: An Exposition of If\u00e1 Literary Corpus (Ibadan: Oxford University Press Nigeria, 1976) discusses the various types of Babalawo. 34 Anthony D. Buckley, Yoruba Medicine (Oxford New York: Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, 1985), 2. 35 \"Notes on Customs & Superstition of Indigenous Institutions\" CSO 26 6076. 117 the multitude of expertise that Yoruba priest (both Babalawo and Olorisa) exercised. Certain specialties were much more common than others in the 1922-1955 period. The area of expertise that was infrequently found in Yorubaland during this period was that of the bone setters and surgeons who preformed more than circumcision.36 Oniseguns as herbalists were the most widespread of the various types of healers. Photo of an Ibadan, Nigeria healing market woman chopping herbs. Photo taken by the author, April, 2008. Figure 4.2. The market sellers, usually women, have not been properly recorded in the historical record as an important source of healing guidance. Typical aspects of patriarchy of both European and Yoruba societies explain the dearth of missionary, colonial and early academic writings on female healers. However, post independence scholars noted the contributions of market sellers/pharmacists to Yoruba healing. 36 On bonesetters see: Oyebola, \"Yoruba Traditional Bonesetters: The Practice of Orthopaedics in a Primitive Setting in Nigeria,\" and a comment on the infrequency of bonesetters in Peter Dopamu, \"The Practice of Magic and Medicine in Yoruba Traditional Religion\" (Dissertation, University of Ibadan, 1977), 446. Isaac O. Delano, The Soul of Nigeria (London: Werner, 1937), 83-87 discusses an experience with a native surgeon, which he never heard of before. This author did not find archival evidence for these types healers. 118 Nevertheless, very few scholars profiled these female healers. Buckley explains that women were the principle ones involved in the \"sale of medicinal ingredients [and]...Since these women were intimately familiar with the plants and animals they handled, they undoubt edly did know much about medicine\".37 The Yeye of Lagos notes that she sells prepackaged medicines similar to how her grandmother did. For example, her grandmother sold soaps, powders, roots, as well as medicines for love, to prevent fights, to help with one's career. The Yeye's grandmother \"had many things in her store...she would have people selling for her.\"38 Maclean is an exception to the standard of excluding market women as healers in the writings just after this period. In giving an elaborate description of the popul arity of and the variety within these markets, she notes \"Men...of ten have to acquire the basic ingredients from the market-women.\"39 In fact, male and female healers collaborated to some degree. Mrs. Oyebisi revealed that some women were \"in their husbands hous es selling herbs.\"40 Additionally, women knew what to prescribe, thus Oyebola's term \"pharmacists,\" yet in many instances offered their own prescriptions as oppos ed to simply fulfilling the prescriptions from male healers. The domain of female and adolescent healthcare was an area practiced by both male and female healers. Dopamu explains the reasons why such a specialty would be so prevalent among the Yoruba. The desire to have children dominates the whole outlook of the Yoruba. To them, celibacy is an abomination, and anybody that refuses to get marri ed while he is under 37 Buckley, Yoruba Medicine, 3. 38 Personal interview of Ifafunke Olagbaju/Yeye of Lagos, April, 2008. 39 Una Maclean, Magical Medicine: A Nigerian Case-Study (London: Allen Lane, 1971), 70. 40 Personal interview of Mulili Atu Oyebisi (Iyaloja), April, 2008. 119 normal conditions to do so, is regarded as committing a major offence in the eyes of society. In actual fact, the Yoruba regard marriage as a sacred duty which every normal person must perform. They regard marriage and childbearing as the focus of life itself...Mo reover, inability to procreate is regarded as a catastrophe and a major failure of marriage.41 Descriptions and investigations of local obstetricians, gyne cologists, midwives and pediatricians are rare in archival records.42 The evidence once again, is more so suppor ted by most of the oral histories. For instance, Iyalorisa (priestess) Edun Osawemimo stated, \"The case of women uncontrollably in public and also bedwet [was a case] in which I knew that my mother usually heal people of such a problem.\"43 In 1952, Chief S.O. Oloye, an herbalist, sent a detailed letter petitioning the gove rnment for compensation because he made a citizen's arrest of a \"mad man for the welfare of the town\". He notes that after disturbing people in Oshodi, the \"mad man\" came to Agege (in Lagos) and harassed and stole from market women, attempted to murder some European children riding in a car, and then vandalized a hous e. \"When I saw this mad man, I called him at once with charms, then I asked him to stretch his hands and feet and he was thereby chained.\" While waiting for colonial resolution the healer spent his own money and efforts \"feeding him and [I, the healer] started reducing his power by means of medicine.\"44 This interesting scenario exemplifies that this healer specialized in indigenous psychology. The colonial environments with increased transportation and impersonal 41 Dopamu, \"The Practice of Magic and Medicine 26 20629, discusses cultural dimensions of women having children and that herbal remedies are use during this process. 43 Personal interview of Edun Ogundeji Osawemimo, April, 2008. It was noted earlier in the chapter that her mother was a traditional gynecologist. 44 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 120 urbanization contributed to adverse impacts of the mentally ill upon society. Thus this area of healing became increasingly valuable. Furthermore, indigenous methods of restraint and care are illustrated here. The healer demonstrated aspects of holistic healing that were ideal of healers, such as concern for communal safety. Nonetheless, the request for monetary compensation was indicative of the time, in that it was not uncommon for healers to work without expectation of monetary payment in pre-colonial and in earlier portions of this colonial period. Training of Yoruba Healers Most healers obtained their training from one or both of their parents. This fact was expressed by some corresponde nce to the colonial government.45 Various female oral history interviewees noted training came from their mothers, grandmothers and/or their aunts who were also healers. Mrs. Oyebisi, the head of an Ibadan healing market, stated, \"I learned it [herb selling and healing] from my aunt. Yes, she was the one because we don't differentiate the two\u2014when one is trained to become an herb seller, one would always be taught how to do healing from the herbs, and this is how I was taught.\"46 Chief Aragberin declared, \"I was born into traditional healing because it was the occupation of my father. This is why I have chosen to be a traditional healer.\"47 Likewise, Chief Olojede stated \"I was born into the family [of Yoruba healers] and I grew up in the practice, immediately after my father died I took over the job. My father taught me...He was 74 years old when he died.\"48 45 \"Homeopathic Practitioners\" & \"Native Drs. and Herbalist Matters Ilesha 2349. 46 Personal interview of Mulili Atu Oyebisi (Iyaloja), April, 2008. 47 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin Edun Adebiyi Omoyebi, April, 2008. 48 Personal interview of Chief Fatai Olojede, April, 2008. 121 At the same time that healers cited a parent as their teacher, numerous healers apprenticed with another master as well, as was the experience of Chief Elebuibon who studied with family and non-relatives.49 There also were the rare cases in this period in which healers would become an apprentice although no person in their family had an indigenous medicine background, although apprenticing increased post-independence. Finally, as the definition of the Adahuns e states, there were healers who acquired know ledge through personal revelation, be that revelation practical/experiential or divine inspiration. Mr. Adeboje reveals that whether a person was trained from a parent or via non-related apprenticeship, in this period healers made \"covenants\" or contracts with their trainers to guide the way they approached their healing work. If you want it [the medicine] to work, there should be a covenant. Even my father, before they can release [a trainee] there had to be covenant, [with] everyone, there should be agreement...Without that covenant, I don't think you will get anything [any success]. When my father was growing old. [He said] 'Have you written this? Come and tell me how far [much]?' If you do the incantation correct, he would say 'You have mastered that...I have given you this, under my seal and in good faith. And you should not use it to the detriment of others.' That is the covenant. [His father mandated] 'You should not take any money on this thing [healing practices].' The other way around, another man would say, 'if you want to do this thing, you want to apply it? I have taken a goat from you. Anybody you are going to apply it to, you must take a goat [from too].50 Keeping secrets was an important part of practicing Yoruba healing. A circa 1930 report explained, There are certain persons who practise [sic] medicine to whom people resort in emergency. These [people] undoubtedly have a knowledge of herbal and other remedies, but they keep their art a profound secret and as a rule such knowledge as they have acquired dies with them, and much which might be valuable is lost. Very occasionally 49 Personal interview of Chief Ifayemi Elebuibon, August, 2007. 50 Personal interview of Olusegun Adeboje, August, 2001. 122 one of these will impart his secret to a favorite son or daughter, but such an occurrence is exceptional.51 Illness in Yorubaland During this colonial period, natural illnesses that colonialist and missionaries were concerned with were not the same as what Yoruba healers often focused on. There were multiple reasons for this, such as western medical workers entering the region with an agenda based on stereotypes of \"African diseases,\" that over-generalized and incorrectly constructed illness in this region. Furthermore, many western medical practitioners had self-centered interests and couldn't fully distinguish what the Yoruba considered health priorities verses, what diseases they were taught to address because these issues affected Europeans worse than they did Africans (i.e., yellow fever and malaria). Dr. Hilary Mayes working in Ekiti, wrote in 1940: I had previously pictured the people, sad, wretched, riddled with disease, flocking to recei ve the healing ministrations of the European doctor. In actual fact...the majority of people who attended our little hospital appeared to me remarkably robust and cheerful, their only complaint being stomach ache for which one and all demanded worm treatment. I had yet to learn that the African, at least in the district in which I was working, regards illness as a disgrace.52 Though various scholars discuss the causes and types of illnesses that healers addressed in Yorubaland, Osunwole provides the most concise overview. A multitude of Yoruba terms describing the degrees of sickness an individual may have yields insight into Yoruba view of illness. Yoruba concepts of illness included: Aisan not well; Okunrun or serious or sick for long time; Ailera or 51 \"Notes on Customs & Superstition of Indigenous Institutions\" CSO 26 6076. The concept of secrets will be discussed in-depth in chapter 6. 52 Mayes. \"Pioneering in the Yoruba Country.\" The Way of Healing. London, 1940. Church Missionary Society Archive, Section 3, Central Manuscript Records (England: Adam Matthew Publications, 1996-). University of Pennsylvania microfilm reels 55-62. 123 unwholesome or weak body; Ara-Lile or body of wellness; Oriburuku or misfortune.53 These degrees were critical in determining source of illness and need for care among the Yoruba. For instance, the difference between a natural or supernaturally caused illness may have been declared because of scale. 'Not well' would likely be natural; 'misfortune' would likely be supernatural. A colonial report written c. 1930 on Yoruba customs stated: The views held generally as to the cause of sickness are straightforward; sickness is regarded as being due to natural causes, or the machinations of some enemy or evil disposed person and as being capable of being cured by natural medicines if only these were known; even a hernia comes into this category and it is no uncommon thing for a Medical Officer to be asked for a medicine, rather than a knife, for it's cure.54 Diseases that had a natural cause had various root causes, such as bad food/drink, overindulgence, overwork, impure blood, internal worms, weather, heredity, and fluid or airborne contagion.55 The 1931 Census of Nigeria for Abeokuta, one of the larger Yoruba cities, noted that less than two percent of the popul ation suffered from the following illnesses: infectious diseases, vision, hearing, digestion, skin, bone s and joint, deformities, circulatory, respiratory, urinary, those of infancy, and of the elderly.56 Yoruba healing was used to heal a variety of health problems. \"We use traditional healing for curing sick people, those that have a stroke, those that have supernatural problems and those who are barren.\"57 With this statement, Chief Odua not only made the point that Yoruba healing addressed both biological and phys ical illnesses, 53 Osunwole, \"Healing In Yoruba Traditional Belief Systems,\" 68. These terms vary in different Yoruba regions, and may not be the standard or commonly used terms for these degrees of affliction. 54 \"Notes on Customs & Superstition of Indigenous Institutions\" CSO 26 55 Osunwole, \"Healing In Yoruba Traditional Belief Systems,\" 72-73, in addition to other scholars. These references are verified for this period by various missionary documents that briefly mention many of these assessments. 56 \"Census of Nigeria 1931 Volumes II\", Crown Agents for the Colonies: London, 1933. 57 Personal interview of Chief Erelu (Onisegun Awo) Odua, April, 2008. 124 but also these health problems were some of the most popul ar issues Yoruba healers remedied. Some healers of this colonial period had experiences similar to Chief Olojede's first job. There was a woman with an acute pile [hemorrhoids] who was brought to me, whose pile needed to be cut, it was a serious case. But, I advised them not to cut it off, that I could prepare herbs that could heal her of this problem. So, I prepared herbs for this woman and this woman was healed of this acute pile.58 Yoruba healers adapted to the health changes this colonial period brought . Scholars have speculated that selected afflictions became present or more widespread in Yorubaland during colonialism (i.e., gonor rhea). Although this idea has been debated, healers were drawn to seek resolutions to issues that did not seem native to the area. An example is the lack of distinctions healers made between asthma and tuberculosis.59 Various studies indicate that reproduc tive health medicines were a large, if not major, portion of Yoruba healing encyclopedias.60 Many of these issues were ones that both healers and clients believed western medicine could not resolve. Chief Aragberin stated, \"There was one woman who had been pregnant for three years, whom was brought to me and I healed her.\"61 The health crisis of an extremely prolonge d pregnancy with an eventual successful birth with the aid of a healer was one commonly know n issue that the healing specialist resolved. This type of issue was likely prone to be considered an implausible situation to a western medical practitioner. Though missionaries and 58 Personal interview of Chief Fatai Olojede, April, 2008. 59 Dopamu, \"The Practice of Magic and Medicine in Yoruba Traditional Religion,\" 429. 60 Later sections of this chapter will highlight the diversity of medicines related to women's reproductive health problems. 61 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin Edun Adebiyi Omoyebi , April, 2008. 125 colonialists had ulterior motives in emphasizing the importance of female health, and they often painted indigenous medicine as destructive and useless for reproduc tive issues. Mental health, on the other hand, was acknow ledged as an area of indigenous healing that had a greater degree of respect, albeit not extensive, from foreign observers and commentators during this period. Sadowsky, Imperial Bedlam: Institutions of Madne ss in Colonial Southwest Nigeria points out that chains and shackles used among the Yoruba to restrain the insane are evidence of certain pre-colonial methods of containment.62 Additionally, research by Raymond Prince and T.A. Lambo reflected areas of efficacy Yoruba healers had in the treatment of the mentally ill, such as tested herbs (e.g. rauwolfia) and culturally appropriate social methodology for mental illness treatment (e.g. indigenous half-way hous es). A modern trend by outsiders has been to designate indigenous healing as psychologically satisfying and fulfilling although not concretely effective. While the amount of medicines to resolve patients' social ills, i.e., prosperity and love, were abunda nt in this period, healers clearly differentiated these issues from that of the mentally ill. Thus, it would be incorrect to presume that that mentally soothing medicine was also unde rstood as treatment of the mentally insane, though these areas have some overlap. Sadowsky for instance, deducts from the archival records of this period that insanity increased during colonization.63 Likewise, peoples' dissatisfaction with social circumstances multiplied during this period. 62 J. H. Sadowsky, Imperial Bedlam: Institutions of Madness in Colonial Southwest Nigeria (University of California Press, 1999), 16. 63 Ibid, 99. 126 An example of a disease that concerned the Yoruba in the 1922-1955 period is smallpox. Nonetheless, the pre-colonial activities that smallpox experts unde rtook to naturally address that illness in Yorubaland demonstrated a keen know ledge of how to control the disease. For instance, the long-standing practices of inoculation, sanitation and quarantines preceded colonization. In a missionary letter c. 1945 the author illustrates just how perceptive the Yoruba were about this disease. In this case a man found on the street was brought to the hospital with no apparent signs of what his illness was, but: The natives have also an extraordinary sense of smell...none of the native nurses were willing to approach him. The doctor asked one who was standing near: 'Please, ma, this man has smallpox', she replied. 'How do you know, nurse?' 'Please, ma, he smells of a smallpox' was the reply, and the next day the spots started to appear.64 Methods of Healing Yoruba healers offered their clients an extremely wide array of healing methods and remedies. The natural phys ical methods of healing included \"incision...a nd herbal soups ,\"65 topical applications, ingested medicines, verbal affirmations and dance therapies. To create the commonly used topical and ingested medicines healers made medicines via drying, poundi ng, burning, boiling, cold liquid infusions, food additions, soaps and ointments. In commenting on the continuance of approach between today's healers with those of the 1922-1955 period, Chief Olojede notes: \"whatever herb that needs to be burnt must be burnt, and whichever needs to be cooke d must be cooke d, and so many more\u2014these are the similarities [with the previous generation].\"66 64 \"Correspondence\" CMS Archive, Medical Department M/Y A2 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin Edun Adebiyi Omoyebi, April, 2008. 66 Personal interview of Chief Fatai Olojede, April, 2008. 127 Globally, there were both advantages and disadvantages to indigenous healing.67 The advantages were often the oppos ite of what was discussed as the shortcomings to western medicine. For example, Sofowora observes indigenous medicine was affordable, accessible, culturally relevant, accepted, and time efficient. Furthermore, he details that there were readily available suppor t resources\u2014namely the locally derived medicines including herbs, minerals, animals, etc., as well as less likelihood of side affects and resistance to chemicals. The disadvantages of indigenous medicine were a lack of scientifically tested evidence, imprecise dosages, unhygi enic, the immeasurability of spiritual aspects, and the overemphasis on evil as a source of affliction.68 On the issue of scientific testing, from the mid-1930s Yoruba healers increasingly urged the gove rnment to test their produc ts. They realized affirmative test results would legitimize their businesses in the eyes of some, potentially increase clientele and possibly provide protection against police, courts and even some indigenous rulers, who, on rare occasion took issue with Yoruba healers. Government corresponde nce reflects that the resistance to these requests declined steadily toward the close of this colonial period, especially once the University of Ibadan opened in 1948 and even more so with the excitement of the teaching hospital opening in 1956. The gove rnment then hope d the University would tackle the effort of studying local healing methods , which, to some extent, it did. 67 Abayomi Sofowora, Medicinal Plants and Traditional Medicine in Africa (Chichester: Wiley, 1982), 100-108. 68 Ibid. 128 Imprecise dosages were commented on in the archival records. In 1954, D.A. Nnaji in a House of Representatives debate stated, What is required is purification and modernization of the administration of African drugs to people. What worries the African today is the administration of his own drugs to cure certain diseases, i.e., what quantity to use...they [the healers] can only fill a cup and tell you to drink. That is only where they are wrong.69 Mrs. Osawemimo stated \"then my father did not have a specific measurements for medicines, he usually used his hand to measure the herbs.\"70 A memo from the Osogbo Assistant District Officer in 1927 spoke of a case in which a medical officer accused a \"native doctor\" of poisoning a patient by an 'irritant drug,' for which the patient then came to the hospital and died. However, the \"deceased's wife bears no ill-will against the native doctor and indeed denies he treated her husband as does the native doctor himself.\" The \"accused admitted\" giving the deceased \"akpata\" mixed with potash and gin, and said that he's given it to many patients. The officer interviewed four other healers who said that the herb was a common remedy, but \"too much potash would cause harm.\" The \"head native doctor\" said he does not use potash for this reason. Since it was only the western medical doctor accusing the healer, the healer was coope rative and had communal suppor t, ultimately, the officer ruled that there was no criminal intent.71 As discussed earlier unhygi enic environments were problematic in this colonial period. The uncleanly atmosphere at this time caused numerous health issues and facilitated epidemics. Though healers were aware of the importance of personal hygiene, 69 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 70 Personal interview of Edun Ogundeji Osawemimo, April, 2008. 71 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 129 the sanitation of the surroundi ngs was less of a concern. Chief Olojede stated, \"There are differences [from his father's days], like the environment then used to be dirty, but now everywhere is clean, because wherever you want to do healing should always be hygienic; and must be separated from where people sleep.\"72 Most scholars of Yoruba medicine, including Odumosu from the 19th c. list recipes for healing. However, it was well documented, between 1922 and 1955 that many published works typically leave out a vital ingredient or preparatory step, thus any recipes published should be approached as examples for informing and for analysis, not necessarily as practically instructive. This is because when healers transferred their know ledge to any person who had not demonstrated decades long commitment through apprenticeship usually via a blood relative, they used secrecy as a protective means to not inform the inquisitor that there is a missing element. There were several categories and over a hund red subcategories of medicines that healers used, which illustrate the voluminous encyclopedia of thous ands of healing ways available to Yoruba people between 1922 and 1955. Odumosu of the 19th c. spectacularly lists over 5,000 medicinal recipes both natural and spiritually oriented.73 Table 4.b is a sample of medicinal categories for health concerns of the 1922-1955 period. 72 Personal interview of Chief Fatai Olojede, April, 2008. 73 Toyin Falola, Yoruba Gurus: Indigenous Production of Knowledge in Africa (Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press, 1999), 20. 130 Table 4.b74 Yoruba Medicinal Categories English Translation Abiku Medicine for stopping miscarriage and infant death.

Oogun meaning 'medicine' commonly preceded the name of the illness, as a label for the specific remedy. Additionally, Pierre Verger who began his education on Yoruba medicine in 1953 published 218 medicinal recipes strictly as \"Oogun, remedies for healing the body, \" and this did not include the 30 plus recipes he lists for \"Ibimo remedies relating to pregnancy and birth,\" his ibimo remedies section is both natural and supernatural.75 It is imperative to briefly discuss medicinal ingredients when considering methods of healing in Yorubaland. Those healers at this time who sought to remove themselves from indigenous religion concentrated on the herbal dimensions of the healing recipes. This strategy can be easily unde rstood as an innov ation, when one examines the medicinal formulas almost every single recipe demanded herbs, often as a central compone nt. While herbs dominated the overall Yoruba medicinal recipe encyclopedias, animal, mineral and food substances, as well as chants were critical to certain formulas. A 1927 colonial report noted that \"nearly every kind of vegetation is used for making medicines,\" listing materials such as, 'cucumbers like creepers,' palm oil, banana tree sap, shea butter, bitter orange juice, potash and melon seeds.76 Here's an example of a recipe for the common ailment of a stomachache. This includes the plants' species, family, common and local names. 75 Pierre Verger, Ewe: The Use of Plants in Yoruba 20629, the author also lists some recipes, but they are likely incomplete. 132 \"Leaf of Ricinodendron Heudeloth, incantation. Drink every morning. 'Ajabgo, cure the stomachache Ologbokiyan, carry the stomach ache elsewhere Eeru, take the stomachache away Aidan, do not let it disturb me.'\"77 When cross-referenced with modern Nigerian academic herbal literature, these herbs were referenced as effective for digestive issues and/or general pain relief. Many published Yoruba recipe compone nts are now being found as effective. What also is demonstrated by this formula is the ease with which a healer or patient of any religion could use the remedy. The 'chants' cited are in reference to the plants, not a supernatural or spiritual entity. To verbalize, instruct and or reinforce one's desires of the plants' effects was the concept of word power (ase) or positive affirmations. Yoruba healing methods consisted not only of medicines but also of various antidotes. Additionally, even the timing of life and death was addressed through Yoruba healing, and some lives and deaths required antidotes for the life process to proceed. Mr. Adeboje recounts that in the 1950s : There was a man brought to me in the night, and they wake me up...[this was] the last place he went was to die, I was the one who released him...He could not die because he had made so many preparations [medicines] during his lifetime, and to let him go he must make an antidote. When he made the remedy he knew the antidote\u2014before you make any remedy you should ask for the antidote...As I was preparing the antidote...h e said I 77 Verger, Ewe: The Use of Plants in Yoruba Society, 187; parenthesis names are from Tolu Odugbemi, Outlines and Pictures of Medicinal Plants from Nigeria (Lagos: University of Lagos Press, 2006). 133 should be looking at the man, that he will not want to die on Saturday...because it is a taboo.78 Here, Mr. Adeboje ensured that his patient died on the culturally correct day. In this case, he also learned an antidote for a long-life medicine. Finally, it should be acknow ledged that access to herbs transformed during the colonial period\u2014in two directions: less access and greater access. Because of corporate mono-cropping and sprawl, access to certain plants decreased, especially those that could only be obtained wildly, but also those from farmlands. Chief Aragberin noted \"the farm from which my father generated herbs then was nearby, but now those places have been turned to hous es, so we need to go to a very far place to source for herbs.\"79 On the other hand, increasingly during this period, there was greater exchange of international ideas, and thus by the 1950s healers were occasionally integrating foreign herbs into their repertoire. Additionally, they were using indigenous herbs in ways foreigners used them, but local people historically had not.80 Conclusion This chapter examined the state of Yoruba healing between 1922-1955. Yoruba healers view is justified that their system was \"traditional\" given its multigenerational and local know ledge. At the same time, the Yoruba healing system was part of a global network of indigenous healing systems because of the holistic perspectives that helped to define Yoruba healing. Yoruba people were loyal to Yoruba healing, despite some of the disadvantages of the system such as healers giving imprecise dosages. Additionally, 78 Personal interview of Olusegun Adeboje, August, 2001. 79 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin Edun Adebiyi Omoyebi , April, 2008. 80 These facts are taught at the University of Ibadan, learned via the personal interview with Bukola Ajisafe, April, 2008 though it has not be well documented. 134 many Yoruba used preventive strategies, such as personal hygiene and herbal remedies to address natural illnesses. The natural and phys ical compone nts of the Yoruba healing system were a focus of this chapter. What was demonstrated here is that Yoruba healing in this colonial period consisted of a wide variety in the type of healers, and that Yoruba healing addressed health issues that were biological. In the healing of biological issues healers relied on herbs and other natural substances, in addition to psychology to create remedies. Certain remedies for phys ical wellness, at times had metaphys ical compone nts, for instance Agbode we was 'a medicine to make the old look young permanently.' Nevertheless, the supernatural compone nts of Yoruba healing are investigated in the next chapter in order to determine how the religious changes of this period did and did not affect Yoruba healing. 135 Chapter Five Yoruba Spiritual Healing: Religion Outsiders usually equated the spiritual dimensions of Yoruba healing with Yoruba religion. However, increasingly during the 1922-1955 period there were clearer distinctions between Yoruba medicine and Yoruba religion. For the purposes of unde rstanding the spiritual aspects of Yoruba healing and the ways religion and healing impacted each other, this chapter examines the following: Yoruba religion circa 1922; spirituality and healing in Yorubaland; components of Yoruba religion relative to healing; and the divinities that relate Christianity's relationship to Yoruba healing is analyzed here. In this chapter it becomes apparent that the flexibility of Yoruba healing as useful on spiritual levels despite the religion of the practitioner or patient, was another reason for the resiliency of Yoruba healing between 1922 and 1955. Yoruba Religion Circa 1922 Ife was know n as the original kingdom of the Yoruba people, because Oduduw a settled there. Oduduw a was the original ancestor and first king of the Yoruba people. Descendants of Oduduw a were noted as the identifying marker of a 'Yoruba' person, at times more so than speaking a dialect of the Yoruba langua ge. Certain Nigerian Yoruba groups did not claim Oduduw a, yet many Dahomeans claimed to have descended from Oduduw a. The Yoruba nationalist leader Obafemi Awolowo championed the relationship to Oduduw a as the definition of 'Yoruba' c. 1948 and created an international recognition 136 of this ideology although it was common among the Yoruba beforehand. Oduduw a was regarded as the Yoruba's progenitor among most local kingdom s. The significance of Oduduw a as the symbolic representative of the Yoruba is that it demonstrates how deeply Yoruba kingdom s and societies were anchored in indigenous religion(s). Modupe Opeola's alternative theory to describe Yoruba origins asserts that it was actually \"odu\" that unites the Yoruba people. 1 Additionally, he notes that odu and Oduduw a were \"one and the same.\" 2 There is additional evidence to suppor t this theory because Oduduw a translated as 'Odu exists.' The odu were the consistently evolving chapters within the Ifa corpus.3 The odu were known as the Yoruba's cultural, philosophical, and historical archives. The existence of odu may be the revolution that Oduduw a as a historical character represents. Oduduwa was the description of the establishment of a new dyna sty c. 1000 C.E., in which the Ifa corpus guided the Yoruba kingdom s. This concept exemplifies how intricately woven Yoruba religion and secular life were, including conne ctions between Yoruba healing and religion. During this colonial period both Christians and colonialists sought to remove many Yoruba religious/spiritual connot ations from the Yoruba culture, e.g. stories of origin. Samuel Johns on inscribed the legacy of Oduduw a, without reference to odu in his legendary text The History of the Yorubas from the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the 1 S.M. Opeola, \"Odu: A Repository of the Secret (Ile-Ife: Kabbalah Center, 2001), and Opeola, \"\"Relevance of Literary Corpus to the 21st Century Yoruba Studies,\"\" (Ile-Ife: 2001). 2 Opeola, 3 Wande Abimbola, If\u00e1: An Exposition of If\u00e1 Literary Corpus (Ibadan: Oxford University Press Nigeria, 1976). 137 British Protectorate first published in 1921.4 Although numerous scholars have elaborated on the 'sacred' position of Yoruba kings, Johns on's depiction of Oduduw a was similar to many healers' dichotomy of Yoruba religion and Yoruba healing. A colonial report c. 1930 notes, There were at one time a set of medicine men specially licensed by the king; they were remarkable for their skill in...secret poisons which were at the kings service when required, but failure to produce fatal effect meant death to themselves. The knowledge of poisons is still considerable.5 The king's \"medicine men\" were priest of Ifa. The Ifa corpus was a common feature in Yorubaland, regardless of whether the kingdom paid allegiance to 'Oduduw a' and despite the worship of any other orisa (divinity). The CMS missionaries encountered babalawos in every part of Yorubaland prior to colonial rule. They found that there was a unity between religion, society and gove rnment. The king or oba as the custodian of local divinities, made offerings on behalf of the public at shrines because these were the places \"where the presence of a spirit is more eminent.\"6 Ancestor and divinity spirits then blessed towns with peace, food, children, etc. Communal festivals, for instance had multiple purposes including purifying the town so citizens would have good health and long life.7 In the colonial 1922-1955 period festivals lasted for days, weeks, and even months. During festivals 4 Samuel Johnson, The History of the Yorubas from the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the British Protectorate (Lagos: C.M.S.

During this period, Christians, and to a small degree, Muslim popul ations intensely campaigned against Yoruba religious aspects. These growing segments of the popul ations, inspired through foreign propaganda worked hard to eliminate any traces of indigenous religion when oppo rtunities arose. Tactics such as shrine destruction, throwing away of all ritual objects and the like were common ways in which Yoruba were asked to demonstrate conve rsion. The Muslims had been present in Yorubaland since at least the 17th century and at this point in history were not as active, as enemies of Yoruba tradition. However, the Christian missions, having only been present for less than a century by 1922 were very aggressive. At the same time, many people still engaged in Yoruba religion, though they 'conve rted' to Christianity. Yoruba religion incontestably declined in the twentieth century because of Christian efforts. J.D.Y. Peel details the early years of this decline in Religious Encounter and The Making of The Yoruba. However, the decline in popu larity of Yoruba religion did not mean erasure of the system. Omosade Awolalu contends that in the 1950s , toward the end of the colonial era, various nationalists came to believe that Christianity and Islam were tools that the Europeans used to oppress Africans. Furthermore, indigenous institutions, specifically cultural and religious ones, received varying measures of colonial suppor t.8 8 Omosade et. al. Nigeria Since Independence: The First Twenty-Five Years (Panel on Nigeria Since Independence History Project, Volume 9. Religion, 33). 139 Spirituality and Healing In Yorubaland Religious co-existence in Yorubaland was not unusual; however the similar methodol ogies of the healers, especially incorporation of indigenous religious elements despite personal commitments to other religions, requires examination. Yoruba healers of all faiths considered the Yoruba spiritual/metaphysical methods used for human communication with the divine force(s) so effective that some continued to use these methods in order to stimulate a patient's healing process. The methods that some healers of any religious orientation still used, to varying degrees, have included sacrifice, divination, incantations, and medicinal preparations for metaphys ical problems. Healers, especially those who were Muslim and Christian, retained divination and sacrifice to a lesser degree than they did incantations and spiritual remedies. Divination was most often only used by Yoruba religious priests (babal awos and olorisa), therefore was the least cross-religious healing compone nt. \"The healing power of sacrifice,\"9 none theless, was communally believed to be so essential that some healers, agnos tic, Muslim, and occasionally Christians, retained this aspect of healing\u2014the importance of sacrifice was a pan-African belief.10 The use of sacrifice in healing declined slightly in the 1922-1955 colonial period among non-indigenous religious healers.11 9 From title: Ifayemi Elebuibon, The Healing Power of Sacrifice (Brooklyn, N.Y.: Athelia Henrietta Press, 2000). 10 John S. Mbiti, African Religions & Philosophy, 2nd rev. and enl. ed.

Inside he does divination and consultations to heal clients. Figure 5.1. Incantations (afose), or using the 'power of words' was somewhat similar to prayer, but more intricate. The Yoruba healers' use of chants and incantations was related to a larger genre of Yoruba oral traditions, such as itan (oral history) and oriki (praise poetry). Incantations were thought fully crafted in order to execute an often immediate outcome. There was typically a command or directive involved and the person reciting the incantation was taught or on occasion was gifted with the ability to transform matter merely through words. It was a fragile act that needed to be done with skill in order to obtain potency.12 Chief Elebuibon explained that he exercised this ability when he was four years old by instantly closing the bleeding wound of a playmate with a chant. For this act he was scolded because of his haphazardness in using it\u2014he did not unde rstand how frightening that could be to others who witnessed the event, of course being a 12 Osunwole, Samuel. \"Healing In Yoruba Traditional Belief Systems,\" (Dissertation, 1989), 129-143. 141 toddler.13 Mr. Adeboje states, \"You have headache, and I pray in the traditional way and the thing [headache] will go [away].\"14 A 1935 Ekiti 'Intelligence Report' notes that in Yoruba culture there was a belief in four types of criminal offenses: those against god, person, community or gove rnment. Offenses against god took the form of insults to god or a priest, neglectfulness of worship, or \"juju disputes.\"15 That correlates with other scholars' more expanded assessments of the Yoruba spiritual causes for illness, namely, enemies (ota), spiritual malevolency (aje), evil medicine (oso), gods (orisa), or ancestors (ebora).16 Religious practitioners of every type of religion in Yorubaland believed in the supernatural.17 While the oral history interviews reveal that Muslim and Christian healers did not detail the type of \"enemies\" that caused an individual illness, such as misfortune, they subscribed to the concept that 'enemies' caused certain problems and thereby healers offer solutions. The majority of Yoruba healers, of various religions, offered medicines that dealt with spiritual/metaphys ical issues. The aim in these cases was to offer positively fortifying and/or protective medicines. Healers were forbidden from offering services that facilitated evil. Table 5.a paraphrases a portion of these types of medicines. 13 Personal interview of Chief Babalawo Ifayemi Elebuibon, August, 2007. 14 Personal interview of Olusegun Adeboje, August, 2001. 15 \"Intelligence Report on Ado District, Ekiti Division Ondo Province\" 26 29734. 16 A.

This chapter uses the term medicine instead of magic, because these remedies and 18 Figure 5.a, a paraphrased sample from Dopamu, \"The Practice of Magic and Medicine in Yoruba Traditional Religion,\" 684-690. 143 \"charms\" were made from natural substances for the function of improved holistic health. Although the objective was for the recipes to work on a supernatural level and/or with spiritual intentions, these remedies and good charms have often been locally referred to as 'medicine' none theless.19 This minor sample of the types of spiritual medicines Yoruba healers offered between 1922 and 1955 expresses why the Yoruba people continued to be so attracted to Yoruba healing. The resiliency of Yoruba healing was in part, because of the large selection of remedies Yoruba people could obtain from healers. Components of Yoruba Religion Relative to Healing Towns, families, and at times individuals had unique spiritual practices and beliefs, although most of the characteristics overlapped. This anthropom orphic system was inclusive of the idea that \"unseen forces which explain and affect human life [and] are thought of and related to in human terms.\"20 Although Yoruba cosmology was inclusive of benevolent and malevolent supernatural beings and activities, the Yoruba religion did not include worship or an embracing of the evil aspects of the cosmology. At the same time, there was a definite recognition and acknow ledgement of these dimensions of spirituality, especially for protection against them. The divinities (orisa) and ancestors (egun) were the major spiritual forces of the Yoruba religion. These spiritual beings were considered benevolent, though it was believed they could be angered. However, they were considered mediators between Olorun (God of Heaven) and human beings, and were independent agents working on 19 'Charms' is a word that was used by many Yoruba English speakers, including healers, to reference some spiritual medicinal remedies. Charms were good or bad. 20 Smart, The World's Religions 310 and 311 defines anthropomorphic, not necessarily in relation to the Yoruba. 144 behalf of humans. These divine forces initiated communication with Yoruba people through various media, including divination, dreams, possession, natural events such as storms or epidemics. Additionally, these spirits created experiences people were suppos ed to perceive messages through. Illnesses were, at times, messages of dissatisfaction from these spiritual forces. There were at lease 401 divinities male, female and androgynous . Some ancestors were deified however many the divinities were masters of natural elements, such as water or fire, or an attribute of nature i.e., the hill of Ibadan. Additionally, the divinities represented and spons ored features of human affairs, i.e., wisdom or health. Communal and personal ancestors and divinities required propitiation, had personalities, favorite foods , emotions, expectations of humans and the power to influence human lives. As Simpson illustrates throughout his text, numerous aspects of spirit worship required medicinal, especially herbal, preparations\u2014these activities were not limited to initiations, celebrations, care of ritual objects and easily found references to medicine in praises, chants and songs . The Yoruba often relied upon these beings for alaafia. Alaafia was usually translated as \"peace,\" but actually meant good health, success and prosperity.21 In order to achieve alaafia praise and sacrifice were required. Sacrifices, which provided healing, sometimes without medicinal remedies, came in the forms of libation, food, cowries, kola nuts, plants, and animals. Yoruba people's level of devotion to divine spirits varied. Not all Yoruba people worshipped indigenous beings in the colonial era. One group were the spiritual leaders, 21 J.D.Y. Peel, Religious Encounter and the Making of the Yoruba, (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000), 91. 145 others were worshippers and some Yoruba only participated in festivals and/or sacrifices. With religion, just as with medicine, some people exercised pluralism, using whatever options available to obtain a satisfactory life. Because pluralism was forbidden in Christianity and Islam, people often covertly practiced two religions. However, the Yoruba religion did not necessitate exclusion of other religious practices although many practitioners certainly were territorial. During the late 1920s an Ifa priest in Oyo wanted his son exiled from the region because he became a Christian and \"refuses to become the Ifa priest in succession to his father.\" 22 That was rather unus ual. A 19th century example of the Yoruba custom of inclusion and acceptance of other religions is demonstrated in the case of the prominent missionary and Africa's first Bishop, Samuel Crowther, who despised the Yoruba religious system. Peter Mckenzie found that \"Crowther's parents had been told by a babal awo (diviner) that their son would worship Olorun, the Lord of Heaven.\" Consequently, his parents were upset that he was destined to worship like the Muslims, since Christianity was not know n in the region at the time.23 This openness allowed for space within the religion for the healing remedies to be incorporated by practitioners of other religions between 1922 and 1955 . The respons ibility of the religious leaders was to ensure alaafia (peace) in all areas of a person's or community's life, be it phys ical or metaphys ical. Nevertheless, if one came to a religious expert for help of any kind, unsurprisingly, spiritual methods and often a spiritual association to the problem would be involved. Some Yoruba religious 22 \"Oyo Divisional Miscellaneous\" #72. 23 McKenzie, Inter-Religious Encounters in West Africa: Samuel Ajayi Crowther's Attitude To African Traditional Religion and Islam Century (New York, Leiden: Brill, 1997), 14-15. 146 priests were diviners, others were commissioned to roles such as keeping shrines, leading in song or dance, produc ing artistic religious paraphernalia, or simply being a participant in communal or family religious activities. Numerous people were also initiated for non-religious purposes i.e., to enhance a profession such as hunting, or to protect one's phys ical health.24 It is then easy to see how hunters and farmers had religious as well as practical access to healing remedies. An implicit function of many of these Yoruba religious healers was to perform divination, either personally or professionally. Divination was a process in which messages were derived from the spiritual world via human management of phys ical tools, such as shells or nuts, which were common among the Yoruba. Various priest-healers used divination to determine health outcomes. Chief Arabgerin explains \"we usually make use of cowries, so that we unde rstand whatever their [the patient's] illness is...I learned that from him [my father].\"25 Mrs. Osawemimo recalls \"My mother used cowry shells) to diagnos e patients.26 Mr. Adeboje describes approaches healers may take with divination: You can treat anybody, first you may find out the cause of the disease...Finding out\u2014if you say, they have done wrong somewhere, you can see what is meant [through divination]...it will be alright. Even before the man comes to you, look behind you the day that it happens...[Ifa will] say 'this man is coming to you\u2014don't help him.' So, if you like the man you can ask Ifa, please what will you take? I want to help him. If you like the man! They [the advising spirits through Ifa] will give you conditions; and if they give you a condition and the condition is not preferable to you, then you will not do it.27 24 Elebuibon, The Healing Power of Sacrifice. 25 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin Edun Adebiyi Omoyebi, April, 2008. 26 Personal interview of Edun Ogundeji Osawemimo, April, 2008. 27 Personal interview of Olusegun Adeboje, August, 2001. 147 Ifa The two main types of Yoruba religious leaders who served as healers were priests of various divinities (olorisa) and priests of Ifa (babal awo or iyanifa). What can be confusing to many is, if Ifa is also a divinity, then why was there a distinction between these two types of priests? These differences were for both religious and political reasons. Ifa priests were present in most kingdom s throughout Yorubaland, especially as advisors to kings, but the same cannot be as easily said about other olorisa. The question must then be asked: How was it that the Ifa priests obtained dominance politically and religiously? The answer lies in the attribute of the divinity\u2014namely that Ifa was the omniscient divinity. Ifa, also know n as Orunmila, was the divinity of wisdom and all-know ingne ss. Ifa was respons ible for putting the world in divine order and coordinated the work of the Olorun (God of heaven), orisa (divinities), the egun (ancestors) and humans.28 Because of this Ifa was more aware of every aspect of human life than any other spiritual entity a human could consult, know ing the past, present and future. Given the Yoruba concept of predestination, if a life calamity occurred, such as a serious illness, then the cause was the person not living in accordance with their destiny. In these cases, Ifa was consulted to provide the corrective prescription, which often included healing remedies. Of the Ifa priests, males in Yorubaland were welcome to train to become an Ifa priest (babal awo), however, only a select group of females were permitted to become Ifa 28 The role of being a communicator between Olorun/Olodumare and other beings was at times attributed to Orunmila/Ifa or Esu-Elegbara. Abimbola, If\u00e1: An Exposition of If\u00e1 Literary Corpus 9 and P. R. McKenzie, Hail Orisha!: A Phenomenology of a West African Religion in the Mid-Nineteenth,525, functions of the orisa overlapped. Esu-Elegbara was considered a work-mate and close friend of Orunmila/Ifa. 148 priestesses (or iyanifa).29 A historical investigation to determine the origin and/or the consistency of the social gendering of Ifa priests might reveal that this phenomenon grew out of patriarchal motivations, both indigenous and colonial.30 One does not find such a gendered perspective with priests of most other divinities. The fact that many babal awos were such prominent Yoruba healers, is one reason many studies have focused on male Yoruba healers. \"The essential aspect of the babalawo's role is not his psychological insight (though he may well be considered to have it), but his technical expertise in having memorized many ese [the verses of odu].\"31 The babalawo trained for decades to remember the 256 (at minimum) odu and yet was suppos ed to assume a humble social position. They possessed many objects necessary for divination and healing remedies. The know ledge within the odus includes graphic symbols, stories and prescriptions. The odu remedies most often sugge sted were sacrifice (ebo), and in many cases, medicine (oogun).32 Below is an example of a healing prescription from the odu \"Obara Iwori\": To have a good memory [Isoye] Tiliaceae A snake Burn [all of these ingredients], draw the odu in the preparation, recite the incantation, drink with water. 29 Abimbola, If\u00e1: An Exposition of If\u00e1 Literary Corpus, 14, and McKenzie Hail Orisha!: A Phenomenology of a West African Religion in the Mid-Nineteenth Century, display numerous nineteenth century references to babalawos. He also states that there were references to female priest of Ifa in the Christian Missionary Society records. 30 Peel, \"Gender in Yoruba Religious Change,\" Journal of Religion in Africa 32, no. 2 (2002), 149. 31 Peel, J.D.Y. \"The Pastor And The Babalawo: The Interaction Of Religions In Nineteenth-Century Yorubaland,\" Africa 60 (3), 1990, 340. 32 Abimbola, If\u00e1: An Exposition of If\u00e1 Literary Corpus, 35. Medicine is a remedy, containing physically and spiritually healing ingredients. 149 Agberigbede, bring my memory Oniyeniye, recall my memory Atori, organise my own memory A sharp memory is characteristic of the snake.33 This particular recipe was chosen because the topic of creating a medicine to obtain, maintain or retain a good memory is a perfect demonstration of a subject that traverses the domains of phys ical and metaphys ical principles. Having a good memory was desired among humans cross-culturally. Nonetheless, in this case a \"good\" memory actually means a superior, exceptional, extraordinary, and in some cases, even, a paranormal memory. This was not a remedy for simply a \"good memory,\" good was a relative term. As with the most Yoruba medicine recipes, this one required local plants; however, this recipe calls for an animal sacrifice too. It is not abnormal that an animal would be called for if it had culturally associated characteristics that relate to the medicinal objective. Once proficient, babalawos often became professionals because of the demands for their services. Even though many healers and priests had other professions i.e., farming, hunting or trading, elder babal awos could dominate the healing landscape because of their typical, eventual full time commitments to their professions. This may be one reason why Yoruba healers who were not babalawos sought to increase their competitiveness, visibility and prominence progressively more during the colonial era. \"The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria\" of 1933 mandated its herbalist members to \"unde rtake no other work or occupation,\" which was not likely prevented.34 33 Pierre Verger, Ewe: The Use of Plants in Society (Sao Paulo: Odebrecht/Editora Schwarcz, 1995). 371. 34 CSO 26 J/1 Z/1c. 150 Conve rsely, with the diversification of religious and cultural perspectives, babal awos were more prone than ever before to downplay their religious roles and emphasize Yoruba healing between 1922 and 1955. Isaac Delano deducted: \"It is...the capacity of prescribing medicines that has caused the \"Babalawos\" to become native doctors. They have to prepare and dispense their own prescriptions, for no native chemist will do it for them.\"35 The odus indicate that there were different types of babal awos, as Wande Abimbola explains: There are five classes of Ifa priests. The first...are the most qualified of Ifa priests being at once both diviners and healers. The second class of Ifa priests consists of priests who have not been initiated into the secrets of Odu [i.e., recipes] and who have all the paraphernalia of Ifa divination and are fully authorized to practise the art of divination. The third class of Ifa priests is made up of people who have all the paraphernalia of Ifa divination but who are forbidden to use them to divine for people outside their own households. To the fourth class are consigned to Ifa priests who are healers; they are full Ifa priests but they divine solely for healing purposes. The fifth class is made up of trained Ifa priests who are neither diviners nor healers but who have been trained as Ifa priests. They have all of the paraphernalia of Ifa but do not use them. [They have] some [other] full time gainful employment but he attends the regular assemblies of Ifa priests and he maintains a disciplined attitude to life which is characteristic of Ifa priests.36 Of the two types of baba lawo that also serve as healers, both were diviners. However, one could attend to all types of life issues, the other was restricted to resolving mostly phys ical healing. Training lasted for decades and could easily require extensive travel in order to work with a \"particular specialist for training.\"37 The priests of Ifa had a wide range of professional approaches available to them, but what about the priests of other divinities? They also could specialize in healing and 35 Isaac O. Delano, The Soul of Nigeria (London: Werner, 1937), 180. 36 Abimbola, If\u00e1: An Exposition of If\u00e1 Literary Corpus,13-14. 37 Ibid, 25. 151 gain outstanding reputations for being effective. The Ifa corpus clearly subjects the other divinities to Ifa's domain. However, alternative Yoruba religious perspectives do not necessarily subdue all divinities to the authority of Ifa. At the same time, many of the major (pan-Yoruba) divinities did share the other divination system, which was merindinlogun (16 cowries). They indisputably occupy a similar rank in the cosmic hierarchy. One extremely ambiguous divinity that E. Bolaji Idowu has claimed was superior to Ifa in the cosmic ranking is Obatala/Orisanla, the divinity that creates humans. He states: \"Orisa-nla is the supreme divinity of Yorubaland. As his name implies he is the great or arch-divinity...H e is automatically the senior and head of them all. He is also called Obatala, the name which [means]...the king who is great.\"38 These claims about which divinity was most powerful is an important consideration in healing because it details some ways in which different types of religious healers were considered. In terms of hierarchies, what is know n from the odus is that the primordial divinities were Sopona/ as the first to come to the planet earth.39 Most of these orisa, and a few others also happen to be the divinities most associated with Yoruba healing practices. Healers that were priests of certain divinities could, occasionally, achieve recognition and regard beyond that of a babalawo if their healing skills were extraordinarily developed. 38 E. Bolaji Idowu, Ol\u00f3d\u00f9mar\u00e8, God in A Account (Birmingham, UK: Iroko Academic Publishers, 2006), and Elebuibon, The Healing Power of Sacrifice. 152 Osanyin One divinity that was repeatedly noted as inferior to Ifa, according to the odus of the two main Yoruba divining systems (Ifa and merindinlogun) is Osanyin the divinity of herbs, plants and medicine. The priests of Osanyin were know n as onisegun, which by the 1922-1955 period was a term applied to Yoruba healers of any religion. It is unclear when people began to use the term onisegun to label Yoruba healers of various religions. Nonetheless, the widely acknow ledged junior rank of this divinity is taken from odus. From the odu\u2014Oturupon of the merindinlogun system the story is as follows: Where we see fourteen elders [14 cowry shells] Orisha says that we should offer a sacrifice Do you see the way that Orisha says that this is so? 'Tortoise enters the forest waddling; 'The skin that covers the stomach does not let us see the intestines [thoughts]' Was the one who cast for Osanyin and Orunmila [Ifa] When they were enemies There was Orunmila [Ifa], he was divining for the king; And there was Osanyin, he was divining for the king. When Orunmila [Ifa] went out He said, 'My life, oh! It is stronger than medicine.' And Osanyin said, 'We e! My life is supernatural.' When Osanyin went out he said 'Ha! Ha! Who is this black person? It is I myself 'Whom he is challenging like this.' 'He is stronger than medicine And Osanyin before my very eyes?' So they went on; Their enmity continued. Then one day They challenged each other. Osanyin challenged Orunmila [Ifa]. And Orunmila challenged Osanyin. Osanyin said 'If you think I am lying, let us bury ourselves in the ground. On the 320th day from today 153 People can come and dig us out. What!' Ifa said, 'I am ready.' They dug a hole for Orunmila [Ifa]. They dug a hole for Osanyin... Orunmila put his hands on his head, he went to the diviners... [They told him] 'The thing that you have to do because of the journey you are going on... A sacrifice is what you should offer'... He did not omit anything, he offered all... When the diviner made this medicine He used a whole giant rat to make it, And a whole crab [then gave this to Orunmila before he went into the hole]... As Orunmila [Ifa] got into the hole that they had finished making... When the crab came out briskly, Crab went down, It looked for water [and brought it back to Orunmila]... Giant rat would bring the food, and Orunmila [Ifa] would eat it in the morning... So it went for 320 days... Osanyin had said, 'What sacrifice?' Osanyin had not sacrificed anything... And they buried them until The 320th day... When the 320th day came... They began to dig out Osanyin... Iron rods, staples, things that Osanyin wore, Jars, potsherds, jars that Osanyin wore were what they found. He was completely decomposed. When Orunmila appeared, he appeared complete with his white cloth... He was praising the diviners, and the diviners were praising Orisha... [People sang] 'If Ifa comes home. One who is stronger than medicine' Is the one they are calling 'Sacrifice is stronger than medicine'... That is Oturupon.40 The odu of Ifa had additional stories that reference Osanyin. For instance, the odu\u2014Ogunda Meji details the story of how Osanyin became the servant of Ifa and one day Ifa discovered that Osayin knew all the plants and their properties, and Ifa then asked Osanyin to teach him this know ledge.41 In both of these examples Osanyin was inferior to Ifa, while at the same time Osanyin was presented as wise and so know ledgeable that 40 Odu recorded in 1951 from Salako via William Bascom, Sixteen Cowries: Yoruba Divination from Africa to the New World, (Indiana University Press, 1993), 753-763. 41 Dopamu, \"The Practice of Magic and Medicine in Yoruba Traditional Religion,\" 126. 154 he served as competition to Ifa. These odus reflect a similar conflict that occurred between Yoruba healers/herbalists and Ifa priests between 1922 and 1955. Priest of other divinities, besides Ifa and Osanyin occupied a wide array of roles. Of those priests (olorisa) that became healers, they were often disciples of one of these the divinity of smallpox and at times also was attributed to mental illness. This divinity was considered the most ancient of the original divinities.42 Saponna also was considered a supreme ruler thus the praise name, Obaluaye, meaning 'king of the world.' It was common that smallpox outbreaks occurred during the time of the hot earth, the dry season. Christians and Europeans in this colonial period misunde rstood Saponna to be a \"demon...[ and] malignant spirit.\"43 Saponna despised wicked medicine yet was equated to death by disease. Thus, presenting a paradox\u2014a divinity that worked to destroy human owners of evil medicine and yet used disease as a weapon. This divinity did not have a reputation for being nice or kind, but he was know n as a performer of important functions for human resiliency. A portion of a praise song that Simpson recorded illustrates Saponna's alliance with Yoruba healing: Abata (Sanponna) who flourishes luxuriantly like the leaves of the ajo tree. The one who takes poison but on whom poison has no effect. Farioro, the one who has many tiny guards of medicine, and one who makes people's medicine ineffective. One who killed six of seven witches. The orisa eats a witches arm almost completely. 42 Idowu, Ol\u00f3d\u00f9mar\u00e8, God in Yoruba Belief, 95. 43 \"Notes on Customs & Superstition of Indigenous Institutions\" CSO 26 6076. 155 Do not tempt me against people, do not tempt people to do evil against me.44 The Yoruba's allotment of a divinity to this disease had significant and practical purposes. As one colonial report noted priests, priestesses and worshippers of this divinity had other \"trade[s] or profession[s] and practise [sic] the arts of their cult in their spare time.\"45 Nevertheless, they were respons ible for ensuring that the ill were isolated from the healthy popul ation. Typically the disciples of this divinity were respons ible for the caretaking of the bodies of those that died from the disease. A c. 1930 report noted They always called in a priest to aid as a doctor in the cure of the [smallpox] disease. Certain ingredients and money were demanded and a preparation consisting largely of shea butter was prepared to rub the body. There is little doubt that shea butter - a well- known remedy for rheumatism and skin affections- had a beneficial effect.46 Worshippers removed the body from residential areas and then buried or cremated them, often along with their clothes and other belongings.47 Subsequently, a death from smallpox was not to be mourned. On the contrary, such a death was to be either ignored or festively celebrated\u2014especially in order to avoid any further vengeance from this divinity. The broom was one of the symbols of this divinity because cleanliness was a common preventative medicinal strategy used among the Yoruba. During an epidemic people were instructed to clean their homes and common areas with a special broom.48 At times, corpses were hung until \"matter droppe d into a calabash which was taken away 44 George E.

Many of these practices, although clearly useful, were the cause of the downfall of the sect during the colonial era. Saponna was quite controversial in the 1922-1955 period, as stated in a colonial report - the worship of it had been \"forbidden by law.\"50 Smallpox was an epidemic during various periods of Yoruba history and continued through this period. As Maclean states: In 1917, the British forbade the 'worship' of Shopanna and put an end to the activities of the priests, on the unsubstantiated suspicion that they occasionally acted maliciously and tried to spread the disease by using a powder made from the dried scabs. But local treatments of smallpox are still very widely quoted and many herbalists today, without admitting adherence to Shopanna, will claim proficiency in the management of serious skin diseases.51 The prohibition of Saponna worship arose because of the work of Dr. Sapara. His assessment of Saponna priests was that priests used the death rituals as an excuse to pilfer victims' belongings, and keep these items for themselves. Furthermore, he argued that inoculation practices spread the diseases and priest actually facilitated epidemics, as oppos ed to providing relief.52 His judgm ent was so acceptable to the colonial regime that they instituted the anti-Saponna law. However, by the 1950s there were still concerns that priests intentionally spread the disease. The minutes from a counc il meeting note that a chief told the counc il about the bad practices of the Native Herbalists with regard to victims of Smal l Pox. He 49 \"Notes on Customs & Superstition of Indigenous Institutions\" CSO 26 6076. 50 Ibid. 51 Maclean, Magical Medicine, 39. 52 Ralph Schram, A History of the Nigerian Health Services (Ibadan: Ibadan University Press, 1971), 140-1. 157 said that owing to the believe [sic] among the people that the worshippers of the god of Smal l Pox must take possession of all the properties of anybody [who] died as a result of attack of S.P., the Herbalists usually hide under this cloak to spread the disease so that as many victims as much properties will be taken by them.53 There is no doubt that there were unscrupulous priests-healers, however, to reduce all or most priests to having such intentions was an exaggeration and/or prejudice. The outlawing of a Yoruba religious sect was rare in colonial Nigeria, and, in fact, this was the only case know n in Yorubaland. Nonetheless, this law was respected and acknow ledged among healers. Multiple healers' association rules of the colonial era state that they forbad the worship of smallpox.54 Yoruba healers still treated smallpox, as evidenced by the directive of one 1929 association that \"nobody must treat a small pox in his own hous e,\"55 but, presumably could treat it in the hous e of victims. The worshipping of Saponna between 1922 and 1955 diminished and went unde rground . Credence to Saponna as a prominent divinity did not decline though. Osun Most water divinities of Yorubaland were considered feminine, and this divinity was associated with the river Osun that begins deep in the interior of Yorubaland near Ogbom oso, flows through Osogbo, the home town of the divinity, and continues to the coast. Osun was the ever-popul ar divinity of fertility, joy and love. This divinity was know n as the \"original feminist\" 56 since she was the only distinct female among the primordial divinities. Peel noted that prior to the colonial era, Osun was much more 53 \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657. 54 \"The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria\" CSO 26 J/1 Z/1c. 55 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 56 Elebuibon (personal conversation) and Diedre Badejo, Osun Seegesi: The Elegant Deity of Wealth, Power, and Femininity (Trenton, N.J.: Africa World Press, 1996), 73 quoting Steady. 158 popul ar than Yemoja, even where the two coexisted.57 This was in part because although both divinities blessed women with children, Osun was also well know n to enhance a person's life with love, wealth and beauty.

The Yeye of Lagos, or the spiritual grand/mother of Lagos, an Olorisa of Osun, who is in her eighties, learned an abunda nce of information about \"roots and leaves\" from her grandmother\u2014who was the head of female priestly healers. She and her grandmother could heal with incantations or water alone. Hydrotherapy, in fact, was a very common attribute of the healing repertoire of the disciples of Osun and was also found among healers associated with other divinities. Healing with only water was a cross-cultural phenomenon, and Yoruba healers would use water to resolve illnesses that modern medicine has verified are induc ed from dehydration, namely blood disorders, digestive dysfunctions, nervous and immune system problems, headaches, rheumatism, etc.60 Among the Yoruba, stagnant waters were never used to heal, just flowing waters, like that of the river.61 Yemoja Yemoja was the divinity of the river Ogun that flows from Abeokuta to the coast near Lagos. Like Osun, this divinity was know n to be respons ible for motherhood and healing (women especially), however Yemoja was not considered a primordial divinity. In 1855, an interesting case of a healing priestess named Akere, who embodied the power of Yemoja, caused four missionaries to discuss her case in great detail in their records and 60 James F. Balch and Mark Stengler, Prescription for Natural Cures: A Self-Care Guide for Treating Health Problems with Natural Remedies, Including Diet and Nutrition, Nutritional Supplements, Bodywork, and More (Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons, 2004), 676-7 discusses health benefits of hydrotherapy. 61 E.

Her career was brief and her origin was unknow n. However, she healed barren women and cured other disorders with exceptional success. Missionary Thomas King noted that Akere was prosperous and she claimed \"to have been commissioned with no less than 600,000 children by Yemaja to give to the people.\"63 Obatala/Orisa'Nla Obatala, also know n as Orisa'Nla, was the divinity that sculpted human beings and gave them the breath of life. This primordial divinity, much like Oduduw a, was credited with being the progenitor of the Yoruba people yet in different ways, because Oduduw a was the first, ancestral Yoruba human and Obatala the creator of humans. This divinity was the patron of social peace, moral purity and long-life. Obatala was often depicted as an old man or woman\u2014one with a prolonge d existence. Long life was treasured in Yoruba society, reemphasizing the social importance of good heath, a typical prerequisite for long-life. Because this divinity created all human beings, Obatala was regarded as the guardian of the deformed and handicapped, as they were considered special children of Obatala. Abimbola paraphrases a priest who declared, \"no Ifa priest desirous of becoming a renowned specialist in healing will ever feel contented with his ability until he can cure the lame, the dwarf and the hunc hback.\"64 Though this quote is in reference to Ifa 62 Peel, Religious Encounters and the Making of the Yoruba, 20. 63 McKenzie, Hail Orisha!: A Phenomenology of a West African Religion in the Mid-Nineteenth Century, 339.

These special children of Obatala often became initiates and at times acquired special abilities (e.g. spirit possession) that allowed them to have greater alternatives in the daily operation of their lives. Ogun Ogun was the divinity of war, hunting and iron. This primordial divinity forged the path from heaven to earth trailblazing for the 401 divinities to inhabit the planet.65 Priests and priestesses of this divinity were rarer to find than those of many other divinities, though many communities, and professionals were devotees of this divinity. 66 Ogun was essential to those that worked with iron objects, namely warriors, hunters, blacksmiths, mechanics, vehicle drivers, farmers, road creators, barbers/hairdressers, (skin) incision makers, circumcised boys and midwives who cut umbilical cords. Therefore, Ogun was associated with life and fertility as well as death and violence. Hunters were healers, and hunters also doubl ed as the warriors of many Yoruba communities. The use of weapons and seeking protection from weapons was not considered wicked among the Yoruba unless used for the wrong purposes i.e., recklessness, greed, or assault upon one's own community. Though Opeola does not discuss Ogun extensively, he does elaborate on the diversity of Yoruba herbal weaponry. Some herbal weapons include apeta or herbal missiles and afose or incantation that could 65 McKenzie, Hail Orisha!: A Phenomenology of a West African Religion in the Mid-Nineteenth Century, 467. 66 John Pemberton and Funso S. Afolayan, Yoruba Sacred Kingship: \"A Power Like That of the Gods\" (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1996), 158. 162 be placed in a container and projected.67 To counter firearms, Yoruba invented charmed garments, which were often leather aprons and padded jackets for battle that contained \"herbal bullet proofs like asaki ibon, afoobon , ayeeta. Some herbal weapons afeeri help their owners to disappear; isuju is used to prevent enemies to be aware of the owner's presence. Eyin-lo-lobe-so, makes the enemies to miss their mark.\"68 Because of the numerous amount of wars, these weapons likely developed in the slave trade era, the colonial environment certainly stimulated desires among citizens for protective medicines, thus keeping such traditions alive from 1922 to 1955. Sango Sango, the divinity of thunde r and lightening, also was the patron divinity of the Oyo kingdom . Sango was widespread because the Oyo kingdom was the most expansive of former Yoruba kingdom s. Priests of this divinity proliferated in Yorubaland. Missionaries noted a range of \"miracles\" or instant self-healing demonstrations of Sango priests such as, immunity to sword attacks, eating glass walking through fire and rising from the dead!69 Furthermore, the strike of lightening, especially if a home was burned, was viewed as a call to implement justice. Victims of the fire had to recruit priests in the healing of their properties. The priests then consecrated the space before the resident was allowed to rebuild their quarters. The c. 1930 report on Yoruba customs noted that if a hous e was struck by lightening the owner must: 67 Opeola, \"\"the Use of Spiritual and Herbal Weapons in Yoruba Warfare\" (Unpublished Paper, Ile-Ife, Nigeria: 1981), 13. 68 Ibid, 14-15. 69 These events were documented by numerous 19th c. missionaries as noted by McKenzie, Hail Orisha!: A Phenomenology of a West African Religion in the Mid-Nineteenth Century, 520-521. I also witnessed such feats by a Sango devotee, in Osogbo, Nigeria. He ate glass, chopped his arm with an ax and walked through fire and remained unscathed. 163 purchase 1 ram, 6 goats, snails, a tortoise, pigeons, iguana, and wild rats.

Various cultures integrated and assimilated their indigenous beliefs with Islam, and scholars have found healing retained a presence within cultures that generally adopted Islam, especially in Africa. The presence of Islam in Yorubaland is well established, and existed for centuries, long before the introduc tion of Christianity. While Islam had not become a dominant religion in Yorubaland, large popul ations existed in some areas. In many towns throughout Yorubaland, Muslim popul ations were integrated and accepted as part of the social fabric. The case of healing among the Hausa people of Northern Nigeria provides insight into how Muslims blended indigenous healing with Islamic medicine. The Hausa were another dominant ethnicity in Nigeria, like the Yoruba were in the southwest. Although Hausaland is hundr eds of miles away, migrations from Hausaland to Yorubaland continued throughout this colonial period.72 Muslim groups like the Fulani were present 70 \"Notes on Customs & Superstition of Indigenous Institutions\" CSO 26 6076. 71 Personal interview of Chief Fatai Olojede, April, 2008. There is a need for greater research on Muslim Yoruba Traditional Healers. 72 Abner Cohen, Custom & Politics in Urban Africa, a Study of Hausa Migrants in Yoruba Towns (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969). 164 in Yorubaland for centuries as well. In the case of the Hausa, certain areas of indigenous (Maguz awa) and Islamic medicine overlap, however, there were beliefs and practices the Hausa Muslims rejected (e.g. spirit possession).73 The associated healing methods and ideologies of the indigenous and Islamic Hausa were expansive and most resembled what was found within Yoruba healing. Common, noteworthy elements of Hausa medicine include herbalists and herb marketers, charms used to ward off evil (including Quran scrolls or tonics made from 'holy' ink), surgeries (i.e., incisions) preformed by barbers, lancing (burning away abscesses with hot metal), and prophe tic medicine via the Mallams (Islamic priest/prayer leaders). Among the Hausa, some of the most highly regarded healers were the midwives and the bone setters.74 Lewis Wall lists \"themes in Hausa medicine,\"75 which included secrets and power, hot and cold, flavors (sweet, sour, bitter, salt), strength and toughne ss, shape and texture. Examining how much Muslims accepted indigenous Hausa healing indicates how it was that Yoruba healers were able to maintain a Muslim identity at the same time as they embraced indigenous Yoruba healing ways. Oral history interviews among Muslim healers reveals that they consider themselves to be Yoruba healers who were of the Islamic faith. They incorporate Yoruba cosmology, though their terminology describes Yoruba spiritual aspects vaguely and in alignment with (African) Islam. 73 L. Lewis Wall, Hausa Medicine: Illness and Well-Being in a West African Culture (Durham: Duke University Press, 1988). 74 Ibid, 228-229. 75 Ibid, 293-313. 165 Christianity and Yoruba Healing For the most part Christians in Yorubaland were antagonistic to Yoruba healing. While almost all denominations of Christianity were vaguely oppos ed to Yoruba healing, there were both healers and clients of Yoruba medicine who maintained Christian identities with indigenous affliations, despite their churches' aversion to many indigenous ways. Mr. Adeboje, a devout Angleican Christain explains, I was baptized in 1955. But, due to the pressure from my father, he said I should lay emphasis more on this [Yoruba healing] than any other arena...Many reverends have been coming to me to preach ...The herbalist, they know God. They believe in God. They call him by their own name...And without him your preparation will not work! The reason why I go [became a Christian is]...When you are praying it does not take time, it doesn't take time for God to answer you. But when you want to prepare something, you want to prepare herbs, it will take time...[After years he realized] It's an insight\u2014the practice [of Yoruba healing] is a passport to God. You can commu nicate.76 Scores of other Yoruba healers in this colonial period conve rted to Christianity and simaltaneously mainted healing. There were some independent churches that arose in this colonial period that did incorporate aspects of Yoruba belief, including certain elements of Yoruba healing modes. The Aladura was most impactful independent church movement in southwestern Nigeria of between 1922 and 1955 , and it affected the state of western medicine in Yorubaland. One CMS Anglican missionary plainly stated that it was the Aladura movement that caused them to establish medical works in the region.77 Conve rsely, the Aladura impact on Yoruba healing did not incite the same tremendous flurry of competition. Nonetheless, the Aladura movement did inspire many Yoruba healers to conve rt to Christianity while retaining alligence to the Yoruba healing profession. 76 Personal interview of Olusegun Adeboje, August, 2001. 77 \"Correspondence\" CMS Archive, Medical Department M/Y A2 1918-1949 (1948). 166 The Aladura were prayer churches that focused on healing. In 1918 Daddy Ali, a gardener for an Ijebu Ode church in Yorubaland had a dream that revealed to him people need to rely on faith, not western medicine to combat illness. The Precious Stone Association, or the Egbe Okuta Iyebiye, formed around this revelation. In the 1920s this association departed from the Anglican Church and began an affiliation with the Faith Tabernacle Church of Philadelphia for some years, and since then the Aladura resembled Holiness and Pentecostal movements.78 In 1941 , the association became the Christ Apostolic Church, as the movement spread all over Nigeria and eventually to various places throughout the world. The emergence of this movement aligns with colonial-period epidemics, and the healing dimension of this association-turned-church was strong.79 As with many other independent African churches, indigenous cultural elements featured prominently in the establishment's philosophy. In the case of the Aladura, portions of Yoruba religion and health concepts and rituals were outstanding. As Benjamin Ray observes: \"Aladura churches retained two funda mental elements [of Yoruba traditions]: the belief in invisible spiritual forces, especially malevolent spiritual powers, and the belief in the efficacy of ritual action.\"80 Though these aspects of Yoruba religion and healing were general and found in multiple religious and healing systems, the Aladura instituted these beliefs and practices with the know ledge of Yoruba indigenous ways and used the Bible for instruction and verification to reinforce aspects of the Yoruba beliefs that they employed. 78 D. H. Crumbley, \"On Being First: Dogma, Disease and Domination in the Rise of an African Church,\" Religion 30, no. 2 (2000), 176. 79 Ibid. 80 Benjamin C. Ray, \"Aladura Christianity: A Yoruba Religion,\" Journal of Religion in Africa 23, no. 3 (1993), 268. 167 The \"ritual action\" among the Aladura came mostly in the form of prayer, however, other dimensions also related strongly to Yoruba approaches. While the Aladura rejected divination and sacrifice, they sought the holistic alaafia or peace, health and prosperity that Yoruba indigenous practitioners sought and used spiritually oriented rituals to obtain the good things in life.81 The Aladura used 'efficacious prayer,' fasting and other forms of personal phys ical cleansings as healing methods . As with Yoruba, ase or power, particularly with words, the prayers of the Aladura were meant to have transformative effect in the phys ical world.82 Furthermore, healing through cleansing for the Aladura came in the form of bathing and/or drinking holy water.83 The Aladura's retention of the Yoruba belief in evil spirits and human acts of spiritual malevolency was part of the allure and challenge of this movement. Their focus on this belief did not mean the automatic co-optation of followers from Yoruba healing, as scholars have sugge sted.84 In fact, this reinforcement of the need to combat evil practices strengthened the Yoruba healing system, which historically fought this battle, although the Aladura offered alternative ways to destroy evil. There is no evidence that Yoruba healing declined because the Aladura presented additional options. By the late 1940s and 1950s there were even some friendly relations between Yoruba healers and the Aladura. Yoruba healers did not fear or feel an excessive need to compete with the Aladura as the other Christian denominations did. Maclean noted several times throughout her text that various Yoruba healers referred their patients to the 81 Ibid, 269. 82 Ibid, 279. 83 Ibid, 278. 84 Crumbley, \"On Being First: Dogma, Disease and Domination in the Rise of an African Church,\" 172; Ray, \"Aladura Christianity: A Yoruba Religion,\" 268. 168 Aladura for healing when necessary. Furthermore, there were healers who became members of the Aladura churches and eventually returned to Yoruba healing. Aladura healing elements such as use of dreams, visions and prophe cies sometimes stimulated the recommitment to Yoruba healing. The Yeye of Lagos stated that in her early adulthood she was with the Aladura church and she became blind with crippled legs, and a prophe t told her she must go back to her traditions in the ways of Osun in order to heal. Today, in her 80s she has no visible impairments, and the energy, healthiness and abilities of someone half her age. Aladura faith healing spread rapidly in the 1922-1955 period, because as Crumbley observed, this group \"mediated the conflict between Yoruba and Christian religious traditions unde r colonial domination.\"85 However, for many, healing through faith alone was not enough . Nevertheless, despite the fact that religious plurality flourished on an unprecedented level between 1922 and 1955, many still placed confidence in Yoruba religion, especially because it offered holistic healing that went beyond a basis of faith. Conclusion The Yoruba healing system was historically intertwined with the Yoruba religion. However, there were various types of Yoruba healers within and outside of the Yoruba religion. The array of Yoruba healers, i.e., priests of Ifa and priests of Osayin, or hunters and farmers, were at times antagonistic toward each other. Between 1922-1955 healers conve rted to Christianity and to Islam on an unprecedented scale, although these were 85 Crumbley, \"On Being First: Dogma, Disease and Domination in the Rise of an African Church,\" 180. 169 still only a minority of healers. Additionally, the Aladura church, which spread in the 1940s , in some instances complemented the Yoruba healing system via a reciprocal referral process. The element of Yoruba healing that allowed for healers of all religions to operate within the Yoruba healing system was a universal cultural subscription to a strong relationship between the supernatural world and the health of individuals. For example, iriron 'medicine to have second sight, enabling one to see what cannot be seen by naked eyes,' was employed to keep people alive and healthy for instance, to avoid poisons. The next chapter discusses how the evil aspects of the Yoruba supernatural world were addressed between 1922 and 1955. 170 Chapter Six Yoruba Spiritual Healing: Containing Spiritual Malevolency This chapter examines how the Yoruba contained spiritual malevolency from 1922 to 1955 . In the Yoruba context, to unde rstand how malevolency was contained one must consider the evil side of healing and/or evil supernatural beliefs, practices and encounters, as well as forces that relate to evil, both good and bad. Therefore, the positive aspects that helped to contain evil in relation to healing are addressed in this chapter as well. Nevertheless, an important concern of this chapter is the focus on how the Yoruba addressed malevolent philosophies, approaches and results. Wicked forces and occurrences were often described as existing outside of the system of the Yoruba's healing and were considered exterior compone nts of the Yoruba's religion(s) as well. Evil realities were serious issues that healers contended and engaged with. There was a pan-African colonial reality of an increase in social anxiety, and thus greater concerns over suffering as the result of malevolent behavior spiritual in origin. A c. 1930 colonial report stated: \"The chief raison d'etre for the belief in witchcraft is that it offers an explanation for the fact that misfortune may befall a society or individual whose conscience is clear so far as the supernatural world of gods , spirits and ancestors is concerned.\"1 In this context, the respons ibility of Yoruba healing as the force against evil among the Yoruba is addressed in this chapter. Specifically, the sections are: Contextualizing Evil in Africa and Abroad, Mysterious Powerful Spirits and the Great Mothers as Healers, Spiritually Malevolent Activities in Colonial Yorubaland, Social 1 Mr. K. Dewar, \"Notes on Witchcraft,\" Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 2, 595. 171 Programs to Contain Spiritual Malevolency, Colonial Laws and Evil Practices, and The Atinga Movement. Contextualizing Evil in Africa and Abroad Questions of distortion, appropriateness of terminology and accuracy of description are relevant to any discussion about spiritually oriented evil in Africa. As Barry Hallen and S. Sodipo explain, western scholars writing \"their expos itions and analyses of the alien ideas in non-alien langua ges\" 2 posed barriers to fully comprehending the African indigenous concepts and have habitually used the term \"witchcraft\" to discuss African beliefs of spiritual malevolency. For instance, the Yoruba word aje is typically translated as \"witches,\" but this English translation does not capture the benevolent side of these spiritual beings. 3 Between 1922 and 1955, Yoruba laymen and healers acquired and used translated terms and concepts in ways that both challenged and reinforced western analyses. Just as was the case with \"witchcraft,\" many places had no equivalent to what was recognized as \"the devil\" or even full scale spiritual embodiments of evil.4 Various African cultures accepted loaded European terms to describe diabolical intentions and malevolent dispositions through human practice or from spiritual entities.5 European and American Christians accused nonbe lievers and persons that were not submissive to church authority of having beliefs that were evil. In the context of the 2 B. Hallen and J. O.

The missionaries' of colonial Africa interpreted the assorted African concepts of evil as superstitions and as further evidence that Africans had no worthy sense of spirituality. Some scholars have argued that certain concepts and/or labels for evil were European imports and impositions upon various African societies.6 However, various Yoruba concepts of spiritual malevolency were present long before European arrival. Prior to 1922 and until 1955 local communities of various African people embraced monotheistic religions while retaining their indigenous spiritual beliefs.7 In the case of Islam, indigenous evil forces often were recognized and accepted as part of reality, and as additions to the Islamic forces. Also, Muslims did not typically campaign to provide substitutions for local malevolent concepts.8 However, the situation was different with Christianity, where 'the devil' and any biblical descriptions thereof, was suppos e to replace indigenous philosophies of evil. Nonetheless, as Jomo Kenyatta explains, Christian Africans did not necessarily give up their beliefs and practices when adopting other religions. He references the Kikuyu, whose medicine men were used to contain spiritual malevolency.9 In many African societies, chance and misfortune were thought to be rare because spiritual ramifications for broken obligations or anti-social behaviors and emotions were 6 Teresa N.

In fact, \"evil was defined as that which destroyed life, health, fertility and prosperity,\"10 and was often blamed for these unde sirable circumstances. 11 This circa 1930 Nigerian \"snake charmer\" may have been considered 'evil' among Europeans. Figure 6.1. Nonetheless, African people used different means to interpret, re-inscribe and defy colonial and missionary activities. While colonialism generated social and personal disruptions that stimulated Africans to blame evil forces as the causes, Africans also freely conve rsed about spiritual malevolency to scare Europeans and to resist their presence. Thus, while Africans adopted some European concepts, they also impressed their own ideas on Europeans. Nuanced examinations of Yoruba ideals of spiritual malevolency correlate with what Mr. Dewar describes in his colonial report: One of the main difficulties presented to the Administration by the magico-religious beliefs [of Africans]...is that however clear the distinction, in theory, between good and 10 Richard Gray, Black Christians and White Missionaries (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1990), 5. 11 Photo from the special collections at the University of Birmingham.

Figure 6.1. 174 evil magic, in practice the two are inextricable mingled...mo st communities...use differen t terms to denote (i) the witch who specialices [sic] in \"black\" magic and (ii) medicine man who specialices in \"white\" magic and (iii) the priest who specialices in religion supported by \"white\" magic...Yet, in practice, the witches, though bad, are not wholly bad and, deriving their power from the same source, may sometimes, though possibly merel y from mercenary motives, use it for beneficent purpose, while the priest [or healers] for reasons of gain, revenge, or prestige often calls in the aid of witches or himself dabbles in witchcraft. Paradoxical though it may sound, this confusion is often most marked in societies in which definite anti-witch organizations or witch-doctors exist.12 There was an interconne cted and various non-polarized views of evil practices and how to contain spiritual malevolency. This assessment report illustrates that these were part of the complexities healers dealt with between 1922-1955 that kept Yoruba people committed to Yoruba healing. The terms \"magic,\" \"witches,\" \"witch-doctors\" and the like, used in Dewar's report were common terms used by colonialists and academics. However, while Africans all over the continent, including many Yoruba, fully embraced such terms, Yoruba healers and Yoruba priests did not completely accept these labels because European, not African perspectives were invoke d. As Yoruba priest-healer Chief Elebuibon notes in his book Invisible Powers Of The Metaphy sical World: A Peep Into The World Of Witches, \"The westernized African is, to say the least, culturally confused and politically unstable, grossly ignorant of his traditions while at the same time inadequate in the borrowed western ways. The notion and practice of witchcraft demonstrate this defect.\"13 Likewise, the term witch-doctor was extremely limiting, and in several if not most African societies the indigenous doctor or priest who would provide beneficent medicine did not only concern themselves with problems stemming from metaphys ical 12 Mr. K. Dewar, \"Notes on Witchcraft,\" Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 2, 595. 13 Elebuibon, Invisible Powers Of The Metaphysical World: A Peep Into The World Of Witches, xiii. 175 malevolency...their repertoires were much more expansive. Additionally, such a title was not considered prestigious because a reputable healer would not want a title that inextricably linked them to evil practices. Therefore, Africans did not adopt the term \"witch-doctors\" for their own use because it was inappropriate, potentially degrading and most certainly too restrictive. The Yoruba recognized that there was a body of spiritual entities that operated metaphys ically yet were not considered part of the Yoruba religious system. The ajogun or 'the invisible enemies of humankind.' Enemies that were found in the ancient odus, or Yoruba spiritual texts included: \"iku (death), arun (disease), ofo (loss), egba (paralysis), oran epe ewon (imprisonment), [and] ese (affliction).\"14 Undoubt edly, the Yoruba sought to avoid untimely or unde served infliction of any of these issues upon them. All of these issues were the type of problems that were resolved through Yoruba healing methods , regardless of the religious orientation of the healer or client. Chief Olojede stated, \"supernatural sicknesses cannot be treated medically. Nightmares and irregular pregnancy and many more of the spiritual problems cannot be treated medically,\" but needed the expertise of Yoruba healers.15 Additionally, there was one set of invisible beings, the aje (mysterious powerful spirits) that were considered, at times, enemies of humankind, but also provided benefits to humankind through life enhancing measures. 14 Kola Abimbola, Yoruba Culture: A Philosophical Account (Birmingham, UK: Iroko Academic Publishers, 2006), 49. 15 Personal interview of Chief Fatai Olojede, April, 2008. 176 Mysterious Powerful Spirits and the Great Mothers as Healers The forces that were associated with harm and healing simultaneously in Yoruba culture were also associated with female spiritual energies and certain human women. The Yoruba terminology to describe these beings includes: Aje, Iya Mi Osoronga, Eleye, Agbalagba, Awon Iya, Iya nla among others. One will notice that \"Iya,\" meaning mother, is a common reference in many of these terms. Thus in Yorubaland, the idea of 'mysterious powerful spirits' was associated with 'mothers,' figuratively and literally. At the same time, men had or used these powers also. However, when men practiced mischievous or mysterious medicine they were called oso or oloogun in the Yoruba langua ge. The fact that these forces, spiritual and human were outside of, but were addressed through, the Yoruba's religious system, facilitated the Muslim and Christian Yoruba people's acceptance of the great mothers; however, many non-healing monotheist defined them as a purely evil genre. Thus, the great mothers maintained a pervasive presence despite any individuals or community's religious orientation.16 The continued yet transforming existence of the mysterious powerful spirits/great mothers during this period, permitted the practice of Yoruba medicine to abound because Yoruba healers had a myriad of ways to address these forces. The mysterious powerful spirits, or the Yoruba aje, were energies that implemented beneficial and evil outcomes. The spirits of the great mothers acquired their 16 Morton-Williams, \"The Atinga Cult among the South-Western Yoruba: A Sociological a Witch-Finding Movement,\" Bulletin de l'Institute Francais d'Afrique noire. Series B, Sciences Humaines. 18 (1956), 49. 177 powers as positive and negative forces of the universe directly from God.17 However, the people in Yoruba society, who exhibited its power gained access through ways that differed greatly from Yoruba religious or Yoruba healing training. Humans who were considered aje\u2014usually women, generally did \"not receive training or serve apprenticeships.\"18 These were considerably distinguishing factors between the human aje, priests and healers. This perspective can be confusing when considering that the adahuns e was divinely given healing abilities. Furthermore, there was the fact that 'oso' must learn their recipes and do not necessarily have innate, mysterious powers. Lay people during this period simplistically reconciled these ideas indicating that what distinguished human aje and oso from priests (olorisa) and healers (onisegun) was that the former were just plainly nefarious. With social misfortunes on the rise in this colonial period, Yoruba citizens' fear of being cursed through evil practices escalated between 1922 and 1955. Two things simultaneously occurred as a result of this increased fear: 1) Among the general public, the definition of humans having aje became more synonym ous with pure evil intent; and 2) Healers acquired more business regarding human suffering due to spiritual malevolency. Because the public perception of aje was that it was completely diabolical, healers accordingly accommodated such images. Healers, while respondi ng to their constituency, were aware that spiritual forces of aje or awon iya operated just as easily as 17 Washington, Our Mothers, Our Powers, Our Texts , Manifestations of Aje in Africana Literature,14. 18 George E. Simpson, Yoruba Religion and Medicine in Ibadan (Ibadan, Nigeria: Ibadan University Press, 1980), 76. 178 their allies. Thus, the humans who used aje for evil purposes were the ones that healers sought to address. Healers were also motivated to take a clear stance against spiritual malevolency because of colonial loathing of such concepts, beliefs and practices. The African Counc il of Herbal Physicians made it plain that: No member of the Council shall practise or have anything whatsoever to do with conjuring or any form of tricks or deception for the purpose of gain or otherwise or of what is known as \"Aje\" or other such like arts, charms and devices which are regarded by Law or in the Criminal Code as illegal.19 Although healers were forced to publicly and privately reconcile the duality of mysterious powers among the Yoruba in slightly new ways, they helped to preserve the positive and negative unde rstanding of aje in Yorubaland, by working with and against these forces. The great mothers were know n as the power behind healing medicines, and healers did not forget this. Yet, there were many people who sought to inflict evil upon others via supernatural means. The spiritual entities know n as aje or iya mi provided the \"life force\"20 that allowed Yoruba medicine to be effective. As Chief Erelu stated the \"traditional healers and Aje work hand-in-hand, the Aje are the ones who makes herbs work. If one provides whatever one is asked to bring, one will be healed.\"21 To take the perspective of Hallen and Sodipo, systems of evil were real in Yorubaland, however the positive and benevolent dimensions of aje has been unde rrepresented in the written record. It should be noted there were multiple versions of the term aje and different ones used in the 19 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 20 Washington, Our Mothers, Our Powers, Our Texts , Manifestations of Aje in Africana Literature, 4. 21 Personal interview of Chief Erelu (Onisegun Awo) Odua, April, 2008. 179 Yoruba spiritual context. Chief Odua reveals that, \"We worship Osa Aje in our family...W hoever is poor, whose business is not moving on fine, if he worships Aje, the person will be prosperous...Aje chieftaincy title belongs to my family.\"22 In this case, aje refers to a divinity of financial success. The spirit of aje also existed within some humans. Thus, humans were also aje and used their powers for good or evil. The spirit of aje was believed to be inherited biologically or was acquired.23 An exceptionally psychic or outstandingly supernaturally talented person was considered to possess aje.24 Therefore, Yoruba healers, priests, as well as various older women were, at times, thoug ht to have this power. In fact, Chief Odua, who has aje in her family line provides an example of how using aje for good or evil was a choice. She notes: My grandfather did not give birth to many children because he had too many bad charms which, did not allow him to have too many children. He married nine wives and gave birth to three children, and these were born by two wives. A wife gave birth two children and another wife gave birth to one child...In ancient times, if one offends those elder [ancestors and great mother spirits] then they will not want to forgive them, in fact it was because of the bad charms...and the tough charms he possessed was what was killing his children...We were taught when we were young not to use bad charms because we heard that our fore-fathers who used it then did not end up well. Their lives were miserable, so we were taught not to do it.25 Healers who had positive aje, often were secretive about it, typically not admitting to being such. Besides the obvious confusion the general public and the colonialists would have because of the widespread view of aje as evil, Hallen and Sodipo explain that there were additional important reasons the good aje could not expos e 22 Ibid. 23 Prince, \"The Yoruba Image of the Witch,\" The British Journal of Psychiatry 107, no. 449 (1961), 797. 24 Hallen and Sodipo, Knowledge, Belief & Witchcraft, Analytic Experiments in African Philosophy, 104-5. 25 Personal interview of Chief Erelu (Onisegun Awo) Odua, April, 2008. 180 themselves or promote the benevolence of aje too much. These reasons included: those with such power have great respons ibility that ordinary people wouldn't unde rstand nor likely appreciate; also since the power source cannot be taught only inherited or acquired it generated fear [and/or resentment].26 Furthermore, if a benevolent aje passed this power onto the wrong person it could have been easily misused. Lastly, if a powerful person made no claims of greatness, they could avoid blame if a mistake occurred. The idea of \"great mothers\" was that these 'motherly' forces were 'great' because of their abilities and command. In fact, it was the capacity to reproduc e life that empowered women.27 The Yoruba's historical association of mysterious power with mothers provides further evidence of the healing abilities of women between 1922 and 1955 that has not been accurately represented in the recorded archival texts. Recently, there has been an academic recognition that women as healers across the globe represented more aspects of healing than just midwifery and ritual specialists.28 Although this dissertation reviewed Yoruba women who functioned as healers through midwifery, religion, marketing and as classic consultants, motherhood among the Yoruba was another area in which Yoruba women exhibited healing skills. Motherhood in Yoruba culture was the most esteemed position a woman could obtain.29 This status coupled with the supreme importance the Yoruba placed on those mature in age, elder mothers were regarded as some of society's most powerful people, 26 Hallen and Sodipo, Knowledge, Belief & Witchcraft, Analytic Experiments in African Philosophy, 116. 27 Badejo, Osun Seegesi: The Elegant Deity of Wealth, Power, and Femininity, 79. 28 McClain, Women as Healers: Cross-Cultural Perspectives (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1989) and Sharla M. Fett, Working Cures: Healing, Health, and Power on Southern Slave Plantations, (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002). 29 T. Makinde, \"Motherhood as a Source of Empowerment of Women in Yoruba Culture,\" Nordic Journal of African Studies 13, no. 2 (2004),165. 181 especially because they were know n to have exceptional wisdom of the munda ne and metaphys ical world. Though males dominated public life, Yoruba women's unrivaled influence over their offspring as youth and adults, meant their social authority, though decentralized was extraordinary and complete; because everyone has a mother. The spiritual entities know n as 'great mothers' were considered as occupying the same type of unregulated power. It was even been assessed that their offspring were the divinities of the Yoruba religious system and the spiritual forces of the earthly elements30 (i.e., herbs), thus holding a command that pertains to anyone who seeks to deal with the supernatural. Chief Aragberin, observed, \"one must have a dependable mother as one's confidant because one cannot practice the traditional healing job without [them]...W e work together as one...If I am having some difficulties and I told them about it, they will give me some herbs and explain the usage and if I obey, there will be healing. Though they practice independently and individually...\" The Iyaloja Oyebisi, a Muslim healer, noted in respons e to healing people supernaturally \"We usually pray with the elder mothers on their [the patient's] behalf so that they can be healed of problems.\"31 Oral history interviewees learned to respect 'the mothers/elders,' the iya awon, from their parents. Maclean interviewed 100 healers and discovered that healers clearly stated that \"our mothers,\" \"the witches help us prepare our medicines...[and] are the bone s behind our treatments.\"32 30 Noted in a 2007 personal conversation with Iyanifa Aina Olomo, author of The Core of Fire: A Path to Yoruba Spiritual Activism (Brooklyn, NY, Athelia Henrietta Press, 2002), Washington, Our Mothers, Our Powers, Our Texts , Manifestations of Aje in Africana Literature,35-51 discusses how the Orisa (divinities) 'have aje,' and argues the relationship of the great mothers to the earth. 31 Personal interview of Mulili Atu Oyebisi (Iyaloja), April, 2008. 32 Una Maclean, Magical Medicine: A Nigerian Case-Study (London: Allen Lane, 1971), 81. 182 Healers across Yorubaland had cases in which they helped women with problems from spiritual malevolency relating to birth, where the great mothers gave assistance. Chief Aragberin recalls: There was one woman who had been pregnant for 3 years, whom was brought to me and I healed her. And her family battled with me because I healed the woman...After I healed this woman I became sick for the next two months because I healed this woman. The woman's family was responsible for my illness. I gave her some medicines to mix with pap and other medicines to use. After a while she gave birth to the baby...Her case was supernatural. But men are more powerful than themselves, so I consulted the elders/mothers and we healed this woman.33 Spiritually Malevolent Activities in Colonial Yorubaland Systems of evil and the application of medicine for malevolent purposes were certainly present in Yorubaland during the 1922-1955 period. Healers fough t spiritual malevolency, in part, because forces of evil were the ones that made indigenous medicine ineffective.34 Furthermore, it was commonly believed that evil practices and/or malevolent medicine were the cause of various reproduc tive, psychiatric, and prosperity problems.35 Healers, of course, sought to cure these types of issues and thus, had to simultaneously appeal to the benevolence of mysterious spiritual beings, and battle evils that attempted to sap their medicines' efficacy, as well as help clients who suffered illness or misfortune as the result of any type of wicked intent or recipe. 33 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin Edun Adebiyi Omoyebi, April, 2008. 34 Peter Dopamu, \"The Practice of Magic and Medicine in Yoruba Traditional Religion\" (Dissertation, University of Ibadan, 1977), 148; Drewals, Gelede: Art and Female Power among the Yoruba (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1990). 35 Prince, \"The Yoruba Image of the Witch,\" 798. 183 Photo of an Ibadan, Nigeria healing market stall displaying skulls and other animal parts. These were common ingredients of evil medicines and the beneficent medicines to counteract evils of various kinds. Photo taken by the author, April, 2008. Figure 6.2. In Yorubaland, descriptions of spiritual malevolency were similar to that of other cultures, especially English versions of evil \"witchcraft.\" Both cultures made frequent references to spiritually malevolent women: having the ability to fly, as cannibals (especially of their own children), and as having secret groups /networks that met at night to strengthen their activities. Teresa Washington depicts the sinister aspects of spiritual aje basically as forces that were to implement justice when necessary, even if cruelly.36 The multitude of mostly male-authored literature on human Yoruba aje portrayed these select older women as intentional, covert, social menaces. On the other hand, Chief Elebuibon explains that they were both kind and cruel, as healers then knew.37 36 Washington, Our Mothers, Our Powers, Our Texts, Manifestations of Aje in Africana Literature, 29. 37 Elebuibon, Invisible Powers of the Metaphysical World: A Peep Into the World of Witches. 184 There, in fact, existed persons who engaged in evil supernatural practices, though they were on the fringes of society.38 This evil Yoruba woman was often powerless and bitter seeking recourse through implementation of evil, as a weapon of the weak.39 Though these women were said to exercise their evil powers psychically and supernaturally, they sometimes used tangible natural recipes40 i.e., from herbs and blood. However, the use of recipes was more commonly associated with oso or male practitioners of mysterious medicine. Delano in discussing the Yoruba's alleged evil elder women in the 1920s and 30s notes: In 1925, in the streets of Lagos, I heard one old woman going about naming those whom she had killed by her witchcraft. The list was a long one, and among the victims whom I knew was a Catholic girl and a minister of religion, and both died in circumstances that aroused surprise and suspicion.41 A man being labeled as aje per se, was atypical. Nonetheless, men as evil practitioners, who were called by some as oso or oloogun, existed with equal frequency in this era. Dopamu describes the numerous distinctions between the two practitioners of evil. These differences were that: oloogun were conscious of actions, aje may not have been; aje could transform into animals (i.e., birds), oloogun did not; aje ate their victims, oloogun did not; oloogun had clients, aje could not be paid; oloogun could quit the business, aje would always do evil [or must be exorcised]; oloogun did not have organizations, aje did; oloogun was learned through apprenticing and training, but people inherited or acquired aje 'psychic malevolent power;' and aje could have been used to 38 J.

Peel, \"Gender in Yoruba Religious Change,\" Journal of Religion in Africa 32, no. 2 (2002), 136. 39 Dopamu, \"The Practice of Magic and Medicine in Yoruba Traditional Religion,\" 284. 40 Morton-Williams, \"The Atinga Cult among , A Sociological Analysis of a Witch-Finding Movement,\" 46. 41 Isaac O. Delano, The Soul of Nigeria (London: Werner, 1937), 98. 185 help family, while oloogun was always bad.42 Given the traits of oloogun nothing prevented women from being oloogun as well. Therefore, the male-female dichotomy of aje and oloogun was not rigid, nor completely fixed. Many types of evil recipes were applied in Yorubaland. The Oloogun who practiced evil medicine were contracted to implement particular deeds intended to phys ically or mentally disable another human, either temporarily or permanently. An individual's health, social relationships, trade and fortune were frequent targets of evil deeds. The multitude of evil medicines kept Yoruba healers with robus t business between 1922-1955. The evil recipes were not fool proof and did not always work. Dopamu notes that evil medicine failed for a variety of reasons including: medicinal protection, incorrect preparation of recipes, karmic and spiritual protection, and at times, refusal of the oloogun to do the job or honor the request. Likewise, Mr. Adeboje observed, \"When you are practicing material herbalism...[positively] you will succeed. But, if you dabble into another type, like saying 'I want to kill this man,' for evil purposes, you will not survive.\"43 In the multitude of cases where the evil recipes did work, it was the job of healers to implement antidotes (ero) to these recipes. Dopamu details many of these concoctions, poisons, charms and spells, paraphrased in table 6.a and simply listed as \"recipes.\"44 42 Dopamu, \"The Practice of Magic and Medicine in Yoruba Traditional Religion,\" 29-31. 43 Personal interview of Olusegun Adeboje, August, 2001. 44 Dopamu, \"The Practice of Magic and Medicine in Yoruba Traditional Religion,\" 678-683. 186 Table 6.a45 Yoruba Categories for Evil Recipes Function 1 Abilu Recipe used to harm an enemy, drastically effecting their fortune. 2 Agbadaagodo/Akaraba Recipe of \"padlock\" to prevent a person from doing something. 3 Agbano Recipe to prevent one from saving money. 4 Alusare Recipe used to make a victim run around like their insane. 5 Alusubu or Subsere Recipe causing one to fall and unable to get up. 6 Aluwo Recipe to disempower a person. 7 Anobo Recipe used to have money boomerang back to a customer, seller loses the money. 8 Apeta Invocation shooting, or soul shooting resulting in death. 9 Ayogo Recipe used to remo ve a person from society. 10 Boreje Recipe to spoil a friendship. 11 Dide oyun mo obinrin ninu Recipe used to prevent a pregnant woman from delivering. 12 Efun Recipe used to make one act abnormal and dangerous. 13 Epe Curse.

The limited, particular ways that evil was associated with Yoruba religion, was for instance, that the divinities were suppos e to protect devotees from the invisible enemies of humankind. The odu (scripts) of Ifa contained references and rules of engagement for all of the enemies of humankind. Chief Elebuibon reiterates multiple times that Orisa Oko, the divinity of the farm and the Egungun, the collective ancestors, were both strongly \"oppos ed to witch craft,\" thus their devotees worked against spiritual malevolency.46 The farm divinity, Oko having such a strong aversion to evil was carried into healers' practices, given that numerous healers were also farmers. Small pox practices of the Saponna sect were categorized in this period as evil because of a few corrupt priests covertly spreading the disease for selfish purposes. However, this was an exaggeration and distorted image resulting from colonial actions. The missionary adaptation of the divinity Esu to mean \"the devil,\" was unde served and incorrect. Esu was the divinity of the crossroads and overseer of proper action. In fact, Chief Odua states that \"Esu and Aje work together,\" for the benefit of humankind.47 The records of this 1922 to 1955 period indicate that even common men used a version of Esu called sigidi for, what many considered evil purposes. Delano illustrates in the 1920s-30s he experienced that a \"sigidi is made with clay in the form of a man, about a foot and a half high\" it then needs to be \"developed,\" for a number of days, then in the case he knew 46 Elebuibon, Invisible Powers of the Metaphysical World: A Peep Into the World of Witches, 34. 47 Personal interview of Chief Erelu (Onisegun Awo) Odua, April, 2008. 188 of \"the men go to the cemetery every day to perform certain ceremonies\" for it.48 In his witnessing the making and use of one, the sigidi went out in the night to carry out its mission to harm or kill, it was gone for two hours, but couldn't complete its mission because \"it could not cross a flowing stream. Lagos is an island.\"49 Delano, Dopamu and Fadipe indicate, that although sigidi was typically employed for the demise of an individual the intention of the owner of the sigidi may be good\u2014using this Esu force as a defense mechanism against a person's \"enemies\".50 Photo of c. 1930 Esu objects. This divinity works for the good of humans, yet Christians translated it as \"the devil\" because it played tricks and punished delinquent humans. Figure 6.3.51 Throughout the 1922-1955 colonial period, those openly accused of spiritual malevolency in Yorubaland were mostly women. While healers sought to appeal to 48 Delano, The Soul of Nigeria,100. 49 Ibid, 101. 50 N.A. Fadipe, The Sociology of the Yoruba (Ibadan University Press, 1970 (from 1939 Dissertation)), states on 299 sigidi was employed to kill enemies; Dopamu, \"The Practice of Magic and Medicine in Yoruba Traditional Religion,\" 176 says that sigidi is not evil. 51 Photo from the special collections at the University of Birmingham. CMS Unofficial Papers, Acc 233 F10/1-103 1860-1930. Figure 6.3. 189 colonial gove rnments to control oloogun, there were few social programs that candidly addressed them. Healers did battle practitioners of evil medicine directly and sought to eliminate them. This was done through medicinal recipes\u2014not typically through personal interactive levels. There also was the understanding that users of evil medicine would likely and eventually destroy themselves. On the other hand, the issue of aje was addressed publicly in a myriad of ways, beyond the private approaches of healers and priests. Since aje were thought to have an innate power that had divine backing, they were seen as a larger threat. \"Trials by ordeal\" operated through indigenous and foreign methods in this era. Parrinder's categories for types of the accused were all relevant to the Yoruba. In particular, accusations came from \"kinship stresses and family jealousies,\"52 as explanations for infant and youth mortality, to consign awkward or anti-social people, to resolve problems of unsettled communities and/or to satisfy the need for a scapegoat.53 Undoubt edly, many of the accused were innoc ent and some were proven as such. Other women were unne cessarily abused or killed because of accusations and not because they actually were evil aje. The associations of the Oro and Ogboni were predominately politically oriented, and also were exclusively or majority male. Fadipe observed: Ogboni fraternity in every community felt the need of an expeditious and vigorous handling of certain classes of offences, disorders and crimes in the community, free of the paralyzing and distracting mysteries of the womenfolk. The result was the setting up of an organization with which the bull-roarer was associated as an object unknown to the women and likely to strike terror into them when agitated. When certain criminals had to be arrested and force had to be used on a scale with which women had to be forcible 52 Parrinder, Witchcraft, European and African, 193. 53 Ibid, 193-202. 190 dragged from her home, or when devotees of the small-pox orisa had to be dealt with for contaminating wells and springs in their effort to spread the epidemic, a day was declared as set aside for Oro, during which women might not show themselves in the public on pain of death.54 A c. 1930s colonial report also complained that Oro was used as a 'terrorizing' organization, although the intent was to eradicate social calamities.55 These 1930s descriptions of Oro societies indicate that before movements such as the Atingas of the 1950s there were Yoruba communal ways of dealing with evil. Sadly, Fadipe's description also illustrates excesses of colonial influences upon patriarchy on an already patriarchal society and how women became the intense object of blame for social ills. Peel offers a perspective on the issue of male prosecution of spiritually malevolent women: In general, one might say that while the legitimate taking of life was a matter for men (as warriors, hunters, sacrificers, executors of criminals and witches etc.), the most essential feature of women was that they gave life: motherhood was the supreme realization of their gender. The obscenity of witches was that they were women who killed; and their most characteristic target was other women, especially in the reproductive careers.56 Practicing evil was thought to be a socially damaging abomination, in need of drastic measures to correct, therefore the torturous treatment. In this regard it could be argued that such brutality against women, was in defense of women. In various parts of Yorubaland, the Gelede society celebrated and placated elder women and the aje spirits in order to show respect, in addition to implementing a protective strategy. Contrary to the pure fear and punishment tactics used by other organizations, as well as other anti-evil campaigns, gelede festivals sought to use positive 54 Fadipe, The Sociology of the Yoruba, 249-250. 55 \"Notes on Customs & Superstition of Indigenous Institutions\" CSO 26 6076. 56 Peel, \"Gender in Yoruba Religious Change,\" 144. 191 acknow ledgement and affirming reverence to engage in the reality of 'great mothers'.57 Women tended to be the majority of membership in Gelede societies since fertility was an essential aspect of womanhood. For instance, a woman who was unsuccessful in conceiving would have first been advised to \"see an herbalist or diviner...[then] may be advised to join the Gelede society in order to win the goodw ill of the aje, in case they are the cause of the problem.\"58 Colonial Laws and Evil Practices Circa 1933 Mr. K. Dewar, an Assistant District Officer compiled a report entitled \"Notes on Witchcraft,\" which was widely circulated among the colonialists and likely the missionaries as well. This scholarly styled document provided all types colonizers with relevant insights into what was considered evil in Africa. It is clear that there was an attempt to generalize the concept of \"witchcraft\" and relate it to European and American dealings with the issue. As there was a \"widespread intellectual predisposition to the universality of the witchcraft phenomenon.\"59 E. Evans-Pritchard's Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande of 1937 became a highly lauded academic work, which suppos edly provided the most complete theoretical and functional model of the topic in Africa, since colonizers and scholars then applied it to all groups in Africa. The issue of spiritual evil practices in Africa and particularly in Nigeria perplexed colonialists. How to handle accusations and trials of spiritual malevolency and evil medicine also referred to as \"juju\" by colonialists, became a source of great consideration 57 Babatunde Lawal, The Gelede Spectacle, Art, Gender, and Social Harmony in an African Culture (Seattle, University of Washington Press, 1996). 58 Ibid, 81. 59 Hallen and Sodipo.

Therefore, he not only describes beliefs in evil from what his research determined to be an 'African perspective,' but he also noted sugge stions on how he thought colonialists should engage the subject. He indicated that these matters needed to be taken seriously by colonial courts, but that trials should consist of solid evidence. He emphasized that the accused ought to be considered sympathetically since the motivations for accusation vary. Furthermore, he argued that the trial by ordeal\u2014typically using sasswood, should be replaced with an oath.60 Though trial by ordeal was prohibited, people in Yorubaland certainly used it to spot an evil, often female, practitioner. Minutes of an 'Ibadan Native Administration Inner Counc il' meeting on October 24, 1938 noted that a man accused his wife of adultery. Upon the husband's request, he and his wife both drink sasswood (obo). As a result the husband died and the wife lived. In response to this strange irony, the police arrested the seller, yet the king of Ibadan, or the Olubadan advoc ated for the continual legality of sasswood. The king acknow ledged that the plant was always sold in markets and should not be prohibited, and its used for \"making medicine for horses, spleen and many other kind of things\" the seller was released with the warning to always ask people why they are buying sasswood.61 In 1936 \"a woman, Oridere, was fined 1 pound for holding Obo bark in her hand.\"62 Sasswood was likely not the only plant (or tree) used in 60 Mr. K. Dewar, \"Notes on Witchcraft,\" Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 2, 595. 61 \"Witch-craft or Juju cases Trial of by Native Courts Forbidden exception in minor cases,\" Oyo Province 1150. 62 \"Witch-craft or Juju cases Trial of by Native Courts Forbidden exception in minor cases,\" Oyo Province 1150. 193 Yorubaland to reveal who an aje might be, for instance some healers used \"tiroo.\"63 However, sasswood (obo) was the one that was most often mentioned because of its widespread use in West Africa and its common presence globally. Colonial authorities in Yorubaland tended to agree with Dewar's assessment of spiritual malevolency and evil medicine in Africa. One Oyo officer plainly stated he believes it was their job to slowly discourage beliefs in spiritually malevolent activities and evil medicine to \"protect him [the African] against himself.\"64 This paternalistic attitude from largely Christian colonialists was one important reason that they would 'entertain' Nigerians. Colonialists allowed such cases to be heard in court for a while in Nigeria, because they believed they were taking a gradual approach in 'helping the African' to diminish the belief in such 'superstitions.' In the mid-1930 's the gove rnor had lifted a ban and approved native courts to hear \"witchcraft\" cases in the southern province (inclusive of Yorubaland) but wanted reports, upda tes and general statistics on these cases.65 Prior to the suspension of the prohibition on colonial native courts hearing cases of spiritual malevolency and evil medicine, indigenous people requested numerous times that these cases be heard. This was especially significant since the native courts were suppos ed to try cases concerning local Yoruba matters. On occasion the Yoruba brought such cases to the courts when permitted. In Ilesha, 1936, \"a man Jewole was fined 10/- and ordered to pay 1 pound compensation to Folowosele on whose wife Subulade he was 63 Simpson, Yoruba Religion and Medicine in Ibadan, 75. This may actually be a combination of substances. 64 \"Witch-craft or Juju cases Trial of by Native Courts Forbidden exception in minor cases,\" Oyo Province 1150. 65 Ibid. 194 found to have put 'bad medicine.'\"66 Nevertheless, the number of Yoruba cases was low compared to other provinces. The Southern Secretary reported to the Chief Secretary on February 15, 1938 , that in \"the first ten months of 1937 there were nearly 900 such criminal cases [of \"witchcraft\"] in the Southern Provinces, of which only 38 were heard in the four Yoruba Provinces. Many of these were, however, of a very petty nature.\"67 There were several reasons why the Yoruba did not use the courts to resolve cases of spiritual malevolency and evil medicine as often as other groups . One reason was that a majority of people, despite indigenous inclusion, did not trust European structures to be able to resolve such issues, especially given that the colonialists only barely unde rstood and typically did not believe in Yoruba spirituality. Additionally, the only possible outcome of court hearings was basic punishment for the accused (e.g. fines). Since death, slavery or lifetime imprisonments were not sentences colonial courts typically employed, the Yoruba knew that the courts would not adequately deal with an evil practitioner. Another reason was that the social repercussions that could result from a court case were not worth the risk, for instance, such a public accusation may cause inter-familial strife. The most important reason was that people used Yoruba medicine to resolve issues of evil practices. When evildoing occurred, courts offered no remedies to counteract the problem, and cures were the critical element in such circumstances. The victim needed relief from whatever the problem was i.e., infertility, illness or misfortune, that was created through spiritual malevolency and evil medicine. The healers offered this and the courts did not. 66 Ibid. 67 Ibid. 195 In the cases that the court did hear oaths were in fact taken by 1937 in various parts of Yorubaland. Bibles, Qurans and Ogun [the Yoruba divinity of metal, hunting and war] were used for swearing, and a person could choos e if they wanted to swear or not. One district officer wrote that oaths were taken only \"with the consent of the oppos ing party, and generally in adultery cases. Oftentimes, it is enough for a party to say he or she is prepared to take such an oath for the other party to give up his claim.\"68 This was likely another reason for the minimal number of such Yoruba court cases. The Atinga Movement Colonialists hope d that Yoruba beliefs and practices of spiritual malevolency and evil medicine would have died by the 1950s , but this did not happen\u2014largely because of colonialism. One officer commenting on the Atinga movement in regret that it was not 'dealt with earlier,' noted: \"There is, however, little hope of mobilising [sic] enlightened public opinion against such practices when many of the most highly placed, educated and influential members of the community believe implicitly in witchcraft and in the powers of Atinga to \"smell it out.\"\"69 The Yoruba's enthusiasm for this short-lived, but remarkable movement in many ways illustrated the sometimes ambiguous role of Yoruba healers. To date, there are very few revealing works written on the Atinga. For instance, in Peter Morton-Williams' 1956 article \"The Atinga Cult among the South-Western Yoruba: A Sociological Analysis of a Witch-Finding Movement,\"70 descriptions and interviewee information match that of the colonial record, however with greater, but not 68 Ibid. 69 \"Witchcraft Oyo,\" Oyo Sociological Analysis of a Witch-Finding Movement.\" 196 complete objectivity. Simpson, in Yoruba Religion and Medicine in Ibadan only briefly describes and analyzes the Atinga, none theless providing original insights. Apter's chapter \"Atinga Revisited: Yoruba Witchcraft and the Cocoa Econom y, 1950-1951\" focuses on econom ics, while other scholars typically only make basic mention of the movement. The Atinga was a foreign born movement, from Dahomey (Benin) via the Gold Coast (Ghana), during the late 1940' s and early 1950's that sought to detect and correct spiritually malevolent practices. This movement among the Yoruba was called \"Alatinga\" or owners of the Atinga. These groups were traveling traders who specialized in luring out evildoers in any town they came to, as well as immediately curing the accused (who were almost exclusively older women). They did this by using practically standardized techniques. These nomads even taught locals their methods . First, they gained permission to stay in the town from a person of Yoruba authority. Once they were granted permission to operate, they then built mud altars at the base of a tree. \"They destroyed many baobab and iroko trees on the ground that they harboured [sic] witches.\"71 Sacrifices and offerings (typically animals and kola nuts) were made and the drums would begin. Then: The parties perform ritual dances, Dahomey in origin, singing Dahomey songs. Usually during the course of these dances some are seized with paroxysms and are laid aside. When they recover, a few hours later, they declare that a witch is found. She is brought to the witch hunters, here juju [religious] calabashes and whatnots are taken from her, she is washed and her head is shaved and she is released, made powerless by white magic. In all cases, they confess to having practiced witchcraft and having killed people.72 71 Simpson, Yoruba Religion and Medicine in Ibadan, 79. 72 \"Witchcraft Oyo,\" Oyo C226. 197 If an accused did not confess to being a witch they were \"tested with an oracle.\"73 They were each required to bring a chicken, a half bottle of gin and fifteen shillings to the head of the Atinga at the site prepared on the edge of town...[After sacrifices and offerings] If it [the chicken] died on its back \"facing heaven,\" the woman was not a witch; if it died in any other position, she was a witch.74 Those found guilty were to confess and be cleansed, those who did not confess were \"tortured until they yielded.\"75 Various accounts point out the cruel ways in which the Atinga punished the accused women who did not easily confess. For instance, there were women who \"have been bound and beaten and have had pepper put in their eyes and private parts, i.e., trial by ordeal...One of the women has had a finger severed.\"76 In another case, the Atinga \"detected some witches, who admitted they were witches after being publicly flogge d in the town,\" and one woman died from the flogging.77 A sad case happened when a woman's own two children \"dragged her to the Atingas and [she then said] that in their [her children's] presence and with their active co-operation, the Atinga's seriously dealt with her and inserted certain medicine into her private.\"78 If the wrong person was accused then the proceedings were sometimes stoppe d. In one situation, two chiefs' wives were charged, and it was then Yoruba authorities worked to end the trials in that town.79 At times, if the child of one of the accused 73 Morton-Williams, \"The Atinga Cult among the South-Western Yoruba: A Sociological of a Witch-Finding Movement,\" 75 Oyo C226 and \"Atinga\" 1951, Ibadan, 2905. 198 vehemently came to her defense, she may be excused from the ordeal.80 Additionally, there was the option of joining the Atinga movement. Records indicate that many adolescents volunteered. These youth attempted to gain power in a society that often suppressed the young. Also some astute older women participated.81 Certainly people realized that being part of the group was a strategy to avoid becoming a target of the group. The other \"voluntary\" reaction that women had upon being charged with spiritual malevolency was confession. Morton-Williams interviewed five women who confessed and obtained interesting results namely that: the majority of them had children who had died, none of them \"voluntarily\" became malevolent, and some did not know they were deviant before the arrival of the Atinga, and most of them said that they did not use evil on purpose. Reasonable assessments of these answers would be that if these women were representative of the types of women that were branded as spiritual malevolent by the Atinga, then there was little evidence to prove their guilt and these confessions were in fact involuntary. The idea that women used spiritual malevolency or evil medicine on their husbands and children is strong within this particular anti-evil movement. Yoruba healers certainly handled such situations. In any instance healers' processes of correcting evil may be lengthy and was certainly not done in public. The fact that accused women often had dead children would seem to put these women in an oppos ing position to the 80 Morton-Williams, \"The Atinga Cult among the South-Western Yoruba: A Sociological Analysis of a Witch-Finding Movement,\" 48. 81 Learned through personal communication with Dele Ajayi. 199 Yoruba healing institution, given the large focus on fertility medicine and life enhancing tonics. The Yoruba concept that evil women ate their children was a cultural idea that was not an outstanding concern to healers. Authorities and lay-persons in town after Yoruba town invited, encouraged and even sought Atingas to visit and practice there, despite the colonial authorities' efforts to eradicate Atinga activities. Kings, chiefs and people of all kinds trusted in the efficacy of the Atinga. Although the length of stay of various groups of Atinga was only a few weeks at the most in the early part of 1951, many Yoruba people were convinced that they were extremely useful. One town would invite them to come because they heard of their success in a neighbor ing area, these testimonies were the source for the speed with which they spread. Caretakers of communities and members of the public considered Atinga remedies to be \"the science [of] anti-witch-craft which when proven have saved lives.\"82 Numerous suppor ters stated that thanks to Atinga activities small pox outbreaks ceased, babies were successfully born, and only natural deaths occurred, thus expressing that the primary concerns about the effects of evil doing were health issues. Since the Atinga were foreigners and temporary residents, they provided a special oppor tunity to address those persons in town that people generally believed to adversely affect the well-being of the popul ation. These outsiders directly targeted a sensitive issue that the average Yoruba felt personally powerless against. Therefore, many Yoruba saw the Atinga as 82 \"Witchcraft Oyo,\" Oyo C226. 200 instituting a permanent solution to a menacing problem without residual ill feelings that would happen with a fellow townsman's accusation. While Yoruba medicine was still used and considered effective, it typically was not a permanent solution to spiritual malevolency and evil medicine. Though healers would fight evil and occasionally destroy human practitioners of spiritual malevolency for their clients or for themselves, these projects were not communal and herbalist would not publicly disempower these persons or groups . To some healers the Atinga's were seen as a complementary. There was even a case in which an herbalist hired the Atinga to come to a village.83 Simpson notes that the Atinga medicine of kola nuts was \"acceptable to most people\u2014to Yoruba religionists, Atinga was a god to most Christians, an angel sent to help them.\"84 It appears as though most Yoruba healers clandestinely disapproved of the Atinga group. One 1951 Dispenser, counc ellor [sic] and some iddlers [sic] who term themselves as Native Doctors have started to instigate the Bale [chief] not to co-operate with the choice of the entire taxpayers [to keep the Atinga].\"85 There were a multitude of reasons healers disliked the Atingas and too few reasons they might have embraced them. First, the idea that nomads could come and instantly eradicate what healers spent their careers dealing with seemed improbable. Second, healers may have viewed their methods too simplistic and potentially a fraud. Third, healers saw the Atinga activities as a spectacle that disregarded the code of 'keeping secrets' that 83 \"Atinga\" 1951, Ibadan, 2905. 84 Simpson, Yoruba Religion and Medicine in Ibadan, 79. 85 \"Atinga\" 1951, Ibadan, 2905. 201 powerful people, such as healers most often employed. Fourth, healers knew that accused women were not wholly bad, nor were the spiritually malevolent exclusively women, therefore Atinga's targeting actually posed a risk to the long-term safety of communities as oppos ed to ensuring security because of their narrow focus. Fifth, Atinga presence implicitly challenged the credibility of healers. Sixth, healers may have remained somewhat silent on the issue because it was too popul ar and they did not want to go against the crowd. Seventh, healers wanted to avoid perpetuating the abuses that accompanied many of the Atinga sessions. Lastly, with the healers, continuous efforts to be in accordance with the law, and by this point to gain gove rnment approval, the healers did not want to advoc ate something the colonialists were staunchly against. The healers likely agreed with the colonialists as the gove rnment worked hard to eliminate the Atinga movement. Citizens' persecution, or \"trial by ordeal\" of alleged spiritual malevolency was illegal in colonial Yorubaland before the arrival of the Atinga. Thus, the colonialists were incensed when the Atinga moved through the region. In town after town the colonial police arrested Atinga practitioners or kicked them out of the area. In some cases their trade items, which consisted of items such as anti-evil \"medicines\" in the form of kola nuts, were confiscated. In fact, the colonialists mainly saw the Atinga as a lucrative \"racket\", with group members comparable to people \"found loafing in any large lorry park [i.e., hustlers].\"86 This was partially due to the fact that the Atinga collected money, not only from the accused, but also from those in town that invited them. 86 \"Atinga\" 1951, Ibadan, 2905. 202 The colonialists were so interested in removing the Atinga, they quarreled with Yoruba indigenous authorities over this issue. They sent numerous corresponde nces to local leaders to warn them against engaging the Atingas. In one case, it took \"three long discussions...to get the Oluwo [king] and Counc il to agree to send the 8 atingas away before noon on Saturday.\"87 In another case, colonialists arrested a chief who allowed the Atinga to practice in his area, making an example out of him to show Yoruba leaders that they were not to entertain the Atingas.88 There were other motivations as to why Yoruba indigenous political authorities desired the presence of the Atinga's, although they had Yoruba priests and healers that addressed witchcraft. Of course there is always the concept that local healers and priests were not effective, however that idea is rejected. Simpson provides alternative reasoning that was true for healers as well, even though he only refers to Yoruba priests in this statement: Of interest is the attitude of the wealthy and influential men who invited the Alatinga to their towns and paid their expenses while they were in residence. These sponsors did not prevent attacks on the orisa [Yoruba divinities]. Some were chiefs whose offices had been made secular under the Protectorate [the British Colonial Government]; others were secular office-holders. Both of these groups would gain some power if the cults of the orisa were to be abolished and the heads of the cults were to lose the small influence they retained.89 Yoruba healers were in similar circumstances. Healers were influential and potentially threatening to political authorities because they held matters of citizens' lives and deaths in their hands. Furthermore, as explained earlier, it was believed that someone who could battle spiritual malevolency and evil medicine could use these 87 Ibid. 88 Ibid. 89 Simpson, Yoruba Religion and Medicine in Ibadan, 80. 203 powers on their own behalf positively or negatively, thus healers instilled a sense of fear not only among general popul ation, but also among those with political stature. The power play that political leaders displayed did not significantly decrease the status of the healers, because the Atinga movement died out quickly and was actually specifically outlawed the same year of the peak of their presence in Yorubaland, 1951 . Simpson observed that by 1955 shrines that the Atingas destroyed were being rebuilt.90 By 1955 healers and priests as the main local specialists subdui ng spiritual malevolency and evil medicine had returned as the normal order. Meanwhile, the fears of these issues continued to increase given the dramatically changing political and econom ic circumstances that this eve of independence brought. Conclusion Yoruba healers had a myriad of ways to contain spiritual malevolency, whether the result of supernatural or human doing. The concept of aje, as mysterious beings or people with special supernatural abilities was unde rstood by the healers, but often a source of confusion for Yoruba lay persons and the colonialists. Even though some people did not fully comprehend the forms and perceptions of how evil operated in Yorubaland in the mid-1930s , colonialists heard court cases pertaining to such issues. Because the Yoruba were not eager to resolve instances of spiritual malevolency in this manner, they continued to use Yoruba healing to resolve their problems. By the 1950s the illegal Atinga movement had a burst of popul arity, however the Yoruba healers did not generally suppor t the movement. By this point, healers had demonstrated their 90 Ibid. 204 lawfulness and their sustained interests in traditions of secrecy. The next chapter further explores how the healers promoted their agendas and sought to engage the gove rnment in positive ways for their benefit, through the establishment of associations. 205 Chapter Seven Yoruba Healing Associations Social and professional associations, groups , guilds, societies, clubs, organizations or any other preferred label, were common features in various cultures around the world\u2014in one form or another whether officially or not. Certain types of associations such as age grades, were found among the Yoruba and other indigenous African societies. The unique Yoruba pre-colonial practice of having an extensive array of associations deserves investigation for a founda tion to better unde rstand how such sophisticated styles of healing associations arose in this colonial period. Therefore, this chapter provides a general synops is of Yoruba associations during the 1922-1955 period, and then concentrates on the Yoruba healing associations in particular. The Yoruba healing associations are examined in terms of their historical scope, organizational structures, social agendas, ethics and disputes. As these issues are explored, it will become apparent how healing associations fostered the resiliency of Yoruba healing in this 1922-1955 colonial period. Yoruba Associations in General Historical research on Yoruba associations is limited. However, evidence of the Yoruba's pre-colonial proficiency in organizing societies and groups for a myriad of interests has been displayed.1 More thorough evidence has been documented in the Americas, where the Yoruba organized societies during the 18th and 19th centuries.2 1 N.A. Fadipe, The Sociology of the Yoruba (Ibadan University Press, 1970, from 1939 Dissertation), 243. 2 The Yoruba dominance of social organizing in colonial Cuba and Brazil has been documented by authors such as Brandon, G. Santeria from Africa to the New World: The Dead Sell Memories: Indiana University Press, 1993. 206 Fadipe's 1930s research revealed that in Yorubaland, \"so strong is their [the clubs'] influence that, in some communities, slaves in the days of slavery organised themselves into convivial associations.\"3 The interests and goals of these associations ranged from munda ne to spiritual concerns, and covered a spectrum of areas, such as: peer groups , leisure, politics, professions and religions.4 Traditionally, these organizations were complete with elected officers, mutual aid efforts and membership charges. Yoruba peer group associations included women's societies and age grade groups . The author of a 1932 Intelligence report observed that \"egbes...are the basis of the machine...it is probably still true to say that every man belongs to some 'club.'\"5 This same report provides details of age grades and women's egbes or associations. One community was documented as having six female \"chiefs\", likely senior leaders of the groups . However, during this time women's leagues were know n to have strong leanings toward commercial interests.6 Both age grade and women's associations also could have strong compone nts of leisurely activities. Age grades ranged in difference of years across various towns of Yorubaland, and could mean groups within three years of similar age, but anywhere up to nine years age difference within a group. The duties assigned to these associations reflected collective efforts to carry out communal respons ibilities. Young persons, which could be any group not considered to be elders, were assigned tasks such as \"cleaning the quarters, carrying 3 Fadipe, The Sociology of the Yoruba, 243. 4 Peter Cutt Lloyd, Africa in Social Change: West African Societies in Transition (New York: Praeger, 1968), also discusses general connections among some of the varieties of Yoruba associations. 5 \"Ara District Intelligence Report\" 1932, Ekiti Division 2/12. 6 Fadipe, The Sociology of the Yoruba, 253. 207 water...making mud for the town wall, and upke ep of paths outside the town.\"7 Arresting criminals and royal respons ibilities could also form part of the tasks of an age grade association. Political and professional groups in Africa often had religious or spiritual compone nts to them. In Yorubaland these groups were clearly distinct in their particular purposes, and were not to be confused with religious associations. The Ogboni societies were probably the most well know n of the Yoruba political associations. The Ogboni had multidimensional functions, but primarily served as the advisors to the king of any given Yoruba district, as well as the protective agency of towns. They were sometimes know n to be the 'Counc il of Elders,' although not every member would be an \"elder.\" Chiefs, and other often prominent, members of society comprised many of the Ogbon i organizations. This co-ed organization was active in death rituals, especially for its members. Between 1922 and 1955 Ogboni societies' importance diminished as did that of Yoruba royal institutions.8 In the 1950s the \"Reformed Ogboni \" Organization, a Christian oriented initiative, grew in popu larity. Professional associations were not typically co-ed because many Yoruba occupations were historically gendered. For certain occupations, such as a trader or craft-person, one could not effectively operate without membership in an association. Exceptions to this rule were surgeons and certain artists who operated exclusively as family businesses.9 Farmers, blacksmiths, and hunters were customary types of careers 7 \"Ara District Intelligence Report\" 1932, Ekiti Division 2/12. 8 Fadipe, 248 and J. D. Y. Peel, Religious Encounter and the Making of the Yoruba, (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000). 9 Fadipe, The Sociology of the Yoruba, 254-255. 208 in which local professional associations flourished throughout Yorubaland. Hunter's guilds functioned as both professional and political organizations because hunters also served as guardians, patrol and policemen for their towns and villages. Many healers before and during this time were hunters. Several oral interviewees revealed \"my father was a hunter and he was a member of the hunters' association.\"10 In other words, many healer-hunters did not belong to any healing association, just the hunter's guilds: Big game hunters had the reputations of possessing very effective magical preparations...They were also credited with having the most terrible and dangerous magic for use against their enemies...Hence, in some commu nities, the hunters' guild was sometimes called upon by the authorities to supply oogun (harmful magic) [and helpful medicine] with which certain classes of offenders were punished. Also, persons who were accused of using oogun against others were handed over to the hunters to deal with.11 Therefore, the hunter's guilds were in part predecessors to incorporated Yoruba healing associations. Yoruba healers took their experience with hunter's guilds and applied that in forming the incorporated Yoruba healing associations, which expanded in number and after 1930. Additionally, hunters, and subsequently Yoruba healers took some of their operational cues from the modes of the religious associations. For instance, members from all three types of associations would meet every 17 days. While there is little explanation of why hunters and healers would meet on such a schedule, the religious associations had holy day calendars that called for gatherings on the 17th day. Religious associations were the other type of historical Yoruba egbe that influenced the healers' approaches to the forming of healing associations. Religious associations were quite active as there were many spiritual and communal functions they 10 Personal interview of Edun Ogundeji Osawemimo, April, 2008. 11 Fadipe, The Sociology of the Yoruba, 251. 209 were expected to serve. There were specific associations for specific divinities. While an individual may have been a member of more than one religious association because they were initiated to more than one divinity, divinities were not groupe d together within one association. Thus, baba lawos and olorisa had separate associations, sometimes leading to competition. On Yoruba Healing Associations Many of the herbalists associations have existed before modern medicine gained its present level of popularity...It is most probable therefore that the associations are manifestations of the tendency of the urban Yoruba to join clubs which represent their occupations or social functions in the commu nity, although the activities of these associations have, no doubt, been intensified in recent times in response to the aforementioned rapidly changing socio-economic and political climate in Nigeria as well as the increasing competition from scientific medicine.12 Though few healers associations documented or orally inferred existed before the 20th century, access, interest and even \"popul arity\" of western medicine in Yorubaland only began to occur post 1920s , thus complicating healers' incentives for joining associations. Archival documents demonstrate that incorporated Yoruba associations were consistently established in the 1930s , 1940s and 1950s. Additional insights of this trend are illustrated in the results of Oyebola's oral history questionna ires and interviews of 165 healers from 31 Yoruba towns. Oyebola did not have access to the archival records at the time he conduc ted research for his article in the 1970s . Table 7.a is a list of associations, in chronological order that existed prior to 1955\u2014as evidenced through the archival records examined for this project and Oyebola's research. 12 D. D. O.

Therefore, some dates are approximations and typically are noted here with question marks. Specified additions from Oyebola, \"Professional Associations, Ethics and Discipline among Yoruba Traditional Healers of Nigeria,\" 90. 211 There are at least three overlapping associations found in his research and the investigations done for this dissertation. There may be three to five more that might match Oyebola's and the research conduc ted for this study, but those assumptions are not made here. With almost a dozen associations added to Oyebola's research, what emerges here is a much fuller picture of the amount and type of Yoruba healing associations in the 1922-1955 period. There are several caveats to keep in mind when considering the amount of colonial Yoruba healing associations that existed. Firstly, a few of the recorded organizations that sought incorporation actually did not operate. Secondly, Oyebola's research notes that by the 1970s eleven of eighteen associations he found were still \"functioning\" and given that he only used oral information, it is possible a percentage of those that were \"defunct\" never existed. Thirdly, a small number of associations were operated by the same persons, thus were likely the same organizations. However, there is no evidence to sugge st that associations merged. Other organizations changed names, and this further obscures the records on the amount of associations in existence sequentially. Numerous informal 'egbe onisegun' or herbalist associations are referred to in colonial documents. Many organizations were very local, purely functional, and missing in official gove rnment corresponde nce. Thus they cannot be accounted for in many documents. These problems may nullify up to one-third of the organizations listed 14 Two of the three associations that are in both accounts (italics) have different dates of establishment. Oyebola's dates are years earlier, and thus the written record has been selected to date these organizations. Clearly, in this case the oral evidence allows for greater potential of inaccuracy or exaggeration. 212 in table 7.a. Furthermore, the table is undoubt edly incomplete and could possibly doubl e if local egbe onisegun were able to be calculated for the 1922-1955 period. In order to locate and illustrate the pre-colonial and colonial period associations, it is necessary to unde rstand the associations that functioned during this colonial period. The majority of documented healers associations arose post-1930. A few of these organizations had branches in several locations throughout Yorubaland. The associations with branches maintained active corresponde nce with the gove rnment and reported large memberships of often a hundr ed persons or more. Localized associations often had small memberships averaging maybe a dozen healers. By the mid-1960s , there were at least 25 different associations operating in Ibadan alone15, thus there was a continued rise in establishment of healers associations throughout colonial and even post-independence eras. The myriad of situations that may have fostered this increase in professional associations in Yorubaland involves social, political, econom ic and religious circumstances. The idea that there is a higher likelihood that healers associations grew out of Yoruba organizational tendencies as oppos ed to the competition from western medical healthcare propone nts16 is convincing, but partial. Certainly, there were egbe onisegun, local healing associations in operation, for instance a 1927 colonial report recorded \"Native Doctors, like members of most other native traders or professions belong to unions.\"17 However, this reference is prone to concern the associations of priests as well, 15 Oyebola, \"Professional Associations, Ethics and Discipline among Yoruba Traditional Healers of Nigeria,\" 100 (Maclean's 26 20629. 213 therefore not reliable evidence to the frequency with which healers had their own associations in the 1920s . More broadly speaking it is fair to say that there was a combination of stimuli for Yoruba healers to form and join associations in this period, and motivations did come in part, from western medical prodding. A colonial administrator in 1931 discusses that there are \"several societies of Native Doctors in Lagos,\" and importantly, he adds: About 20 years ago, a scheme was formed by Dr. Sapara for the registration of Native Doctors. It appears that the register was drawn up and that the names were actually recorded by the Commissioner of Police... The object of this registration was partly to protect the public from the depredations of charlatans and also to obtain information on matters of interest to the Medical profession. I understand that considerable interesting information has been obtained with regard to herbs and roots by keeping in touch with Native Doctors.18 Dr. Sapara was a foundi ng member of Egbe Aiyegunle/the African Counc il of Herbal Physicians association as indicated in the incorporation papers.19 This illustrates that this western medical doctor did play a role in encouraging the formation of the types of healing associations that proliferated in the 1922-1955 period. Additionally, the increase of western medical doctors and hospitals during this period certainly contributed to healers' desires to formally organize. Colonial laws and administrative activities, as well as indigenous religious perspectives also motivated healers to formalize the structures of their organizations. 18 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. Dr. Sarapa is the Yoruba western medical doctor who worked on the small pox issue mentioned in chapters 2 and 4. 19 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 214 Organizational Structure of Healing Associations The Yoruba healing associations as documented in this 1922-1955 period described themselves quite professionally and legalistically. There is no doubt incorporation papers were generated with the aid of lawyers. Many associations had similar structures to that of the 'The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria,' a society which declared itself unde r a couple of different names prior to and during this period, most notably 'The Native Herbalist Guild of Nigeria.' This organization is the oldest documented one, recording in the 1933 articles of association papers that they were actually established by a man named Abetipa in 1855. New presidents followed Abetipa in 1877, 1902, 1916, and 1933 . In these articles they address objectives, admission policies, meetings, arrangement of officers, contribution expectations, codes of conduc t, as well as the names and addresses of certain members.20 As with most healing associations they did not train healers, however, they did have exams for applicants and membership fees that needed to be paid.21 They met \"every seventeenth day\" and claimed to punish members if they failed to pay dues, or exhibited poor behavior. This association's regional expanse was broad and included branches and members outside of Lagos. Other Yoruba territories they operated in included the areas of the Ijesa, Ijebu, Egba,Yaba, Egun, Ketu, Ikorodu. The certificates awarded to the healers upon membership to the group were quite an appealing factor to healers. Certificates added proof of 'legitimacy' to other healers, 20 \"The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria\" CSO 26 J/1 Z/1c. 21 Membership fees will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 215 the public and the colonial gove rnment. 1931 colonial communication states that there were several societies of Native Doctors in Lagos...It appears however, that all families in Lagos employ a Native Doctor and there is considerable competition. The Native Doctor, however, equipped with the certificate of a recognized Society is able to hold his own...[Fu rthermore] There are several different Societies of Native Doctors among Pagans, Mohammedans and Christians. These societies issue certificates to members who have qualified as Native Doctors.22 This communication emphasized the advantage healers held by possessing one or more certificates. Some healers had certificates from multiple associations.23 An association certificate is pictured below in figure 7.1: 24 22 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 23 George E. Simpson, Yoruba Religion and Medicine in Ibadan (Ibadan, Nigeria: Ibadan University Press, 1980), 94 this healer gained these certificates in the early and mid 1950s. 24 \"The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria\" CSO 26 J/1 Z/1c. Figure 7.1. 216 This early association's papers demonstrated that the organization had a level of sophistication that was unus ual for the time. This guild may have been a model or template for the formation of subsequent organizations. The 'Nigerian Association of Medical Herbalist' exhibited an equal level of cleverness in the structure of its organization. However, this association appears to have achieved a greater level of success in recruiting members and gaining public recognition. By 1947, when they were established, fresh ideas were being considered which addressed the shifting social and political circumstances. As was the case with products, services and commercial pursuits of all kinds, 'new and improved' versions of associations were likely to arise. 25 25 \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657. Figure 7.2. 217 The 'Nigerian Association of Medical Herbalist,' like other associations, could not form as a trade union but could form as a corporate entity, legally. \"The Companies Ordinance of 1922\" provided some inspiration for the type of 'articles of association' these guilds submitted. Figure 7.2 illustrates that the colonial gove rnment licensing offered to the associations, and therefore the healers, an additional method of gaining status and prominence. Because of the oppo rtunity to license associations, many healers that operated from 1922 to 1955 mistakenly deduced that they could apply to operate as a licensed healer or medicine 'dealer'. The archival records are filled with scores of requests from healers attempting to apply for personal licenses. There was no such option offered by the colonial gove rnment, as the system of indirect rule claimed not to concern itself intricately with the affairs of the \"natives.\" After repeated rejection healers became aware by the 1940s that such requests were actually more appeals to the gove rnment to establish a personal licensing initiative that some figured would provide greater creditability than an association certificate. Nonetheless, there was hope from both healers and colonialists that the associations would tackle matters of verifying, legitimating and/or simply recording the affairs of healers. Healing Ethics The associations greatly emphasized the ethical standards that characterized reputable healers. Since the organizational structure of these associations was democratic and officers were elected, the most famous and well-respected healers usually became the 218 officers.26 Therefore, they brought their wisdom and experience to the organization. The numerous rules that associations expressed typically had sections for the purpose of ensuring particular ethical standards were met among their memberships; they even sought to control healers that were not members. The incorporation documents and other forms of corresponde nce reiterate that there were three overarching areas of concern: quacks, evil and/or immoral medicine, and finances. Associations sought to deal with the issue of quacks both explicitly and subtly. The \"Lagos Doctors' Society of Shangode yi's House\" states as their first rule that: \"Any person who is not a member of this Doctors Society must not practice as a [indigenous ] doctor, if he does he will be handed over to the Government to be punished.\"27 Though this association had no authority to do such, or had recourse if they tried, this was not the only case of a healing group seeking to implement such a rule. The Otta Cumi Pele Herbalist Society petitioned the gove rnment in 1936 to investigate \"uncertificated [sic] people...[who] do not know anything about how to cure people from sickness.\"28 Similar overtures continued throughout this period as exemplified with the 1949 corresponde nce from the 'Nigeria Herbalist Society' asking the district officer if they could send around an inspector to make sure people were properly practicing Yoruba healing.29 They expressed that they did not want any damaging incidents to occur again referring to an 26 Oyebola, \"Professional Associations, Ethics and Discipline among Yoruba Traditional Healers of Nigeria,\" 103. 27 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 28 \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District Association, Ijebu Branch\" 1951-1955, Ijebu Provincial office 1/4006. 219 herbalist in Ilesha whose ignorance could have ruined their reputations.30 'The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria' also sought to take action against \"unqua lified\" healers. Meanwhile, the 'Nigerian Association of Medical Herbalists' also sent the colonial gove rnment requests to prohibit quacks from practicing, however their incorporation papers provided more implicit ways of marginalizing healers. This organization not only offered certificates, but specifically propos ed \"Proficiency Certificates\" with four grade levels: fellowship, associate, members and diploma. They did not detail the descriptions and requirements of each level, but noted that these certificates were merit based, determined through tests and involve the payment of a fee.31 Corresponde nces from healers indicate that testing among healers was carried out, usually via a voluntary basis. Oral histories indicate that some associations \"tests\" increasingly sought to replace the 'contests' that some healers and even oloogun (those who practiced mysterious medicine,) implemented. Most healers interviewed echoed Chief Odua's observation that \"there are battles in the traditional healing job...I f one is not humble, one can be killed easily.\"32 Mr. Adeboje plainly recalls that: The problem the herbalist have, is that if you are working like this some people will be cursing you, some herbalist, will be cursing you not to succeed . In this house I have recei ved so many tests..You see, when you are practicing herbal something you are exposed to temptations. Your counterparts will be testing your power. 'Do you say you are very good?'...If you say you have power, they can go there in the night and carry 30 Ibid. 31 \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657. 32 Personal interview of Chief Erelu (Onisegun Awo) Odua, April, 2008. 220 [away] all your power. [They] will come this morning and say 'We are aware of your power, and we have carried them'...So there are a lot of temptations from the rivals.33 The unanimous movement against quacks was undertaken in this period for several reasons. The most cited motivation was the desire to abolish the charlatans' activities that ruined healers' reputations. Reputations obviously were the most legitimate forms of \"certification\" that healers had. Nonetheless, another reason less discussed, was the increase in immigrant popul ations between 1922 and 1955 that obscured people's ability to determine how credible a healer actually was. Lastly, the drive against quackery also grew out of a desire for harmony and stability in operating one's business against police harassment, which occurred seldom and healers wanted it to stay that way. Since healers were sought out to suppor t and ease life, part of their duties were to fight evil and immoral aspects of life. It was commonly unde rstood that association members were not to engage in promoting evil medicine, and many associations overtly stated such. The issue of morality was one that easily overlapped with evil, however it was clearly distinct. The rules of numerous associations and the results of Oyebola's research illustrate that there were frequently listed types of immorality that healers were to avoid.34 The recurrently stated immoral activities included being intimate with female clients, conduc ting abortions, seducing a colleague's wife, and using \"atidiki\" or an herbalist using his penis to insert medicine. It is no shock that these moral laws among healers greatly concerned women and/or male-female relationships, given the great value Yoruba placed on family. 33 Personal interview of Olusegun Adeboje, August, 2001. 34 Examples found in \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657 among other archival files and Oyebola, 91. 221 In the 1922-1955 period econom ic factors affected healers and patients. The growth and recessions of globally oriented currency of this period most certainly impacted healers and how they did business. Yet, the offences that healers prohibited were not primarily created via the new capitalistic social environment, and certainly many of these violations preceded the colonial era. Healers' associations sought to avoid debt, for instance, and some associations clearly stated members were on rare occasion expected to make up for liabilities. The 1947 Nigeria Association of Medical Herbalists papers notes \"cost, charges and expenses\" for debts \"may be required not to exceed L25,\" and the 1951 papers of the African Counc il of Herbal Physicians for the same issue states the \"amount as may be required not exceeding Ten Pounds .\"35 Falola and Adebayo argue that Yoruba ideals of money did change in the colonial era, yet many pre-colonial philosophies remained. Concepts among the Yoruba historically include the following: money is important, \"money should be acquired in an hone st, 'clean way,'\" 36 and having good character is better than money. Healing associations repeatedly mentioned that it was unethical to commit fraud and to steal. Stealing not only meant taking money deceptively, but also taking another's clients. The ideas on fraud consist of misrepresentation of skills or medicinal efficacy, taking payment with false pretences, and intimidating clients, such as only partly rendering services, or threatening a life. Additionally, there was a consensus among many healers that \"hawking\" or aggressively soliciting business (for instance on the street) was 35 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 36 Toyin Falola and A. G. Adebayo, Culture, Politics, & Money among the Yoruba (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2000), 53-60. 222 unprofessional.37 Hawking/hard solicitation was not a form of fraud, per se, but some considered it intimidation and manipulation, because clients should not be coerced into patronizing a business. Having had ethics in healing certainly helped the associations promote their social agendas. Social Agendas of Healing Associations The associations embodied healers' desires to protect and enhance their reputations. However, associations' social agenda was expressed in a variety of complex ways. Furthermore, as Oyebola and his reviewers point out, healers conve yed clear political aims in the purposes of their organizations.38 These associations were not considered 'trade unions' by the colonial administration and cannot be considered as such, although a minority of healers intended that the associations would operate this way. While comparisons to trade unions have been made, this assessment only characterizes these associations minimally. The one relationship between trade unions and healers associations was the lobbyi ng efforts. Trade unions none theless were for those that were employees yet full-time healers were entrepreneurs. As Walker deducts: Entrepreneurial success for the creative capitalist requires the ability to organize business ventures in a rational manner, so that opportunity can be grasped and risks minimized...Innovation, risk taking, and the ability to sense the wants of the consumer, [is] the business acumen traditionally associated with entrepreneurial endeavors.39 Healers were non-profit and for-profit businesspersons in this colonial environment. 37 See \"The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria\" CSO 26 J/1 Z/1c; and Oyebola, \"Professional Associations, Ethics and Discipline among Yoruba Traditional Healers of Nigeria,\" 92. 38 Oyebola, \"Professional Associations, Ethics and Discipline among Yoruba Traditional Healers of Nigeria,\" 91. 39 J. E. K. Walker, \"Racism, Slavery, and Free Enterprise: Black Entrepreneurship in the United States before the Civil War,\" Business History Review 60, no. 3 (1986), 371-72. 223 In the 1920s and 30s it was common that healers had other part-time jobs. Many healers even had the charitable goal to help humanity as their predecessors did. Mr. Adeboje was sworn to keep the legacy of healing altruistically, even during the steep increase of capitalism in colonial Yoruba society. However, he notes other benefits of not taking money for healing work. I want that [my] name to be magnified. So, I give you something without asking for anything...You see there was an incident, when my father was alive, they told me to prepare an herb for a woman who was looking for [to have] children...I prepare it. The woman conceived, the woman born [the child]. On the day of naming, the husband of the woman, his friends, they were jubilating, using talking drums, passing through my father's house [property], my father hears the talking drum, what they were saying; then they went back...My father said I should call the woman. I helped the woman...but they never came back...but the father warned me, 'You are the one who helped this woman.' And the name of this person [the child] is also my name...they named [the child] 'but, don't talk about them,' the father [said]...because if you talk about them things will be bad.40 In this case, the compensation for his service was a child being named after him. This meant that his name would be carried on beyond his death and beyond his own family. Mr. Adeboje also declares that in this colonial period another benefit of practicing part-time was that one was not motivated to join an association. When you say you want to be in full practice, there are regulations. As of now, I am in part-time practice. If I want to practice fully, I must join the herbalist [association]. I will be meeting with them. But, I don't want to. It is the age, formally, I was thinking about my age. But now, even if I am 60, I don't want join them, because I don't want to make anything [money] off of it. I want to use it for humanitarian [purposes].41 Association fees were a common feature of the registered organizations, for numerous reasons including taxes, publicity and to initiate projects. The African Counc il of Herbal Physicians, by 1951 required that: 40 Personal interview of Olusegun Adeboje, August, 2001. 41 Ibid. 224 Every person shall, on admission as a member pay the Council the sum of L2.2/- and be liable to pay a sum of 1/- monthly or 12/- annually payable in advance, with the exception of those already enrolled in the \"Ebge Aiyegunle\" who shall only be called upon to pay L1.1/-.42 Charging fees indicates that there was assistance needed in the functioning of organizations. Increasingly in the 1922-1955 period healers considered fees for services part of the way to reinforce the objectives of the associations. Also, this requirement indicates that healers by this point were paid for their services and operating on full-time basis more often. Falola and Adebayo observe that: Traditional healers and herbalists also deman d money for their services. Sometimes they charge much more than they actually spent in preparing the medicine. Many of those interviewed explained that they do this in order that the charm (oogun) might appear to have value, because oogun ti a o f'owo se, ehin aaro ni gbe, meaning that a charm for which one has not paid good money is not highly valued. Thus, money plays a major role in the entire process of consultation, examination and the treatment.43 By the 1940s and 1950s , healers increasingly practiced Yoruba medicine exclusively. This recognition helps to clarify the common pursuits these organizations unde rtook. Most of the evidence sugge sts that the associations had similar purposes, with the 'Nigerian Association of Medical Herbalist' best articulating the panorama of aims. The figure 7.3 from the 'Nigerian Association of Medical Herbalist' articles of incorporation is thorough and an excellent point of departure in comprehending the objectives of most healing associations.44 This organization, established in 1947, reflected early and later goals advoc ated by other associations. Categorically, Yoruba healing associations sought to be networking, lobbying, legitimatizing, marketing and 42 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 43 Falola and Adebayo, Culture, Politics, & Money among the Yoruba, 57. 44 \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657. Figure 7.3. 225 competitive-advantaging organizations. These social agendas also traversed the terrain of political and econom ic agendas. Networking among Yoruba healers was for the purpose of having referral options, know ledge exchange, dispelling and endorsing rumors, socializing and, at times, engaging in collaborative projects. Even the earliest organization, \"The Native Herbalists Guild of Lagos\" states in their 1933 rules that: 226 This Society is formed for the purpose of (a) natural aid and protection among Native herbalists, Adaunses or Oniseguns and those who practise [sic] the native system of Therapeutics in Nigeria so that facilities may be given for assisting one another in the practice of the art of healing as may come within the scope of their calling...[and] encouraging the friends of such patients to consult Registered Medical Practitioners [western medical doctors] whenever necessity demands.45 Healers increasingly specialized, and even healers in the 1920s , who were more likely to be generalists, had gaps in their know ledge base. Reputable healers only attempted to cure issues that they were sure they'd have success with. Chief Aragberin stated, \"If I can't do any job all alone I will need to call on them [association members] for their assistance. And this is the major reason for the establishment of this association.\"46 Concern and desires of well-being ideally overrode egotistical determinations that might allow a patient to suffer, and thus healers would call in the assistance of, or refer patients to another healer who may have more expertise in the problem or better chances of success for one reason or another, as stated above , they'd even refer patients to western medical doctors. At the same time, it is clear that healers were aware of ambiguous colonial laws that provided very little protection for any mistakes made within indigenous therapeutics, and colonial laws were biased toward the western medical profession. Having \"suitable means of imparting and improving the medical and health know ledge of its members with a view to raising the standard of the practices\" as is stated in figure 7.3 was a tricky area for healers to engage. There were benefits of exchanging information. In these associations certain healers became friends, and thus would share healing ways. Additionally, healers needed to have a trusted medicinal expert that could 45 \"The First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria\" CSO 26 J/1 46 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin Edun Adebiyi Omoyebi, April, 2008. 227 restore their health, in case the healers themselves got sick.47 In the association meetings, healers would also freely discuss the most common and well-know n remedies and methods since most people were expected to already possess such information. On the other hand, the element of competition and the practice of exercising secrecy undoubt edly limited the quality and quantity of knowledge that was actually exchanged through associations. In-depth know ledge had to be sought through direct mentorship. Creating collaborative projects was at times necessary because some healing rites required multiple hands with expertise. The secrecy needed to produc e and/or apply certain medicines was often maintained through the healer and his or her apprentices. Nevertheless, even trainees were not permitted to participate in every aspect of healing special cases because they were not considered to be ready enough to acquire full and complete recipes. There were cases in which an apprentice was not allowed to help; yet the healer needed more than one mind or two hands. In these instances, healers would request the help of a competent colleague with equal to or greater in status or know ledge than they. Many healers tried as much as possible to handle their cases without the aid of peers. For instance, Chief Olojede stated \"pregnancy delivery is not what can be done with a group of colleagues or another colleague.\"48 The lobbyi ng agenda that the associations maintained was comprised of three main ideas: 1. Healers of any particular association should serve as excellent advisors to the gove rnment in any matter related to healing; 2. Associations were the proper agents who should create, regulate and enforce laws concerning healing issues; and 3. Healers 47 Una Maclean, Magical Medicine: A Nigerian Case-Study (London: Allen Lane, 1971), 86. 48 Personal interview of Chief Fatai Olojede, April, 2008. 228 should gain greater recognition and be fully documented as legitimate healthcare providers. These politically oriented agendas blossomed during the colonial decades. In the 1920s and 1930s these objectives were more general notions, but by the 1940s they became clear doctrines. The presence of new academic institutions seeking research on indigenous healing also prompted healers to work with the colonial regime. Associations were often the portal for political and academic access to healers. The objective \"to co-operate with the Government of Nigeria through its Medical and Health Services in all essential order and legislation...[ and to] seek and devise competent means of offering its advices, services and comments to the Government on all such matters concerning the health and welfare of the public of Nigeria,\" as noted in figure 7.3, was an effort broadly pursued. Initially, the gove rnment called on healers to occasionally consult in court cases and to help curb disease. These requests motivated healers to seek official, not just casual couns eling roles. By 1955 , some healers had achieved this status, for instance internal colonial corresponde nce substantiated that a locally well know n father-son duo sir-named Fawole had \"been called in to assist the Lagos Mainland Police in cases where native medicines and juju charms are concerned, and he has been paid for his services either by the Police or the Courts.\"49 Healing associations placed themselves in a precarious situation by consistently seeking gove rnment recognition, help, regulation and enforcement of laws pertaining to healing issues. Quackery was the main pursuit healers sought to outlaw. In retrospect, the associations were fortunate that the colonial government rarely involved itself in the 49 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 229 affairs of healers. Although control and regulation of members and non-member healers was difficult for the associations to achieve, if the gove rnment had been more active in the jurisdiction of healing matters, likely, healers' freedoms and creativity would have been greatly curtailed. In fact, the \"Ibadan Native Herbalist Co-Operative Society,\" in a 1940 letter stated that from the indigenous gove rnment and other associations \"we don't see any improvement but oppression.\"50 However, ironically, using the colonial gove rnment to provide an avenue for self-determination was a consistent pursuit with various political, econom ic, cultural and social movements in Nigeria. The colonial gove rnment was motivated in part by their policy of indirect rule when they recognized healers' associations, for colonial administrators had little to no policies to document or otherwise verify individual healers. Indirectly, the associations would ideally do that. Figure 7.3 illustrates that associations were fully conscious of healers' desires for recognition, noting a main purpose of the association(s) was \"to promote, protect and safeguard the political, economic and social interests of all member herbalists throughout Nigeria and to co-operate with all or any such association or society in other places to do so.\" Associations reiterated this point by declaring they intended \"to do all such other things as may be considered likely to advance the privileges, right and interests of its members and herbalists generally throughou t Nigeria.\" As discussed earlier, the healers' applications for personal licenses reveal healers' great interest in gove rnment recognition as another form of legitimization. The petitions were brief and straight to the point, with 50 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 230 healers providing their basic contact information and request for a license. But the volume of petitions reflects the numerous attempts to gain any form of additional accreditation possible. This drive for credibility also led many associations to establish an air of international interaction. For instance, in 1937 the First Native Herbalist Society of Nigeria requested an official British gove rnment certificate so that Yoruba healers would have extra certification when traveling abroad. Additionally, by the 1950s healers were attending healing conferences outside of Yorubaland. Because many healers also were entrepreneurs, it is not surprising that healing associations pursued marketing strategies. For instance, healers sought to brand themselves, and some created insignias and logos as is displayed in figure 7.4. Figure 7.4.51 Additionally, as figure 7.3 declares, most associations sought \"to adopt such reasonable means of propaganda or publicity calculated directly or indirectly to advance the interests of Herbalist, e.g. by obtaining, collecting and disseminating news or by establishing a 51 \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657. Figure 7.4. 231 bureaux [sic] of information.\" Records indicate the healers did obtain positive presence in newspapers and on the radio. There were numerous attempts by healers to establish hospitals during this era. Since the law called for a western medical doctor on the staff of hospitals, those attempts by healers to form hospitals failed. The 1950s colonial Ministry of Social Services stated, \"All hospitals and maternity centres must be registered unde r the Private Hospitals Ordinances. Registration may be withheld if the institution is not unde r the management, control and supervision of a medical practitioner.\"52 Healers subsequently sought to establish \"herbal healing homes\" instead.53 Healing association members also made efforts to have research unde rtaken on healing ways. This included independent and collaborative research projects with gove rnment or educational institutions. In 1954 the Nigerian Herbalist Association, Ijebu Branch stated they owned a hous e in Lagos for \"research.\"54 The same organization depicted in figure 7.4, 'The African Counc il of Herbal Physicians' was intimately aware of the competition that the western medical establishment and academia posed, especially since one of the founde rs, Dr. Sapara was a western medical practitioner. A.L. Fawole, the son of Chief Fawole was a healer with some training in western medicine resulting from a distance learning doctoral degree from London.55 'The African Counc il of Herbal Physicians' specified that they sought : To establish Herbal Hospitals for the treatment of very serious cases entrusted to individual memb ers of the Association or the Association itself; To found an Herbal 52 \"Native Doctors, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 53 Herbalist Ijebu 1951-1955, Medicinemen & Herbalists: General Papers,\" MH 32 vol. II. 232 Institute for imparting knowledge in the art and science of Herbal treatment...[and] To establish an Herbal Research Laboratory.56 Very few, if any, associations or independent healers were able to actualize these desires to establish Yoruba medicine hospitals or research centers during this 1922-1955 period. However, associations' attempts to articulate a philosophy, and to establish such institutions is worthy of consideration. These efforts reflected the desire to attract and service a greater number of patients, as well as compete with missionaries, western medical professionals and intellectuals. Healers by the 1940s and 50s had a better realization that the colonial gove rnments would not help them in these types of endeavors, as they did with western colonial and missionary medical and academic initiatives. At the same time, numerous healers and associations never intended to acquire gove rnment help in these pursuits, but just wanted to offer the most innova tive services possible. The aspiration to conduc t research also was part of the healers' associations ever evolving enterprise to find ways to substantiate and legitimate themselves and their work. Disputes Colonial documents sugge st that controversies within associations, as well as between organizations, non-members and indigenous gove rnments were isolated cases. Although the associations did not appear to present disputes they had with the colonial regime, there must have been undoc umented or destroyed records of the troubles they had with the colonial gove rnment. It has already been expressed that the level of personal interaction between the healers and the colonial governments was quite minimal. All of 56 Ibid. 233 the oral interviewees for this project knew of no healer-gove rnment interfacings, further sugge sting the distance between the two institutions. Ironically, the missionary records also indicate that while missionary western medical practitioners had a high disdain for healers, once again, there were rarely cases of interaction or conflicts in need of resolution. The value of examining disputes in the records is to indicate that associations did meet and operate on some general level, as oppos ed to the incorrect presumptions certain scholars of Yoruba healing have made.57 The reason why most scholars besides Oyebola, Simpson, Maclean, (and Osunwole to a lesser extent) would minimize the importance of healing associations and argue that the associations were skeletal and non-functioning, is the lack of access that outsiders were likely to have been afforded to these meetings. Anyone who was not a healer was not allowed to attend a meeting. Furthermore, healers had a vested interest not to introduc e non-healers to their broader networks, in order to monopol ize business. It was natural that disputes within these associations arose. In 1953 Paul Aina the General Secretary for the 'Nigerian Association of Medical Herbalist' in Ijebu-Ode had been suspended. He was notified in a letter explaining why he was suspended. The numerous reasons included not calling meetings, not entertaining executive members, not appearing at meetings, trying to regionalize the association although the executive board didn't want that, calling \"an unconstitutional assembly\" and instituting fees without 57 Mary Olufunmilayo Adekson, The Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Traditional Healers of Nigeria (New York: Routledge, 2003) and Anthony D. Buckley, Yoruba Medicine (Oxford, New York: Clarendon Press; Oxford University Press, 1985) are examples of scholars who minimize the importance of associations. 234 permission.58 This long list of infractions generates curiosity as to how it was that one year later Aina was reinstated. The association implemented forgiveness and Aina must have repented to obtain this forgiveness. In examining the reasons for this suspension it becomes clear that the organization sought to operate with integrity and needed a way to enforce this. Making an example of a prominent member was one of the most impactful ways to send message to the membership and the government since this dispute was documented to the colonial resident administrator. They sought to express that the association ran with honor and some degree of efficiency. There was manipulation between associations and healers to coerce non-members to become members of organizations. Six healers from Illa went to Lagos in 1931 to get certificates because they were directed to do so from another healer who had already done this. That man had \"informed them that unless they became members claims for services rendered would not be heard by the Native Courts,\"59 which was not true. In another corresponde nce the 'Otta Cumi Pele Herbalist Society' accused a non-member 'uncertified' healer of killing a local citizen and requested that the medical officer investigate this death.60 This accusation was not proven to be the case, and it is likely that the association would not have made such an indictment if the healer was one of their members. It is important to recognize that healers of all kinds, at times, opted out of associations for a wide variety of reasons. Some Yoruba healers consciously decided to 58 \"Nigerian Herbalist Association, Ijebu Branch\" 1951-1955, Ijebu Provincial office 1/4006.. 59 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 60 \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657. 235 decline membership in associations for rationales and incentives such as individualism, arrogance, competence, incompetence, age, secretiveness, avoiding fees, assessments that associations only serve the leaders, gove rnment links and other special interests that made associations unappealing.61 For these reasons, healers saw weaknesses and disadvantages of organizations. Certainly the aims, objectives, and requirements of the associations diminished healers' autonom y. Furthermore, if the members did not have the quality of skills particular healers had, it is probable that non-members avoided binding themselves with healers of lesser proficiency and/or those with low-grade reputations. On the other hand, healers with very rudimentary know ledge knew that their incompetence would become expos ed in the company of experienced association members. Because fees were requested, healers wanted organizations to be valuable in exchange. Joining these organizations was not always a valuable investment, for reasons stated earlier, as well as the selfishness or dictatorial potential of the leadership. The intentional links that associations sought with the government was also unattractive to certain healers because they distrusted and abhorred the modes of operation of the colonialists. Religious difference also played a role in the formation and composition of healing associations' membership. The general associations discussed here tended to be secular, although their membership may have had predominated religious tendencies. It was common that olorisa healers were not members of healing associations62 because 61 Oyebola, \"Professional Associations, Ethics and Discipline among Yoruba Traditional Healers of Nigeria,\" H.K. Heggenhougen's discussion. 62 Oyebola, \"Professional Associations, Ethics and Discipline among Yoruba Traditional Healers of Nigeria,\" 103. 236 they had their own religious associations, in part. One 1935 colonial report noted \"Some are native doctors (Onisegun) as well as Ifa priests but it is usual to find that the doctors conduc t their business separately and have their own separate club.\"63 Additionally, most associations addressed here were male-centric, while most Yoruba religious associations had male and female members (with the exception of Ifa). Maclean cites that \"One [babal awo] declared that if a healer's skills were sufficient they would soon become know n without any necessity for public advertisements or special pressure to attract people to him.\"64 This commentary was not explicitly religiously oriented, however, the fact that the babalawo was most likely a member of their own Ifa religious association, factors in. One difference in approach between the healing guilds and religious associations was that religious associations were not organized with a primary purpose of promotion, like the healing organizations were. It is also pertinent to keep in mind that many healing associations formed to create competitive advantages over western medical practitioners, as well as a level of reputation on par with babal awos and some olorisa. Associations found themselves having troubled relationships with indigenous rulers, on occasion, during this period. They were negotiating a difficult terrain of having to maintain their identities between two gove rnments\u2014colonial and indigenous . In some cases the healers associations simply did not have suppor t from the indigenous rulers, in other cases the rulers sought to seize control of the organizations. In the first case, the 63 \"Intelligence Report on Ado District, Ekiti Division Ondo Province\" 1935 CSO 26 29734. 64 Oyebola, \"Professional Associations, Ethics and Discipline among Yoruba Traditional Healers of Nigeria,\" 100, Maclean's discussion. 237 'Ilupeju Society' in 1934 discusses that they had operated harmoniously for years with the approval of the king, or the Alake in this case. However, when they requested his suppor t to go to from Abeokuta to Lagos to renew their certification, he initially avoided them, and then he denied them permission. The king expressed to them that the law stated they can only become certified in their own regions\u2014which was a misinterpretation of the law, (misunde rstanding of the law was common). The king's second secret reason, which he only stated to the colonialists, was that \"the majority of them are not competent but only native quack doctors.\"65 This assessment may have been true, or it may have false, or both, given that a few associations were composed of inferior quality healers. However, the king likely had unstated biases that would lead to his opinion. First, kings were advised by a particular group of Yoruba religious leader, who may have been a healer also, namely a babal awo (priest of Ifa) and at times the olorisa representing the patron divinity of that town. With religious pluralism growing during this era, it could also be the case that the king carried out centuries old traditions, while maintaining personal beliefs in Christianity or Islam. For this reason, or because of an affiliation with western medical practitioners, the king may have absolutely rejected Yoruba healing as an institution. In the second case, the Ibadan Native Herbalist Co-Operative Society wrote the colonialist gove rnment for help in 1940 , because the king, or Olubadan in this case, \"privately choose\" his \"in-law\" to be the president of their organization when in fact there was another elected president that the association had chosen. They noted that \"the 65 \"Native Herbalist Correspondence\" 1934-1953, Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657. 238 appointment of Adelu Oluawo by Olubadan to dominate us is entirely contrary to the Traditional Law and Custom of our Native Professional-Work.\"66 They argued that the king was confusing the work of healers with the style of operation of royal Yoruba religious leaders. Just because this in-law was a Yoruba priest and was part of the royal family did not mean that he should automatically assume the position of leading the local healers' society. This type of recourse reflects ways that the colonialists provided citizens with options to change \"tradition\", in theory or reality. Such options were scarce in the monarchical era. The latter point is not to sugge st that colonization was more beneficial for Yoruba citizens than not. This same case in Ibadan was complicated by a dispute over who should pay taxes, the associations or the king. Colonial taxes created conflicts and hardships that transformed Yoruba healers' ways of thinking and acting. This issue of taxes was confusing to numerous healers associations. As Falola and Adebayo note, during the colonial era \"Government money was owo olowo \"other people's money\" that had been placed at their disposal to do with as they pleased. Moreover, gove rnment money was for the people, and could be used by the people.\"67 Healers considered themselves to be part of \"the people.\" As a result, this association conve yed the view that the king's role as protector of indigenous culture obligated him to offer associations some financial aid. 66 \"Native Herbal Medicine Dealers, Practice and Sale of Herbal Preparations by in re:\" 1921-1931, Oyo Provincial Papers, volume 1, file 105. 67 Falola and Adebayo, Culture, Politics, & Money among the Yoruba, 72. 239 Conclusion Yoruba healing associations arose out of Yoruba religious and hunting associations. In the 1920s Yoruba healing associations, incorporated through the colonial gove rnment. came into existence. The steady rise in the number of healing associations in the 1930s , 40s and 50s demonstrated shifts in the state of Yoruba healing. There were several motivating factors for the establishment of incorporated healing associations, such as culture, political changes and the presence of western medicine. Individual healers and the associations lobbied the colonial government on a number of issues, such as licensing and regulation of \"quacks.\" In the late 1940s and the 1950s, associations sough t for healers to have greater involvement in legislative and academic/scientific initiatives. Additionally, healers were operating as full-time practitioners and specialized more often. The healing associations presented perfect examples of how and why Yoruba healing was resilient, as the associations aided in continued public confidence in Yoruba healing. Finally, through political savvy, medical awareness, religious tolerance, contesting evil and allied associations the Yoruba healing system was fortified for resiliency between 1922-1955 in the face of professional, social, political, religious and cultural adversities. 240 Conclusion The resiliency of Yoruba healing between 1922 and 1955 involved the steadfast preservation of a cultural system, as well as adaptations to this system that allowed it to remain successful and preferable into the present day. By 1955 , British colonialism in Nigeria was nearly over, and independence was achieved five years later. Independence positively impacted Yoruba cultural practices, such as healing. Independent Nigerian gove rnments differed from that of the colonialists because they, for instance promoted serious research studies on Yoruba healing. This dissertation has drawn on research conduc ted at Nigerian Universities since the 1960s and 1970s , such as works by Dopamu and Oyebola. Even institutions such as the Nigerian National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD) participated in the post-independence verification of the efficacy of Yoruba healing. An example of NIPRD work is illustrated in their approved of three indigenous medicines: doprovil, cornavil and niprisan. In Ogunya le, a Yoruba healer, get his remedy for a sickle cell anemia\u2014now know n as niprisan\u2014patented in 46 countries, including the United States.1 During his interview Mr. Adeboje displayed his patented medicine for convul sions. There have been several transformations in Yoruba healing in the last half century. For example, the concept of non-related apprentices is quite common among Yoruba healers today, although their predecessors previously kept it in the family. The capitalistic socio-econom ic structure has compelled healers to ensure that the institution 1 Shingu Gamaniel \"Evaluation of Traditional Medicine for the Management of Sickle Cell Anemia in Nigeria\" African Health Monitor, 27. 241 remains, even in cases where family members are disinterested in perpetuating the craft. Chief Olojede states \"I have taught two people who graduated from me, and three people are unde r me training to become traditional healers...one needs the assistance of somebody, so I started having trainees as soon as I started practicing.\"2 Mrs. Oyebisi notes \"I have trained 13 people and four of them are now in this same market doing good in their independent businesses. Some others are in their husbands hous es selling herbs.\"3 Yoruba healers have increasingly interacted with western medical doctors in the last few decades. Chief Aragberin states that western medical doctors \"usually come for our coope ration on healing jobs. Like when they need us to assist them in delivering a pregnant woman, and we will give them medicines and it works for them.\"4 Conve rsely, Mrs. Oyebisi notes \"foreign medical doctors always come to discuss or chat with us, but they have never assisted us in healing jobs.\"5 However, Yoruba healers, in the last half century, have been open to use the technology of western medicine. Chief Olojede discusses how in order to diagnos e a pregnancy he \"usually directs the pregnant woman to the scan [x-ray or ultrasound] .\"6 In the modern era Yoruba healers persist in innova ting. Finally, it is important to reiterate that Yoruba healers have actualized their own hospitals in the last decades. Many dimensions of Yoruba healing still remain consistent. The system continues to address clients' health holistically, for issues that are phys ical and spiritual. 2 Personal interview of Chief Fatai Olojede, April, 2008. 3 Personal interview of Mulili Atu Oyebisi (Iyaloja), April, 2008. 4 Personal interview of Chief Aragberin Edun Adebiyi Omoyebi, April, 2008. 5 Personal interview of Mulili Atu Oyebisi (Iyaloja), April, 2008. 6 Personal interview of Chief Fatai Olojede, April, 2008. 242 Mrs. Oyebisi, a Muslim, recalls a job that is of the type that Yoruba healers have historically addressed: \"Yes we heal people with spiritual issues...There was a man whose manhood stopped functioning after he slept with another man's wife, he was brought to me and after I diagnosed him, I placed him on traditional medicines and the second day he became healed. He and his wife always come to visit me.\" Yoruba healers continue to combat spiritually malevolent activities in addition to maintaining religious flexibility. Chief Odua demonstrates that Yoruba religious-healers still integrate their indigenous religious skills into resolving health matters. There was a case of a woman whom whenever she gave birth to any child, the child would die. This woman was brought [to me]. I searched the cause of this misfortune and I realized it was the husband's mother who was actually the cause of her misfortune. I do my searching through a handfan (patewo). So after we discovered it was her mother-in-law, we pleaded with the elders and they released [her], so that was the end of her misfortune about child death (abiku).\"7 The Yoruba healing system continues to be resilient by integrating innova tion and adaptation with tradition and replication. While this study focused on part of the colonial period (1922-1955) , it is useful for unde rstanding the status of Yoruba healing in the 21rst century. Hopefully, this dissertation will contribute to the strengthening of modern Yoruba healthcare systems, and arouse further investigations of healing histories. Histories of healing must continue to document insights from the wisdom of Africa. 7 Personal interview of Chief Erelu (Onisegun Awo) Odua, April, 2008. 243 Bibliography Archival Sources Nigerian National Archives at Ibadan, Records of the Chief Secretary's Office CSO 26 29979 \"Intelligence Districts\" CSO 26 Indigenous Institutions\" CSO 26 J/1 Z/1c \"Customs & Superstitions of Tribes and Colony & Southern Provinces of Nigeria- Compilation of book on by Mr. Hargrove\" 1921-2 CSO 26/3 29956 \"Intelligence Division Ondo Province\" by Officer, 1936 CSO, 31494 \"Native Courts: Power to Try Cases of Witchcraft and Juju\" Nigerian National Archives at Ibadan, Records of the Southern Nigeria Provincial Offices Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 1, 657 \"Native Herbalist Corresponde nce\" 1934- 1953. 244 Abeokuta Provincial Office, District 2, 595 \"Notes on Witchcraft'\" compiled by Mr. K.
